the feature race at mehamas summer fest 
wasnt exactly a display of blazing speed but they didnt call it 
the slug and scotch broom festival for nothing 
humor helped make up for the lack of action in the race 
saturday in which the first of the critters to ooze its way out of 
a ring was declared winner 
he was going pretty fast wasnt he said daniel urquhart 
8 of aumsville whose slug crept to the championship 
rick urquhart father of the winning slug trainer said he found 
the racer at a state park 
we definitely searched high and low for this one we didnt 
take any backyard varieties he said well probably retire 
this one for the year maybe well catch the same one next year 
the festival the towns first in 30 years was the brainchild 
of businessmen mike boyles and bill mercer who came up with the 
idea over a drink at mercers fish hatchery tavern 
i was talking about how i was glad scotch broom season was 
over and he said something about how slugs oughta be banned and 
it just came together said boyles scotch broom is a bushlike 
weed with small yellow flowers that grows along roadways 
i guess we were kind of bored boyles said

a popular israeli singer of egyptian descent 
asked to entertain at an army generals goingaway party caused a 
minor scandal by singing a song about the 19monthold palestinian 
uprising 
the 20yearold singer haya samir appeared on nationwide 
television monday to defend herself after newspaper reports said 
her performance the previous night was met with boos and shouts 
from an audience that included defense minister yitzhak rabin 
the song she sang included such lines as those oppressed on 
the road prisoners of killing hungry for justice 
chewing their hatred mother earth is bleeding wounded by the 
war cursed by force and hatred 
samir who served in the army as a member of an entertainment 
troupe was invited because she was a favorite of maj gen yitzhak 
mordechai who was being honored with a party as he was transferred 
from head of the armys southern command to head of central command 
in the job he is leaving mordechai was responsible for putting 
down the uprising in the occupied gaza strip his new 
responsibility will be the west bank also torn by the revolt 
against israeli occupation 
the masscirculation daily maariv quoted one top officer as 
remarking after the show i am shocked yitzhak mordecai loved 
her singing and we wanted to give him a nice time she used us 
according to the paper samir said after the party i did not 
intend to sing a political song this is a song about life 
speaking on israel television monday she said the idea to sing 
the controversial song which she wrote herself came to her as she 
mounted the stage 
samir was born to egyptian moslem parents who immigrated to 
israel israeli newspapers said she was the only arab woman to ever 
serve in the army though some arab men regularly serve in the 
israeli military

after decades of hostility the vatican is 
seizing on what it calls a new spirit of cooperation by moscow to 
strengthen the roman catholic church in the soviet bloc 
over the past six months the vatican has succeeded in naming 
new bishops in lithuania and czechoslovakia forging diplomatic 
ties with poland after a 40year lapse and nailing down a visit by 
pope john paul ii to hungary 
and last week the vatican named its first bishop in the soviet 
republic of byelorussia since the aftermath of the russian 
revolution 
all the steps taken together are very important said a 
senior vatican diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity it 
is an encouraging picture 
vatican officials and independent analysts say progress is due 
to the combination of openings provided by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and a pragmatic policy pursued by the pope who as a 
bishop in poland had pursued a moderate but firm strategy for 
religious freedom 
the vatican is aware of the new opportunities and is putting 
out feelers in as many directions as it possibly can said dr 
john eibner head of eastern european research at keston college 
the british institute that monitors religious freedom around the 
world 
not everything is rosy despite the appointments last week of 
four bishops in czechoslovakia seven dioceses still lack bishops 
in romania there are no eastern rite catholic bishops 
in the soviet union a major obstacle to improved relations 
remains the ukrainian catholic church which was forcibly merged 
with the russian orthodox church under josef stalin in 1946 
there is a strong underground ukrainian church and ukrainian 
faithful have stepped up demands for recognition of their church 
but vatican officials dont expect any immediate solution 
still progress is unmistakable and has extended to soviet 
allies cuba which has agreed to a visit by the pope expected in 
two years and vietnam where a cardinal recently made the first 
official visit by a vatican representative since the communist 
takeover 
the appointment of a bishop to byelorussia is viewed as 
particularly significant since it is uncontested soviet territory 
the vatican does not recognize the absorption of lithuania by the 
soviet union in 1940 and a lithuanian exile mission is accredited 
to the holy see 
in the case of lithuania in march and in byelorussia last week 
the vatican informed the kremlin of the decision to appoint a 
bishop 
these authorities in the new spirit established by the 
soviet government politely let the holy father know they had no 
difficulty in this regard the vatican said 
experts are divided over whether moscow is sending out any 
direct signals to its allies or whether it is a situation of the 
winds of change blowing across borders and the church being seen as 
a potential partner in helping to rebuild shattered economies 
analysts do agree that the potential of a church without leaders 
was becoming increasingly embarrassing for the prague government 
which has been widely criticized for religious repression 
the vatican has made public note of the changed attitude of the 
soviet leadership toward religion and has been encouraging contacts 
pravda the soviet party newspaper said earlier this year that 
a bridge is being built from both sides the commentary was in 
marked contrast to accusations by soviet news media in the early 
80s that the pope and the church were interfering in polish affairs 
there is speculation that hungary may be the next warsaw pact 
country after poland to establish diplomatic ties with the holy 
see john paul recently told a group of hungarian pilgrims to 
prepare spiritually for my apostolic visit to hungary within two 
years 
how much progress is down the road could be answered when 
gorbachev visits italy in november and is expected to see the pope 
the meeting would be of historic proportions the first between 
the head of a soviet party that disparages religion and the leader 
of a church with 850 million followers 
it was stalin who cynically assessed the roman popes influence 
asking how many divisions does the pope have

president bush condemning the reported 
hanging of lt col william higgins by proiranian kidnappers 
monday night called on all parties holding hostages in the 
middle east to release them to begin to reverse the cycle of 
violence 
in a statement telephoned to news organizations bush pointedly 
renewed his criticism of israel whose kidnapping on friday of a 
moslem shiite cleric led higgins kidnappers to release a tape 
which they said showed his execution by hanging 
on friday i said that the taking of any hostage was not 
helpful to the middle east peace process the brutal and tragic 
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement 
bush said 
tonight i wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent call 
to all all parties who hold hostages in the middle east to 
release them forthwith as an humanitarian gesture to begin to 
reverse the cycle of violence in that region 
in his conference call to news agencies presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said it was impossible to tell what the 
reaction to the presidents statement would be 
asked if the us government had contacted israeli in an attempt 
to persuade it to release its hostage fitzwater replied that we 
have had contacts with israel but not in the past day he did 
not elaborate on the nature of the contacts 
we face a very difficult situation fitzwater said we 
have threats of two other possible deaths we have hostages being 
held by a number of countries or factions or groups 
the president feels his plea with real attention focused on 
the situation could give everyone a chance to release their 
hostages 
fitzwater referred to threats made during the day by groups in 
the middle east against two hostages joseph james cicippio an 
official of the american university of beirut and anglican church 
envoy terry waite 
earlier referring to this brutal murder of the marine 
officer bush said it is a most troubling and disturbing matter 
that has shocked the american people right to the core there is no 
way that i can properly express the outrage that i feel 
while bush cautioned publicly that he had no confirmation 
higgins had in fact been hanged senate republican leader bob dole 
rkan said the president told congressional leaders monday night 
that its about a 98 percent probability that it happened 
in the first reaction to bushs call ehud olmert minister 
without portfolio in the israeli government said on the abc 
nightline program he did not believe the president wanted 
israel to give up its hostage without a good chance of 
obtaining the release of others thereby 
i just dont believe that the president wanted to just draw a 
comparison between israel and these organizations to say you 
did something wrong and you did something wrong and just 
release all the hostages 
i think the logic of what the president said is that hezbollah 
should release all the hostages the american and israeli hostages 
and in that case it is also wise to release sheik abdul karim 
obeid the hezbollah leader kidnapped by israeli commandos 
olmert said 
he defended the decision to kidnap obeid on the grounds that 
we have tried all other ways there came a time when we had to 
decide whether we do something or just sit still against 
terrorism 
bush monitored reports through the afternoon after returning 
from chicago then met into the evening in the cabinet room with 
top advisers including defense secretary dick cheney deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and other cabinet members 
before briefing the congressional leaders 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
said after that meeting that bush was considering several options 
but he declined to identify them 
i dont think anything has been ruled out at this point 
boren said 
during his earlier meeting with advisers bush received a 
briefing on the status of our knowledge of the situation this was 
primarily an informational meeting at which all aspects of the case 
involving col higgins and the other hostages were discussed 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
higgins reported killing triggered an instant debate in 
congress over israels role in the events israeli commandos 
kidnapped a shiite moslem cleric last week and the announcement of 
higgins hanging said he was killed in retaliation 
perhaps a little more responsibility on behalf of the israelis 
would be refreshing dole said but rep charles schumer dny 
countered that blaming israel would be turning the world on its 
head 
at the white house officials carefully avoided direct criticism 
of israel but fitzwater said it is fair to say that many people 
do share the senators concerns he would not elaborate 
an israeli official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said its ridiculous to say that israel is 
responsible for higgins death we dont even know if its him and 
if it is when he was killed 
a member of congress who attended the leadership meeting with 
bush speaking on condition of no further identification said the 
lawmakers were told repeatedly the united states was given no 
notice of israelis intent to kidnap the cleric and there was no 
consultation between israel and the united states 
after meeting with bush senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said the president strongly reaffirmed his belief in the 
appropriate policy of not negotiating with terorrists in any 
circumstances 
he like others at the meeting declined to discuss which 
possible responses including military options might be under 
consideration 
rep william dickinson rala ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said after the white house meeting the 
president made it very clear until the facts are known at least 
more facts than we have now theres no way you can make a 
definitive decision on what to do 
there are nine americans in captivity in the middle east 
including terry anderson middle east correspondent for the 
associated press 
somehow there has got to be a return to decency and honor 
even in matters of this nature bush said on the white house lawn 
after returning from chicago where he had addressed the national 
governors association 
he also said he had spoken by telephone with higgins wife a 
wonderfully stoic individual who is going through sheer hell 
bush cancelled appearances in las vegas and oklahoma city 
he learned of reports of the execution as he landed in chicago 
higgins 44 was serving as part of an international 
peacekeeping force in lebanon when he was taken captive in february 
1988 proiranian shiite moslem captors said they hanged him monday 
in retaliation for israels kidnapping of a moslem cleric the 
group released a videotape purporting to show the execution 
israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric sheik 
abdul karim obeid and other shiite moslem captives for all 
captured israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by shiite 
groups in lebanon 
secretary of state james a baker leaving paris for washington 
after a weekend of meetings focusing on ussoviet relations and 
the future of cambodia called the execution report outrageous 
and uncivilized 
dole said in washington i would hope the israelis would take 
another look at some of their actions that they must know in 
advance would endanger american lives 
but rep schumer said israel is among the few countries 
seeking to fight terrorism the blame has to fall on the terrorists 
themselves 
rep gary ackerman dny was circulating a letter asking 
colleagues to support a resolution calling for the extradition of 
sheik obeid to stand trial in the united states for the kidnapping 
of higgins

sylvester stallone says he isnt trying to avoid 
romantic commitments because of his failed marriage to brigitte 
nielsen he just hasnt found the right girl 
i need something like sister mary theresa and madam curie and 
uh irma la douce a little bit of everything the actor said 
in an interview to be broadcast on abcs good morning america 
this week 
stallone says he appreciates the fair sex because women 
have a vast understanding of the way i think 
they are by chemical composition more emotional so they 
tend to be a little bit more compassionate very workoriented 
he said i think women strive very hard to show that they 
certainly can carry on any endeavor that a man can so i only 
benefit by being surrounded by these kinds of people 
stallone says he has pretty much recovered from his divorce from 
nielsen and isnt attempting to avoid any new commitment if that 
comes along i mean cause what really what else is there

chantal became the first hurricane of the atlantic 
season monday as it bore down on texas and louisiana thwarting 
efforts to rescue the crew of a capsized oil rig and forcing 
evacuation of a coastal island 
the storm had strengthened rapidly after growing early monday 
from a tropical depression to a tropical storm it had a maximum 
sustained wind speed of 65 mph in early afternoon and increased to 
75 mph 1 mph over the threshold for reclassifying a tropical storm 
a hurricane by 6 pm edt 
hurricane warnings were posted from freeport texas to morgan 
city la 
its not going to be a major hurricane but there will be 
beach erosion tides 10 feet above normal in some places and 10 to 
15 inches of rain over mississippi louisiana and eastern texas 
said todd kimberlain of the national hurricane center 
the same area was deluged in late june by tropical storm allison 
according to the hurricane center the hurricanes centers 
likeliest landfall would be at 7 pm cdt tuesday in the area of 
port arther and galveston texas 
forecasters said there was a 53 percent chance of the storm 
centering on port arthur and a 52 percent chance of centering on 
galveston 
the hurricane center emphasizes that its calculations are only 
probablities based on previous storm tracks extrapolated from 
hurricane chantals current path 
squalls on the edge of the storm dumped heavy rain on new 
orleans and forced closure of the 24mile long causeway across lake 
pontchartrain 
about 2500 people on grand isle a tiny resort area just off 
the southeast louisiana coast were asked to go to the mainland 
mayor andy valence said he feared louisiana highway 1 the only 
route off the island would flood 
in southwest louisianas cameron parish county civil defense

residents had evacuated the southern coast most to stay with 
friends or relatives 
two emergency shelters opened in nearby lake charles with 67 
cameron residents staying in one shelter 
these people are from cameron theyve been through this more 
than once they brought all the necessities some brought tvs some 
brought radios said nancy cowan red cross disaster chairman for 
calcasieu and cameron parishes 
lutie dyson 62 said she and her husband clarence 73 a 
retired commercial fisherman have frequently evacuated their homes 
since june 1967 when hurricane audrey slammed ashore and killed 
526 people injured nearly 4000 destroyed or damaged more than 
2500 homes and left millions of dollars in damage 
i cant tell you exactly maybe 10 or 12 times since audrey 
said mrs dyson a mother of 15 who lost her home to audrey if 
they tell us to get out we get out 
told landfall was expected near port arthur mrs dyson replied 
they told us that for audrey too and we got audrey i pray it 
doesnt hit anybody but we have to take what god sends we always 
put the lord on our side 
heavy weather on the storms fringe halted the search for 10 men 
lost when an oil rig capsized while being moved south of morgan 
city the coast guard flew divers to the rig despite 12foot seas 
and 60mph winds 
one man died after falling from a chevron platform south of new 
orleans 
at midnight edt the hurricanes center was near latitude 281 
north and longitude 931 west or about 130 miles southeast of 
galveston it was moving northnorthwest at 10 mph and forecasters 
expected it to continue to gain strength and follow that 
northwesterly path into midday tuesday 
this should bring the center over the upper texas or western 
louisiana coast tomorrow afternoon or evening said bob sheets 
the hurricane centers director 
sheets said tropical storm force wind extended outward 150 miles 
to the north and 125 miles to the south of the center a few 
tornadoes were also likely over sections of louisiana and extreme 
eastern texas during the night and tuesday he said 
texans also began girding for the hurricane while oil companies 
removed hundreds of workers from rigs and platforms in the gulf 
weve evacuated everybody said conoco inc spokesman 
michael oconnor our production is automated weve set them on 
timers 
were planning for the worst and hoping for the best said 
doug matthews city manager of galveston an island city of 60000 
just south of houston 
the old bugaboo is where this baby is going to hit said 
john jamison a national weather service meteorologist in galveston 
chantal the third named storm of the 1989 atlantic hurricane 
season formed earlier monday from the seasons fourth tropical 
depression in the southcentral gulf 
meanwhile in the open atlantic tropical depression no 5 had 
become tropical storm dean by 11 pm edt it had top sustained 
winds of 40 mph and was centered near latitude 155 north and 
longitude 478 west or about 850 miles east of the lesser antilles 
it was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to gain 
strength but hold its course forecasters said 
two other depressions have formed into named storms since the 
1989 atlantic hurricane season began june 1

president bushs proposed cut in the 
capitalgains tax wont increase government revenue any more than 
did president reagans big tax reduction in 1981 says a coalition 
of liberal organizations 
its just like 1981 republicans and conservative democrats 
proposing to cut taxes to balance the budget said robert 
mcintyre executive director of the laborfinanced citizens for tax 
justice 
rather than boost revenue mcintyre told a news conference 
monday the proposed reduction in capitalgains taxes would cost 
the government more over the next decade than would the bailout of 
the savings and loan industry or the purchase of the b2 stealth 
bomber 
mcintyre was joined at a news conference by joan claybrook 
president of ralph naders public citizen organization and robert 
greenstein executive director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities 
bush contends that cutting the capitalgains tax would produce 
greater revenue by spurring investment even though his treasury 
department forecasts a 20 billion revenue loss in 1994 through 
1996 the experts who advise congress say that after a oneyear 
gain of 4 billion a cut would result in permanent revenue losses 
reaching as high as 114 billion in 1996 
meantime two economists writing for the institute for research 
on the economics of taxation concluded that a capitalgains 
reduction would be good even if it did not boost revenues 
a capitalgains tax cut is likely to help people in all income 
classes by spurring economic growth wrote michael schuyler and 
roy e cordato it would ease the income tax bias against saving 
and toward immediate consumption 
those are the same arguments bush made in asking congress to tax 
capital gains at a lower rate than applies to wages democrats are 
fighting the plan on grounds 80 percent of the benefit would go to 
those with incomes over 100000 a year 
nevertheless 13 ways and means republicans and six democrats 
a majority for the panel are supporting a substitute plan by rep 
ed jenkins dga that would cut the 33 percent maximum capital 
gains rate to 196 percent for two years it then would be raised 
to 28 percent and investors would be protected against taxation on 
gains caused solely by inflation 
house democratic leaders attempting to block passage of the 
jenkins plan are negotiating with bush aides on the idea of 
writing the inflation protection into law without cutting the 
capitalgains rate 
mcintyre said such a change known as indexing still would 
amount to a tax reduction for holders of capital gains and could 
easily be manipulated with indexing he said you just cash in 
the assets that indexing helps and hold on to those that arent 
helped 
greenstein called any capitalgains reduction an enormous 
windfall for the wealthy 
ms claybrook said bushs claim that lower capitalgains 
taxes would stimulate new savings and venture capital is 
nonsense 
after cuts in 1978 and 1981 she said savings plummeted to 
historic lows besides ms claybrook said virtually all venture 
capital funds today come from taxexempt pension funds and other 
institutional investors for whom the lower capitalgains tax 
provisions provide no benefit 
she said also that if capital gains are taxed at a lower rate 
than wages our tax code would once again be haunted by all 
manner of unproductive tax shelters that are not profitable without 
the tax benefits equipment leasing billboards oyster beds and 
llama breeding created to convert ordinary income into capital 
gains

the agriculture departments monthly index 
shows prices farmers received for raw products dropped 07 percent 
in july from a month earlier but were up 28 percent from a year 
ago 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report monday that declining prices for oranges 
broilers soybeans and corn were partially offset by higher prices 
for potatoes cotton tomatoes and hogs 
the july index of prices paid for commodities and services 
interest taxes and farm wage rates was 178 percent of its 1977 
average the index was 06 percent above april and 35 percent 
above july 1988 
higher prices during july for feeder cattle and calves 
gasoline and building materials were partially offset by lower feed 
prices the report said 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products as a group declined 06 percent from june to 
july but still averaged 61 percent above last years figure 
overall crop prices declined 29 percent from last month and 22 
percent from july 1988 
the allfruit index was down 20 percent from last month and 19 
percent from a year ago

the us department of agriculture says its 
working on a way to find out how much soil is blowing in the wind 
by the mid1990s the departments scientists plan to have a 
wind erosion computer system to help make daily estimates of soil 
losses from wind erosion says lawrence j hagen an agricultural 
engineer with the usdas agricultural research service 
the system should also be helpful for managing rangelands and 
croplands in humid as well as dry areas he said 
in the future according to hagen the wind erosion system could 
be linked to other computers to help compute the effects of dust on 
the acid rain process calculate economic costs of erosion and 
assess management strategies for public lands 
the usda says semiarid to humid croplands outside the great 
plains often threatened by wind erosion include much of the 
southeastern seaboard sandy and organic soil areas of michigan 
wisconsin and minnesota lakebed soils of ohio michigan minnesota 
and north dakota the palouse region of the pacific northwest and 
several irrigated valleys of california

rotating grain crops such as corn with 
alfalfa is a key strategy for sustaining agriculture in the long 
run according to a new study by the us department of agriculture 
and cornell university scientists 
crop rotation may be the answer to sustaining longterm 
productivity of our land to provide billions of people with food 
fuel and other renewable resources says gary h heichel a plant 
physiologist with the usdas agricultural research service 
he says the study analyzes energy uses of various farming 
systems including continuous corn crops and various rotations of 
grain and legume crops continuous corn can be highly productive 
with the use of nitrogen fertilizer he says adding but is of 
dubious sustainability because of high fossil fuel use and soil 
erosion 
on the other hand heichel said legumes are among the 
most efficient crops grown in the united states partly because 
little fuel is required to grow them also more energy is embodied 
in farming equipment needed to grow other crops such as corn 
more than 3 million calories of fossil fuel energy normally are 
required to produce nitrogen fertilizer for an acre of corn grown 
under a continuous cropping program said david pimentel an 
ecologist and entomologist at cornell university but a crop 
rotation that alternates one crop of soybeans which normally 
requires no nitrogen fertilizer with two crops of corn could 
reduce fossil energy use by 26 percent

congress may provide taxpayer money to remodel 
vice president dan quayles official residence to accommodate his 
family despite earlier plans to fund the work with private 
donations 
about 200000 in private money raised to pay for the 
renovations may be used instead for decorating said denise 
balzano chief of staff to quayles wife marilyn 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the senate 
appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee said monday he 
will ask the bush administration to justify the use of public money 
when his panel works on spending legislation this week 
assuming they can justify it and thats a reasonable 
assumption the federal government should pay for it deconcini 
said 
the house voted friday to provide 200000 for the renovation as 
part of 184 billion approved for treasury and postal programs for 
fiscal 1990 the planned remodeling of the third floor of the 
victorian mansion would create separate bedrooms for the quayles 
three children and other rooms as well 
the quayles children tucker 15 benjamin 12 and corinne 
10 live on the top floor of the threestory building which is on 
the rolling grounds of the naval observatory in northwest 
washington and was built in 1894 the structure on the exclusive 
embassy row section of massachusetts avenue has been the 
official residence of the vice president since 1975 
last november shortly after president bush and quayle were 
elected the quayles said the mansion would need work to make it 
meet the familys needs they moved into the mansion in february 
balzano said a group of mrs quayles friends offered to raise 
the money for the renovation and about 200000 in donations were 
collected the quayles also informed congress of the work she said 
we felt it was important they be kept informed of what we were 
doing since it is a government building balzano said the idea 
for providing public money for the work came from the house 
appropriations committee she said 
rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the house 
appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee which authored the 
housepassed spending bill said mrs quayle invited them to visit 
the mansion and examine the needed work 
we didnt plan to put it into this budget roybal said in an 
interview she called our attention to it 
the lawmakers decided to provide money after receiving a report 
from subcommittee staff saying the renovation was needed said 
roybal 
none of the work has been done balzano said plans call for the 
construction of four bedrooms a family room an office for mrs 
quayle three bathrooms and a room for a washer and dryer 
the first floor of the mansion is used largely for entertaining 
while the second floor has a master bedroom and a guest room

a group of explorers returned from a journey to 
the polar icecap with two bits of metal from the wing of a world 
war ii bomber treasures retrieved from under 250 feet of ice 
pat epps and other members of the greenland expedition society 
suffered hunger cold and sunburn in the hunt for the lost 
squadron eight aircraft which crash landed in greenland in 1942 
this is the first time someone brought back tangible evidence 
of these aircraft said epps owner of epps aviation at suburban 
dekalb peachtree airport where the expedition returned in a dc3 
monday 
the group left georgia on july 7 seeking proof to back up sonar 
scans made in 1988 that showed the aircraft buried under four 
decades of ice and snow 
the planes are a pair of b17 bombers epps said were worth 
400000 to 800000 apiece if made airworthy and six p38 
lightnings twin engine fighters epps said were worth 600000 to 
12 million each 
they were flying to england in 1942 when they were forced down 
by bad weather the crews later were rescued 
epps recovery team spent 17 days on the icecap storms grounded 
their plane for days and trapped the men in their tents 
we were there six days unsupported said society coleader 
richard taylor an atlanta architect we ran low on fuel we ate 
just one meal a day we had very little food wed run the 
generator just enough to send radio messages they were very 
brief 
wed play hearts for hours at a time said atlanta 
businessman neil estes 
the explorers used two steam drills to bore 250 feet through the 
glacier to a b17 nicknamed big stoop then they lined the 
threeinch hole with plastic pipe and lowered a handheld coring 
drill to cut pieces of the planes metal skin and what appeared to 
be a piece of an oil tank in the wing behind an engine 
its still got oil or hydraulic fluid on it taylor said 
taylor said there was no evidence of the kind of shifting of 
different layers of ice in the glacier that could have destroyed 
the planes 
epps credited norman vaughan 83 of trapper creek alaska the 
last man to see the planes with keeping the expeditions hopes 
alive 
vaughan a dog musher and army air force officer was sent by 
dogsled in 1942 to make sure topsecret bombsights on the bombers 
were destroyed or brought back 
vaughan told epps about the planes eight years ago and was part 
of epps recovery team handling an assortment of duties including 
camp cook 
the threeweek expedition cost about 150000 and epps said the 
greenland expedition society would have to raise somewhere between 
15 million and 4 million for an expedition to last all next 
summer to recover the planes 
he hopes to sink a shaft to the planes that is large enough to 
remove the planes in pieces 
epps wants to fly at least one of the planes off the ice

us diplomat felix s bloch suspected of 
spying for the soviets sipped grapefruit juice and calmly watched 
for 45 minutes as a foreign correspondent showed him videotapes and 
clippings of how his story is being told in his native austria 
i tried and tried but he said he wouldnt answer questions on 
the substance of his case said robert weisner the washington 
correspondent for staterun austrian television he said bloch 
looked rather surprisingly relaxed monday as he sipped juice 
and watched videotapes of the bloch story prepared for austrian 
television 
bloch also read austrian newspaper accounts of the case which 
weisner showed him during blochs 45minute visit to the offices of 
austrian television monday afternoon in the georgetown section of 
the capital 
meanwhile the justice department in its first public statement 
on the case expressed concern that its investigation may have been 
hurt by premature disclosure and acknowledged objecting to the 
state departments confirmation of the investigation on july 21 
on his first day back in the nations capital after more than a 
week in the new york city area bloch emerged alone from the back 
door of his apartment in the fashionable kalorama section and 
strolled to georgetown 
he wore a blazer with a furled umbrella hung over his left 
wrist 
bloch was followed by about 15 people including reporters and 
photographers two cars with television cameramen being driven so 
slowly that traffic was stopped and a car containing two 
grimfaced men presumably agents for the fbi 
to reporters who queried him along the way bloch said im 
hardly a free man you know id love to put it behind me 
the 54yearold diplomat was placed on paid leave by the state 
department on june 22 his diplomatic passport has been revoked 
but he has not been charged with any crime he is followed any time 
he goes out by fbi agents and reporters 
at the austrian television office bloch asked weisner how the 
austrian media were covering his case wanting to know how he was 
being perceived by the public in his native country weisner said 
bloch was the no 2 official in the us embassy in vienna until 
two years ago 
weisner said he managed to reach bloch by telephone monday and 
asked him if he wanted to come and talk and see what austrian 
television reported on his case 
bloch replied that he was coming to georgetown on other business 
and would be willing to stop in from there he went to his 
lawyers office 
bloch returned to washington after spending more than a week 
with his father in manhattan and his daughter in suburban 
chappaqua ny 
at the justice department runkel said news reports that began 
with an abc news segment july 21 may have hurt the fbis ability to 
collect evidence against bloch 
you could say we have a concern that the premature disclosure 
of the matter may have had an adverse effect on the gathering of 
information runkel said 
runkel also said there were some concerns expressed by the 
justice department before the state department issued a 
statement july 21 confirming it was cooperating with an fbi 
investigation of illegal activities by bloch involving a 
foreign intelligence service 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said 
the fbi has a videotape of bloch passing a briefcase to a kgb agent 
in paris earlier this year but that the government does not have 
enough evidence to charge him with espionage 
to bring an espionage case the justice department must have 
evidence that specific classified information was passed to a 
foreign power and that the materials release damaged national 
security 
the bureau believes bloch was recruited 14 years ago by the 
soviets when he was stationed at the us embassy in east berlin 
according to a congressional source

president bush is breeding cynicism in the war 
on drugs by calling for laws that already are on the books and 
failing to seek full funding of drug legislation says the chairman 
of the senate judiciary committee 
the war of words what has it wrought asked sen joseph r 
biden jr ddel what it has wrought so far is cynicism 
political opportunism and some despair 
bush is able to stand up at his inauguration and say this 
scourge will end and then have no one call him when he refuses 
to use the tools already available to him to fight the war on 
drugs biden said monday in a speech at the national press club 
bush sought to cut 10 million in funds for the law enforcement 
training institute at glynco ga even as he traveled there to 
praise the institute and call for new anticrime legislation biden 
said 
among the laws sought by bush that congress already has passed 
biden contended are longer sentences for drug dealers the death 
penalty for some drug dealers minimum prison terms for weapons 
offenders and preventive detention for people arrested with drugs 
congress passed such laws in 1984 1986 and 1988 all by 
bipartisan support and neither party in congress at the time tried 
to take political advantage for them having been passed biden 
said 
alixe glen a white house spokeswoman said the crime package 
that the president sent to the hill is a decisive effective and 
achievable package and it is a very comprehensive program to 
combat crime 
bushs plan doubles the mandatory penalty for the use of a 
semiautomatic weapon completely reforms pleabargaining 
practices she said the death penalty may be a law on the 
books but the procedures necessary to implement the death penalty 
would be activated by bushs plan 
in addition she said the package adds nearly 1000 federal 
agents to law enforcement agencies 
biden said the 1988 antidrug legislation called for the 
addition of almost 3000 agents to federal law enforcement agencies 
and for treatment beds for nearly 250000 addicts 
but in 1989 mr president you failed to put in your 
budget the money need to make these tough laws work biden said 
you didnt even ask for them to be funded after you praised them 
in the election campaign 
biden said 18 billion must be found in the current fiscal year 
to fully fund the 1988 antidrug bill even if it means raising 
taxes to pay for it by contrast he noted the bailout plan for 
the savings and loan industry will cost several billion dollars 
and each b2 bomber sought by the administration costs 530 million 
larry cirignano a spokesman for william j bennett director of 
the office of national drug control policy said after the speech 
that he had no comment on the remarks

here is the text of president bushs statement 
calling for the release of hostages in the middle east 
our grave concern over the taking and holding of american 
citizens as hostages has been made clear on numerous occasions in 
the past 
on friday i said that the taking of any hostage was not helpful 
to the middle east peace process the brutal and tragic events of 
today have underscored the validity of that statement 
that position and our firm opposition to negotiating with 
hostage takers was further reinforced in my discussions this 
evening within the administration and in consultations with the 
congressional leadership 
tonight i wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent call 
to all all parties who hold hostages in the middle east to 
release them forthwith as a humanitarian gesture to begin to 
reverse the cycle of violence in that region

gains made by secretary of state james a 
baker iii in weekend talks with his soviet and chinese counterparts 
are being overshadowed by the reported execution of an american 
hostage in lebanon 
baker returned from paris on monday night indicating he was 
pleased that us relations with the soviet union had edged up a 
few notches and that highlevel contacts with china had been 
reestablished 
but he was at a loss about how to cope with a resurgence of 
terrorism that apparently led to the death of marine lt col 
william r higgins and threatens other american hostages in 
lebanon 
apart from denouncing higgins kidnappers as outrageous and 
uncivilized baker gave no hint that the bush administration had 
yet found an effective strategy for coping with its first major 
foreign policy challenge 
before leaving paris baker asked soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze to do what he can for the american hostages when he 
visits tehran 
using the paris peace conference on cambodia as a backdrop 
baker began plotting with shevardnadze the first summit meeting 
between bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
a soviet observer called the meeting a shirtsleeve session 
at the soviet embassy that ran three hours and 10 minutes 
officials on both sides said baker and shevardnadze disagreed 
sharply over afghanistan but otherwise found rapport the soviets 
are irked about continuing us weapons shipments to rebels trying 
to dislodge a promoscow government in kabul 
baker invited shevardnadze to wyoming for a sept 1920 meeting 
on the planned summit 
baker seized the opportunity at the paris conference to 
reestablish highlevel contacts with china after a lapse of nearly 
two months following the violent repression of the studentled 
prodemocracy movement in beijings tiananmen square on june 34 
baker met for 90 minutes with foreign minister qian qichen with 
only interpreters present 
baker told qian that repression on the part of the peoples 
republic of china would not be understood by the american people 
a senior us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
after the meeting 
it was our view that if china does want to continue its 
reform as it says it does it ought not to turn inward and isolate 
itself through conduct that would not be understood by many in the 
international community the official said 
following the tiananmen square shootings of chinese protesters 
bush barred exchanges of senior us and chinese officials as well 
as highlevel visits to china however bakers meeting with qian 
was considered outside the bounds of the sanctions 
his aim was to assure qian that the administration wants to 
preserve strong ties with beijing but we are going to need 
help the official said 
the two governments found a common interest on cambodia both 
want to see vietnamese troops leave by the end of september and a 
un observer force supervising a ceasefire in the war between 
guerrillas and the hanoiinstalled government 
the chinese want a role for the khmer rouge the cambodian 
faction backed by beijing that is accused of murdering more than 1 
million cambodians between 1975 and 1978 baker wants the khmer 
rouge shut out

the yellow ribbons around the trees that 
shade william richard higgins first school are tattered and fading 
after 17 months much like local hopes that he would survive his 
captivity in lebanon 
two blocks north of lancaster elementary school the red brick 
house that was his first home stands vacant and decaying a 
poignant reminder of reports that higgins captors had hanged the 
marine lieutenant colonel 
its a sad day sad for everybody in the country and a sad 
day for lancaster said doris spurlin who like other merchants 
here had decked the door of her dress shop with a yellow ribbon 
everybody had been so hopeful that he would get out she 
said monday 
higgins 44 was seized while assigned to a united nations 
peacekeeping force proiranian shiite moslems claimed monday to 
have executed him in retaliation for israels kidnapping of a 
moslem cleric the group released a videotape purporting to show 
the execution 
higgins wife robin said in a statement released in washington 
by her attorney gregory craig that she did not know if the 
reports were true 
one thing i have learned over the past 17 months is that the 
truth is hard to find and it remains so said mrs higgins 37 
who is a major inthe marine corps and works at the pentagon as a 
public information officer 
mrs higgins did not come to work monday but arrived at the 
building at midmorning with higgins 19yearold daughter chrissy 
they remained secluded out of reporters sight 
in her statement mrs higgins urged americans not to draw any 
premature conclusions during this terrible time of uncertainty 
she also appealed to the captors in lebanon to put an end to this 
needless cycle of violence and victimization by releasing my 
husband right now and sending him home 
peggy say the sister of hostage terry anderson urged american 
officials to respond cautiously to higgins reported death 
anderson the longestheld hostage is middle east correspondent 
for the associated press 
what we have witnessed in the israeli retaliation in kind for 
the kidnapping of their people is that violence truly does beget 
violence and that i hope the united states will use this 
opportunity for reconciliation rather than retaliation mrs say 
said in an interview from her home near cadiz in western kentucky 
an eye for an eye only leaves both sides blind 
higgins sister mary fisher said from her home in the 
louisville suburb of okolona that she believed higgins was dead 
before she saw the videotape 
how can i doubt it said mrs fisher adding that she was 
angry because the government has not done what it should have 
done to get him out 
us sen mitch mcconnell who attended church in south 
louisville with higgins in the 1950s recommended he be given the 
nations highest honor the medal of honor 
regardless of higgins fate he deserves it the kentucky 
republican said 
mcconnells democratic counterpart wendell ford called upon 
president bush to take immediate retaliatory action 
just issuing a statement of protest isnt going to cut it 
ford said weve had americans now in captivity for years and 
this heinous act should motivate us to make an extra effort to get 
our remaining hostages released 
bush monday night called on all parties holding hostages in 
the middle east to release them to begin to reverse the cycle of 
violence 
in texas meanwhile two men who were marine academy classmates 
of higgins started a scholarship fund for his daughter short of 
getting on our old gear and going to find the guys that hung him 
we decided to do something for his kids said gs sky page 
who chipped in 250 along with greg mullen 
lancaster a farming town of 3400 claims higgins as a native 
son although he was born a county away in danville which had the 
nearest hospital and grew up mainly in louisville 
higgins lived here only through the first grade but both lines 
of his family the higginses and the eagles were 
wellestablished said marguerite whittaker coowner and managing 
editor of lancasters 100yearold weekly newspaper the central 
record 
although few townspeople knew higgins personally they have 
been concerned mrs whittaker said 
higgins family called him richard perhaps to avoid confusion 
with his father billy higgins an accountant 
billy higgins died in louisville and was brought here for burial 
in the lancaster cemetery beside his wife ethel eagle higgins on 
feb 20 1988 three days after his sons abduction

the bush administration is willing to discuss 
a compromise on financing the presidents savings and loan bailout 
but wont consider any plans offered so far a senior treasury 
official says 
under secretary for finance robert r glauber in an interview 
monday said a compromise would be considered if it doesnt 
undermine the spending discipline imposed by the grammrudman 
balanced budget law 
whether there is something else lurking out there that would 
preserve what is important to the administration which is the 
integrity of the grammrudmanhollings process is the issue 
he said 
were certainly prepared to look at what somebody could come 
up with 
a housesenate conference committee last week agreed to finance 
the multibilliondollar bailout on budget a plan favored by 
democrats the plan would balloon the federal budget deficit but 
waive automatic spending cuts that would be triggered under the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the administration favors an offbudget funding mechanism 
that would avoid automatic spending cuts by keeping sampl spending 
out of the deficit 
president bush argues that his way of evading grammrudman 
although somewhat more expensive than the democratic plan is 
harder to duplicate and would be less likely to encourage a 
congressional spending spree 
the full house and senate are scheduled to vote on the 
conference committee bill this week with house action expected by 
thursday and a senate vote a day later 
the dispute appears to be a stalemate democrats have enough 
votes to block the presidents financing plan in the house and 
probably in the senate republicans say they can muster 41 votes in 
the senate in support of the president enough to block the 
democratic plan under that chambers rules 
sen phil gramm rtexas who is leading the effort to protect 
the deficit law that bears his name said hes given some 
thought to a compromise but doesnt hold out much hope 
if theres a magic solution i havent come up with it he 
said the question is are we going to destroy the budget process 
in the process of passing the sampl bill the answer to that is yes 
or no you cant say youre going to destroy it a little bit 
democrats will be unwilling to consider a compromise until 
senate republicans prove they can block the democratic plan he 
said 
glauber rejected compromise proposals that have been publicly 
offered so far 
if we could find some way to make the precedent less easy 
to copy then weve got the basis for a compromise he said 
one type of compromise advanced earlier by rep chalmers wylie 
rohio and sen alan cranston dcalif is a hybrid with some 
spending on budget and some off which glauber said is little 
better than the democratic plan 
another type of plan first advocated by sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich chairman of the senate banking committee doesnt 
waive grammrudman instead it evades automatic spending cuts by 
loading all of the spending into fiscal year 1989 the deadlines 
that would trigger automatic spending cuts already have passed for 
that year 
however glauber said that would make grammrudman 
meaningless 
on a related topic glauber said the administration may appoint 
an interim director to run the resolution trust corp the new 
agency that will oversee the disposal of failed sampls if a 
permanent director cant be found immediately the administration 
may temporarily appoint someone already serving in the government 
he said

girls at a camp for diabetics once tossed used 
syringes into empty milk containers that went to the dump but fear 
of aids has changed that and the federal government is considering 
how millions of other american diabetics should dispose of their 
needles 
its been a nightmare said shelley yeager director of the 
clara barton camp at oxford in central massachusetts weve 
really had to be very careful 
about 115 campers and counselors give themselves injections 
some as often as four times a day yeager said in addition the 
camp uses about 600 lancets daily to test campers blood sugar 
there are an estimated 11 million diabetics nationwide of whom 
about 25 million give themselves insulin shots each day said 
richard kahn chief scientific and medical officer for the american 
diabetes association in alexandria va 
the environmental protection agency is working on a brochure 
advising diabetics of the best way to dispose of needles said 
robin woods a spokeswoman for the agency in washington dc 
it will suggest that diabetics place sharps the needle end 
of a syringe in a hard plastic or metal container like a coffee 
can before throwing it in the trash woods said 
the association recommends people dispose of the needle and 
syringe in a way that it cant be used again kahn said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has heightened concern about 
medical waste because the disease can be transmitted through 
contaminated hypodermic needles aids which attacks the bodys 
immune system also can be transmitted through sexual contact 
the epa drew up new rules on how hospitals dispose of medical 
waste after many us beaches were fouled last summer 
the massachusetts department of public health has adopted new 
regulations on the disposal of infectious waste that take effect 
next week but like the federal rules they dont apply to 
household waste said the departments al comproni 
the regulations require hospitals doctors funeral parlors and 
other generators of infectious waste to either ship used needles to 
certified waste disposal sites or sterilize them and grind them for 
disposal in a solid waste landfill 
the clara barton camp started changing its disposal methods 
about two years ago as aids became a concern yeager said 
all needles now are thrown in special plastic medical waste 
containers placed around the camp this year the camp built a shed 
on the soccer field just to house the disposable containers 
doctors pick them up periodically and take them back to a hospital 
where they are destroyed yeager said 
the becton dickinson co of franklin lakes nj donates the 
needle containers worth about 2 each the camp uses about 20 
containers a week yeager said 
some companies are considering offering disposal services to 
individual diabetics 
becton dickinson sells needle containers to doctors and 
hospitals but may develop a container for home use said linda 
schmitt an assistant product manager 
there really hasnt been one designed for the consumers 
schmitt said 
medical waste disposal co of randolph is preparing to offer a 
home needle pickup service said debra bornstein a company 
official it plans to charge 20 for doortodoor pickup and 
disposal

hurricane seas forced rescue workers to stop 
their search for 10 crewmen aboard a capsized offshore oil rig as 
swells rose as high as 25 feet 
the selfpropelled rig avco 5 with 14 people aboard was headed 
to shore early monday when it capsized about 20 miles off the 
louisiana coast near morgan city chevron spokesman jonathan lifa 
said 
four of the 14 workers were plucked from the water by fishermen 
and a coast guard helicopter said chief petty officer michael 
robling 
the rig leased by chevron from avis bourg co of folsom was on 
its side in about 25 feet of water a coast guard spokesman said 
officials hoped survivors had found airpockets in the sealed 
compartments on the rig but hurricane chantals 12foot seas 70 
mph winds and heavy rains prevented divers from making a search 
the dive boat and a coast guard cutter stood nearby but the bad 
weather forced helicopters back to shore 
an air bubble trapped in watertight compartments would be the 
only oxygen for any survivors said coast guard lt steve hardy 
but he did not estimate how long any trapped crewmen could survive 
three survivors were taken aboard the fishing vessel spar royale 
for a trip to wine island pass and one person was taken by 
helicopter to grand isle hardy said none of the four was 
seriously injured officials said 
the coast guard said a search for the 10 missing workers would 
be suspended indefinitely because of worsening conditions swells 
25 feet high were reported in the area late monday night 
the missing workers were not immediately identified 
elsewhere a second jackup rig so called because the legs can 
be jacked up to allow the rig to sail was tilting at a 12degree 
angle and five workers were taken from it without injury hardy 
said 
the rig owned by atlantic amp pacific marine inc of houston was 
about 15 miles east of grand isle 
a history of accidents involving jackup rigs also called lift 
boats such as the one that capsized monday prompted the coast 
guard to start an inspection program last january officials said 
companies had until monday to apply for an inspection the owners 
of the capsized rig had applied officials said 
what it boils down to is a record of casualities including 
fatalities that gets your attention the number of lift boats 
involved in accidents is higher than normal said lt allen 
harker a marine inspector at the coast guards 8th district 
headquarters 
hardy said he wasnt aware of many accidents involving jackup 
rigs when they are sailing past problems occurred mainly with 
stationary rigs he said 
the avco 5 a work rig about 72feet long is basica barge with 
legs that extend 100 feet under water the legs are lifted above 
the vessel when it is under way 
through 1987 according to a study by the coaste approximately 
46 accidents involving such craf

with little fanfare the justice department is 
departing from reagan administration civil rights policies to 
actively defend federal programs requiring setaside contracts for 
minority businesses 
they are now id say aggressively defending the 
constitutionality of the dot program said john payton a 
washington civil rights lawyer 
the departments defense of two affirmative action programs for 
highway construction financed with transportation department funds 
signals a shift from the days of president reagans civil rights 
chief william bradford reynolds according to lawyers familiar 
with the cases 
the department is distinguishing the federal programs from a 
richmond va setaside law that was declared unconstitutional in 
january by the supreme court 
the justice department asked a federal appellate court in march 
to uphold tennessees highway setaside program that it only 
halfheartedly defended during the reagan years said payton who 
is involved in the case 
and in july the department continued efforts to defend a 
setaside program for minority highway contractors in north 
carolina 
i think there is a shift said barbara arnwine director of 
the lawyers committee for civil rights under law but 
undamentally they are only doing what they should be doing that 
is defending the federal law 
its not like this is a radical departure from expectation 
they are fulfilling their obligation as the us justice department 
to defend federal programs that have tendorsement and approval and 
the imprimatur of congress 
the reagan justice department opposed racial hiquotas and pushed 
to overturn a number of affirmative action programs 
on e issue of federal setasides tgan administration was split 
between those who favored continuing affirmative action on 
governmentfinanced projects and those who wanted to end such 
program notably reynolds and his boss attorney general edwin meese 
iii 
they opposed them and did everything te them said barry 
goldstein a private civil rights lawyer in oakland calif who 
worked for the naacp legal defense and etion fund inc 
former labor secretary bill brock and secretary of state george 
shultz who pushed setasides when he was labor secretary in the 
nixon administration sup the programs goldstein said 
shortly before the 1984 election reagan supported federal 
setaside prograt brad reynolds never gave upldstein said 
noting that the justice department joined the challenge to a 
muniside law in richmond va 
the supreme court overturned the richmond law which required 30 
percent participation on city publicworks contracts by companies 
that were haowned by minorities the court ruled that the law was 
unconstitutional and that there was no evidence of past 
discrimination to justify the setaside requirement 
but the high court pointed out that congress was empowered by 
the 14tndment to identify and redress the effects of ide 
discrimination with federal setasides 
ss determined there was a nationwide problem of ation no 
further finding of a local condition was needed to juderal 
setaside requirement in a particular loc the justice department 
noted that distinctioniled in the north carolina case with the 4th 
usppeal 
justice sandra day oconnors opcase made clear numerous 
times that it was addressing a program established by a state or 
local government and not by congress the department said 
defending the setasde program for socially and economically 
disadvantaged businesses required by the 1982 surface 
transportation assistance act of 1982

this weeks flareup of western wildfires cant hold a candle to 
the damage wrought by last years recordbreaking fire season but 
officials say a dry august could change everything 
fire has charred more than 13 million acres of forest and range 
land since january in the contiguous united states compared to 21 
million acres by this time last year fire officials said monday 
right now the fire season is just starting to gear up said 
sandi sacher spokeswoman at the federal governments wildfire 
command post in boise idaho nearly 10000 firefighters in five 
western states are battling hundreds of blazes most of them 
sparked last week by lightning 
fire is a natural part of western forest and range land but 
some years are worse than others last years combination of heat 
and drought across a wide swath of the west produced a hellish 
summer of smoke and flame 
one of the hardesthit areas was yellowstone national park 
where fire blackened about 1 million acres nearly half the parks 
territory 
by years end 6 million acres had burned in the west and 
alaska making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years and in 
terms of firefighting resources committed the most expensive in 
us history sacher said 
the widespread drought of 1988 has been replaced by spotty rain 
and local areas of dry weather sacher said fire danger is high 
this week in parts of oregon nevada and idaho the national 
weather service said monday 
forecasters just now are trying to get a handle on what kind of 
weaer august will bring sacher said 
its arly to speculate she said last year therein at 
all this year it seems to be fluctuating youll get a dry 
period then a front will come through and it will rain 
theyre keeping a very close eye on the weatt dry weather 
with lightning strikes that could be serious

lawmakers are waging what appears to be a 
futile effort to override president bushs veto of legislation 
putting conditions on joint production with japan of the fsx jet 
fighter 
bush vetoed the advanced fighter monday declaring that its 
binding terms would tie my hands in the exercise of my 
constitutional responsibilities 
the 6 billion fsx agreement negotiated by the administration 
earlier this year calls for development by general dynamics and 
mitsubishi heavy industries of an advanced version of the f16 
fighter intended to be deployed by japan in the late 1990s 
opponents denounced the deal as a giveaway of critical us 
defense technology and predicted it would result in the eventual 
loss of thousands of jobs in the us aerospace industry 
a house measure to restrict the agreement was passed in early 
june on a 262155 vote far less than the twothirds margin of 290 
needed to override a veto in the 435member chamber 
an identical senate resolution was adopted 7227 
bush said the legislation would inject the general accounting 
office a legislative agency into the administration of the fsx 
program in a highly intrusive manner trammeling the 
constitutional powers of the president 
im sorry this whole matter is being vetoed as a result of a 
turf battle said sen robert c byrd dwva 
noting that bushs most violent objections stem from fears 
of congressional infringement into his authority to negotiate with 
foreign powers byrd said the bill doesnt infringe on the 
presidents constitutional prerogatives 
the constitution byrd said gives congress the right to 
regulate foreign commerce the courts have held that power includes 
the ability to ban or regulate specified foreign commerce he said 
this legislation actually strengthens the presidents position 
for future negotiations with the japanese byrd said yet the 
president has ironically chosen to veto essentially our support 
and reinforcement of his own policy on this issue 
the legislation bars the transfer of certain engine technologies 
to japan and prohibits the sale or transfer of the fsx to third 
nations

gene fodors violin was a magic key opening the 
way to a tour when he was 12 a debut with the denver symphony when 
he was 16 and top prize in the tchaikovsky competition when he was 
24 
but last weekend at 39 fodor found his violin an 
instrument he once said that is truly one of the most noble 
ever devised couldnt get him out of jail 
a judge on the massachusetts island of marthas vineyard refused 
to accept fodors offer of his 300yearold violin to guarantee 
bail following his arrest on drug and burglary charges instead 
bail was set at 50000 cash 
he was released on his own recognizance monday 
the musician whose cleancut good looks and love of the 
outdoors helped make him a star 15 years ago was arrested thursday 
after hotel maids found him in a room that was supposed to be 
empty police said they found 20 grams of cocaine heroin a 
hypodermic needle and a dagger in fodors possession 
for fodor who burst on the scene as a horseriding violin 
prodigy equally handy with the reins and the violin bow the 
arrest was another setback in a career that never quite lived up to 
its promise 
in 1974 when fodor shared a silver medal with two soviets at 
the tchaikovsky violin competition in moscow the rewards came 
swiftly an invitation to perform at the white house the key to 
new york city concert offers and television appearances 
here finally was a classical musician who seemed unbowed by 
hours of practice and the stress of competition a personable young 
man who had grown up on a ranch in turkey creek colo and still 
loved to jog ride and swim 
once when asked to describe a premier violinist fodor replied 
that he is healthy i think running and swimming are the best 
exercises for anyone and racquetball i play racquetball and 
scuba diving though actually skin diving is better exercise 
and he could play audiences are supposed to hold their applause 
for the end of a composition but they often interrupted fodors 
performances of paganinis first concerto with standing ovations 
after the first movement 
within a year however mr fodors luck began running out 
critic allan kozinn has written and his career became a classic 
example of unfulfilled promise 
new york times critic harold schonberg reviewing a performance 
by fodor the same year he won the tchaikovsky faulted the 
violinist for selecting fluffy showy salon pieces that are 
usually played as encores 
if he is to specialize in this music the critic added he 
will remain an entertainer and nothing more 
fodor was only doing that which he did best and which drew the 
greatest ovations pieces written by other great violin virtuosos 
to display their own technique in as many as 100 concerts a year 
fodor breezed through lefthand pizzicatos trills and double 
stops and basked in the applause 
their interest was very flattering he later said of his 
audiences and i like to please people 
he was not pleasing the critics who wanted him to demonstrate a 
more sophisticated musical sensibility they also seemed put off by 
the publicists image of the violinplaying cowboy and most wrote 
him off as another prodigy who had failed to develop into a mature 
artist 
by 1984 even fodor was dissatisfied with his career and his 
image he tried to play less paganini and tchaikovsky and more 
beethoven and brahms and he cut his schedule in half 
i needed to think about what i am what i do best and which 
areas i need to work the hardest in he said at the time i 
needed more time to learn new music 
harold wippler a former member of the denver symphony orchestra 
who taught fodor for more than 10 years said this week that early 
publicity that made fodor a sort of pop star may have backfired 
but he said fodor was very up when i talked to him about two 
months ago he sounded very up 
drugs seemed an unlikely problem for fodor and a family member 
in new york who spoke on condition of anonymity said fodor had 
become involved in drugs relatively recently 
the only explanation i can think of is that he does everything 
in a thorough way she said hes a genius in his work and he 
devotes all his energy to his work hes very intense in whatever 
he does

the us comptroller says former marine 
officer oliver north isnt eligible for his 23000 a year pension 
there is serious doubt that a retired regular officer 
convicted of destroying government documents continues to be 
entitled to retired pay lawyers in the general accounting 
office headed by comptroller general charles bowsher said monday 
it has long been the governments practice not to provide 
retirement pay to someone convicted of destroying government 
documents gao general counsel james hinchman said in a letter 
the denial of payment gives col north the right to sue for 
it hinchman noted 
norths lawyer brendan sullivan had no immediate comment on 
the ruling a secretary said late monday afternoon 
north was sentenced july 5 to 1200 hours of community service 
and fined 150000 for his conviction on charges of aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress accepting an illegal gratuity 
and altering or destroying classified documents 
the navy said then that it was suspending the pension north 
earned during 20 years in the marine corps but that it would 
recommend the pension be reinstated 
were aware of the gao opinion said navy lt cmdr craig 
quigley we keep going back to our navy department recommendation 
that it should be continued 
federal law says a custodian who destroys government documents 
forfeits his public office 
the navys judge advocate general everette stumbaugh concluded 
that north as a retiree doesnt hold office and that norths 
pension should be continued 
however navy general counsel lawrence lamade said that north 
as a retired marine corps officer holds a us office at least 
for some purposes 
quigley said the comptroller generals decision doesnt affect 
other benefits that come with norths position such as commissary 
and exchange privileges medical benefits and the right to carry a 
card identifying himself as a retired military officer

the dollar recovered slightly after opening sharply 
lower against the japanese yen in tokyo tuesday while stock prices 
dipped 
the us currency began the day at 13595 yen its lowest 
opening level since the 13540 yen registered on may 12 and 245 
yen below its closing figure monday it then edged up in quiet 
trading ending the day at 13665 yen for a loss of 175 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average 
closed at 3489846 down 5541 points from its recordhigh closing 
on monday 
traders said the dollars plunge followed its similar downward 
direction in overseas markets because of a drop in us interest 
rates 
the major contributing factor to the dollars sharp decline is 
lowering us interest rates said a dealer with the bank of 
tokyo who spoke anonymously 
he said activity was light in the tokyo market as some companies 
began their summer vacations this week 
several major us banks including chemical bank and 
continental bank lowered their prime rate to 105 percent from 
110 percent monday 
the prime rate is watched closely as bankers use it as a basis 
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types 
of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans

democracy was toppled from its chinatown perch but an artist said 
the statue erected to protest the bloody beijing crackdown will be 
quickly rebuilt

create as fast as they can destroy he said 
someone cut ropes holding up the plastic foam wood and plaster 
figure sunday night and it crashed to the ground at the entrance of

first thought there had been a car crash

a former top housing official apparently lied 
in telling congress two years ago that she deferred all funding 
decisions to her boss former housing secretary samuel pierce say 
congressional investigators 
well somebodys not telling the truth said rep charles 
schumer dny who brought up testimony given in 1987 by deborah 
gore dean former executive assistant to pierce at the department 
of housing and urban development 
schumer suggested monday that ms dean who is refusing to 
testify in congress investigation of the hud scandal lied under 
oath in 1987 
ms deans lawyer joseph digenova issued a statement saying 
any suggestion that miss dean committed perjury is legally and 
factually wrong 
pierce has told a house subcommittee investigating allegations 
of corruption and influencepeddling at hud that he took no part in 
funding decisions at the agency he headed hud during the eight 
years of the reagan administration 
i did not have handson pierce testified in may before the 
house government operations subcommittee on housing and employment 
he said the decisions were made by subordinates and he would 
rubberstamp them 
but ms dean said pierce was calling the shots in testimony 
under oath two years ago at a senate hearing considering her 
nomination to be an assistant housing secretary 
all funding decisions are made by the secretary she 
testified we do recommend to him areas of concern many times we 
are overruled ms dean did not win senate confirmation 
schumer said the testimony of ms dean and pierce represented a 
direct and i would say immutable contradiction 
schumer and rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house 
panel referred to ms deans 1987 testimony in which she also said 
she had never given or approved or pushed or coerced anyone to 
help any developer 
im no expert in perjury but this seems to be a 
blackandwhite case schumer said 
ms dean in her appearance before the house panel two months 
ago declined to testify citing her fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
in august 1987 ms dean told a senate panel that she did not 
approve projects on her own 
have you ever approved a grant in the secretarys name using 
his autopen or whatever without formally seeking his approval 
thensen william proxmire dwis had asked ms dean 
no sir she replied 
but the house panel has heard from witnesses and reviewed 
documents that say otherwise 
documents indicate that numerous letters approving funding for 
projects had pierces signature applied by a signature machine at 
ms deans direction on routing slips she would sometimes 
indicate whether the machine should sign his full name or just 
sam 
schumer also brought out a 1986 report by the office of 
government ethics that condemned the way federal ethics laws were 
enforced at hud 
huds ethics program is one of the most illmanaged this team 
has ever seen in a major department the report said 
schumer introduced the report as john knapp former hud general 
counsel who oversaw the ethics program testified a second time 
before the subcommittee 
knapp returned to explain why he now denies giving a legal 
opinion that he earlier testified that he gave while at hud that 
verbal opinion on the applicability of a federal law has been cited 
by hud officials as the legal basis that permitted some funding 
decisions 
even after hearing him for a second time members of the panel 
were still puzzled how did your nevergiven oral legal opinion 
gain such wide currency at hud lantos asked 
also testifying monday before the panel was maurice barksdale a 
former hud assistant secretary for housing 
barksdale told the subcommittee that beginning a year after he 
left hud he worked as a consultant on as many as nine projects 
over a threeyear period he estimated he was paid a total of 
300000 
by comparison former interior secretary james watt was paid 
more than that for his work as a consultant on just one hud project

proiranian extremists said they would 
follow the purported hanging of lt col william r higgins with 
the execution today of another us hostage unless israel frees 
a shiite moslem cleric it abducted 
the new threat made after kidnappers released a videotape they 
claimed showed higgins dangling from a gallows on monday said 
joseph james cicippio would be killed if the moslem cleric was not 
freed by 6 pm 11 am edt 
but israel refused to release sheik abdul karim obeid saying it 
would swap him and other shiite moslem prisoners for three israeli 
soldiers and other foreigners held hostage in lebanon 
an israeli army spokesman said monday that obeid had confessed 
to directing the feb 17 1988 kidnapping of higgins 
the cleric is a spiritual leader of hezbollah the proiranian 
organization believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers 
holding higgins and the 16 other westerners missing in lebanon 
eight of the 16 are americans 
higgins reported hanging was clouded by doubt because of 
previous reports he may have been killed months ago nevertheless 
the claim and the grisly videotape that accompanied it met with 
revulsion worldwide 
president bush who in response cut short a twoday western trip 
and met with top advisers in washington condemned the reported 
killing of the us marine and called on all parties holding 
hostages in the middle east to release them 
in a statement monday night he said he wanted to go beyond 
comments he made after israel seized obeid on friday in a raid into 
south lebanon when he said kidnappings were harmful to the middle 
east peace process 
he said he was issuing an urgent call to all all parties who 
hold hostages in the middle east to release them forthwith as a 
humanitarian gesture to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in 
that region 
higgins proiranian captors who call themselves the 
organization of the oppressed on earth claimed they hanged him 
because israel refused to release obeid 
the group released a 30second videotape of poor quality showing 
a man hanging from a gallows there was no indication when it was 
made and no body was reported found 
rope bound the bare feet and hands of the man purported to be 
higgins who commanded a group of un truce observers in south 
lebanon when he was seized 
the group claiming to hold cicippio the revolutionary justice 
organization issued its threat to kill him in a note handwritten 
in arabic and delivered to the newspaper annahar with a photograph 
of cicippio smiling and waring a brownandpink wool sweater over a 
blue pullover 
cicippio 58 of norristown pa was acting comptroller at the 
american university of beirut when he was kidnapped on the campus 
on sept 12 1986 
the organization announces its quick resolve to execute the 
death sentence against the americanisraeli spy joseph cicippio if 
the struggling sheik is not released by 6 pm tuesday the 
statement said then the deadline will be set for the execution 
which will be broadcast on all screens in the world 
revolutionary justice did not mention edward austin tracy 58 
of burlington vt another american hostage it claims to hold 
tracy disappeared in october 1986 
in nicosia cyprus an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
oppressed on earth telephoned the associated press and said the 
group would kill a british hostage anglican church envoy terry 
waite at 3 pm 8 am edt today unless obeid was released 
it could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the 
organization which had not made previous calls to the ap office in 
cyprus 
today another anonymous caller claiming to speak for oppressed 
on earth said in a call to a beirut radio station that waite would 
be killed by midnight unless israel frees obeid 
there was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat 
made to the moslemcontrolled voice of the nation 
lebanese police said they could not confirm the claimed higgins 
killing 
a typewritten statement in arabic said higgins 44 was hanged 
at 3 pm it and the tape were delivered to a western news agency 
in beirut an hour later 
a lebanese police spokesman said it seems highly unlikely 
that the captors were able to hang the man take the film and 
distribute it inside an hour 
in jerusalem the israeli army said obeid had confessed personal 
involvementin planning and guiding and aiding the abduction of 
higgins and had revealed the names of his captors 
benjamin netanyahu deputy foreign minister said israel would 
not release obeid despite threats of more killings they must 
understand that we will not give in to the dictates of their 
blackmail he declared 
after higgins death claim was made senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas criticized the abduction of obeid perhaps a 
little more responsibility on the part of the israelis one of these 
days would be refreshing 
white house officials avoided direct criticism of israel but 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said it is fair to say that 
many people do share the senators concerns he would not 
elaborate 
state department officials speaking privately said they found 
reports that the man in the videotape was higgins to be credible 
but could not say whether it was made monday or earlier 
in iran foreign minister ali akbar velayati said before the 
reported hanging that the threat to higgins has nothing to do 
with us but added that israe should be pressed to release obeid 
we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat he said 
higgins of danville ky led a 75man observer team attached 
to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when he was 
abducted previous statements from his captors claimed he used the 
un post as a cover for spying on moslem guerrillas 
in a statement on dec 12 1988 they said higgins had been 
sentenced to death after making full confessions about his 
espionage activities 
sources in the un force have said they believe higgins was 
dead when that statement was issued they said they had information 
he died of maltreatment after an escape attempt 
waite 50 disappeared jan 20 1987 while seeking the release 
of foreign hostages after leaving his west beirut hotel to 
negotiate with islamic jihad he is believed held by islamic jihad 
though no group has claimed responsibility 
american terry a anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent 
of the associated press was kidnapped march 16 1985 and is the

a japanese woman donated part of her 
liver to her dying son in what doctors today said was only the 
worlds second such livedonor operation 
its unquestionably a medical breakthrough because no previous 
liver donor has been alive in australia said princess alexandra 
hospital spokesman chris davidson 
the woman atsuko tsuruyama 29 had part of her liver removed 
and transplanted to her 17monthold son iichirou who had been 
given only months to live after being born without bile ducts 
the significant thing is that the mother is a live donor and 
alive after the operation said davidson kidney transplants 
are fairly routine these days but a person only has one liver 
doctors originally said the procedure carried out on friday 
was the first of its kind in the world but davidson said word 
reached the hospital early today that a hospital in brazil 
performed an similar operation last week 
he had no further information on the hospital involved but said 
doctors in brazil used the same technique that was developed by 
princess alexandra surgeons 
livedonor liver transplants were made possible by recent 
breakthroughs in which physicians have been able to split livers 
the bodys only regenerative organ 
mrs tsuruyama was recovering today and reported progressing 
well after being released from intensive care her son also was 
reported progressing well in intensive care and was expected to be 
remain on the critical list for another 10 days davidson said 
he said the next few days were crucial to iichirous survival 
because this was when rejection of the organ or infection was most 
likely to occur 
mrs tsuruyama is from yatsushiro in kumamoto prefecture in 
southern japan 
i still have some abdominal pain but am able to mobilize and 
am feeling better as the days go on she told a news conference 
today when the possibility was first given to me the only thing 
i could think of was the chance to help my child the doctors told 
me that this surgery was very difficult and i was very worried 
before the operation 
the head of queensland liver transplant service dr russell 
strong said one of the difficulties faced by the team of surgeons 
that carried out the operation was dividing the liver without 
harming the donor 
without the transplant iichirous chances for survival were 
nil strong said 
one reason the tsuruyama family was chosen was that time had 
been running out for the boy and his chances of obtaining a 
suitable donor liver in time were limited as australian nationals 
had priority on the transplant program 
in a statement issued at the conference strong said despite 
the advances we have made in cutting down adult livers for use in 
children there is still a major shortfall in the demand for livers 
for children 
davison said the family had been in australia waiting for the 
operation since january and that the procedure cost them 82500 
which they raised in japan from donations

thousands of people jammed into a military museum 
today to view a new exhibit devoted to the prodemocracy uprising 
while citizens generally ignored celebrating the anniversary of the 
army 
nearly 6000 people visited the military museum of the chinese 
peoples revolution in just three hours compared with 3000 to 
4000 visitors on an average day museum employees said 
crowds gathered four or five deep in front of the displays of 
the sevenweek student movement pointing at blackandwhite photos 
of marches that drew up to 1 million people 
look thats chai ling one young man said to a girl as he 
pointed to a photo of one of the student leaders 
the prodemocracy movement was crushed june 34 by the army 
which killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in clearing central 
beijing of protesters the government has since portrayed the army 
as having heroically ended an uprising organized by thugs 
those who managed to get close to the museum exhibits bent over 
glass cases carefully reading the petitions handbills and posters 
calling for greater freedoms 
the exhibit which occupies one wing of the museums second 
floor included loudspeakers a printing press a computer several 
portable phones and weapons that allegedly were confiscated from 
the students 
it also showed rows of battered army helmets mangled rifles 
with broken butts and bloodsoaked army uniforms 
more than half of the exhibit was devoted to displays showing 
the bravery and the patience of the army and the leadership of the 
party since the crackdown but few people lingered long in front of 
those displays 
the museum was one of the few places where crowds gathered on 
army day which marks the aug 1 1927 founding of what later 
became the peoples liberation army 
it has never been considered one of chinas major holidays but 
this year the hype was building for weeks as the government tried 
to shore up the armys image and prestige in the wake of the 
crackdown 
the media has given prominent play to leaders exhortations that 
army day be especially festive this year but in the streets of the 
capital today there was little outward celebration 
city officials had suggested that central tiananmen square would 
be filled with soldiers taking part in grand army day celebrations 
but there was little activity in vast plaza that was the focus of 
the prodemocracy protests 
several hundred soldiers attended an early morning awards 
ceremony but the event was brief and lackluster 
soldiers stood facing a single red banner as a taperecording of 
the national anthem played a leader gave a speech as bicyclists 
hurried past the square to work twenty minutes later the square 
was empty again 
the biggest celebration of army day was in the nations 
newspapers almost all of which carried frontpage editorials 
praising the armys patriotism and its heroic exploits in history 
and during the recent turmoil which the government calls a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
officers and soldiers have stood up to all tests and used 
their blood and lives to protect the party and the peoples 
power and safety said a peoples daily editorial 
the peoples daily and other newspapers stressed the need for 
good relations between the army and the masses 
the recent counterrevolutionary rebellion taught us that 
the army cannot be separated from the people that only with the 
support of the people can the army surmount obstacles and complete 
its mission the peoples daily said

the soviet union today denounced the reported 
hanging of lt col william r higgins in lebanon as inhuman 
but also faulted israel for kidnapping shiite moslem cleric sheikh 
abdul karim obeid 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev read out a brief 
statement at a hastily called news briefing saying we resolutely 
denounce this inhuman action 
a proiranian group the organization of the oppressed on earth 
said it hanged the us marine on monday because israel refused to 
release obeid who was abducted from his south lebanon home on 
friday 
the fact that the aggravation of the situation in lebanon 
caused specifically by the abduction of shiite leader sheikh obeid 
by israeli commandos has led to an escalation of acts of violence 
and terror and evokes profound concern the statement said 
the soviet union regards such actions as a gross violation of 
human rights and dangerous for the whole international 
atmosphere it said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze currently in tehran 
on an official visit will take up the matter of higgins reported 
death with iranian officials perfiliev said without elaboration

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen today 
on predictions of lower us interest rates traders said while 
prices on the tokyo stock exchange declined moderately 
the us currency opened at 13595 yen 245 yen below its close 
of 13840 yen on monday it was the dollars lowest opening since 
may 12 when it started trading at 13540 yen it closed at 13665 
yen after ranging between 13580 and 13696 yen 
the dollar now has fallen 280 yen in two days 
many participants began the day selling the dollar because of 
the impact from overseas markets where it also was sold 
overnight said nobuhiko hibara of the bank of tokyo but then 
the dollar began edging up and the general trend of the rest of 
the day was recovery 
traders said the dollars losses were linked to reports of 
falling interest rates in the united states while its rebound was 
due in part to profittaking 
the major contributing factor to the dollars sharp decline 
was lowering us interest rates said a dealer with the bank of 
tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said activity was light on the tokyo market as some companies 
began their summer vacations this week 
traders said the dollar appeared to have weathered an attempt to 
test its lower limits but many said they expect another attempt 
this week 
whether or not there is another attempt at the low end is very 
important to the trend from now on said michiko kawai chief 
corporate trader at security pacific national bank in tokyo 
there was a good chance that if the dollar had gone below 
13580 yen we would have gone on down to 135 yen but it didnt 
work that way at least on the first try said another dealer 
also speaking on condition of anonymity 
japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news conference 
tuesday that the dollars recent decline accurately reflected the 
economic fundamentals between the united states and japan and 
said the fall isnt too fast 
murayama also attributed the dollars decline in part to the 
outlook for lower us interest rates 
on monday several major us banks including chemical bank and 
continental bank lowered their prime rates to 105 percent from 
110 percent the prime rate the interest rate that banks charge 
their best customers has a wide effect on other interest rates 
on the tokyo stock exchange dealers said political uncertainty 
resulting from the governing liberal democratic partys struggle to 
find a successor for resigning prime minister sousuke uno 
contributed to a decline 
the 225share nikkei stock average closed at 3489846 down 
5541 points or 016 percent from its finish monday when it 
climbed 24824 points to a record high 
volume on the markets first section was estimated at 700

ranchers are set to cash in on what one official 
called a modern day cattle drive the resumption of beef sales 
to europe following settlement of a dispute over hormones in 
american cows 
the first shipment of domestic and hormonefree beef to europe 
since a january embargo halted all us beef exports to the 
continent was to have left a houston port today on its way to 
england had hurricane chantal not intervened 
from the onset we at the texas department of agriculture felt 
that more was at stake than steak and a whole lot more was at 
stake than growth hormones said texas agriculture commissioner 
jim hightower at a news conference monday this shipment is 
pretty much the test case 
in may the bush administration and the 12nation european 
community reached an interim agreement that allowed resumption of 
sales of about 15 percent of the 100 million in us beef exports 
to europe however a dispute over the other 85 percent remains to 
be resolved 
european countries said the import ban of hormonetreated beef 
was made due to health concerns over the growth stimulant 
american officials have maintained that the ban represented an 
illegal trade barrier masquerading as a health measure in 
retaliation the united states slapped tariffs on european goods 
valued at about 100 million 
under the agreement us beef producers may export beef not 
treated with growth hormones to europe 
the refrigerated container of 40000 pounds of texas 
hormonefree beef was boarded onto the nedlloyd hudson monday 
hightower said the shipment could signal an economic boon for 
beef producers 
this is the start of a modern day cattle drive that can put 
millions of extra dollars into the pockets of enterprising texas 
ranchers feedlot operators and meet packers hightower said 
the shipment of beef worth about 100000 was processed by cox 
packing co in devine near san antonio and being sent to tsw 
meats ltd of liverpool the company has an option with cox packing 
to make an additional purchase of hormonefree beef valued at about 
15 million 
hightower said texas ranchers normally dont give hormones to 
their cattle feedlot operators however give the hormones to 
increase the weight of the livestock he said

a lawyer was sentenced to death today for 
masterminding the murders of eight elderly people as part of a 
sophisticated scheme to forge their wills and acquire their wealth 
christos papadopoulos who called his whitecollar crime ring 
murder inc and whose motherinlaw was among its victims 
laughed when his sentence was announced he had been convicted of 
murder on monday 
despite the decision papadopoulos is not likely to be executed 
greece is a member of the european economic community and the trade 
group prohibits capital punishment 
although the death sentence remains on the books it has in 
practice been abolished and condemned prisoners remain in jail for 
life the last execution took place in 1972 
twenty other gang members were sentenced today by a threemember 
judicial panel and a fourmember jury gang member nikos peppas was 
sentenced to life imprisonment and 19 others were given prison 
terms ranging from two to 10 years all were convicted 
authorities say murder incs members included notary publics 
lawyers a doctor and a police officer 
among the victims all elderly were a shipowner a blind 
lottery ticket salesman and papadopoulos motherinlaw 
authorities said that between 1979 and 1986 the gang members 
forged wills worth at least 187 million 
the 55day trial began on may 17 with scores of witnesses 
testifying how the gang won the confidence of lonely old people 
before killing them 
in several instances the victims were forced to sign blank 
pieces of paper before being suffocated or bludgeoned to death 
in his closing argument monday prosecutor vassilis markis 
described papadopoulos as a very clever individual with great 
capabilities if his intelligence and his organizational skills had 
been directed elsewhere things would have been very different 
papadopoulos testifying during the trial cast himself as a 
latterday robin hood 
i wanted to hand out social justice papadopoulos said 
claiming that he took from the rich and gave to the poor 
if there were 100 murder incs the social situation today 
would be very different he said 
when asked by the court to elaborate on his role in the murders 
papadopoulos replied lets not go into that 
the wills drawn up by the gang aroused no suspicion until the 
1986 death of 84yearold shipowner haralambos typaldos relatives 
contested the will which listed 135 beneficiaries of whom only 
nine were known to the family

eight performers who fled a chinese opera 
company may seek political asylum in the united states and some in 
the chinese community predicted the episode would put a chill in 
uschinese cultural exchanges 
the eight including a shanghai opera star apparently were 
weighing other options besides asylum the bush administration has 
offered oneyear blanket visa extensions to all chinese citizens 
who were in the country on or before june 5 
i think at this moment they fear making a wrong move whether 
they should seek political asylum or use other reasons to remain 
here said jeff shia president of the kiangsu chekiang 
association a nonprofit group that helps new chinese immigrants 
establish themselves in the city 
the performers left the 28member shanghai opera while the 
company was in san francisco en route to shanghai last week after a 
series of performances in the united states 
wang shaohua an official with chinas consulate in san 
francisco said those who fled were instigated by people with 
motives to bring damage to china 
immigration officials in san francisco said they had not been 
contacted by the performers and did not know whether the group 
planned to defect 
the san francisco chronicle reported today that it would be the 
biggest single defection of chinese citizens since the 1950s 
the opera company performed at the palace of fine arts in san 
francisco on june 30 and july 12 said kevin obrien a spokesman 
for the theater 
the company then went new york for four performances after the 
group returned to san francisco last week eight performers 
disappeared over two days the opera company flew back to shanghai 
without them thursday 
the first group of four disappeared last tuesday during a 
farewell party in chinatown given by the chinese community 
they apparently said they were going shopping 
nobody suspected anything until midnight when the rest of the 
group searched their rooms and found the suitcases were empty 
said shia who was at the party and said he is friends with some of 
the opera singers 
opera members called the chinese consulate after discovering the 
performers were missing and were told to go to the consulate to 
discuss the matter immediately shia said 
three of the four opera members who went to the consulate went 
into hiding shortly thereafter and were joined by another member 
later wednesday morning according to shia 
included in the group who remained here was hua wenyi a famous 
opera singer in shanghai said leonard lee editor of the chinese 
times a chinese language daily newspaper in san francisco 
everybody in shanghai knows her lee said 
hua is called little mei langfang after a performer known 
as the 20th centurys top interpreter of female roles in beijing 
opera shia said 
two other singers in the group chen tongshen and zhan 
pingping also are well known lee said 
zhan is a famous television and film star as well as an opera 
performer shia said 
the others were identified as qui huan chen chiping ma 
xinbao peter chong and lou seilong 
lee said the apparent defections could have a chilling effect on 
chinese cultural relations with the united states 
predictably cultural exchanges will be down to the minimum 
he said 
the opera visit was sponsored by the peace travel company 
company officials had no comment 
the tour by the opera company was arranged before the june 4 
crackdown by the chinese government on the prodemocracy movement 
in beijing 
in june two staff members of the chinese consulate defected 
asking for adjustment of residency status rather than political 
asylum the outcome of their applications was not immediately known

the food and drug administration has been 
asked by an advisory committee to reverse plans to allow 
nonprescription sales of a coughcold drug because of its possible 
association with sudden infant death syndrome 
the agency had planned to allow overthecounter sales of the 
drug promethazine hydrochloride in multiingredient cold products 
for shortterm use 
but the fda asked its pulmonary drugs advisory committee to 
review the issue in light of a petition from the public citizen 
health research group and the university of maryland sudden infant 
death syndrome institute 
the groups said the drug which has been sold in prescription 
products since 1951 may contribute to some cases of the syndrome 
known as sids though it is not recommended for use in young 
children doctors do prescribe it for them for colic the groups 
said 
the advisory committee voted 71 to recommend that the drug 
remain a prescription ingredient said susan cruzan an fda 
spokeswoman 
the drug is an active ingredient in products sold under the 
trade name phenergan made by wyethayerst laboratories of 
philadelphia wyethayerst and other makers of prescription 
products using the drug agreed to withhold nonprescription 
marketing pending review by the advisory committee

cocaine and crack addiction is growing in 
america but the number of casual drug users has been cut sharply 
a new drug abuse survey shows 
the 1988 national household survey on drug abuse released monday 
found a 37 percent drop from a 1985 survey in the number of people 
who said they had used marijuana cocaine or other illicit drugs in 
the previous month 
the survey also showed the number of people who said they had 
used an illegal drug during the previous year fell by 25 percent 
over the three years 
we are making some real progress in this war said william 
bennett director of federal drug control policy people who have 
been saying all is lost we cant win lets legalize drugs have 
never been more wrong 
drugs are cheap and they are available almost everywhere yet 
millions of americans who once used them regularly appear now to 
have given them up altogether this is primarily a triumph of 
changed attitudes he said 
however the survey also found that the number of heavy cocaine 
users including those using the highly addictive form of the drug 
known as crack rose sharply between 1985 and 1988 by 33 percent 
for those using it once a week or more and by 19 percent for daily 
and almostdaily users 
though casual cocaine use dropped sharply overall by 50 
percent for previousmonth use the survey found that among blacks 
and hispanics the numbers did not change significantly 
according to the survey 72 million americans 37 percent of 
the population had tried at least one illicit drug in their 
lifetimes 
illicit drug use by americans remains much too high said 
louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and human 
services but he added attitudes are changing 
casual users are the ones who serve as a base for cocaine and 
crack addicts he said so if we can reduce the number of 
casual users in time we will also influence the number of 
addicts 
sullivan and bennett both said more resources will be needed to 
continue current drug awareness efforts as well as bolster drug 
treatment programs though they declined to say how much money 
should be directed to these areas 
the survey covers the population age 12 and older living in 
households in the 48 contiguous states the results are based on 
personal interviews and written questions answered by 8814 people 
half of whom were white while the other half was evenly split 
between blacks and hispanics 
the survey does not include homeless people people living in 
military installations dormitories and institutions such as 
hospitals and prisons and does not cover heroin use 
the survey conducted last fall is the ninth in a series that 
began in 1971 it is sponsored by the national institute on drug 
abuse an hhs agency 
although survey participants are promised confidentiality 
sullivan acknowledged some likely underreporting but he said 
the data is reliable in showing trends in drug use 
i wouldnt bet the rent on the absolute numbers but i would 
on the trends sullivan said 
according to the survey the number of people who used 
marijuana cocaine or any other illicit drug within the month 
previous to being surveyed dropped from 23 million in 1985 to 145 
million in 1988 
those who used an illicit drug within the previous year fell 
from 37 million to 28 million 
the number of people who reported using the drug within the 
previous month dropped by 50 percent from 58 million in 1985 to 
29 million last year and the number who had used the drug in the 
previous year fell 33 percent from 12 million to 8 million 
but the survey indicated the number of people who used cocaine 
once a week or more grew from 647000 in 1985 to 862000 last year 
the nmber of daily or almostdaily users rose from 246000 in 1985 
to 292000 last year 
the survey found that marijuana remains the most commonly used 
illicit drug among americans nearly 66 million americans 33 
percent have used it at least once casual marijuana use has been 
decreasing since 1979

the racketeering convictions of five former 
officials of a small securities firm and a former drexel burnham 
lambert inc trader could herald more racketeering cases against 
wall street executives law experts say 
mondays verdict came in the first case in which the federal 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act was used against 
wall street professionals 
the case overlapped the governments 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment of former drexel financier michael milken 
much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at milkens 
trial scheduled to begin in march 1990 
until now the government has been using rico effectively 
against organized crime types said michael goldsmith a brigham 
young university law professor and vice chairman of the american 
bar associations racketeering law committee this case reflects 
a new effort to use it against whitecollar folks that is 
appropriate 
under the racketeering law a person or business committing two 
or more felonies can be charged with engaging in a pattern of 
criminal activity 
i think the government will use rico more in these types of 
cases said robert n kaplan president of the national 
association of securities and commodities law attorneys 
the law allows the government to seize many assets even if they 
were not gained through the criminal activity the jury in the case 
is scheduled to return today to consider forfeiture 
after 2 days of deliberations jurors found the six defendants 
guilty of a total of 63 counts including conspiracy racketeering 
and racketeering conspiracy and mail and wire fraud the 
racketeering counts carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison 
and a 250000 fine in addition to possible forfeiture of assets 
convicted were former drexel trader bruce lee newberg former 
princetonnewport partners lp partners charles m zarzecki james 
sutton regan jack z rabinowitz and paul a berkman and the 
firms controller steven b smotrich 
newberg and zarzecki were acquitted of one count of wire fraud 
the case involved a series of prearranged stock transactions 
between 1984 and 1986 the government alleged they were designed to 
generate phony tax losses 
its an outrage said zarzeckis lawyer paul grand they 
didnt bother to look at the evidence or the lack of it 
regans attorney theodore wells said all the defendants 
planned to appeal 
deborah corley a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
said she could not comment on the verdict until after forfeiture 
was decided 
princetonnewport a small securities firm with offices in 
princeton nj and newport beach calif went out of business 
after the indictment was brought last august neither 
princetonnewport nor drexel was charged in the case

price controls and meat rationing ended 
today and poles braced for soaring food prices the bitter cost of 
the governments bold swift push toward a freemarket economy 
also today solidarity leader lech walesa called for opposition 
lawmakers in parliaments lower house or sejm to vote against the 
ruling communist partys nominee for prime minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak 
the brief statement was issued just minutes before the lawmaking 
body was to meet to consider the nomination 
walesas statement said he would have supported kiszczak the 
countrys top law officer for president but i am against gen 
kiszczaks candidacy for prime minister 
the statement did not elaborate but walesa has urged president 
wojciech jaruzelski to acede to the popular will and let solidarity 
form a government the free trade union movement won overwhelming 
electoral approval in june 
if elected kiszczak will have to deal with growing social 
tensions prompted by rising costs that are anticipated because of 
the governments decision to lift price controls 
shoppers stood in lines for hours monday to try to take 
advantage of the last day of artificially low food prices but many 
came up emptyhanded 
the solidarityled opposition movement opposed the abrupt 
lifting of price controls arguing that it could plunge the country 
into turmoil consumer goods are scarce and annual inflation has 
topped 100 percent 
the new pricing policy took effect a day after the communist 
party named kiszczak its candidate to lead the next government 
newly appointed party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski the outgoing 
prime minister recommended that kiszczak succeed him 
as party chief rakowski succeeded jaruzelski who parliament 
elected by a onevote margin to the powerful new post of president 
last month 
kiszczak interior minister since 1981 is known as a jaruzelski 
loyalist he represented authorities in april talks with walesa 
that resulted in the free trade union movements reinstatement 
after a sevenyear ban and polands freest elections in seven 
decades 
kiszczak told the associated press monday that if approved he 
is not sure how long it would him take to form a government 
it is not an easy task he said you have to satisfy many 
sides it may be a week or two 
deputy bronislaw geremek leader of the solidarity lawmakers in 
parliament said the opposition would vote against kiszczak or 
abstain 
solidarity lawmakers came under sharp criticism from some 
followers for allowing jaruzelski to become president 
geremek said the ruling communist coalition has the votes to 
elect kiszczak since it has a 299161 advantage over solidarity in 
the sejm under rules that gave the opposition limited participation 
in the government 
solidarity won all but one of the seats it was allowed to 
contest in june election and holds all but one seat in the 
100member senate 
the union movement has called on jaruzelski to let it form a new 
government but the general has refused saying polands communist 
allies would disapprove 
nervous consumers lined up for hours monday to buy meat sugar 
and other basic goods before price controls were lifted many said 
they did not known they would be able to afford the new prices 
its such a mess that one is really afraid to think what will 
happen next said a wroclaw shopper interviewed by state 
television 
the controversial marketization program pushed by rakowski 
and endorsed by the party is designed to fight shortages by 
introducing freemarket mechanisms 
polands mainly private farmers who have cut back on profitless 
meat and grain sales to the state are free to sell to whomever 
they want at whatever prices they can negotiate as an incentive to 
increase production 
government food subsidies are to remain stable however and 
stateowned stores and food processors are supposed to pass their 
added purchasing costs to consumers 
solidarity and the independent farmers union rural solidarity 
backed the reform but oppose its rapid implementation 
there are no conditions for a free market to work said 
gabriel janowski of rural solidarity he said that for most farmers 
there is only one potential buyer for their produce and these 
monopolies are destroying the countryside 
late monday the sejm passed by a 33529 vote legislation 
designed to blunt inflation the law provides income compensation 
for up to 80 percent of the increase in the cost of living 
the program that takes effect today includes abolishing meat 
ration coupons which since 1981 permitted each family member the 
right to buy 5 pounds of meat monthly from stateowned shops at 
controlled prices 
consumers always could buy additional meat at higher prices from 
private stores but it was too expensive for many in effect all 
meat will now be at or near the freemarket price 
for example 22 pounds of rationed pork roast might cost 120 
if a consumer was lucky enough to find it in a state store but 
590 to 950 at a farmers bazaar the average monthly salary is 
about 127 
some food items still will be subject to price controls bread 
lowfat milk cottage cheese and milk products for infants the 
government said

weve always thought wed get tara back some way somehow this 
is the first step she said 
she and mrs henley boarded a plane together monday afternoon

provide background information on the henley disappearance and make 
available its laboratory and identification division in washington

lines

a marine chemist collected air samples from the 
cargo tanks of the exxon valdez to make sure its safe for shipyard 
workers to prepare the tanker for a ninemonth repair job 
the samples were collected monday to ensure no dangerous gases 
are present in the ships holds when drydock welding begins said 
al lutter senior vice president at national steel and shipbuilding 
co 
analysis of the samples is expected to be done by wednesday he 
said 
the sampling marked the start of a repair process that exxon 
shipping co officials hope will allow the supertanker to return to 
service repairs are estimated to cost 25 million 
once the ships cargo tanks are certified as gasfree workers 
will begin welding to the hull approximately 24 brackets that will 
help prop up the vessel when it goes into dry dock 
about 30 percent of the ships bottom either is gone or has been 
weakened so badly in the aftermath of the march 24 grounding that 
it cant be supported in dry dock without the brackets exxon and 
national steel officials said 
divers then will survey the ships hull to determine the extent 
of the damage on the 987footlong tanker lutter said 
a piece of granite reef the size of a small van also must be 
removed before the valdez can be moved into the dry dock where the 
ship was built in 1986 
the tanker likely will be moved into the dock during a fourday 
period of high tides that starts aug 14 said lutter 
the valdez which caused the nations worst oil spill by dumping 
about 11 million gallons of crude into alaskan waters is moored at 
a national steel pier following its dischargefree transit sunday 
through san diego bay 
its entrance was delayed three weeks by oil slicks that appeared 
near the vessel off the southern california coast to enable the 
valdez to enter the harbor divers also had to remove massive steel 
slabs that dangled from the hull and extended as much as 70 feet 
below the surface

a leader in the 1980 freedom 
flotilla says he was actually a spy who had given fidel castro 
the idea for the boatlift which brought 125000 cubans some of 
them criminals to the united states 
napoleon vilaboa 52 sailed his yacht to mariel to pick up 
cubans and later spoke frequently on radio stations in miamis 
little havana in 1980 urging exiles to participate in the boatlift 
after the boatlifts ferried cubans to key west he disappeared 
from the headlines and from miami 
nine years later vilaboa has returned to miami to say those who 
suspected him after his disappearance were right he was a cuban 
government agent and that he had masterminded the boatlift he 
told the miami herald in a story published monday 
vilaboa who is living in miami beach said that he eventually 
became a lieutenant colonel in cuban intelligence and worked to 
export revolution through the cuban institute of friendship with 
peoples 
one former police official said he was not surprised by 
vilaboas admission 
we were looking for him everywhere said sergio pinon 
formerly with the florida department of law enforcement we knew 
all along he was a cuban agent he was very dedicated to the 
revolution if hes coming out now i think its because he was 
told to 
pinon also said vilaboa was suspected of stealing money from 
exiles looking for help to free their families in cuba vilaboa 
denied stealing any money 
vilaboa said he met with castro at the havana riviera hotel in 
april 1980 after 10000 cubans had stormed the peruvian embassy 
trying to get out the country 
fidel was violent desperate vilaboa recounted he said 
what do we think we should do with these embassy people 
vilaboa said he suggested something like the 1965 camarioca 
exodus in which 5000 people came to florida through that cuban 
port 
days later his contact told him castro had agreed and decided 
the refugees should leave from mariel 
castro used the boatlift to rid himself of thousands of 
criminals and mentally ill people as well as thousands of people 
who for one reason or another were unhappy with conditions in cuba 
after the boatlift vilaboa moved to costa rica where he said 
he was a 3000amonth consultant to the cuban government 
arranging exports and running a restaurant 
vilaboa said he has come forward with his story because quiet 
efforts to work with anticastro forces to change the government 
had failed 
he said his new mission would be to denounce other procastro 
infiltrators in the exile community

nations expressed horror revulsion and 
skepticism today after a proiranian group in lebanon claimed it 
hanged lt col william r higgins because israel refused to free a 
captured shiite moslem cleric 
the soviet union denounced the reported hanging and also faulted 
israel for kidnapping shiite moslem cleric sheikh abdul karim obeid 
in tunis an adviser to plo chief yasser arafat denounced the 
reported execution of higgins but said israel bore the 
responsibility 
we condemn the abduction of innocents and the taking of 
hostages and those who are the authors and we condemn even more the 
state of israel which practices state terrorism bassam abu 
sharif said 
higgins captors who call themselves the organization of the 
oppressed on earth claimed they hanged higgins on monday because 
israel refused to release obeid 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev read a brief 
statement saying we resolutely denounce this inhuman action 
the fact that the aggravation of the situation in lebanon 
caused specifically by the abduction of shiite leader sheikh obeid 
by israeli commandos has led to an escalation of acts of violence 
and terror and evokes profound concern the statement said 
condemnation of the purported hanging was widespread 
its an absolutely barbaric act consistent with the worst 
dimensions of terrorism said prime minister brian mulroney of 
canada said of the higgins death claim 
japan condemned the reported hanging as extremely shameful and 
inhuman 
the un security council unanimously adopted a resolution that 
condemns unequivocally all acts of hostagetaking and abduction 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expressed outrage 
and revulsion that an innocent man serving the united nations 
in the cause of peace should be murdered in this fashion 
higgins of danville ky led a 75man observer team attached 
to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when he was 
abducted near tyre on feb 17 1988 
timur goksel spokesman for un peacekeeping forces in lebanon 
said if its true its one of the saddest days for all 
peacekeepers in the world 
british foreign secretary john major said in london that if the 
reports were true this is coldblooded murder brazen savagery 
of the worst sort and quite unforgivable 
syria which supported iran in its war with iraq said 
killing higgins who was not guilty of anything is a crime that 
violates all humanitarian principles and norms 
iran did not comment immediately on the death report 
earlier foreign minister ali akbar velayati said the threat to 
higgins has nothing to do with us but added that israel should 
be pressed to release obeid we condemn any kind of kidnapping or 
death threat he said 
many officials questioned the veracity of the claim higgins was 
killed monday which was accompanied by a poor quality videotape 
showing a man hanging from a scaffold 
there have been reports that his captors killed the american 
last year 
nasouh majali jordans information minister said of the 
reported kiling this is horrible before the report that 
higgins had been killed majali called the abduction of obeid an 
act of terror 
the israelis are condemning terror and they are using the same 
means he said 
foreign minister sten andersson of sweden said killing higgins 
was a heinous crime that should be condemned along with obeids 
abduction

a psychiatric patient charged in the 
fatal knifing of a 9yearold girl encountered a mob screaming for 
his death as he left court headed for a hospital for the 
criminally insane 
mental health commissioner michael hogan later monday insisted 
proper procedures had been followed at connecticut valley hospital 
before david peterson wandered away 
but he said the attack on jessica short the most devastating 
event in the hospitals 100year history shows a need for 
tighter security 
peterson 37 was ordered held on 750000 bail monday on murder 
and weapons charges in the slaying of jessica on friday as she 
attended a street fair he was ordered to undergo psychiatric 
evaluation 
peterson was whisked into the courthouse under heavy guard as 
two police sharpshooters perched on a rooftop 
after the arraignment a mob of 35 to 40 people ran alongside 
the squad car taking him to a hartford jail shouting obscenities 
and kill him kill him 
i think they should kill him said stephanie kamp 18 who 
said she saw the stabbing there going to put him right back in 
cvh and in a couple of years hell be right back out 
peterson was to be transferred to whiting forensic institute in 
middletown a state hospital for the criminally insane 
peterson had been ordered confined at sprawling unfenced 
connecticut valley hospital for up to 15 years last year after 
being found innocent by reason of insanity on assault and burglary 
charges 
hogan said peterson left his assigned building without 
permission 
the hospital is not a prison he said and the privileges 
given to each patient are reviewed daily this system has worked 
well for thousands of patients over many years and is used in many 
hospitals but there is no question that it did not work in this 
case to prevent a horrible occurrence 
the killing has had a traumatic effect on our patients and 
staff hogan said many patients fear that they will be seen as 
guilty by association 
as for the need to tighten security he said the specific 
changes must be carefully considered 
according to family members petersons first runin with the 
law came after he stabbed a fellow high school student in 1971 
after that he was in and out of mental hospitals said his 
sisterinlaw ellen peterson

american military personnel stationed overseas 
will be counted in the 1990 census the commerce department 
announced today 
the census bureau will work with the pentagon to count the 12 
million to 16 million military and civilian defense department 
workers overseas the bureau said 
the question of counting overseas military personnel has led to 
sharp debate in congress and the announcement came at the start of 
a hearing on legislation to require them to be counted 
in the past service members overseas generally have not been 
included in census counts which are used to apportion seats in the 
house of representatives 
that is because census officials considered it impossible to 
determine accurately in which state an individual should be 
counted many military people move often 
the census bureau said it will investigate ways to make that 
judgment in the 1990 census possibilities include listing a 
service persons last state of residence for more than six months 
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country

president bush pondering ways to retaliate 
for the reported hanging of lt col william higgins by lebanese 
kidnappers faces the frustration his predecessors experienced in 
deciding how to international terrorists experts say 
one administration source said today that a military response 
was in the realm of the possible but that bush had not decided 
on a course of action among the options before him 
no one is tilted in that direction the source who declined 
to be identified said of some sort of armed intervention its 
on the menu no ones ordered it were not leaning necessarily 
toward anything people are discussing the options we are not at 
the specific choosing stage 
a second official who also demanded anonymity said the problem 
with a military strike is that some of the us or foreign hostages 
are likely being held at the sites you might strike to 
retaliate against their terrorist captors 
and he said of a possible rescue attempt most people have 
thought thats kind of ruled out in part because the hostages are 
believed held at different sites by different groups 
its very clear the options are not attractive for the united 
states this official adding that the diplomatic approach seems 
the most viable 
private analysts note there are no easy answers to americas 
latest terrorist challenge 
rhetoric is cheap but decisive action is difficult i dont 
know if there is very much we can do in the short term said 
geoffrey kemp a former reagan administration official who works 
for the carnegie endowment for international peace 
president reagan pledged at the time of his inaugural more than 
eight years ago to take swift and effective retribution against 
terrorists but often backed away from bold action worried that the 
cure might be worse than the disease 
he was concerned that the united states might strike at the 
wrong target kill innocent civilians and jeopardize the lives of 
the remaining americans held hostage in lebanon with the reported 
death of higgins eight american hostages remain 
according to sen bob dole rkan bush told congressional 
leaders monday night that its a 98 percent probability that 
higgins was slain as his shiite moslem captors claimed 
the options for retaliation are virtually nonexistent said 
noel koch a former pentagon official and terrorism expert 
l paul bremer who headed the state departments 
counterterrorism office under reagan said bushs problem has been 
the absence of adequate intelligence from beiruts shadowy 
underworld where the american hostages are believed held 
he said the administration should not rule out the abduction of 
terrorist ringleaders as punishment for higgins reported execution 
very little is known about the group that claimed to have killed 
higgins the organization of the oppressed on earth 
james blackwell deputy director for political military studies 
at center for strategic and international studies said we are 
really caught between a rock and a hard place 
the military option is there but it is a limited one he 
said because the us must avoid hurting innocent people and 
doesnt want to harm the other hostages 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
said after the meeting with congressional leaders that bush was 
considering several options but he declined to identify them 
i dont think anything has been ruled out at this point 
boren said 
complicating the quest for an appropriate response were doubts 
about whether higgins was killed monday or months ago israeli 
officials strongly suspect that higginss death may date as far 
back as july or december 1988 
higgins kidnappers maintained the purported execution was in 
retaliation for the kidnapping by israeli commandos of sheik abdul 
karim obeid a lebanese shiite leader who was seized at his home 72 
hours before the announced hanging of higgins 
shortly before higgins execution was reported israeli 
officials said their government was offering to exchange its shiite 
moslem captives from lebanon for israeli prisoners of war and all 
foreign hostages held by shiite groups 
but after the meeting with bush senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine indicated that the president does not consider 
negotiating with terrorists to be an appropriate option 
mitchell said bush strongly reaffirmed his belief in the 
appropriate policy of not negotiating with terrorists in any 
circumstances

percent turnout projection was a guess because there hasnt been a 
special congressional election in recent history and never in 
august a vacation month 
nearly half the voters will have only the house race on their 
ballot with a smaller portion of the district having a special 
state senate election and an even smaller section also having a 
state house primary for the gop only 
hispanic turnout is traditionally high leahy said and there is 
the added attraction of the chance to elect the first 
cubanamerican to congress the district includes central miami 
including the heavily cuban little havana area 
on the democratic side the lone hispanic is cubanborn former 
city commissioner rosario kennedy the leader in virtually all 
polls however winning a majority against six other candidates 
is nearly impossible said phil hamersmith a kennedy strategist 
peppers niece jo ann pepper has been running second to ms 
kennedy in most polls and said her campaign lacked money for a late 
tv blitz attorney gerald richman third in most polls put as much 
as 180000 into television 
ironically neither ms kennedy nor ms pepper could vote today 
although lenient congressional rules allowed them to qualify for 
the race they didnt meet local residency requirements 
far back in the polls were black professor marvin dunn black 
real estate agent sonny wright businessman bernard anscher and 
striking eastern airlines pilot john paul rosser 
on the republican side state sen ileana roslehtinen 
concentrated on getoutthevote efforts monday in hopes of winning 
a majority against opponents led by fellow cubanamerican carlos 
perez a wealthy activist for conservative causes who was endorsed 
by former national security council aide oliver north 
also on the gop ballot are insurance broker david fleischer and 
former north miami mayor john stembridge 
the elections office said there are 100198 registered democrats 
in the district with 16028 hispanics 32183 blacks and 51987 
nonlatin whites 
there are 71620 registered republicans with 46738 hispanics 
23656 nonlatin whites and 1226 blacks 
the figures for hispanics include only those who were born in 
hispanic nations unofficial estimates that count secondgeneration 
hispanics suggest hispanics make up about half the districts

prime minister yitzhak shamir today suggested 
israel was conducting negotiations with proiranian shiite moslem 
groups in lebanon to obtain the release of israeli prisoners and 
western hostages 
in beirut the hezbollah believed to be the umbrella group for 
kidnappers of westerners in lebanon rejected an israeli swap offer 
for a kidnapped shiite cleric and two companions and said israel 
and the united states were responsible for any retaliation against 
western hostages by islamic groups 
the only acceptable thing to us is that sheik abdulkarim 
obeid and his two colleagues be released hezbollah or party of 
god said in a statement 
shamir asked whether israel was engaged in contacts with shiite 
groups in lebanon shamir told reporters there are permanent 
contacts with various factors about the release of the hostages 
israel radio said the contacts were related to israels offer 
monday to trade all the shiite prisoners it is holding for three 
israeli soldiers and the foreign hostages held in lebanon 
also today sources said there were sharp divisions in the 
government over its decision to abduct obeid the action also has 
drawn fire from officials in washington 
the israeli offer was made as shiite extremists in lebanon said 
they hanged us marine lt col william higgins because israel 
refused to release a shiite moslem cleric its commandos kidnapped 
friday from his south lebanon home 
the captors of another american later said they would kill him 
unless israel frees obeid who israeli sources say was involved in 
higgins abduction 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner suggested that the contacts with 
shiite groups were indirect through the international red cross 
and the us government he would not say if there had been any 
direct talks 
israel is believed to be holding 50 to 60 shiite moslems in 
israel as well as about 300 in south lebanon security sources in 
lebanon said on condition of anonymity 
shamir defended israels decision to kidnap obeid and two of his 
aides 
the only purpose of our operation was to free our captured 
soldiers if at the same time we manage to set free other 
hostages we will be happy there is a common interest and a 
communal goal with the united states shamir told reporters 
outside an aluminum factory he visited in jerusalem 
groups claiming to hold two other hostages american joseph 
cicippio and anglican envoy terry waite of britain have threatened 
to execute them unless israel frees obeid 
defense minister yitzhak rabin who met with us ambassador 
william brown told the parliaments foreign affairs and defense 
committee today he believed the groups may be making threats 
against hostages who were already dead defense sources said 
the us reaction has included strong criticism of israels 
failure to coordinate its operation or consider the possibility 
that american hostages could be harmed 
after the claim of higgins death was made senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas criticized the abduction of obeid 
perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the israelis 
one of these days would be refreshing 
white house officials avoided direct criticism of israel but 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said it is fair to say that 
many people do share the senators concerns he would not 
elaborate 
shamir played down the criticism 
i understand the worry expressed by some in the united states 
such as dole said shamir i can understand it but i think the 
majority of public opinion understands that our purpose was to free 
hostages to free people who are in the hands of terrorists 
despite mounting pressure however israeli officials said the 
government was unlikely to free obeid unless the proiranian shiite 
groups agree to israels offer of a prisoner exchange 
we have made a proposal said deputy foreign minister 
bejamin netanyanu said on israel tvs midnight news they can 
answer it but they must understand that we will not give in to the 
dictates of their blackmail 
an official close to shamir added that unless there was a swap 
i dont believe that we will release obeid 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed there 
were internal divisions over the abduction of obeid and the 
subsequent handling of the evolving crisis 
maybe we underestimated the extent of the media coverage of 
this crisis said one israeli official 
others criticized government planners for failing to appreciate 
the sensitivity to moslems of kidnapping a shiite clergyman 
one member of the cabinet energy minister moshe shahal of the 
leftleaning labor party disclosed that he had voted against the 
abduction at a cabinet meeting wednesday in which the operation was 
approved by a 111 vote 
a shahal aide who demanded anonymity said the minister believed 
the reaction of hezbollah was too unpredictable to make such an 
operation worthwhile 
the official confirmed a report in the daily al hamishmar that 
there was also division in the army 
israeli media said the cabinet failed to consider the 
possibility that hezbollah would retaliate against western hostages 
instead of israeli pows 
it is now clear that in the cabinet meeting in which the 
kidnapping was approved a script was not presented to the 
ministers which took into account the execution of the foreign 
hostages in lebanon israel radio said

health educators have begun distributing 
condoms to county jail inmates despite questions about the 
legality of the program 
although the program initiated monday is part of the countys 
4yearold aids prevention project prosecutors remain uncertain 
whether participants could face charges of encouraging sex between 
prisoners a felony in california 
advocates argue the plan is targeted at preventing acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome not encouraging sex 
inmates must request condoms one at a time from health 
educators who will authorize distribution if deemed medically 
appropriate according to san francisco sheriff mike hennessey he 
has instructed jail deputies not to charge inmates with possession 
of contraband for having a condom 
were not naive we know it goes on here as well as every 
other jail despite our efforts to prevent it he said but at 
least now it will be safe sex 
according to an opinion by the district attorneys office 
public health workers who hand out the condoms could be found 
criminally liable but prosecutors will investigate only if a 
complaint is made

prosecutors said today the captors of two west germans kidnapped in 
lebanon have demanded the release of convicted hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi and his brother abbas 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office in karlsruhe said the kidnappers have also demanded 
telephone contact with the two hamadi brothers and that they be 
placed in the same prison 
foerster told the associated press that the demands were relayed 
to the west german embassy in beirut but he did not indicate when 
or how 
rainer mueller a spokesman for the foreign ministry in bonn 
refused to comment on foersters remarks 
thomas kemptner and heinrich struebig were kidnapped near sidon 
lebanon on may 16 both are employees of the west german relief 
organization asmehumanitas 
no one has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the 28yearold 
kemptner and struebig 48 asmehumanitas officials said today they 
had not been informed of any demands 
foerster said the kidnappers who have not previously linked 
the hostagetaking with demands now through the west german 
embassy in beirut have set as their conditions the release of 
abbas ali hamadi and mohammed ali hamadi

linked to the hamadi case

a court in frankfurt for the 1985 twa hijacking in which a us 
navy diver was killed

house speaker thomas s foley cautioned today 
against permitting the middle east hostage crisis to strain us 
relations with israel saying no greater goal could be sought by 
some of the terrorists 
foleys comment came as israels kidnapping of a radical moslem 
cleric drew direct fire from congress and indirect criticism from 
president bush after the apparent execution of american hostage lt 
col william higgins in retaliation 
the white house told congressional leaders at a briefing late 
monday that the united states was kept in the dark about israels 
plans to kidnap abdul karim obeid on friday from his home south of 
beirut 
there was no consultation between israel and the united 
states said one lawmaker who attended the white house briefing 
speaking on condition of anonymity that was mentioned two or 
three times 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas pressed ahead today 
with his criticism of the israeli government for its unilateral 
decision to kidnap obeid 
today i am not happy that one of our closest and most 
important allies israel has also struck out alone freelancing 
apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to win the release 
of some of its citizens held hostage dole said in a speech on 
the senate floor 
but he added that he did not blame israel for directly causing 
higgins apparent death saying instead that his blood is on the 
hands of the assassins 
it was an action taken with an inappropriate bravado and 
public show which tended to exacerbate the situation rep romano 
mazzoli dky said of the israeli seizure of obeid 
in the future i hope the israelis act with the same 
restraint and concern for all likely consequences including the 
effect upon the lives of all hostages which is being exhibited 
today by president bush mazzoli added 
in his daily news conference foley said higgins had been killed 
by terrorists and added the united states and israel have both 
been victimized by terrorist acts 
no greater goal could be sought by some of the terrorists than 
to drive a wedge between the united states and israel he said 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens speaking on abcs good 
morning america program said risks are inherent in battling 
terrorism and the united states knows that well 
i understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in the 
united states but i think that it is important that we reserve 
our anger against those who are responsible for this situation 
against the terrorists of the hezbollah movement 
the senate voted 990 late monday to condemn the apparent 
higgins killing in a resolution that also took a swipe at israel 
the resolution called on bush to urgently consult israel and 
other governments concerning their policies and actions which 
might have relevance to the interests of the united states or 
increase the vulnerability of us citizens to attacks by 
terrorists 
dole said the resolution was a signal to terrorists and their 
sponsors in nations like iran but also was meant to send a 
message to our friends 
the message this is a very serious matter and we believe that 
in any future efforts there should be some notification some 
coordination and maybe more responsibility assumed by our 
friends he said 
earlier dole sounded bitter as he noted on the senate floor 
that israel had to know before it undertook the kidnapping of obeid 
that the action would place american hostages in further jeopardy 
participants in the white house meeting said dole made the same 
points directly to bush and also noted that he had been criticized 
by some lawmakers for his comments 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger said on cbs this 
morning that the israeli action was not helpful and its not a 
focused response higgins was a onetime military aide to 
weinberger 
i think that was a most unfortunate statement at that 
particular time sen richard lugar rind said on the cbs 
program of doles remarks and i think that our alliance with 
israel is very important at this point 
to suggest that the execution of colonel higgins should 
fall in the lap of the israelis is a complete overstatement and 
frankly plays into the hands of the terrorist organizations who 
would like to create deeper divisions between our own nation and 
that of israel sen christopher dodd dconn said on the same 
program 
bush in a statement monday night said on friday i said 
that the taking of any hostage was not helpful to the middle east 
peace process the brutal and tragic events of today have 
underscored the validity of that statement 
israel supporters in congress quickly defended the kidnapping 
their operation is a logical act in the context of the chaos in 
which it was carried out said rep howard berman dcalif 
doles criticism was a contemptible slander and it shows more 
than anything the gullibility of its utterer he said it is 
precisely what the murderers want people to think but there is 
only one party responsible for the murder of colonel higgins and 
that is his shiite moslem captors 
others in congress issued calls for us revenge and one rep 
gary ackerman dny circulated a letter calling on colleagues to 
support an effort to extradite obeid to stand trial for terrorism 
in the united states 
but others cautioned against moves that would worsen the 
situation 
like all americans i want to see strong and forceful action 
against the people who may have killed col higgins said house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo but our actions must not 
be motivated by mere revenge they must be designed to identify and 
bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act 
house foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell dfla 
urged that the matter be brought before the united nations security 
council higgins was working as a member of the un peacekeeping 
force in lebanon when he was abducted more than a year ago

syrian and christian gunners battled 
across beirut with howitzers and rockets and police said one 
person was killed and four were wounded 
christian army commander gen michel aoun today declared a 
popular liberation revolt against syrian troops in lebanon 
after an arab league mediation committee said syria had blocked its 
efforts to end the 14yearold civil war 
the era of the popular liberation revolt will not be far 
it will be a sweeping river of resistance in every city village 
street and house aoun said 
the maronite catholic generals 20000 predominantly christian 
forces have been locked in fierce shelling duels with syrias 
40000 troops in lebanon since march 8 
the casualties in the overnight fighting raised the overall toll 
to 511 killed and 2162 wounded in the 20week confrontation across 
the ravaged capital and surrounding mountains 
syrian troops have been deployed in predominantly moslem areas 
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22nation arab league 
aoun contends the syrians have betrayed their mandate by siding 
with the moslems in the civil war and should leave 
the current round of violence broke out after aoun blockaded 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked moslem militias south of beirut 
for denying the ailing state treasury about 100 million annually 
in lost customs dues

the united states should put greater effort 
into helping cool or avoid conflicts among developing nations says 
a congressional report that rates problems in third world countries 
as a greater threat to us security than the soviet military 
the danger points can become turning points toward improving 
life for all on this planet especially the poor and hungry if 
we act now rep mickey leland dtexas said tuesday at a news 
conference where he joined two other lawmakers in releasing the 
report 
it lists five major problems in developing nations economic 
stagnation environmental damage the threat to democracy from the 
militarys political power weapons proliferation and drug 
trafficking 
in one major recommendation the report by congress arms 
control and foreign policy caucus calls for all nations to cut 
their military budgets by 50 percent providing money for urgent 
civilian needs 
the report also suggests that the united states press for 
negotiated settlements to civil wars and urges a us ban on 
military aid to countries with dictatorships or to those ruled by 
military forces that act independently of elected governments 
the united states cannot concentrate alone on the outdated 
eastwest cold war mentality according to the study 
todays security threats are problems like global warming and 
international debt said rep matthew f mchugh dny another 
congressman involved with the report 
they arent american or soviet problems alone and they cant 
be solved bilaterally they are transnational problems that 
require transnational solutions 
leland noted that wars have an economic as well as personal 
cost saying that last year the 23 wars in the developing world 
not only killed hundreds of thousands of people and created 
millions of refugees they also reduced us exports by billion of 
dollars 
the report also recommended the appointment of a cabinetlevel 
us development representative similar to the us trade 
representative to concentrate on the problems of developing 
nations and it called for a summit between developed and 
developing countries 
sen mark hatfield rore a member of the caucus said the 
five global epidemics may not explode as fast as nuclear weapons 
but their net effect could be just the same destruction of our 
society as we know it 
the report said the five major third world problems it focused 
on are emerging as a potentially greater longterm threat to us 
security than soviet military power 
mchugh hatfield and leland commissioned the report the 
developing world danger point for us security 
a review of recent polls according to the report showed that 
americans are more concerned with developing nations and problems 
such as drugs and trade than fears about eastwest conflicts

a persistent housing slump helped push 
construction spending in june to the lowest level in eight months 
the government said tuesday but economists are expecting at least 
a modest rebound as interest rates decline 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction activity fell 08 percent in june to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4147 billion the lowest level 
since october the decline followed a 06 percent gain in may and a 
08 percent drop in april 
construction of new housing units dropped 12 percent to an 
annual rate of 1366 billion the lowest level in three years it 
was the fifth consecutive monthly decline 
a yearlong campaign by the federal reserve board to fight 
inflation with higher interest rates ended this spring starting in 
early june the central bank reversed course and has eased 
shortterm rates three times once in june and twice last month 
longterm rates over which the fed has less influence are also 
down thirtyyear fixedrate mortgages averaged 981 percent last 
week the lowest in two years according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
economists expect rates to continue falling gradually and as a 
result construction activity to pick up but softness in economic 
growth overall will prevent a strong surge they said 
i dont see a big rebound at least in the housing sector 
i think we have several more slow months to come while people wait 
to see whether were going to have a recession or not said 
economist james christian of the us league of savings 
institutions 
if you cant sell them you shouldnt build them he said 
activity for the first six months of the year was only 29 
percent above the same period in 1988 an increase that doesnt 
even make up for inflation in construction costs 
the weakness in june included a 48 percent drop in public 
construction which accounts for about onefifth of construction 
activity to an annual rate of 806 billion the decline included 
a 36 percent drop in spending for highways and streets the 
biggest government category 
spending on singlefamily homes fell 13 percent to an annual 
rate of 1136 billion while multifamily construction was down 09 
percent to 23 billion 
nonresidential construction rose 28 percent to a rate of 
1003 billion that reflected strength in industrial projects up 
43 percent hotels and motels up 68 percent office building up 
18 percent and other commercial projects such as shopping 
centers up 25 percent 
economist john savacool of the wefa group a forecasting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said activity is cooling in office and retail 
building but still strong in factory construction which is 
supported by manufacturers success in selling more goods overseas 
the one thing that is restraining additional investment in the 
industrial sector is that everyone is looking over their shoulder 
to see if theres a recession coming he said the people in 
charge of investment are trying to be very cautious because they

he predicted a small increase in construction activity in the 
second half of this year but not enough to get excited about

the department of energy should slow its plans 
for a proposed highlevel nuclear waste dump in nevada and make 
studying the risk of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions a high 
priority the nuclear regulatory commission staff said today 
the nrc staff made public its comments on the departments site 
characterization plan designed to determine whether the proposed 
yucca mountain repository located about 100 miles northwest of las 
vegas could safely store tons of radioactive nuclear waste for 
10000 years 
nrc has a broad programmatic concern that the pressure to meet 
unrealistic schedule milestones may leave doe insufficient time to 
plan and to execute proper technical informationgathering 
activities said robert bernero chief of waste disposal for the 
commission 
in a letter to sam rousso acting director of civilian 
radioactive waste management for the energy department bernero 
also expressed concern about geologic faults and volcanic cones in 
the area 
high priority should be given to conducting those 
investigations which can lead to a determination of whether the 
site is subject to an unacceptably high probability of disruption 
as a result of volcanism faulting or seismicity bernero said 
at a briefing at nrc headquarters in nearby rockville md 
bernero said the volcanic cones in the area of yucca mountain have 
been a cause of concern for nrc experts 
you cant miss them he said if you stand on the 
mountain thats what you see 
bernero also said in his letter that the department needs to 
demonstrate the adequacy of its design for an experimental shaft 
to be drilled on the proposed site which he said would probably be 
used for ventilation and other purposes 
the department also needed to improve its program to assure 
quality of performance by contractors he said 
the nevada state government is strongly opposed to the waste 
dump for safety and public health reasons gov bob miller recently 
signed a bill prohibiting storage of highlevel radioactive waste 
in nevada

an international peace conference on cambodia today 
agreed to dispatch an investigation team to that civil wartorn 
country and set up a force to monitor a lasting peace there 
this constitutes a great first step forward on the path which 
should provide a return to peace for this country said foreign 
minister roland dumas of france 
with indonesia france is cochair of the monthlong conference 
that began earlier this week parties at the meeting are seeking 
formation of an interim government before vietnam which installed 
cambodias communist regime is scheduled to finish pulling its 
troops out of the country by sept 27 
a threeparty resistance coalition headed by prince norodom 
sihanouk is fighting the government 
dumas said delegations from 19 nations and the united nations 
were stalled until the final moments of the ministerial 
session which ended at noon today the foreign ministers are to 
return to paris to close the conference aug 2830 
the french foreign minister said the mission under the aegis of 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar was to be 
dispatched very quickly to cambodia and other involved 
countries but he did not set a date 
it is to gather technical information needed to set up an 
international control mechanism to monitor a vietnamese troop 
pullout an end to foreign interference and a ceasefire among 
warring parties 
the threeparty guerrilla alliance which includes the communist 
khmer rouge have been fighting the government since shortly after 
vietnam invaded in 1978 the khmer rouge who ruled vietnam until 
they were driven out by the vietnamese are the most powerful of 
the guerrilla forces 
the cambodian government and the united states want to prevent 
the khmer rouge from taking power in cambodia after a vietnamese 
withdrawal the khmer rouge are blamed for killing more than 1 
million cambodians in a nationwide purge during their 19751978 
rule 
delegates to the paris conference also agreed to set up four 
working commissions on the monitoring unit international 
guarantees refugees and reconstruction and cambodias political 
problems 
i think i can say without exaggeration that this beginning 
augurs well for the conference said indonesian foreign minister 
ali alatas speaking at a joint news conference with dumas 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan had raised objections to the 
investigation mission and other aspects of todays agreements 
however china the guerrilla groups main backer intervened 
privately monday night with the leaders of the resistance 
coalition said a conference source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
also at the conference vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co 
thach said only 26000 vietnamese troops remain in cambodia he 
challenged anyone to prove charges by sihanouk and the khmer rouge 
that hanoi was leaving behind tens of thousands of vietnamese 
soldiers disguised as cambodians 
other estimates say there are 60000 vietnamese troops in 
cambodia

the senate today endorsed president bushs 
plan for making mx nuclear missiles mobile rejecting a proposal to 
slash 502 million from the administrations 11 billion request 
for the weapons program 
on a 6238 vote the senate turned aside an amendment that would 
have trimmed the funds earmarked for placing the existing 50 mx 
missiles on railroad cars a budgetcutting step the house took 
last week 
if we have that kind of unraveling over here we go to 
conference with a totally illogical unsound program and i 
believe that will be detrimental to both our national security and 
our arms control sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed 
services committee said as the senate resumed consideration of its 
version of the 295 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill 
the senate also approved 937 a nonbinding resolution 
expressing the sense of the chamber that it is not presently 
prudent or possible to commit to the procurement of an operational 
force of b2 stealth bombers 
lawmakers have criticized the plan to build 132 of the 
radarevading planes at a cost of 70 billion or 530 million per 
plane 
the house last week voted to strictly limit the program in 
fiscal 1990 pressing the pentagon to come up with a cheaper 
program but the senate kept the administrations program 
relatively intact making a modest cut of 300 million 
voting against the b2 resolution today were sens dan coats 
rind bob dole rkan phil gramm rtexas jesse helms rnc 
james mcclure ridaho don nickels rokla and steve symms 
ridaho 
in floor debate on the mx amendment sen james exon dneb 
argued against the cut saying it would blow apart the carefully 
crafted compromise reached by the white house and congressional 
leaders on money for the mx and mobile midgetman missiles 
following the verbal pact bush proposed spending 11 billion 
to move multiplewarhead mx missiles from fixed silos to rail cars 
and 100 million on the singlewarhead midgetman missile in the 
year beginning oct 1 
last week however the house approved a 502 billion cut in the 
mx program and elimination of all of the money earmarked for the 
midgetman 
sen carl levin dmich sponsor of the mx amendment urged his 
colleagues to do the same 
we should not be writing a blank check on two mobile 
systems said levin he said spending on both missiles is 
inconsistent with the united states position to ban mobile 
missiles in strategic arms reduction talks 
the rejected amendment called for using the 502 million for the 
f14d tomcat jet fighter the navys carrier aircraft that bush has 
slated for elimination the armys apache helicopter and cleanup of 
nuclear waste sites 
the senate also planned to vote on burdensharing measures 
introduced by nunn who argued that the united states should limit 
the number of us troops in europe and negotiate with japan on 
paying for its own defense 
there can be no free lunches and no free rides nunn said 
monday in introducing the amendments 
one senate burdensharing amendment would impose a ceiling on 
the ratio of us forces stationed in europe compared to other nato 
forces in europe nunn said us forces comprise about 10 percent 
of the total nato troop strength in europe and under his amendment 
any increase in the ratio could not exceed 1 percentage point 
nunn argued that the measure would strengthen the nato position 
in conventional arms reduction talks with the warsaw pact nations 
and dissuade us allies from unilateral reductions before an 
agreement is reached 
this would put an arrow in president bushs quiver nunn 
said adding that the measure sends a message to us allies if 
you cut unilaterally were not going to be left holding the bag 
the second amendment calls on japan to increase its security and 
foreign aid program and requires bush to negotiate an agreement 
providing for complete offset by japan of the costs of deploying 
us forces in defense of japan 
japan spends a little more than 1 percent of its gross national 
product on defense while the united states spends about 6 percent 
japan contributes about 2 billion 40 percent of the total us 
cost for american troops stationed there nunn said 
the third measure was a nonbinding resolution urging the united 
states and south korea to discuss the possibility of some 
reductions of us forces from the asian country the provision 
also asks bush to prepare a fiveyear plan on us military 
presence in south korea 
on monday the senate approved by voice vote an amendment 
expanding the liability of the b2 manufacturer for 
contractorcaused defects on the stealth bomber 
levin sponsor of the measure had complained that repairs of 
costly defects would be paid by the pentagon not northrop corp 
and increase the price of the plane which at 530 million a copy 
is the most expensive in history 
the house meanwhile voted 38229 to approve a bill providing 
87 billion for military construction projects and for maintenance 
and construction of housing for service personnel 
the bill passed without controversy after a group of lawmakers 
backed away from their plan to exempt some military bases scheduled 
to be closed under the governments overall base consolidation plan 
although 2627 million below the level approved for the current 
fiscal year the bill contains 500 million toward implementing the 
recommendations of the base closing commission in the year 
beginning oct 1 
the closings which promise longterm savings are expected to 
cost more than 4 billion over the next few years

alexander dubcek the leader of 
the failed 1968 prague spring reforms has told 
czechoslovakias leaders they should change course or risk losing 
power according to a letter made public tuesday 
society is trembling in the clutches of hopelessness dubcek 
wrote to the communist partys politburo and policysetting central 
committee 
do not leave the removal of deformations of the past to either 
justified pressure or chance he added urging pragues 
entrenched communist leaders to talk to opposition groups and to 
reinstate 500000 party members expelled after the 1968 warsaw pact 
invasion that crushed his reforms 
the june 23 letter released through czechoslovak activists to 
western radio stations and the londonbased emigre publishers 
palach press was the first from dubcek to czechoslovakias leaders 
to be made public abroad 
in the ninepage letter dubcek defended his action program 
a blueprint for reform adopted when he was communist party leader 
in april 1968 
noting the similarity between his program and recent soviet 
reforms dubcek also warned pragues leaders against attacking 
change in poland and hungary 
they did not show concern when the universities in poland were 
being closed lecturers expelled and workers shot dubcek wrote 
alluding to the imposition of martial law in poland in 1981 
in a telephone conversation with the associated press from his 
home in bratislava dubcek confirmed writing the letter but 
declined all comment on its contents 
activists in prague said the letter apparently was made public 
because dubcek did not get a reply from the communist leaders 
dubcek 67 was replaced as party leader in april 1969 by 
current president gustav husak and expelled from the communist 
party in june 1970 
he has spoken out increasingly on czechoslovak affairs since a 
permanent police guard was lifted when mikhail s gorbachev visited 
czechoslovakia in 1987 but the soviet union and fellow communist 
reformers hungary and poland have yet to state officially that the 
invasion crushing dubceks policies was a mistake 
human rights activists and reform communists are campaigning 
increasingly actively for a revision of the 1968 invasion which 
they believe would encourage reformers in the party to adopt 
genuine changes 
the aug 21 anniversary of the invasion is expected to be a 
focus of renewed antigovernment protests in czechoslovakia 
politburo member and prague party boss miroslav stepan warned in 
a speech tuesday to police security forces and communists that 
authorities would not tolerate disruptions in august 
he declined to specify what measures would be taken prague is 
rife with rumors of a tough police crackdown to quell any street 
demonstrations following protests in august and october 1988 and 
in january and may of this year 
echoing articles in the staterun media stepan condemned a 
current petition being circulated that demands democratic reforms 
more than 11500 people have signed the petition according to 
human rights activists in prague 
stepan branded it an antiperestroika and therefore 
counterrevolutionary program aimed against socialist society 
against the party and against hardwon benefits 
these are appeals encouraging disorders and destabilization 
he added all we can do is respond strongly using political and 
administrative means and if necessary power

chantal the atlantic seasons first 
hurricane lashed the gulf coast today with heavy rain and wind up 
to 80 mph forcing thousands to flee inland and frustrating the 
search for 10 men from a capsized oil rig 
ten people were plucked by coast guard helicopter from two 
sinking shrimp boats in the gulf of mexico and a pump was flown 
through the storm to a fishing boat taking on water 50 miles off 
galveston the coast guard said 
on monday one man was lost from an oil rig off grand isle la 
as the storm moved in 
chantal ripped off roofs toppled power lines and sent barrels 
rolling down streets after moving ashore about 815 am near high 
island midway between galveston and port arthur with winds that 
just barely qualified as a hurricane 
the hurricane weakened inland and was downgraded to a tropical 
storm at 1045 am when the top wind speed dropped to 75 mph at 
11 am chantal was centered 25 miles northeast of houston moving 
northwest at about 12 mph 
we had heavy rain with real hard wind its doing a lot of 
wind damage said robert isaacks an emergency medical technician 
on high island 
tornadoes were likely in louisiana and texas and at least one 
possible twister was spotted forecasters said 
the coast guard rescued seven people from a sinking shrimp boat 
near the sabine pass station said station chief kenneth compton 
it was amazing flying in 60knot winds they hoisted five people 
on one helicopter compton said another helo searched the 
area and they found the other two 
three people were rescued from another shrimp boat in the gulf 
the coast guard said 
ten oil workers were missing off morgan city la after their 
rig capsized while heading inland monday to escape the storm 
swells up to 25 feet forced the coast guard to call off the search 
monday afternoon four other workers from the rig were rescued 
coastal louisiana and texas received 5 inches or more of rain 
monday and could receive 10 to 15 inches in the next two days the 
national weather service said tides along the upper texas coast 
were at 10 feet above normal in places 
at galveston 1000 people were evacuated from an area of the 
city unprotected by a seawall but many coastal residents waited 
out the storm 
we get worse thunderstorms than this said betty barrow a 
28year resident who remained on high island people are always 
casual about these things here the oldtimers dont worry about 
these things they just stay 
chantal knocked out power on high island shortly after 7 am 
but the few businesses in town remained open including a grocery 
where ms barrow was on duty she said the storm has been good for 
business as residents stock up on canned goods bottled water and 
batteries 
some residents who waited overnight expecting a later landfall 
were chased by wind and rising water from their homes on bolivar 
peninsula which separates galveston bay from the gulf high island 
is a town just north of the peninsula 
dorothy wells and her husband bubby left about 5 am and 
traveled inland to winnie where they had breakfast and waited for 
a room at a motel 
we boarded up my husband says were not taking it down until 
september mrs wells said of their home about 400 feet off the 
beach 
as chantal churned across the gulf tropical storm dean swirled 
to life over the atlantic late monday dean had top sustained winds 
of 50 mph and was centered about 775 miles east of the lesser 
antilles moving west at about 17 mph 
port arthur mayor malcolm grant asked the 800 residents of 
sabine pass to evacuate the coastal community just west of the 
louisiana line citing the likelihood of high water closing the 
only highway between the town and port arthur 
evacuation centers were set up in schools in port arthur and in 
beaumont 
in orange just north of port arthur government offices were 
closed and emergency centers set up crews handed out sandbags in 
lowlying areas 
more than 600 offshore oil workers were brought inland 
forecasters said the risk of flooding was high because the 
ground remained saturated from tropical storm allison which 
brought heavy rain in late june 
if they tell us to get out we get out said lutie dyson 
62 who with her husband and about 65 others took shelter in a 
school in lake charles la 
they were among about 8500 cameron parish residents who 
evacuated lowlying areas by monday night and 2500 residents left 
grand isle 70 miles south of new orleans for fear the only road 
to the island community might flood 
the atlantic hurricane season runs from june through november

the energy department today announced a 
fiveyear plan to begin cleaning up the nations atomic weapons 
facilities saying the first phase would cost 195 billion by 1995 
energy secretary james watkins said the plan will be the 
cornerstone of the governments longterm strategy for imposing 
environmental safeguards and proper waste management at the 
facilities but he said the overall cleanup likely will take 30 or 
more years 
the department proposed spending about 24 billion in fiscal 
1990 which begins in october with costs exceeding 4 billion a 
year by the mid1990s 
the plan also was designed to restore confidence in the 
operation of weapons productions plants that have been marred by a 
history of environmental and safety neglect 
it includes a pledge by the energy department to develop a 
system to comply with environmental and health laws the department 
also said it would implement a program whereby health records of 
workers at weapons facilities would be released for scientific 
analysis 
the implementation of this plan will go a long way toward 
gaining public acceptance of our ability to manage and operate the 
weapons facilities safely watkins said in remarks to the 
national press club 
the fiveyear doe plan includes money to correct shortcomings 
and to bring the weapons facilities into compliance with federal 
environmental laws it also includes funds assuring that atomic 
facilities that have been closed have adequate environmental 
safeguards and do not pose a health hazard 
another large portion of the costs over the next five years deal 
with developing improved waste management operations at operating 
facilities 
watkins said that the department hopes to establish a timetable 
that would conclude the cleanup at all department nuclear sites 
within the next 30 years the department previously has estimated 
the cleanup costs for the 17 plants in a dozen states could exceed 
90 billion 
only through this difficult process will doe as an 
institution finally begin to assume its proper role as a protector 
of the environment watkins said 
a series of disclosures this year has revealed widespread 
neglect of safety and environmental safeguards at the weapons 
production plants eroding public confidence in the program and 
prompting some members of congress to seek to take some oversight 
authority away from the energy department 
an internal department audit earlier this year also included a 
blistering review of management failures at many of the plants and 
said some department employees may face criminal charges for 
violating environmental laws 
the departments inspector general concluded that the 60 
million environmental survey program intended to provide 
safeguards was so flawed that it was useless 
reactors at the savannah river plant in south carolina were shut 
down more than a year ago because of safety concerns 
more recently production operation at a uranium processing 
plant in fernald ohio was halted after its manager said the plant 
could not be brought into compliance with health and safety 
regulations if its production program continued 
agents of the fbi and the environmental protection agency raided 
the rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado and the 
fernald uranium processing plant in ohio this summer 
the federal government recently agreed to pay residents near the 
fernald plant 73 million to settle a suit over claims they have 
been harmed by toxic releases 
meanwhile the department announced monday that it had reached 
agreement with westinghouse electric corp in setting a schedule 
for restarting production reactors at savannah river the countrys 
largest nuclear weapons plant 
department officials declined comment on a report in the new 
york times that westinghouse which operates the plant had 
estimated the cost of repairing and restarting the three reactors 
at as much as 166 billion or more than four times what had been 
previously estimated 
according to the times the higher cost estimates were provided 
june 26 in a confidential report from westinghouse to the 
department one department source said watkins rejected the 
proposal because of its high cost estimate and proposed restart 
schedule

rubber duckies are no fun a department 
of environmental management official said tuesday 
the dem outlawed plastic ducks in rhode island waterways after a 
race in warwick sent 7000 toy ducks floating down the pawtuxet 
river 
the warwick rotary club which sponsored the contest to call 
attention to pollution in the river charged spectators 3 to enter 
a 3inch pink or yellow plastic duck in a onemile race 
this is not a good idea for a lot of environmental reasons 
stephanie powell of the dems division of groundwater and 
freshwater wetlands said tuesday 
if you have thousands of pieces of plastic being dumped into a 
river theres no way theyre going to be picked up a lot of these 
plastics would end up on the riverbanks in the marshes 
powell also said the plastic ducks do not break down and could 
endanger marine life 
but jack frazier rotary club president said volunteers picked 
up the ducks and all but four or five were accounted for 
the dem has not received any complaints powell said 
the race raised 11500 for the rotary clubs environmental 
fund which goes to local environmental groups rotary officials 
said 
the real lucky duck was tom defelice of warwick who won a 
vacation for four at disney world in florida after his duck crossed 
the finish line first in 5115

an auditors report released tuesday says the 
government could save 21 million a year if it would just 
acknowledge what any schoolchild knows that people turn a year 
older on their birthdays 
the birthday debate centers on the social security act which 
follows old english common law in judging that people reach a new 
age on the day before their birthdays 
health and human services inspector general richard p kusserow 
said that because the start and end of some benefits is determined 
by age attainment the oldfashioned definition skews who gets 
what when 
for example people normally are eligible for full retirement 
and medicare benefits in the month that they turn 65 but benefits 
start a month earlier for people born on the first of the month 
an the other hand benefits for children of disabled or deceased 
workers normally run through the month in which they turn 18 but 
end a month earlier for youth born on the first 
kusserow in a report to the social security administration and 
health care financing administration stated the obvious the 
popular understanding is that an individual attains a given age on

a senate committee on tuesday approved 
president bushs three nominees for the federal communications 
commission clearing the way for expected speedy confirmation by 
the full senate 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee voted 
152 to approve the nominations of 
alfred c sikes assistant secretary of commerce for 
communications and information bush has selected sikes to become 
chairman of the fivemember commission 
sherrie p marshall a washington attorney and former 
legislative aide to outgoing fcc chairman dennis r patrick 
andrew c barrett a member of the illinois commerce commission 
committee chairman sen ernest f hollings dsc said he 
expected the full senate to vote on the nominations before the 
august congressional recess which is scheduled to begin friday 
they were expected to be confirmed easily 
the only committee opposition to the nominees came from 
democrats albert gore jr of tennessee and jay rockefeller of west 
virginia 
gore said he was sending a symbolic signal to the white 
house that he didnt believe the new fcc would be an improvement on 
eight years of marketissupreme deregulation during the reagan 
administration 
i dont think what the fcc has been doing is in the public 
interest said gore who at a confirmation hearing monday had 
challenged the nominees on what they planned to do about indecent 
programming 
gore whose wife tipper has led a grassroots campaign against 
violent and suggestive lyrics in rock music on tuesday reiterated 
his displeasure with barretts assertion that much like illegal 
drugs are commonplace in society a market also exists for indecent 
radio and tv shows 
barrett said the fccs role was to decide what the law will 
allow us to tolerate 
there has been an attitude at the fcc that whatever the market 
is we are going to accept it gore said tuesday i hope they 
will if confirmed not continue what theyve been doing over at 
the fcc 
the only outside opposition to the nominations has been from 
antiindecency groups who think the fcc hasnt been tough enough on 
broadcast smut and that bush didnt seek out nominees who were more 
likely to take a hard line against indecency 
hollings gore and others hit hard on tv indecency noting that 
until congress stepped in to ban all indecent tv programs in 1988 
the fcc had established a safe harbor for such shows from 
midnight to 6 am when children were presumed not to be watching 
sikes a former missouri broadcaster and selfdescribed 
moderate said he would vigorously attack obscene material on the 
airwaves but that the supreme court has proscribed much of 
congress power in the area of free speech and indecency 
the fcc last year tried to implement the 24hour ban on indecent 
programming but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged it 
on constitutional grounds a federal appeals court in january 
stayed imposition of the law 
hollings and other committee members expressed hope that 
relations between the fcc and congress would improve after lengthy 
battles with a commission headed by patrick and his predecessor 
mark s fowler 
major issues the new commission will face include the government 
role in fostering international competitiveness in areas such as 
highdefinition television further deregulation of the telephone 
industry reregulating cable television and assignment of the 
airwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephones and 
direct broadcast satellites

iran has been trying to distance itself 
from the threats by proiranian groups in lebanon to murder western 
hostages 
at the same time however it has vowed retaliation for the 
abduction of a shiite moslem cleric by israeli commandos 
irans leaders did not react immediately to the killing of lt 
col william r higgins who was kidnapped in 1988 while serving as 
part of a united nations peacekeeping force in lebanon a 
proiranian islamic group said it hanged higgins on monday because 
israel had failed to release sheik abdulkarim obeid who was 
abducted friday 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati said before higgins 
killing was announced that the threat against higgins has nothing 
to do with us however we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death 
threat 
on sunday however interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi said 
in tehran that islamic groups around the world would retaliate for 
israels abduction of obeid and two companions 
the islamic clergy and militant groups throughout the 
world will take action against the interests of israel and the 
united states they will not allow them to live comfortably 
mohtashemi said 
denouncing the media coverage of higgins killing the abrar 
daily newspaper said the trumpets of human rights were not blown 
at all when the zionist thieves trespassed lebanese territory and 
shamelessly kidnapped a human being 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus quoted 
the newspaper as saying higgins death was no more depressing 
than the daily killings by israeli soldiers of palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
with the death of an american colonel the banner of human 
rights is once again being raised just because a blueeyed 
american has died 
israel said obeid had been involved in planning attacks on 
israel and offered to trade him for three israeli soldiers held in 
southern lebanon as well as the western hostages 
all the groups holding hostages in lebanon are believed linked 
to the iraniansupported hezbollah or party of god but hezbollah 
denies it has anything to do with hostagetaking 
iranian media which condone the actions of the lebanese shiite 
groups carried reports of higgins killing from western news 
agencies 
hashemi rafsanjani irans presidentelect is believed to want 
to erase irans image as a sponsor of international terrorism 
the 1979 fundamentalist revolution of ayatollah ruholla 
khomeini who died june 3 helped spawn various shiite terrorist 
groups in lebanon revolutionary guards sent into lebanon during 
the 1982 israeli invasion helped organize hezbollah 
rafsanjani himself was criticized by the west this year when he 
called for the death of five americans or europeans for every 
palestinian killed in the occupied territories by israeli soldiers 
before higgins abduction rafsanjani was quoted by an iranian 
newspaper as saying that oppressed groups had no choice but to 
take hostages

it is an oftenrepeated tale in 
addis ababa two white children were kidnapped or abandoned 20 
years ago when the boy was about 5 years old and the girl but an 
infant and raised in a tribal family 
the years have provided different variations on the story and 
though many here know some version there are no records to 
substantiate it 
now however a brother and sister have stepped forward 
claiming to be those lost children they say they want to find 
their parents 
on june 23 a cable arrived at the state department in 
washington from the us embassy in ethiopias capitol it began 
on june 14 two oromignaspeaking caucasians visited consular 
officer conoff claiming to be the longrumored kidnapped americans 
of 20 years ago 
after i sent the cable i called washington to assure them i 
wasnt making this up on a slow day in addis said carol l rose 
who retired this week as the us consul in ethiopia i was 
afraid the desk officer wouldnt believe it its all just too 
fantastic 
mrs roses 2page cable told the story of haile mariam gadessa 
and tegest gadessa as they recounted it through an embassy 
interpreter and later repeated it to the associated press 
haile mariam now 24 or 25 and miss tegest about 20 speak 
haltingly and nervously about their story in the presence of what 
to them are strange white foreigners 
what little they know was told them by the native couple who 
raised them haile mariam has only the vaguest memory of those 
days miss tegest none at all 
they tell of being left by their parents in the care of a 
housekeeper a man of the oromo tribe who took them to live with 
his relatives in a house of mud with a thatched roof 
haile mariam said he was was raised as a herdsboy keeping the 
familys cattle sheep and goats while miss tegest was given to 
another family as a maid 
his eyes downcast and haunted haile mariam tells of frequent 
beatings by a foster father who never wanted them of being taunted 
and abused by villagers who saw him and his sister as freaks 
his gnarled hands speak of a lifetime of hard work he has never 
spent a day in a classroom his sister has completed eight years of 
school 
they said they are not sure why they were left with the 
housekeeper but haile mariam thinks their father became ill and 
was flown out of ethiopia for treatment accompanied by their 
mother 
they said the housekeeper took them to live with his sister and 
brotherinlaw in chaborgurage a region about 50 miles west of 
addis ababa whether or not that was meant to be temporary it 
became permanent after the housekeeper was bitten by a rabid dog 
and died 
after he died they the foster parents were afraid they 
would get in trouble if they went to ethiopian authorities haile 
mariam said 
ive been hearing this legend almost from the day i arrived 22 
months ago said mrs rose all of the embassys ethiopian 
employes know it 
so too do many other ethiopians some speak of the children 
being taken by a gang of oromos others say the mother died of 
a stroke shortly after they were abducted and the father has come 
back many times looking for them 
the mystery is that we have no record of the parents asking 
the embassy for help in finding the children and neither does 
anyone else said mrs rose 
the consulate checked its own records back more than 20 years 
and asked the state department the defense department the 
canadian and all european embassies to do the same all came up 
blank 
all we have is the legend said mrs rose no records 
just the story 
but she has a theory 
back in the 60s i was one of those backpacking around the 
world on 50 cents a day she said if you got in trouble the 
last place you went was to the us embassy 
mrs rose referred to a time when many americans did not trust 
their own government the days of assassinations the vietnam war 
and turmoil in the streets 
if the parents were civilians who chose not to seek help from 
the us embassy why didnt they go to local authorities for 
assistance 
the children disappeared in the last years of the long reign of 
emperor haile selassie when the us community in ethiopia 
numbered more than 20000 many of them in the military 
in 1974 ethiopia was convulsed by a bloody revolution that 
brought a marxist government to power and many records were lost 
or destroyed 
mrs rose hired abebe worke one of ethiopias most 
distinguished lawyers and a former member of the countrys high 
court to investigate 
she also notified the ethiopian foreign ministry which turned 
the matter over to the ministry of internal affairs neither worke 
nor the ministry has turned up any trace of the parents 
a search of newspaper records by the associated press found no 
mention of the disappearance 
the absence of records suggests that the father was a military 
man who had the children with an ethiopian woman then abandoned 
her and them 
under those circumstances in this society the woman most 
certainly would have tried to place the children with relatives 
said worke the stigma of raising them alone would have been too 
great 
while mrs rose admits that scenario is possible she doesnt 
believe it her cable to the state department said consular 
officials were convinced the two are telling the truth as they 
know it their skin is scarred from sunburn and the scarring 
has caused some distortion of their facial features they both have 
light brown eyes and curly light browndark blond hair 
their skin is not brown or black but bronze adds gustavo 
delgado an embassy political officer i think they are as white 
as the porcelain on your kitchen sink 
with no record of their birth or nationality there is little 
that mrs rose and the us government can do for haile mariam and 
tegest 
as the search continues for their parents they live together in 
a mud hut in the village of sebeta about 25 miles from addis ababa 
there miss tegest cares for her 3yearold son astoy born out 
of wedlock while haile mariam supports them with odd jobs earning 
about 15 ethiopian birr a month the equivalent of 8 
and they recall the distant past 
i have a memory it is almost like a dream very indistinct 
haile mariam says it is of my mother she is very tall and 
white and we lived in a house made of bricks

a service station owner is facing six 
months probation for violating an ordinance with a portable sign 
advertising 10 percent discounts to those whom jesus loves 
escambia county judge james roark told jerry harrison 46 he 
would lift the probation imposed after a jury verdict monday if 
he complies with the sign ordinance within 30 days roark also 
ordered him to pay 430 in court costs 
harrison who says he is a bornagain christian and reformed 
drug and alcohol abuser said he was doing gods will by 
offering the discounts on labor advertised on a 4by8foot 
portable sign 
officials said they objdcted to the medium rather than the 
message 
harrison was charged with violating an ordinance against 
portable signs passed to reduce visual clutter and safety hazards 
i thought the judge was very fair said harrison who 
claimed he gives the discount to all customers because jesus loves 
everyone he said he wants to find a way to keep the sign but will 
remove it if he cannot meet requirements 
exxon officials were unable to force him to remove the sign in 
1987 after members of the jewish community complained about it but 
he changed the message initially the sign stated the discount was 
available only to christians

technical experts of the nuclear regulatory 
commission told the energy department on tuesday it should delay 
sinking two experimental shafts at a proposed highlevel nuclear 
waste dump in nevada until further study of problems including 
possible earthquakes and volcanic eruptions 
in comments on the departments site characterization plan for 
the proposed yucca mountain repository the nrc staff said the 
department had erred by treating the shafts as though they were 
merely test drilling and would not be part of the dump if it is 
established 
robert bernero chief of waste disposal for the nrc said the 
shafts would be the first major holes to be dug into the yucca 
mountain formation 
if the dump is established he said they would probably be used 
either for ventilation or as an alternative form of access the 
main access route through which radioactive waste would be brought 
into the dump would be a ramp 
congress has ordered the department to study whether the yucca 
mountain location about 100 miles northwest of las vegas nev 
could safely store tons of radioactive nuclear waste for 10000 
years 
bernero said consideration of a possible license for the dump is 
not expected until about 1995 
the location is opposed on health and public safety grounds by 
the state of nevada whose legislature has passed a law prohibiting 
a highlevel nuclear waste dump within its boundaries 
in a briefing at the nrcs rockville md headquarters and in a 
letter to sam rousso acting director of civilian radioactive waste 
management for the energy department bernero said study of seismic 
and volcanic risks needed to be given high priority 
if you stand on yucca mountain and look to the west across 
crater flats you can see a number of volcano cones 10 or 12 miles 
away he told reporters they raise questions obviously 
that another volcano might go off and it does go off that it 
might go off in or through the repository 
bernero also said there is a body of data that suggests the 
presence of a fault that would go right through where the shafts 
are 
in our analysis it is doubtful he said its not 
certainly there or its not certainly not there it should be part 
of the design process to determine whether there is faulting and 
if so its significance 
bernero said the latest plan submitted by the department on 
dec 28 contained substantial improvements over the original 
one of jan 8 1988 
however we do have a range of technical concerns 
we have asked doe to give much greater care to the design 
control process and the analysis for these experimental shafts 
he said 
he said nrc and department officials met july 6 and 7 and agreed 
to work together this summer and fall so the issues can be 
resolved before the shafts are sunk 
he said agreements were also reached to improve quality 
assurance plans for auditing the performance of contractors 
in his letter to rousso bernero said nrc has a broad 
programmatic concern that the pressure to meet unrealistic schedule 
milestones may leave doe insufficient time to plan and to execute 
proper technical informationgathering activities 
high priority should be given to conducting those 
investigations which can lead to a determination of whether the 
site is subject to an unacceptably high probability of disruption 
as a result of volcanism faulting or seismicity bernero said

a yearold state law allowing crime 
victims to speak at sentencing hearings is bringing humanity into 
the legal system backers say 
the law patterned after similar measures in michigan and 
california gives victims a maximum opportunity to participate 
said fran sepler executive director of the state crime victim and 
witness advisory council the council pushed for whats known as 
the righttoallocution law 
allocution is sort of the cadillac of victims rights said 
sepler adding that other states are considering such laws 
everything i hear from people in the the criminal justice 
process is that the law is working well and its being handled in a 
way thats not disruptive of the criminal justice system said 
state sen richard cohen an author of the measure 
its allowed victims who are often given short shrift in the 
process to have more of an opportunity to be a part of whats 
taking place said cohen they will have the satisfication of 
the sentencing judge knowing exactly how they feel and what has 
happened to them 
since a guilty plea may leave a victim no opportunity to testify 
at trial this is the only absolute guarantee that the victim of 
a crime has access to a judge in a case he said 
sepler said she made a telephone check of 10 counties about six 
months after the law took effect use of the right ranged from an 
estimate of 40 percent to 60 percent in st louis county in 
northeastern minnesota to only seven or eight times in hennepin 
county which has nearly 1 million residents and almost onefourth 
of the states population 
in california where voters approved allocution in 1982 two 
surveys released last year of judges and district attorneys 
indicated that fewer than 5 percent of felony crime victims made 
statements at sentencing hearings the reasons cited were that 
victims felt they could have little impact they had already had 
satisfactory involvement or they were afraid 
in michigan very few take advantage of actually speaking 
said circuit court judge michael harrison 
however in at least half the crimes where there is an 
identifiable victim harrison said they submit a statement that 
state sentencing guidelines require judges to consider michigans 
crime victims rights law has been in effect since july 1985 
sepler said mothers against drunk driving is advising members to 
speak at sentencings 
the feedback i get from judges is that they find these 
statements very difficult to listen to extremely painful that it 
injects an element of humanity into the courtroom that is 
otherwise not there she said 
while there may not be substantial changes in sentencing 
the victim impact statements are important considerations for them 
as they determine things like mitigating and aggravating factors 
said sepler 
the most publicized use of the new law came in may when more 
than 300 people attended a hearing in suburban inver grove heights 
in the case of four teenagers who vandalized a high school 
resulting water damage and asbestos removal costs amounted to 
millions of dollars 
about 30 people testified during the orderly hearing in a 
college auditorium district judge william thuet one of two judges 
who gave students faculty staff and taxpayers standing as 
victims said the four teenagers probably got more lenient 
sentences none more than a year in jail because members of the 
public were all asking that we be compassionate with these guys 
one measure of the success of the new law said sepler is that 
the dire consequences predicted by opponents havent happened 
opponents felt that only those individuals who are articulate 
educated and welloff would use it and that it would be a step 
backwards in jurisprudence she said 
and we would have irresponsible sentencing practices and 
judges unable to dismiss irrelevant testimony and appeals based on 
these statements she added that has not in any way shape or 
form come to be

american military personnel stationed overseas 
will be counted in the 1990 census but the house on tuesday 
blocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens 
the decision to include military personnel in the count was 
announced by the commerce department at the start of a hearing on a 
bill to require the action 
according to tuesdays announcement the census bureau will work 
with the pentagon to count the 12 million to 16 million military 
and civilian defense department workers overseas 
at the same time the sometimes emotional debate over leaving out 
undocumented aliens was under way both in committee and on the 
house floor where rep tom ridge rpa failed in an effort to 
attach the ban to an appropriations measure 
his amendment was offered to a 58 billion appropriation bill 
for running the state justice and commerce departments next year 
including 800 million for carrying out the 1990 census the bill 
was approved by a vote of 258 to 165 and sent to the senate 
the dispute cuts close to home for the 435 house members since 
the census count will be used to redistribute house seats among the 
states states which have grown in population will get more seats 
others will lose them 
many northern states already facing losses because of 
population shifts to the south and west fear additional gains by 
the sun belt states and large urban centers because of the 
settlement of illegal aliens in those areas 
hence ridges amendment rejected after extensive parliamentary 
maneuvering 
opponents pointed out that the constitution specifically 
requires house seats to be apportioned based on all the persons 
residing in a state 
every census since the constitution was created has counted 
all residents of the states both citizens and noncitizens 
observed rep don edwards dcalif 
congress is empowered to identify those to be counted in the 
census responded ridge 
the count scheduled for april 1 1990 will cost 4 billion 
said ridge asserting that the census bureau has the money to 
identify and separate out illegal aliens but doesnt want to 
rep william f goodling rpa contended that at the time the 
constitution was written there were no illegal aliens all new 
arrivals were welcome 
rep marvyn dymally dcalif countered that there have always 
been undocumenmted aliens in this country the difference is that 
in the early days they came from europe 
the debate dymally said is really over the fact that 
population shifts will lead house seats to southern and western 
states and that undocumented aliens are being blamed 
pennsylvania i dont care what they do unless they go down 
to the southwest and bring the people back theyre going to lose a 
seat said dymally 
rep tim valentine dnc however said he cannot understand 
why illegal aliens should be allowed to dilute the representation 
of us citizens 
counting illegal aliens is not fair it may be constitutional 
but its just not right said valentine 
the question is how are we going to identify those that are 
here illegally that are not entitled to representation in this 
body said rep james slattery dkan that will be tough to do 
the least we should so is to make that extraordinary effort 
youre now asking the bureau of the census to be judge and 
jury in determining who should be counted responded rep robert 
garcia dny 
the questions of counting undocumented aliens and overseas 
military personnal have been tied together in many debates with 
the question raised of the fairness of including illegal aliens but 
not american servicemen and servicewomen in the figures used for 
apportionment 
in the past service members overseas generally have not been 
included in census counts used to apportion seats in the house of 
representatives 
that is because census officials considered it impossible to 
determine accurately in which state an individual should be 
counted many military people move often 
the census bureau said it will investigate ways to make that 
judgment in the 1990 census possibilities include listing a 
service persons last state of residence for more than six months 
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country 
census officials have generally opposed any attempt to delete 
illegal aliens contending that they have no method of determining 
who is in the country legally asking people about their status 
would likely result in people lying or refusing to participate in 
the count officials say resulting in a potential undercount of 
residents in many areas

the democraticcontrolled senate judiciary 
committee on a pair of 77 tie votes today killed william lucas 
nomination to be the nations top civil rights enforcer 
attorney general dick thornburgh blamed the rejection on raw 
politics but administration officials said they would not seek 
to overturn the committees decision on the floor of the senate 
the committee first deadlocked 77 on a motion to approve the 
nomination leaving lucas one vote short of the majority he needed 
on an identical vote the panel then rejected a republican move to 
send the nomination to the floor without recommendation 
all six committee republicans and democrat dennis deconcini of 
arizona voted in favor of lucas a black democratturnedrepublican 
who served as wayne county sheriff in michigan all the no votes 
were cast by democrats 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
committees action is very disappointing to the president we 
felt he lucas deserved better treatment and he deserved that 
position 
in terms of where we go from here were now exploring our 
options fitzwater added 
the committees action was a stinging defeat for president bush 
who said last week he supported lucas 100 percent and was 
convinced that much not all that much of the criticism of him 
is pure american politics 
but sen howell heflin dala a conservative southerner who 
cast a critical vote against lucas said hes lacking in 
experience and qualifications his managerial accomplishments are 
debatable 
minority leader bob dole rkan said on the senate floor that 
he had urged bush to make a socalled recess appointment under 
which lucas could serve in the post for a number of months without 
being confirmed 
bush could make such an appointment as soon as congress 
recesses scheduled for the end of the week if they will not 
give him the simple chance to make his case then the president of 
the united states should do so with a recess appointment dole 
said 
asked about doles suggestion fitzwater said no decisions 
have been madeabout either mr lucas future or how we might 
approach the job at the justice department 
lucas was opposed by many civil rights groups who said he was 
not a strong enough advocate for affirmative action and other 
traditional civil rights concerns 
he told the committee it was too early to evaluate recent 
supreme court decisions narrowing the scope of civil rights laws on 
job bias minority setasides and other issues he also declined 
invitations from senators to express concern about the direction 
the country is taking in civil rights matters 
justice department spokesman david runkel conceded defeat for 
the nomination and said the agency had no other candidates as of 
today 
lucas had no immediate comment runkel said he would continue to 
work at the justice department as a 28450perday consultant 
until he completes an analysis of the departments role in 
enforcing civil rights the contract is up march 20 1990 
as a result of raw politics a man who has demonstrated his 
ability over a 40year time span as a social worker police 
officer an fbi agent a sheriff and a county government leader to 
make a difference for the benefit of many americans has been denied 
the opportunity to continue to serve thornburgh said 
republicans compared the committees rejection of lucas to the 
senates refusal to confirm robert bork for the us supreme court 
sen strom thurmond rsc accused critics of refusing to give 
this black man a chance 
hes a minority of course years ago minorities didnt have a 
chance i know said thurmond who was one of the senates most 
implacable opponents of civil rights in the era of racial 
segregation 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
thurmonds accusation amounted to a cynical setup because most 
of the critics were supporters of civil rights and were concerned 
mainly about lucas qualifications 
it seems to me that bill lucas has failed miserably to prove 
that he has some knowledge to compensate for his lack of 
experience biden said 
after the committee rejected confirmation thurmond moved to 
send the nomination to the floor without any recommendation but 
that was blocked on an identical 77 vote 
sen arlen specter rpa was the last republican to fall into 
line behind lucas telling a news conference last week that its 
more important to have someone who understands supreme court 
decisions from personal experience knows it so to speak in his 
gut as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the commas 
and semicolons 
civil rights groups have campaigned against lucas saying he 
lacks experience committee republicans contend that the 
61yearold black nominee would apply the lessons he learned in his 
rise from dishwasher to fbi agent to wayne county mich sheriff 
and county executive 
lucas also came under fire for failing to declare 8884 worth 
of goods to us customs following an asian trip not making 
courtordered jail improvements when he was wayne county sheriff 
and for inaccuracies on an application for admission to the new 
york bar critics also accused him of a conflict of interest 
involving a county building project and cited court findings that 
he was lax in investigating police brutality charges 
on the customs matter lucas said he was not aware the goods 
were in his familys luggage he said he did his best on jail 
improvements and ultimately was responsible for a new jail he said 
he saw no conflict of interest on the county building project and 
investigated the police brutality charges as soon as he found out 
about them 
the panel had scheduled a vote for last thursday but delayed 
action after heflin said he wanted more time to look into new 
allegations the nature of those allegations was unknown 
sens paul simon dill and howard m metzenbaum dohio had 
said they would oppose lucas 
for assistant attorney general for civil rights i just think 
that we need a strong voice who will speak out for civil rights and 
i dont hear that coming from bill lucas simon said 
his supporters including the rev joseph lowery of the southern 
christian leadership conference said there was no practical way 
for him to oppose bush administration policy which holds that it 
will take time to assess the impact of the supreme court decisions 
simon and other lawmakers however said lucas appeared to lack 
sufficient zeal for civil rights

a former japanese soldier said tuesday that 
antiaircraft gunners fired blank shells at us bombers in the 
final months of world war ii so civilians wouldnt realize 
ammunition was running out 
kiyoshi tsujibayashi said about one out of every four shells 
fired by his regiment which manned antiaircraft guns protecting 
southern osaka was a blank 
tsujibayashi who was a lance corporal said soldiers were 
secretly ordered to fire the blanks which contained only a small 
amount of gunpowder beginning in june 1945 to maintain civilian 
morale and avoid criticism that the military was not doing enough 
to defend the people the war ended in august 
even when ammunition was available for the regiments 48 guns 
the shells were unable to reach the height at which the american 
b29 bombers were flying tsujibayashi said in a telephone 
interview 
tsujibayashi the owner of a supermarket near osaka said his 
regiment was told in march 1945 to avoid useless firing to conserve 
dwindling ammunition 
as the us bombings intensified we were told to use the 
blanks to avoid criticism from the public that we werent doing our 
job he said 
tsujibayashi 63 said he decided to share his story to let 
others know about the actual situation during the war 
defense officials were not available for comment on the report

the extremists in a statement monday for a verdict on cicippio the 
statement was accompanied by an authenticating snapshot of another 
us hostage author edward austin tracy also held by the group 
also today a deadline set by kidnappers for a british hostage 
anglican church envoy terry waite passed with no immediate word 
from his captors 
the reported hanging of marine lt col william r higgins and 
the threat today against cicippio presented president bush with his

conference at the press center in east beiruts jedeideh area 
she read out a message to her husband joe i know the 
difficulty of the situation in which we are but all i ask you is to 
keep your hopes high 
on monday the proiranian shiite group that abducted higgins 
the organization of the oppressed on earth released a videotape of 
a man they said was higgins dangling from a gallows 
higgins commanded a group of un truce observers in south 
lebanon when he was seized feb 17 1988 
the revolutionary justice organization had issued a statement 
monday saying it would announce the hour of cicippios 
execution if sheik abdulkarim obeid was not freed by 6 pm 
today 11 am edt the reprieve announced later today apparently 
extends the deadline to 6 pm thursday 
israel has refused to release obeid and two companions captured 
with him jerusalem has said it would swap him and other shiite 
moslem prisoners for three israeli soldiers and other foreigners 
held hostage in lebanon 
today the proiranian hezbollah rejected the offer and said 
israel and the united states were responsible for any retaliation 
against western hostages taken by islamic groups 
the only acceptable thing to us is that sheik abdul karim 
obeid and his two colleagues be released said a statement by 
hezbollah or party of god 
the cleric is a spiritual leader of hezbollah the organization 
believed to be an umbrella group for the kidnappers of higgins and 
the 16 other westerners missing in lebanon eight of the 16 are 
americans

this morning an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
oppressed on earth said in a call to a beirut radio station that 
waite would be killed by midnight 5 pm edt unless israel frees 
obeid 
there was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat 
made to the moslemcontrolled voice of the nation 
in nicosia cyprus an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
the group told the associated press on monday that the group would 
kill waite at 3 pm 8 am edt today but the deadline passed

of foreign hostages after leaving his west beirut hotel to 
negotiate with islamic jihad he is believed held by islamic jihad 
though no group has claimed responsibility 
higgins reported hanging was clouded by doubt because of 
previous reports he may have been killed months ago and lebanese 
police said they could not confirm the claimed higgins killing on 
monday nevertheless the claim and the videotape that accompanied 
it met with revulsion worldwide 
bush condemned the reported killing of the us marine and 
called on all parties holding hostages in the middle east to 
release them he cut short a twoday western trip and met with top 
advisers in washington and an administration source said officials 
were considering how to respond

lawmakers said the white house made clear the united states had 
been kept in the dark about israels plan to kidnap obeid 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir today suggested 
israel was conducting negotiations with shiite groups to obtain the 
release of israeli prisoners and western hostages 
asked whether israeli was engaged in contacts with shiite groups 
in lebanon shamir told reporters there are permanent contacts 
with various factors about the release of the hostages 
israeli sources said the decision to abduct obeid had triggered 
deep divisions in the government shamir defended the abduction 
saying it was made to help free israeli and western hostages in 
lebanon 
in iran foreign minister ali akbar velayati said before the 
reported hanging that his country condemns any kind of kidnapping 
or death threat 
israeli fighter jets swooped over strongholds of the shiite 
fundamentalists in lebanon at daybreak today drawing gunfire from 
hezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of baalbek police said

president bush today weighed us options for 
responding to the reported hanging of marine lt col william 
higgins by his lebanese kidnappers and military action is in the 
realm of the possible an administration source said 
officials emphasized however that bush had not decided on a 
course of action and one source said that both a potential hostage 
rescue operation and a military strike were not attractive 
options 
administration officials said diplomatic contacts were under way 
in the meantime 
white house officials said they were still trying to gather the 
facts we still cannot offer any confirmation of his death or the 
circumstances surrounding it said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bush met for 90 minutes with secretary of state james a baker 
iii and other top administration officials to review the 
intelligence from lebanon this session was primarily 
informational fitzwater said 
he emphasized the white house was going about other business as 
well and bush still planned to host a barbecue for members of 
congress this evening 
we do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere the spokesman 
said 
fitzwater said the united states was in contact with all 
countries in the region but there was no direct communication with 
iran which backs moslem militants believed to have seized higgins 
in february 1988 
at the state department however spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states has sent messages to iran through 
established channels 
the message also sent to other countries is that there can 
be no excuse for the killings of our hostages ms tutwiler said 
this is outrageous behavior it is uncivilized it excludes who 
take this action or support it from the community of civilized 
nations 
other officials said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
was asked by baker during a meeting in paris on monday to convey 
us concerns to iranian authorities when her visits tehran this 
week 
fitzwater reiterated bushs call on all parties to release 
hostages asked if the united states regarded sheik abdul karim 
obeid a shiite muslim cleric seized in lebanon by israel as a 
hostage or a prisoner the spokesman said i dont want to 
dictate any political terms for political purposes its pretty 
clear he was kidnapped 
asked about reports that terrorists have delayed by 48 hours 
their threat to kill another american hostage joseph james 
cicippio fitzwater said we feel there should be no deadlines 
there should be no hostages 
bush on monday issued an urgent call to all all parties who 
hold hostages in the middle east to release them forthwith as a 
humanitarian gesture to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in 
that region 
one us official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
said there was still no final confirmation that higgins was the 
person seen hanging in the videotape released by the shiite moslem 
kidnappers 
the official said nothing has been ruled out in retaliation 
for the reported execution of the 44yearold higgins who was 
assigned to a united nations peacekeeping force 
as for the possibility of military action the source said 
its in the realm of the possible 
no one is tilted in that direction its on the menu no ones 
ordered it were not leaning necessarily toward anything 
said the official people are discussing the options we are not 
at the specific choosing stage 
presidential assistant stephen m studdert said bush was 
concerned that every military option for example has with it 
the possibility that those sites may be a place where american or 
in the case of terry waite british hostages are held 
he said chief of staff john sununu discussed the constraints 
of military options at some length in a staff meeting 
a source described the president as outraged incensed but 
cognizant of the limitations on his options and the need to be 
responsible he doesnt believe you should fight terror with 
terror 
the reported execution of higgins touched off the first foreign 
policy crisis of the bush administration it also led the president 
to criticize israels abduction of a shiite moslem cleric from 
lebanon on friday higgins kidnappers cited the israeli action in 
announcing the americans execution by hanging 
on friday i said that the taking of any hostage was not 
helpful to the middle east peace process the brutal and tragic 
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement 
bush said monday night 
israel today welcomed bushs call for release of the hostages 
and said its offer to swap the cleric sheik abdul karim obeid for 
western hostages and israeli captives still stands 
an israeli embassy spokesman david peleg said today that 
israel carried out the abduction only after we reached the 
conclusion that all other means had failed to gain the release of 
our hostages not the americans 
administration officials said ambassador william brown met with 
a top israeli official early today to discuss the situation 
meanwhile former hostage david jacobsen told cbs news and the 
los angeles times that the abduction of obeid may have destroyed 
chances for the release of associated press correspondent terry 
anderson the longestheld of the eight current american hostages 
all the reports were that terry anderson was to be released 
last saturday night and because of the kidnapping of the sheik 
that obviously was postpned jacobsen told cbs today 
observers in washington and the middle east and andersons 
sister peggy say they had not heard any such report 
bush cut short a twoday western trip on monday and returned to 
washington after learning that higgins captors had released a 
videotape they said showed his execution the president met with 
his top advisers before briefing congressional leaders monday night 
while bush publicly said he had no independent confirmation of 
higgins death senate republican leader bob dole said the 
president told the lawmakers that its about a 98 percent 
probability that higgins had indeed been killed 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
said bush was considering several options to respond to 
higgins death but like other lawmakers at monday nights meeting 
he declined to identify them 
earlier dole rkan had criticized israel for its role in 
touching off the crisis declaring that israel launched the 
commando raid to abduct obeid without forewarning the united 
states dole said perhaps a little more responsibility on behalf 
of the israelis would be refreshing 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said without 
elaborating its fair to say that many people do share the 
senators concerns 
israeli officials rejected criticism of their commando raid 
saying obeid had helped plan and carry out several terrorist 
operations including higgins kidnapping in february 1988 rep 
charles schumer dny said blaming israel for higgins death 
would be turning the world on its head 
one administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said us officials had more meetings planned on the crisis and it 
was premature to say bush had ruled out military retaliation or 
rescue missions 
the white house made clear to congressional leaders that the 
united states had been kept in the dark about israels plan to 
kidnap obeid on friday according to one lawmaker who attended the 
briefing 
israel says obeid is a leader of a proiranian group that is 
holding foreign hostages in lebanon an israeli army spokesman said 
obeid admitted he was involved in higgins kidnapping

the nations governors concluded a harmonious 
fourday meeting today with a mildly worded resolution urging the 
government to reduce the deficit and protect domestic spending 
without raising taxes if possible 
during their annual meeting the governors also skirted abortion 
and other policy differences and were summoned to a meeting on 
education next month with president bush 
democratic and republican governors met separately over 
breakfast to discuss their parties prospects in the virginia and 
new jersey governors races this year and the outlook for the 36 
governorships up in 1990 
both groups met in private with democratic national chairman 
ron brown addressing his partys governors the democrats elected 
ohios richard celeste to be chairman of the democratic governors 
association beginning in january 
iowa republican terry branstad was installed as new chairman of 
the bipartisan national governors association and democrat booth 
gardner of washington was selected to serve as vice chairman to 
follow branstad as chairman in a year 
cbs anchorman dan rather spoke to the final full session of the 
national governors association conference saying you who 
already have the toughest job in american politics have got to take 
the lead in convincing the president and congress that the present 
approach to education policy is a mess and needs immediate 
overhaul and the present approach to the federal budget deficit is 
an alice in wonderland fantasy 
before heading home today the governors approved a series of 
policy statements including a cautiously worded one urging the 
government to reduce the deficit without raising taxes if 
possible while protecting key domestic spending 
the governors also approved a resolution urging congress and the 
bush administration to impose a twoyear moratorium on expanded 
medicaid coverage that the states would be required to pay for 
other policy matters under consideration included allowing 
students and parents to select public schools of their choice 
consistent with desegregation goals and tougher steps against 
drug smuggling including requiring cooperation in antidrug 
efforts for countries to receive us foreign aid 
some of the governors headed home early skipping the last 
session one was idaho gov cecil andrus who said he needed to 
deal with forest fires that have become totally out of control 
bush whose appearance at the conference was overshadowed monday 
by the reported hanging of marine lt col william higgins by 
proiranian captors in lebanon invited the governors to meet with 
him in late september for a summit meeting on education the 
meeting at a site to be named later was a campaign promise of 
bush and was discussed by governors last spring 
democratic gov gerald baliles of virginia who was being 
replaced as chairman of the governors association by republican 
terry branstad of iowa said were impressed with the 
accessibility and indications of a cooperative attitude from bush 
democrat bill clinton of arkansas said the summit will keep 
education and childrelated issues on the public agenda 
but ohio gov richard celeste a democrat said bushs remarks 
were too little considering bushs campaign claim to be the 
education president he called the speech uninspired and 
uninspiring 
it lacked any real vision or any real voltage in terms of 
getting us moving now said celeste in one of the few public 
criticisms of the administration voiced at the conference 
celeste said the education meeting would discuss a dampening 
effect on state and local education initiatives created by the 
budget climate and bushs flat opposition to new taxes 
the presidents posture last year in the election really 
chilled efforts at education reform and education finance in many 
parts of this country celeste said the president is in a 
unique position to sound the trumpet and i didnt hear any brass 
this morning 
governors of both parties met in private over breakfast before 
bushs remarks and several governors said bipartisan concern was 
voiced over federal medicaid requirements that force states to 
spend more on health care without compensation from the federal 
government 
in a questionandanswer session with bush celeste asked the 
president to consider a twoyear moratorium on additional medicaid 
requirements which he later described as the fastest growing 
spending item in his state budget 
bush did not commit himself to such a moratorium but said id 
like to consider it and certainly were trying to hold the line on 
spiraling costs 
bush and his transportation secretary samuel skinner suggested 
they were sympathetic with the governors request that surplus 
federal transportation trust funds be released but made no 
promises of money the trust funds for highways and airport 
facilities contain up to 19 billion according to governors who 
contend much of that is being withheld from the states so it can 
count against the deficit in the federal budget 
it is important that we begin to spend the balances of the 
trust fund as soon as possible on mass transit highways and 
aviation infrastructure skinner said 
scientist carl sagan urged the governors to support steps to 
counter the environmental threats of ozone depletion and global 
warming including a ban on chlorofluorocarbons and increased use 
of alternative fuels chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals found in 
such products as coolants cleaning solvents and plastic food 
containers 
it is a problem thats extremely serious and will not be 
solved by business as usual said sagan

a group believed to represent proiranian 
kidnappers rejected israels offer to trade an abducted moslem 
cleric and the tuesday deadline for killing an american hostage 
was extended for two days 
the captors of joseph cicippio acknowledged a plea for mercy 
from his lebanese wife in announcing the 48hour postponement 
on monday after the group holding lt col william r higgins 
said he had been hanged cicippios kidnappers said he would be 
killed unless israel freed sheik abdul karim obeid by 6 pm 
tuesday 11 am edt the reprieve was announced two hours after 
the deadline 
also threatened with death is anglican church envoy terry waite 
50 a briton who disappared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel 
in moslem west beirut to negotiate for the release of american 
hostages there was no immediate word on his fate 
obeid is a spiritual leader of hezbollah or party of god the 
fundamentalist shiite moslem group believed to be an umbrella for 
hostage takers hezbollah also is said to have two of three israeli 
soldiers held prisoner in south lebanon 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel suggested tuesday that 
israel was conducting negotiations with proiranian shiite groups 
to win freedom for the soldiers and western hostages in a trade for 
obeid and other shiites 
cicippios lebanese wife ilham called a news conference 
tuesday and appealed to those holding her husband in these 
fateful minutes i appeal to all of you to spare no effort to give 
him a chance so he will be able to prove to you that he is 
innocent of all guilt 
her 58yearold husband was kidnapped sept 12 1986 he was 
acting comptroller of the american university of beirut 
in washington president bush weighed a response to the killing 
of higgins a 44yearold us marine officer on un duty in 
lebanon an administrative source said military action was in the 
realm of the possible but officials said it was not an 
attractive option 
israeli warplanes swooped over hezbollah strongholds in south 
lebanon at daybreak tuesday but did not attack groundtoair 
barrages from hezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of baalbek 
scored no hits police said 
on monday the revolutionary justice organization issued a 
statement in arabic accompanied by a photograph of cicippio 
saying a time would be set for his execution unless obeid was 
released by 6 pm tuesday 
it said at 815 pm 115 pm edt tuesday in a 13line 
handwritten statement in arabic delivered to the beirut newspaper 
annahar that the deadline had been postponed the statement was 
accompanied by an authenticating photo of edward austin tracy 
another american hostage held by the group 
the photograph showed tracy 58 from the waist up in the first 
picture of him released since march 8 he had white hair and a 
bushy white beard and wore a navy blue track suit 
due to the friendly appeals and sincere behests as well as 
some special factors and the moving plea by cicippios wife the 
revolutionary justice organization declares the unextendable 
postponement of the execution deadline by 48 hours only the 
statement said 
those concerned should realize that any other attempts to 
wrest a new postponement will be futile 
revolutionary justices original threat to cicippio arrived at 
annahar a few hours after a group calling itself the organization 
of the oppressed on earth said it had killed higgins it released a 
poorquality videotape showing a man who appeared to be the marine 
officer dangling from a scaffold 
when the tape was made could not be determined there have been 
reports higgins was killed months ago 
hezbollah declared tuesday as it has before that it has no 
connection with hostagetaking and said of the israeli offer 
the only acceptable thing to us is that sheik abdul karim obeid 
and his two colleagues be released 
the united states and israel jointly bear the responsibility 
for the kidnapping crime and the continuation of their detention 
they also bear the responsibility for every reaction from the sons 
of islam and the oppressed in lebanon and the world 
israeli commandos abducted obeid and two associates friday from 
the sheiks home in the southern lebanon village of jibchit 
the mainstream shiite militia amal hezbollahs rival has said 
it holds israeli airman ron arad captured after his plane crashed 
in south lebanon while on a bombing mission on oct 16 1986 
hezbollah is believed to hold two other israeli soldiers captured 
while on patrol in february 1986 
israel has said it would trade obeid and the other 5060 
lebanese shiites it holds for the three soldiers and western 
hostages held in lebanon who totaled 17 with higgins and include 
eight other americans 
higgins commanded a 75man un truce observer team when he was 
abducted feb 17 1988 in south lebanon 
marrack goulding un undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping 
left for lebanon on tuesday to try to recover the colonels body 
two anonymous telephone callers to news media in cyprus and 
beirut made the threats to waite the first deadline of 3 pm 8 
am edt tuesday passed and the second caller said it had been 
extended until midnight 5 pm edt 
shamirs spokesman in jerusalem hinted at indirect negotiations 
through through the red cross or some other intermediary in 
geneva the red cross denied involvement 
on monday night bush issued an urgent call to all all 
parties who hold hostages in the middle east to release them 
forthwith as a humanitarian gesture to begin to reverse the cycle 
of violence in that region 
in moscow the soviet foreign ministry said we resolutely 
denounce this inhuman action the fact that the aggravation of the 
situation in lebanon caused specifically by the abduction of 
shiite leader sheik obeid by israeli commandos has led to an 
escalation of acts of violence and terror and evokes profound 
concern 
the hezbollah statement said the trade outlined by israels 
defense minister yitzhak rabin was a stupid move that 
deserves only ridicule and disdain 
hezbollah said it had nothing to do with western hostages 
we see no comparison between zionist invaders captured on our 
land during a confrontation against the zionist occupation that 
mirrors the ugliest form of terrorim and the zionist abduction of a 
cleric while he was asleep at his home in his town inside lebanese 
territory hezbollah said in the statement which was telephoned 
to the associated press office in beirut 
israeli said obeid was involved in planning attacks on israel 
and had confessed to directing seizure of higgins 
aside from the americans the hostages in lebanon are four 
britons two west germans an irishman and an italian 
terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press is the longestheld hostage he was kidnapped

tuesday those holding the two west german relief workers had 
demanded the release of convicted hijacker mohammed ali hamadi and 
his brother abbas spokesman hansjuergen foerster said the 
demands were relayed to the west german embassy in beirut but did 
not say when or how 
a frenkfurt court sentenced mohammed hamadi to life in prison 
for murder and air piracy in the 1985 twa hijacking in which a us 
navy diver was killed and 33 americans were held hostage 17 days 
abbas hamadi is serving 13 years for helping kidnap two west 
germans in 1987 to try to get his brother freed the hostages later

an international conference agreed tuesday to send 
a factfinding mission to cambodia in what the french foreign 
minister called a great first step toward peace in the 
southeast asian nation 
with the promised pullout of vietnamese troops less than two 
months away the mission will gather information that would allow 
an international control mechanism to monitor the withdrawal and a 
ceasefire among combatants 
as members of 20 delegations were leaving the turnofcentury 
conference hall french foreign minister roland dumas told 
reporters unanimous agreement had been reached on a work program 
and structure for the monthlong meeting 
this constitutes a great first step forward on the path which 
should provide a return to peace in this country said dumas who 
is leading the conference with his indonesian counterpart ali 
alatas 
agreements authorizing the factfinding mission and setting out 
tasks for four working groups for the next month were set out in a 
fourpage document approved unanimously tuesday after hard 
bargaining 
the conference described as one of the most complex peace 
initiatives of recent times is trying to halt hostilities between 
a threeparty guerrilla cambodian coalition led by prince norodom 
sihanouk and the prohanoi government in cambodia 
it also is trying to prevent the return to power of the khmer 
rouge who are members of sihanouks coalition 
the khmer rouge turned cambodia into a vast slave labor camp in 
which hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of 
disease and hunger 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan reportedly made a number of 
objections on conference organization and procedure but then went 
along with the majority after chinese foreign minister qian qichen 
met with monday with him sihanouk and the third member of their 
loose alliance son sann 
in turn vietnam and the cambodian government of prime minister 
hun sen agreed to the factfinding mission under the auspices of 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar the two have 
opposed un involvement because the world body recognizes 
sihanouks coalition rather than hun sens government 
the delegates also agreed to set up four working commissions to 
deal with the international control mechanism international 
guarantees refugees and reconstruction and cambodias internal 
problems these commissions are to begin their work this week 
following three days of ministerlevel speeches and closeddoor 
debate 
the agreement on procedure reflects a convergence of political 
willto finally put an end to war conflict and immense suffering 
of the cambodian people alatas said 
despite the notes of optimism as the first phase of the 
conference ended crucial issues remained unresolved including the 
future role if any of the khmer rouge 
vietnam and hun sen are opposed to any khmer rouge role in a 
future government saying the guerrillas would only try to grab 
power and launch another murderous revolution 
no one wants to establish high expectations its going to be 
a lot of work in the next four weeks canadian foreign minister 
joe clark told reporters 
other conference participants doubted a comprehensive settlement 
could be reached by the time the foreign ministers return to paris 
to conclude the conference aug 2830 
dumas said the factfinding mission would be dispatched very 
quickly to all areas of cambodia and concerned countries in the 
past the khmer rouge have barred outsiders to their military camps 
along the thaicambodian border including doctors and aid workers 
from international aid agencies 
the khmer rouge initially opposed this mission as well as the 
committee to deal with cambodias internal strife

stephen studdert who has coordinated public 
events for president bush during his campaign and presidency 
submitted his resignation tuesday amid speculation he wants to run 
for governor in his home state of utah 
his job as assistant to the president for special activities and 
initiatives has been offered to sig rogich a political and 
advertising consultant from nevada but rogich is deciding whether 
to take the job studdert said 
studdert 40 said he will return to utah and has no present 
plans to run for governor but he said i dont close the door 
on any option for the future 
however he said in an interview republican gov norman h 
bangerter is a close personal friend and if bangerter chooses 
to run again in 1992 id support him in a minute 
studderts first assignment when he came to the white house to 
head president reagans advance office was to coordinate the return 
of the 52 american hostages who had been held captive in iran for 
444 days 
that day jan 20 1981 brought what he called the most 
poignant moments of his life he said 
he had obtained a navy band at the last minute to meet the 
hostages at andrews air force base ill never forget the 
trombone player marching by playing tie a yellow ribbon with 
tears running down his cheeks studdert said 
despite white house rumors that there was some agitation for 
studderts departure after a few presidential appearances did not 
go smoothly he said both bush and chief of staff john sununu 
strongly counseled me to stay and asked him to reconsider his 
decision to resign 
but he said he and his wife decided they wanted to return to 
utah for a more quiet life with their six children in the tiny town 
of highland 
when he agreed to join the bush presidential campaign last year 
studdert said he had not really wanted to leave his private 
consulting business nor did he particularly want to come back to 
work at the white house 
i just cant say no to the guy he said of bush in his 
resignation letter the former advance man told bush that during 
his years in washington nothing has been more satisfying than to 
serve you and mrs bush 
he later told reporters i have the best job in the entire 
federal government i have a fun job i love what i do and bush 
makes it so its been very very hard for me to make this 
decision 
he said he has traveled almost 5 million miles in his 
efforts to set up where the president will appear and how those 
appearances will look

a national drug strategy presented to cabinet 
officers focuses on law enforcement and stresses a need to rid 
inner cities of illegal drugs according to administration 
officials who have seen the document 
the predominant theme is the inner city one administration 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity said tuesday 
a paramount target of lawenforcement activity especially at 
the local level must be the disruption of those street markets for 
drugs in which retail demand and supply finally meet in a 
combustible mix the report said according to a source 
the strategy report required by the 1988 antidrug law that 
created the office of national drug control strategy strongly 
reflects public comments made by director william j bennett since 
he took office five months ago the final report is due sept 5 
it reads like one of his speeches said one source 
bennett has said repeatedly that the war against drugs must be 
fought on all fronts enforcement prevention and treatment and 
that the nation must do more and do better on each of those fronts 
the report reflects that attitude 
no single strategy pursued alone or to the detriment of other 
possible and valuable initiatives can work to contain or reduce 
drug use the strategy says 
what that means in terms of money was not immediately clear as 
the draft strategy circulated monday included no budget figures 
that might reflect the exact priorities it also did not include a 
classified strategy on international and interdiction policies that 
is under review by the national security council 
in an interview in june bennett said he expected to call for 
more money for drug treatment and probably more for prevention 
asked whether that meant less proportionally for law enforcement 
he said no not necessarily 
last week bennett said the escalating cost of the drug war may 
eventually lead to the need for a tax hike 
the strategy focuses on the highlyaddictive smokeable form of 
cocaine called crack and denounces any move to decriminalize any 
kind of illegal drug despite some officials claims that such 
action might cut down on drugrelated violence 
legalizing drugs would be an unqualified national disaster 
the report says in fact any significant relaxation of drug 
enforcement for whatever reason however wellintentioned would 
promise more use more crime and more trouble for treatment and 
education efforts 
instead the report says we should be tough on drugs much 
tougher than we are now 
the new york times reported on the strategy in tuesdays 
editions 
the strategy reflects bennetts past statements that education 
and treatment programs must be tied to strong law enforcement to be 
effective on numerous occasions bennett has told of treatment 
specialists who say arrests of drug users are what spur them into 
treatment and keep them there 
the strategy includes proposed antidrug legislation for states 
that closely resembles outlines bennett provided two weeks ago to 
the american legislative exchange council a gathering of state 
legislators at monterey calif according to one source 
at the meeting bennett urged the legislators to take a range of 
actions from hiring more police judges and prosecutors and 
building more prisons to ensure certain and prompt punishment of 
drug offenders to imposing civil fines of up to 10000 for those 
convicted of possessing small amounts of drugs 
bennett has warned that states and educational institutions that 
fail to impose some antidrug laws could risk losing federal money 
in the most recent stategy draft that threat takes the form of 
a possible loss of highway funds for states that fail to revoke 
drivers licenses from those convicted of drug offenses 
the draft also threatens to drop federal education funds from 
elementary secondary and postsecondary schools that fail to have 
education departmentchecked and approved drugprevention programs 
and policies threats in an earlier draft to revoke criminal 
justice funds were eliminated from the later draft

junior high schools in the occupied west bank 
will be reopened wednesday allowing about 70000 more palestinian 
children to return to classes the israeli army announced tuesday 
the junior high schools would be reopened for the first time 
since january said west bank commander maj gen amiram mitzna 
primary schools and classes for high school seniors reopened 
july 22 and 200000 students returned to classes 
the west banks nearly 1200 primary and secondary schools were 
closed throughout most of the 19month palestinian uprising against 
israeli rule in the occupied territories 
the israeli government said the schools were hotbeds of violence 
and rejected repeated appeals from the united states and 
international human rights organizations against the closures 
palestinian leaders have called on students not to jeopardize 
the resumption of classes by initiating antiisraeli disturbances 
mitzna speaking to israeli legislators touring the west bank 
town of ramallah said the army was considering reopening classes 
for high school sophomores and juniors in the near future israel 
radio said 
mitzna added that israel recently released 97 high school 
students who were arrested for antiisraeli protests to allow them 
to resume their education 
elsewhere in the occupied lands two palestinians were shot and 
wounded overnight in clashes between israeli soldiers and about 200 
protesters in the tulkarem refugee camp the army also fired tear 
gas to disperse the crowd which gathered to protest the death of a 
palestinian camp resident earlier in the week arab reports said 
the army said three palestinians were wounded in the tulkaram 
clashes 
in other developments israel radio reported that leaflets 
signed by palestinian liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafats fatah wing warned activists from the hardline marxist 
popular front for the liberation of palestine that they bear 
responsibility for their threats against palestinian lawyer jamil 
tarifi 
tarifi a plo supporter disclosed last week he had met with 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir for discussions on 
implementing shamirs peace plan tarifi is the only palestinian to 
admit to such a meeting 
graffiti signed by the front later appeared on walls threatening 
tarifi with punishment for the meeting 
faisal husseini a prominent east jerusalem palestinian leader 
and a plo supporter harshly criticized the threats and told the 
israeli news agency itim that these warnings do not serve the 
palestinian cause 
the front headed by george habash has opposed arafats offer 
to compromise in negotiations with israel

during the tough teenage years kids often reach 
out for help but police say some of those who call telephone talk 
lines become victims of criminals capitalizing on their 
vulnerability 
since the expensive chat lines began about two years ago 
parents have battled their children over spiraling phone bills but 
now three massachusetts men face charges of raping a 14yearold 
hopedale girl they enticed to run away from home and people are 
wondering if a more serious threat may be afoot 
we have a lot of troubled teens and its discouraging said 
nancy arguello a manager at a local talk line company if a guy 
is smart enough to get a girl to believe hes nice theres not 
much we can do some of them can be very clever and unfortunately 
girls fall into the trap 
its a big problem and getting bigger said patrolman 
richard mank who has managed the hopedale case and spoken with 
other police departments about similar incidents 
the trio has allegedly made contact with at least eight 
teenagers in recent months mank said offering them reassurance 
and a safe place to go should the teens want to run away from home 
sick people are using these kids they make friends with them 
and listen for the ones who want to run away he said i would 
caution the parents to listen to their kids so they dont go to 
strangers 
of 40 million party line calls logged by new england telephone 
over a 2year period at least 10 percent were made by those who 
dial services like xbt telecoms talkabout teen line a group 
conversation designed for people under age 16 said john johnson a 
spokesman for the telephone company 
talkabout is an entertainment service it is not and never has 
been designed or advertised as a threatening or abusive type of 
thing said xbt spokesman allan fitzmaurice 
moderators are required to keep conversations from getting too 
personal and disconnect abusive callers said bernice mcintyre 
chairman of the public utilities commission 
but no federal guidelines have been set down and the degree to 
which moderators enforce talk line standards can vary 
arguello who trains and manages moderators for xbt said 
regardless of how well prepared mediators are party lines can get 
out of control 
everyone picks up the phone at night and goes crazy for some 
reason arguello said all the creeps come out of the woodwork 
you disconnect them and they keep coming back even angrier than 
before 
moderators often listen in on 20 to 30 lines at a time she 
said making it impossible to keep tabs on all the conversations 
its been our policy to discourage callers from meeting and 
exchanging phone numbers and we cut people off all the time 
fitzmaurice said 
apparently in the case of the 14yearold in hopedale three 
men all over the age of 16 allegedly wooed her without 
discouragement 
two men were arrested and arraigned late last month on various 
charges including rape kidnapping contributing to delinquency 
and abusing a child under 16 years old an arrest warrant has been 
issued for a third man wanted on similar charges

but they said they feared the government would respond with a harsh 
crackdown 
the south african council of churches which includes almost all 
leading protestant denominations said it backed a plan for ailing 
blacks to seek treatment at whites only hospitals beginning

parliamentary elections sept 6 south africas tricameral 
parliament has houses for whites asians and people of mixedrace 
but excludes the 28 million black majority 
elections in south africa have become synonymous with the 
perpetuation of apartheid and discrimination said frank chikane 
general secretary of the council of churches 
the only means that remain open to the voteless majority is to 
embark on a program of peaceful nonviolent defiance that will 
change these laws chikane said 
his statement was endorsed by nine prominent church officials 
including anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize 
we call on all participants to act with discipline and 
restraint that such a campaign deserves in order to retain the 
moral high ground chikane said 
we are seriously concerned at the repressive action which law 
and order minister adriaan vlok has threatened to use he said 
vlok has said the campaign is part of an attempt to disrupt the 
elections with violence such actions he said must be stopped 
at all costs 
there have been several bombings in the past week and police 
said the three people who were killed had been planting the 
explosives on monday night gunmen opened fire and tossed a hand 
grenade at a johannesburg police station but no one was injured 
no one has claimed responsibility for the violence police blame 
most such attacks on the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla group 
the mass democratic movement a loose coalition of 
antiapartheid groups that organized the defiance campaign said 
antiblack leaflets that had been circulating in recent days 
could be the work of the government so as to instill a climate of 
violence around a nonviolent action 
one organizer cas coovadia said no more than 50 blacks were 
expected to present themselves wednesday at any one of the eight 
white hospitals targeted by the movement government officials have 
said blacks who arrive at whites only hospitals and are not in 
need of emergency treatment will be referred to black hospitals 
people entering hospitals without permission could face jail 
terms of up to two years according to a government directive 
issued last week 
the mass democratic movement has no official structure or 
acknowledged leader but is made up of some of the same people who 
headed the united democratic front until it was banned last year

with one american hostage reported dead and 
another under threat president bush is grappling with the same 
dilemma that haunted his predecessors how to punish international 
terrorists without jeopardizing the lives of innocent people 
administrations back to president nixons for the most part have 
shied away from military retaliation when faced with terrorist 
activity even when the provocation was great now bush is the one 
facing decisions after mondays reported execution of lt col 
william higgins 
a 1986 report on terrorism written by a task force headed by 
then vice president bush summed up the difficulty our principles 
of justice will not permit random retaliation against groups or 
countries 
the report also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations 
are high risk missions that can have a severe negative impact on 
us prestige if they fail 
put another way bush is loath to order the dropping of 
500pound bombs if in addition to doing away with enemy targets 
the action also claims the lives of innocent civilians and 
jeopardizes the remaining american hostages as well americans 
traveling in the middle east could become even more inviting 
targets to terrorists intent on vengeance 
compounding bushs problem is that solid intelligence from 
beiruts shadowy underworld is hard to come by the american 
hostages are believed to be never in the same place at the same 
time so a rescue mission is regarded as extremely difficult if not 
futile 
the administration has begun pursuing a diplomatic option for 
dealing with the terrorism issue but officials acknowledged tuesday 
that this is a painstakingly slow process with little prospect of 
quick results 
after conferring in paris in recent days with secretary of state 
james a baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze was 
in tehran tuesday relaying american concerns about the unfolding 
drama in beirut according to the officials 
beyond that us diplomats were in contact with a number of 
governments thought to be in a position to influence the iranians 
who have close links to the lebanese shiite group which claimed 
responsibility for higgins reported death 
bushs decision to cut short his out of town schedule on monday 
and return to washington raised the expectation that more dramatic 
measures were in the offing to register his horror over mondays 
developments 
on the other hand the almost unanimous opinion of private 
experts is that bushs hands are tied 
rhetoric is cheap but decisive action is difficult i dont 
know if there is very much we can do in the short term said 
geoffrey kemp a former reagan administration official who works 
for the carnegie endowment for international peace 
there are other inhibitions to a strong show of us force in 
the postkhomeini era in tehran a bloody retaliatory raid could 
squander whatever prospects there are for an improvement in 
relations with iran 
the sense of anxiety here has been heightened with the threat 
that another american hostage joseph cicippio will be killed 
thursday if israel does not release a kidnapped shiite cleric 
no president was more disposed toward dealing decisively with 
terrorists than ronald reagan who took office pledging swift and 
effective retribution against them 
but reagan stopped short of carrying out that promise even in 
the face of his darkest moment as president the truck bombing 
deaths of 241 american marines in beirut in october 1983 
public demands for retaliatory action quickly dissipated when 
american attention was diverted by the usled invasion of grenada 
barely two days later 
in addition reagan felt that the options presented to him for 
retaliating for the deaths of the marines were too costly 
reagan did respond with a determined show of force 2 years 
later after he concluded that libyan leader moammar gadhafi was 
behind the bombing of a cafe in west germany frequented by american 
soldiers 
american f111 bombers based in britain struck at targets in 
tripoli and benghazi and administration officials said gadhafi was 
far less adventuresome afterward 
while the link between gadhafi and the cafe bombing appeared to 
be clear at least to the administration the connection between 
iran and the shiite moslem group which announced the execution of 
higgins on monday was more ambiguous

the nations major industries acknowledged 
tuesday their lobbyists lined up congressional sponsors for 
president bushs clean air bill even though business rejects key 
language to control acid rain and car pollution 
reflecting an ambivalent attitude toward one of the presidents 
major legislative initiatives the multiindustry clean air working 
group objected strongly to bushs planned alternative fuels program 
for motor vehicles and a cap on utilities sulfur dioxide 
emissions the major cause of acid rain 
despite these reservations the coalition of major petroleum 
oil auto chemical utility and other companies said bushs 
legislation remains the best hope for breaking a decadelong 
stalemate on improving the nations air pollution law 
it is tough to get cosponsors on a bill we dont support 
coalition administrator william fay told a news conference we 
did hold our nose 
by supporting the bush legislation industry is trying to steer 
lawmakers away from rival bills supported by environmental groups 
who argue the bush proposal is loaded with concessions for 
industry the competing legislation would give industry far fewer 
choices than the bush plan in deciding how to curb air pollution 
which fay said is not as bad as some people think 
the air in every city but los angeles is healthy 99 percent of 
the time he declared 
besides giving industrys most comprehensive assessment of the 
bush legislation so far fay accused rival environmental groups of 
using a rhetorical slight of hand to argue the bill is soft 
theres no gift here for consumers workers or businesses 
describing intensive industry lobbying to line up sponsors for 
the bush legislation one house staffer said she was visited by a 
general motors lobbyist even though her boss has announced support 
for the rival legislation 
according to the staffer the lobbyist argued that automakers 
were being unjustly accused of causing the nations air 
pollution problems even though vehicle pollution has been largely 
controlled by new technology 
the bush legislation was introduced in the house with 90 
republican and 57 democratic sponsors and was to be introduced in 
the senate this week 
the provisions that upset the industry group the most have been 
cited again and again by administration officials as cornerstones 
of the legislation 
the alternative fuels plan would require that in areas with 
severe ozone pollution at least nine cities vehicles with 
cleanburning fuel must be sold according to the following 
schedule 500000 in the 1995 model year 750000 in the 1996 model 
year and one million in each of the model years from 1997 through 
2004 those figures represent only a percentage of the total number 
of vehicles expected to be sold in those cities each year 
the bush plan also would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 
million tons by the end of the year 2000 based on 1980 levels but 
the measure also would cap emissions at the reduced level thus 
restricting growth of utilities unless they could further reduce 
their emissions from existing plants 
speaking of the alternative fuels plan fay said were 
suggesting the mandate should not be there because automakers are 
not certain the technology is perfected for such a program 
the leading alternative fuel is methanol currently made from 
natural gas but which also can be manufactured from coal the 
industry group said methanol would be the most likely alternative 
fuel if the bush program went into effect 
michael mason a lobbyist with the american petroleum institute 
told the news conference that his oil industry trade group believes 
the proposal to be a big mistake because there should be a 
level playing field in which all fuels should be able to compete 
mason said most methanol would have to come from saudi arabia 
iran or the soviet union and suggested that oil companies may be 
able to produce a cleanerburning gasoline as an alternative 
the cap on sulfur dioxide emissions fay said is 
unnecessarily restrictive limits economic growth and makes it 
difficult to build new factories and power plants

a woman who survived for two weeks in 
the north atlantic was so busy eating a fish that had jumped into 
her life raft that she almost failed to see the vessel that rescued

by drinking her own urine for four or five days before being 
rescued he said he had been worried about the amount of salt she 
had taken in through the urine 
the doctor said ms culver was calm and alert when she was 
transferred to the bermudabound royal viking star cruise ship a 
swedish vessel on sunday about 350 miles northwest of this british 
colony 
akerberg the royal vikings doctor who treated ms culver was 
quoting by bermudas royal gazette newspaper as saying she is a 
very strongwilled person who wanted to survive 
she told me she was very energetic right up until the last few 
days but then she was sleeping more and more he said in the 
newspaper interview 
ms culver earlier told officials she and abbott were trapped on 
the 3footby10foot raft with only a flashlight a flotation 
device an fm radio some cold cuts crackers peanuts and a half 
gallon of water 
akerberg also said the couple later managed to collect a 
halfgallon of water during a downpour 
the doctor said that after a while she noticed her 
boyfriends personality begin to change he didnt want to go on 
he jumped over the side of the raft she just thought he was 
cooling off but he swam away and disappeared 
abbott a delivery man for a bogota nj courier service 
lived on a boat during the summer in new york 
the doctor was quoted as saying ms culver had been dieting for 
several weeks before the trip that could have helped save her 
life he said she was already eating less 
he said she was severely dehydrated undernourished and 
suffering from exposure when she was rescued 
the coast guard said they had abandoned ship after a leak 
developed in packing material around the propeller shaft they put 
the engine in neutral to recharge batteries but it slipped back 
into gear and blew out the packing material letting in water 
at a news conference tuesday dr ronald lightbourne the 
medical director at the hospital said ms culver was progressing 
well and had eaten ham and eggs for breakfast he said she was 
transferred to the intensive care unit on monday evening more to 
protect her from the attention of the media than as a result of her 
medical condition 
she will undergo minor surgery wednesday to remove patches of 
sunburned skin and will be hospitalized a few more days he said

the united states on tuesday pledged 
50 million in additional food aid to poland to help ease shortages 
caused by the governments moves toward a freemarket economy 
were trying to help carry them through this period curtis 
kamman deputy assistant us secretary of state for european 
affairs said at the end of a 24nation meeting on economic aid to 
poland and hungary 
austria and switzerland also promised food aid the european 
economic community a 12nation trading bloc earlier agreed to 
remove 120 million worth of meat grains and other products from 
warehouses to ship to poland 
western nations want to speed up the push in eastern europe for 
more open political and marketoriented economic systems 
poland on tuesday ended price controls and meat rationing as 
part of the governments drive toward a freemarket economy there 
was concern the abrupt lifting of price controls might send the 
country into turmoil 
president bush and other world leaders last month asked the 
european economic community to set up an aid meeting to try to 
encourage democratic change and economic reforms in poland and 
hungary the leaders attending their annual economic summit in 
paris also urged emergency food shipments to poland 
shortly after bushs trip to poland last month the united 
states promised 9 million in food from surplus stocks 
kamman called tuesdays conference very successful 
participants agreed to meet again in the early fall for more 
discussions and decide then whether to schedule a highlevel 
conference on the aid program 
kamman told reporters it was the intention of the united 
states to provide an additional 50 million in surplus food to 
poland beginning oct 1 most will be free some might be sold on 
easy loan terms 
it gives them the confidence to do their price reform and it 
may help them in the longrun to keep social discontent at a 
manageable level kamman said 
eec spokesmen said the conferences agenda focused on food aid 
to poland and economic and trade cooperation between the west and 
the poland and hungary 
they said polish president wojciech jaruzelski sent a letter 
last month asking for 685000 tons of beef pork powdered milk 
butter oils wheat corn rice and sugar in the next few months 
he also said poland needed at least 37 million tons of food 
next year and again in 1991 roughly 1 billion worth in each year 
according to the eec moreover he asked for 250000 tons of feed 
for animals and 220 million to 250 million in pesticides and 
similar products in 1990 and again in 1991 
the spokesmen said there was interest in devising a plan to link 
the free food to changes in the structure of the polish economy 
particularly in the poorly working system for getting food from 
farms to consumers tables poland has accepted the idea in 
principle they said 
one possibility under discussion by the common market would be 
to allow the poles to sell the food on the free market and use the 
money to improve the distribution chain 
the spokesmen said the quick shipments of food were necessary to 
help poland as it goes through the painful process of restructuring 
its economy some at the conference urged that the food be 
channeled into the economy so that it doesnt worsen the 
alreadyhigh inflation rate or discourage domestic food production 
hungary has been in the forefront of economic reforms in the 
east bloc since the 1960s still it has a foreign debt of about 
18 billion the highest per capita in eastern europe polands 
foreign debt stands at 39 billion 
nations at meeting include the common market members of britain 
ireland norway denmark belgium the netherlands luxembourg

soldiers frolicked in an amusement park tuesday 
to celebrate the 62nd birthday of chinas army and thousands of 
civilians flocked to an exhibit about the prodemocracy student 
movement that was crushed by troops 
despite weeks of buildup in the media however there was little 
other public observation of army day which marks its founding on 
aug 1 1927 
also tuesday chinas official xinhua news agency criticized as 
traitors fugitive chinese dissidents who have formed groups in the 
united states to work for democratic reform at home 
it also criticized foreign news reports on the dissidents 
activities especially those of the us governmentrun voice of 
america 
the nationally televised evening news reported only two brief 
ceremonies at tiananmen square which student protesters occupied 
for seven weeks until the military crackdown june 34 that left 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people dead 
the square has been closed to the general public since then and 
city officials had suggested it would be filled with soldiers 
tuesday 
instead one of the few places that drew a crowd was the 
military museum of the chinese peoples revolution which on monday 
formally opened an exhibit on the popular student movement 
nearly 6000 people visited the museum in just three hours 
tuesday compared to 3000 to 4000 visitors on an average day 
museum employees said many were there to see the exhibit which 
like all official accounts of what the government calls a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion criticizes the students and 
glorifies the army 
crowds gathered four or five deep in front of the displays about 
the student movement and those who managed to squeeze toward the 
front bent over glass cases poring over the students petitions 
handbills and bigcharacter posters calling for democracy human 
rights and more freedoms 
the exhibit also showed rows of battered army helmets mangled 
rifles with broken butts and bloodsoaked army uniforms evidence 
of the soldiers patience and restraint the signs said 
but few people lingered long in front of the displays that 
lauded the army and praised the party 
for weeks the leadership and the media have been exhorting the 
masses to make this years army day particularly memorable in a 
show of love and respect for the army but most of the holiday 
activities were restricted to the troops 
the beijing evening tv news showed soldiers gleefully driving 
bumper cars and sliding down water rides at an amusement park 
at dawn in tiananmen square a group of young pioneers the 
communist partys organization for youngsters attended the daily 
flagraising the nationally televised evening news said the 
children were told to learn from their martial law 
soldieruncles 
a few hours later several hundred soldiers attended an award 
ceremony to honor those who acted bravely during the turmoil but 
the square was empty again after 20 minutes 
the soldiers stood facing a single red banner while a band 
played the national anthem some soldiers were shown receiving 
medals 
the biggest commemoration came in the nations newspapers 
almost all of which carried frontpage editorials praising the army 
officers and soldiers have stood up to all tests and used 
their blood and lives to protect the party and the peoples 
power and safety the peoples daily said 
xinhua called the voice of america the most active and open 
supporter of the fugitives in their attempt to overthrow the 
chinese government 
not long ago voa broadcast twice its long interview with wuer 
kaixi continuing to spread the lie of the bloodletting at 
tiananmen square 
wuer was one of the leaders of the sevenweek student 
prodemocracy movement that shook china in the spring he vowed 
after fleeing china to continue fighting to avenge the hundreds and 
possibly thousands of people who died when the army attacked the 
protesters june 34 
he and other fugitive dissidents helped lead a gathering in 
chicago last week of chinese studying in the united states at 
which participants voted to form an allamerica chinese student 
union to press for reform in china 
xinhua accused the students of accepting financial help from the 
rival nationalist government on taiwan

cuts during recent years in a federal program 
that provides housing for the elderly and handicapped left a long 
waiting list of applicants for available units according to an 
american association of retired persons study released tuesday 
the department of housing and urban development scaled back the 
socalled section 202 construction during the reagan administration 
and scrapped elevators for twostory buildings housing frail 
residents the study said 
although aarp cited the program as a model of successful 
cooperation between the federal government and private nonprofit 
sponsors it said it found newer units inadequately adapted for 
residents whose mobility decreases with age 
over half of the projects occupied during the most recent 
phase of the program were forced by hud to change their 
construction plans to eliminate congregate spaces or elevators to 
use lower quality construction materials or to build smaller 
units said john rother aarps director of legislation research 
and public policy 
this raises questions about the ability of these projects to 
remain sound and able to adapt to the residents needs 80 percent 
of whom are elderly women he added 
aarp said that hud since 1959 has provided direct lowinterest 
loans to nonprofit sponsors to encourage construction of 
subsidized rental housing for older adults and the disabled it 
added that nearly 200000 units have been built since the program 
began but new construction has decreased from 20000 units in the 
1970s to 10000 units last year 
it said waiting lists averaged eight people for every vacancy in 
buildings constructed with section 202 funds 
the organization advocates a larger section 202 construction 
program to keep the elderly and handicapped out of more expensive 
institutional care 
aarp a nonpartisan organization representing people age 50 and 
older said surveys were mailed to all the section 202 housing 
project managers and sponsors in 1988 of whom about 60 percent 
responded 
rep james florio dnj chairman of the subcommittee on 
housing and consumer interests of the house select committee on 
aging released the study conducted by the university of illinois 
and called it a useful tool to motivate congress on housing 
legislation 
needless to say the current crises at the department of 
housing and urban development have taught us that better monitoring 
of program administration and effectiveness is severely needed 
he said 
florio said that if the federal government does not authorize 
additional construction lowincome older adults will not live 
long enough to move from the waiting lists into 202 units

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
calling the low us savings rate one of the most critical problems 
facing the country said tuesday that the bush administration is 
drawing up legislative proposals to encourage americans to be more 
thrifty 
the low rate of savings in the united states compared to other 
industrial countries has been a major source of concern for 
policymakers trying to make american businesses more competitive 
internationally 
personal savings as a percentage of disposable income fell to 
a record low of 32 percent in 1987 and recovered only slightly to 
42 percent in 1988 
the fed chairman said that between the civil war and world war 
i the united states had the highest savings rate in the world a 
position now held by japan policymakers are concerned because a 
low pool of savings drives up the cost of borrowing for businesses 
making it more expensive for them to expand and modernize their 
production facilities 
greenspan testifying before the senate banking committee 
called the low us savings rate the crucial issue for the 
longterm economic outlook of the country 
he said officials at the federal reserve the treasury 
department and the presidents council of economic advisers were 
studying a variety of possible legislative proposals to boost 
savings 
treasury undersecretary robert r glauber said in an interview 
that the administration had a task force reviewing the low savings 
question glauber said one option being considered was revamping 
individual retirement accounts which were scaled back in the 1986 
tax law 
also being studied glauber said were ways to eliminate the 
inequity in the tax code that corporations face between borrowing 
to finance expansion and selling more equity in their concerns if 
a corporation raises capital by borrowing it can deduct its 
interest payments but if it sells stock in the company and 
distributes dividends on its profits both it and its shareholders 
are taxed on those profits 
glauber said treasury secretary nicholas brady would be 
addressing the countrys inadequate savings rate during a series of 
speeches this fall the administrations push for a reduction in 
the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changes 
needed to lower the cost of capital to businesses glauber said 
these are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly 
glauber said 
one problem the administration faces in proposing any changes in 
the tax law is that creating tax breaks to encourage savings such 
as restoring the full deductability of ira contributions would 
cost the government billions of dollars at a time of high budget 
deficits 
greenspan said americas low savings rates were a very 
difficult problem one that has exasperated economists for a number 
of years 
on other subjects greenspan 
confirmed that the central bank moved to lower interest rates 
for a third time last week as part of its continuing effort to keep 
the country out of a recession 
predicted that the us trade deficit would show little further 
improvement this year because increases in the dollar would hurt 
american exports but greenspan said he believed the trade deficit 
would resume dropping significantly beginning next year 
backed the administrations position that the huge bailout of 
the savings and loan industry should be handled offbudget 
this approach because it would be harder to duplicate would not 
encourage other efforts to circumvent the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law requiring a balanced federal budget by 1993 
greenspan said 
rejected suggestions that the grammrudman deficit targets 
which call for reducing the shortfall to 64 billion in 1991 and 
28 billion in 1992 should be raised saying any such tinkering 
would roil financial markets 
greenspans comments on the deficit targets came in response to 
a question from senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
sasser later told reporters that he opposed changing the 
grammrudman targets but that the idea was being floated by other 
lawmakers who wanted to avoid the pain of making sharp cuts in the 
federal budget next year right before the midterm congressional 
elections 
he said the suggestion was being made in connection with 
proposals to remove certain big government programs such as social 
security and highway construction from the main federal budget

the parents of two young people who 
disappeared last year in new mexico said tuesday that a mysterious 
photograph found in a florida parking lot appears to show their 
children bound and gagged 
michael henley now 10 vanished on a turkey hunt with his 
father in april 1988 in the mountains south of their hometown of 
milan nm tara calico now 20 disappeared five months later 
while bicycling on a country road near her hometown of belen nm 
michaels parents and ms calicos mother flew to this florida 
panhandle city to meet with police tuesday the mystery photo was 
found june 15 in a store lot where a white van had been parked but 
the parents did not learn about it until the picture was shown 
friday on the nationally syndicated television show a current 
affair 
after spending two hours viewing the photo and talking with 
investigators michaels mother marty henley said she is almost 
certain the boy shown tied up in the polaroid snapshot is her son 
he looks scared real scared but he looks healthy and im 
grateful for that mrs henley said but added i dont want to 
get my hopes up too high 
her husband also named michael was more cautious saying he 
wanted fbi experts to compare photos but agreed the resemblance 
was striking 
if its not michael its a little boy who looks very much 
like michael henley said 
the mother of ms calico pat doel said she was convinced the 
young woman shown in the photo was her daughter 
she said she was relieved her daughter appeared to be healthy 
and said she wanted that message to get through to the abductor 
strange as it may seem i would thank him for keeping her 
alive ms doel said i would thank him for taking care of her 
seeing that shes fed seeing that shes clean i hope he values 
her life as much as we do 
the parents said they were frustrated that the photo which 
could have been taken as early as april according to police 
experts was not enough to locate the children 
its frustrating for us to think perhaps weve got this close 
and cant go any further ms doel said 
port st joe police chief carl richter said the fbi has agreed 
to use other photographs of the children and compare them with the 
photo in its washington laboratory to confirm the identifications 
he said that police also had received dozens of other tips but the 
henley and calico cases were considered the only serious ones 
he said the parents and investigators while pleased to find the 
photo were worried about the consequences of the discovery 
it could be devastating richter said whoever has the 
children if he hears about it they may retaliate its a 
possibility 
the fbi in albuquerque has said it is already providing 
technical help to local authorities and that as soon as an 
abduction is confirmed the agency will officially enter the case 
the parents said they did not know when they would return to new 
mexico 
they were alerted to the picture by friends who saw a current 
affair and they appeared on the show monday at first they were 
unsure about the identifications but ms doel said that after 
taking time growth and lack of makeup into consideration she was 
convinced the girl was her daughter 
ms calico is shown in the photo beside the book my secret 
audrina by vc andrews which the mother identified as her 
daughters favorite

a swarm of bees stung a woman to death 
after she apparently knocked over the hive 
mary gaxiola 66 was stung monday more than 100 times 
including about 50 times on her head and face said coroner david 
m hadden 
other workers in a cantaloupe field 200 miles north of los 
angeles put towels on the victim a highway patrol helicopter crew 
administered antisting drugs before flying her to a hospital 
where she was pronounced dead 
hadden said people allergic to bee stings can die from the venom 
in a single sting while multiple stings can be fatal to others 
through a buildup of venom 
the coroner said bees in the area would be sent to the state for 
examination but did not appear to be the aggressive africanized or 
killer bees that were found 100 miles away four years ago and 
supposedly eradicated

a sixmember jury tuesday began deliberating 
whether korean air lines was guilty of willful misconduct when one 
of its jumbo jets flew off course and was shot down by a soviet 
fighter plane in 1983 killing all 269 people aboard 
in final arguments after a twoweek trial in us district 
court lawyers for families of the victims said flight 007 was off 
course almost from the minute it left the ground in anchorage 
alaska and headed to its pacific ocean route for seoul south 
korea 
lawyers for the families presented as expert witnesses two 
pilots who theorized that the crew aboard the kal plane 
misprogrammed at least one and possibly all three onboard 
computerized navigation systems while the boeing 747 was on the 
ground in anchorage 
milton sincoff one of the families lawyers said that even kal 
acknowledges the wreckage from flight 007 plummeted into the sea of 
japan which would put it far off its pacific ocean course 
kal attorney george tompkins countered that the main evidence in 
the case is a line drawn by soviet officials on a map showing an 
offcourse flight 007 flying for several hours over russian 
airspace hundreds of miles to the west of its planned route 
that russian line was furnished by the people who shot 
this plane down and killed these people said tompkins this 
disaster is going to remain a mystery until the russians come 
forward and say what evidence they have to support that black 
line 
tompkins said that to suggest the plane was off course for four 
hours means that the crew radioed in false position reports at 
three checkpoints in the pacific ocean 
you must conclude they lied on every position report said 
tompkins to accept the plaintiffs theory you have to buy that 
russian line 
in the final hour of the flight after giving its last position 
report something happened acknowledged tompkins who offered 
no explanation in order to end up in the sea of japan after being 
on course just an hour previously the plane would have had to 
abruptly change direction and head into soviet territory 
sincoff said it is frankly impossible for flight 007 to have 
been on course at its last radioed check point an hour before it 
was shot down he said the distance from the check point to the 
crash site is 660 miles and that the plane was flying at 500 mph 
but tompkins said it is not believeable that the plane spent 
several hours over soviet territory 
lawyers for the families want you to believe that he the 
pilot of flight 007 was flying through russia chattering on the 
radio so he wouldnt have to turn around and dump fuel and 
land back in anchorage said tompkins 
lawyers for the families are trying to prove that crew members 
on the plane had to have known that they were off course yet 
decided to continue the flight rather than returning to anchorage 
where they would have faced disciplinary action 
if the jury is convinced the airline crew was guilty of willful 
misconduct that will entitle the families to seek damages in 
excess of a 75000perpassenger limit established by 
international treaty

the christian commander of the army said 
tuesday the lebanese people will rebel against the syrian army 
which the arab league has blamed for blocking efforts to end the 
14yearold civil war 
gen michel aouns 20000 predominantly christian troops have 
been locked in fierce artillery battles with syrias 40000 troops 
in lebanon for the past five months 
the era of the popular liberation revolt will not be far 
it will be a sweeping river of resistance in every city village 
street and house aoun a maronite catholic told his forces 
police said one person was killed and four were wounded in a 
predawn howitzer duel between syrian and christian gunners across 
beiruts dividing green line bringing the overall casulty toll to 
511 killed and 2162 wounded since the confrontation erupted march 
8 
syrian troops entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate but aoun and other christian leaders claim 
they have betrayed their role by fighting on the moslem side in the 
civil war and should pull out 
aouns remarks tuesday were published by the independent daily 
newspaper annahar and other publications to mark lebanons army 
day 
he said the syrian occupation will be eliminated and the 
nation is heading toward practicing sovereignty 
a threemember committee of arab foreign ministers said it has 
reached an impasse in its bid to end lebanons civil war mainly 
because syrias concept of spreading lebanese state sovereignty 
is different from the committees stand on this matter a 
statement said without elaborating 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
proposed a timetable for a government of national entente to 
spread its authority with its own forces over the whole of 
lebanon according to the statement issued in rabat morocco 
but syria which considers lebanon within its sphere of 
influence refused to accept the timetable the statement said 
the saudi moroccan and algerian heads of state were asked at an 
arab league summit may 26 to work out a peace plan for lebanon by 
november 
algerias staterun television said the committee would ask arab 
heads of state to decide on the next move 
in syria the governmentowned damascus radio blamed aoun 
the radio without disclosing details said aoun and his 
clique are responsible for the committees failure 
the broadcast accused the christian general of attempting to 
partition the warravaged nation into ministates along sectarian 
lines and said the people of lebanon shall not allow the 
partition conspiracy to pass 
the current wave of violence started after aoun blockaded 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut for 
depriving the ailing state treasury of about 100 million in lost 
customs dues annually 
the syrians and their moslem militia allies retaliated by laying 
siege to the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of the 
capital shelling its coastline and blocking its land exits 
the ferocious shelling duels have devastated beirut and forced 
more than 12 million of an original 15 million population to 
abandon the city and seek refuge in safer areas 
in southern lebanon meanhile a police spokesman said tuesday 
that israeliallied militiamen killed three guerrillas in a clash 
near the southern village of sahqra eight miles from the israeli 
border in israels selfdeclared security zone 
israel kept control of the sixto10milewide zone when it 
withdrew the bulk of its invading army from south lebanon in june 
1985 
the palestine liberation front a syrianbacked faction said 
the guerrillas were on their way to carry out an attack against 
the zionist enemy 
the police spokesman also said gunmen shot and wounded two 
officials of plo chairman yasser arafats mainstream fatah 
guerrilla group in the southern city of sidon 
he said three gunmen in a green car opened fire with automatic 
rifles wounding fatahs comptroller in lebanon mahmoud asadi and 
his bodyguard monzer hamza

the head of the us public health service 
acknowledged tuesday that little federal money is available for 
early treatment of people infected with the aids virus but blamed 
congress for failing to allocate the money 
dr james o mason assistant secretary for health at the 
department of health and human services said congress often fails 
to provide additional money to pay for new programs it authorizes 
i think thats interesting he said 
it would be helpful if you folks would provide leadership 
shot back rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house oversight 
subcommittee grilling mason and other administration officials 
about a broad range of aids programs 
although the exchanges never got more testy than that there was 
a consistent undercurrent of disagreement over who bears prime 
responsibility for what weiss and rep nancy pelosi dcalif 
maintained was inadequate financing for aids treatment 
the two house members represent the two cities with the largest 
aids populations new york and san francisco 
mason noted that congress authorized 15 million last fall to 
help pay for azt administered to patients who could not afford to 
pay for it themselves during the current fiscal year azt which 
costs several thousand dollars a year per patient is the only 
approved drug treatment for aids 
however the azt authorization did not carry with it a new 
appropriation to replace the one that had been used up that left 
hhs officials with the choice of ignoring congress direction to 
continue paying for the drug or dipping into other aids budget 
accounts to come up with the 15 million 
mason who headed the centers for disease control in atlanta 
before being appointed to the no 2 hhs job by president bush said 
he faces a similar dilemma in the emerging fiscal 1990 budget 
because the azt program is authorized at 30 million but not 
included in the appropriations bill scheduled for debate later this 
week 
the only place i can find that money is to take it out of 
prevention or biomedical research said mason someone has to 
make a priority decision 
from a broader perspective mason pointed out that he also bears 
responsiblity for preparing the entire public health service 
budget which includes the national insitutes of health the food 
and drug administration and several lesser known agencies 
what is enough money for aids he asked rhetorically we 
cant drop infant mortality or cancer we could drop any other of 
these and do more on aids but i dont think that is what the 
nation wants us to do 
pelosi expressing concern that three specific early treatment 
demonstration programs for which she won congressional 
authorization have not been funded acknowledged that there has 
to be a bigger pie and that the congressional appropriations 
committees do not like to be too specific in how they allocate 
money 
on the other hand she said health programs have little hope of 
getting a larger slice of the federal budget pie unless the hhs 
department is going to squeak a lot louder 
mason assured the congresswoman that hhs secretary louis 
sullivan is a very squeaky secretary 
still mason suggested that most of the money appropriated to 
the department is very specifically defined 
we have been getting very clear guidance except when we get an 
authorization without an appropriation he said 
the human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee 
of the house committee on government operations which held 
tuesdays hearing does not have jurisdiction for legislation 
either authorizing or appropriating money for hhs programs

the senate judiciary committee opening 
hearings on measures to ban desecration of the flag was urged 
tuesday to shun partisan politics and punish flag burners by 
ignoring them 
every politician in the congress should recognize that to be 
ignored is the ultimate punishment society can inflict said 
former sen charles mcc mathias a maryland republican 
robert h bork returning to the committee that led the way in 
blocking his confirmation to the supreme court testified in favor 
of amending the constitution to prohibit flag desecration 
borks schedule did not allow time for committee members to 
question him but he told reporters outside the hearing room i 
have no particular emotional response to returning to the 
committee that questioned him for five days in 1987 before voting 
against his nomination by thenpresident ronald reagan 
the full senate agreed voting against him 5842 
bork agreed there was an irony in his appearance since the man 
confirmed for the seat bork had been up for anthony m kennedy 
voted with the majority in the supreme courts 54 ruling that flag 
burning is protected free speech bork has said if he were on the 
court he would have voted to uphold a texas law against flag 
desecration 
asked whether he believed the judiciary committee is capable of 
handling the issue properly bork said you may record that i 
grinned broadly 
mathias recalling a longfellow poem said the ship of state 
sailing majestically through history should treat flag burners 
with the same indifference as slugs and snails and slimy 
creatures whose submarine activities do not cause the great ship to 
deviate a degree from its course 
the committee is considering proposals to amend the constitution 
or enact legislation to reverse a supreme court ruling june 21 that 
said burning or desecrating the flag as a form of political protest 
is a constitutional right 
similar proposals are being weighed in the house a 
democraticsponsored bill could be voted on next month in the house 
after congress returns from a recess due to begin friday 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden ddel 
said he plans to hold four hearings on antiflag burning proposals 
biden is sponsoring legislation to make to it a crime to 
desecrate the american flag an alternative to a proposed 
constitutional amendment backed by the bush administration and many 
republicans 
opponents of both proposals said tuesday that congress and 
president bush are overreacting 
we are caught up in a crass competition about who loves the 
flag more said sen howard metzenbaum dohio we want to use 
the flag against our opponent in the next election and we want to 
be sure it is not used against us 
but sen strom thurmond rsc sponsor of a proposed 
constitutional amendment said an overwhelming majority of 
americans are looking to the congress to restore the proper 
civil respect for our american flag 
he noted that after the high court ruling the senate voted 973 
to express disapproval with the justices decision that action 
carried no legal weight 
metzenbaum and sens edward m kennedy dmass and gordon 
humphrey rnh were the three who opposed the resolution 
condemning the court ruling 
all three are judiciary committee members who urged their 
colleagues tuesday to withdraw plans to reverse the courts 
decision 
humphrey produced a pair of bedroom slippers with an american 
flag design that seems to me to be desecration he said

poles expressed shock tuesday at soaring 
food prices and parliament dismissed the government of prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski legislators argued over rakowskis 
successor 
solidarity lawmakers heaped criticism on the outgoing 
administrations economic policies the union movement was reported 
to be considering a proposal that could lead to a solidarity prime 
minister 
meat price increases on tuesday were the highest in recent 
memory food prices skyrocketed under the marketization program 
put together by rakowskis government across poland there were 
empty shelves and bewildered shoppers 
where is the meat where is the meat cried out an old man 
in a store without a scrap of meat 
i am going to america a woman shopper said in despair 
authorities say the increases are needed to prompt farmers to 
deliver to market and stabilize the level of state subsidies to the 
food industry 
a vote on interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak as prime 
minister set for tuesday was postponed amid signs his candidacy 
was in trouble in polands new pluralistic parliament 
rakowski went to a hospital tuesday after reportedly feeling 
faint but returned to parliament in the evening for urgent talks 
within his communist coalition 
according to several deputies involved the caucus leader for 
the communistallied peasant party aleksander bentkowski proposed 
that the peasants and solidarity form a government with a 
solidarity prime minister the communists would be left only with 
ministries controlling police and the army 
opposition sources said solidarity was considering the proposal 
one peasant party faction was in rebellion against the 
communists and its own leadership walking out when rakowski came 
to address the caucus 
we have a general as president now they want a general as 
premier and we know they want a communist to be deputy premier 
said one rebel speaking on condition of anonymity 
a member of the solidarity delegation flew to gdansk to review 
the situation with union founder lech walesa walesa had urged 
solidarity followers to vote against kiszczak the candidate 
advanced monday by the polish united workers communist party 
rakowski elected party first secretary four days ago was 
formally dismissed as prime minister by parliament on tuesday 
referring to deputy prime minister ireneusz sekulas claim that 
the ship of the polish economy is on the right course 
solidarity deputy ryszard bugaj said it seems to me that the 
situation is the exact opposite this ship is sinking 
walesa did not explain his reasons for urging deputies to vote 
against kiszczak who as interior minister was in charge of the 
police forces 
the image of the top policeman as head of government has upset 
many poles and solidarity met dissent from followers when it 
accepted gen wojciech jaruzelskis election as president july 19 
i am against gen kiszczaks candidacy for prime minister 
walesa said without elaborating 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek said monday he 
expected kiszczak to be elected even without support from 
solidarity lawmakers who are outnumbered 299161 by the communist 
coalition in the sejm but the matter appeared uncertain tuesday 
the peasant partys 76 votes are needed to give the 173strong 
communist delegation a working majority 
the parliament session began with criticism of the 9monthold 
rakowski government that lasted nearly five hours dwelling on high

prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday his 
government was making contacts in an effort to free hostages in 
lebanon and sources said direct approaches were made to lebanese 
shiite moslems for a prisoner swap 
israeli officials said it remained willing to exchange a moslem 
cleric kidnapped by israel and other lebanese shiite prisoners 
for israeli soldiers and western hostages the radical shiite group 
hezbollah or party of god issued a statement spurning the deal 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner called the offer humanitarian 
and fair and added we believe it is not hezbollahs last word 
israel television said the army would let the international 
committee of the red cross visit the kidnapped lebanese clergymen 
and his two abducted assistants if shiite groups allowed a red 
cross visit to three israeli soldiers believed to be held captive 
in south lebanon 
a defense ministry spokesman confirmed the report but would not 
give details 
israel insisted it would not free sheik abdul karim obeid 
despite threats by shiite kidnappers to kill western hostages in 
lebanon 
when asked by the national news agency itim whether obeid might 
be turned over to us authorities shamir replied he could not say 
what might be done 
the israelis say obeid planned guerrilla attacks on israel and 
directed the kidnapping in february 1988 of lt col william r 
higgins a us marine officer on un duty in south lebanon 
on monday higgins captors said they had hanged him and 
released a poorquality videotape showing a man on a gallows the 
kidnappers said he was hanged in retaliation for obeids abduction 
but there have been reports higgins was killed several months ago 
shamir said tuesday night that higgins was apparently dead 
and added we express our deep sorrow to his family and the 
american people 
during a factory tour earlier shamir said there was a common 
interest and a common goal between israel and the united states 
on freeing hostages but noted the reason for capturing obeid was 
to free the three israeli soldiers held in south lebanon 
the only purpose of our operation was to free our captured 
soldiers he said if at the same time we manage to set free 
other hostages we will be happy 
foreign minister moshe arens told reporters in jerusalem that 
israel viewed the new death threats as disinformation 
we do not have much faith in the truthfulness of the 
announcements that come from these organizations he said it 
would probably not be very wise to take any action based on that 
information 
itim the israeli news agency reported tuesday that shamir was 
making contacts to free western captives and he said on his 
factory tour there are permanent contacts with various factors 
about the release of the hostages 
pazner said the contacts were indirect through the united 
states and international organizations 
some israeli sources speaking privately said talks were being 
held directly with lebanese shiites about the proposed 
prisonerhostage trade 
security sources said israel is believed to hold 5060 lebanese 
shiite moslems in israel and through its surrogate south lebanon 
army militia about 300 in southern lebanon 
israel made the offer to free shiite prisoners in exchange for 
its soldiers and foreign hostages on monday before the 
announcement that higgins had been killed 
shamir defended the abduction of obeid as a strong energetic 
effort to help free the captured soldiers 
if need be we will take stronger steps he told a ceremony 
in jerusalem marking the 49th anniversary of the death of israeli 
pioneer zeev jabotinsky

president bush announced tuesday the united 
states will provide up to 50 million in food aid for poland to 
help avert shortages in the country as it struggles to reform its 
government and economy 
bush who visited poland last month said the food will assist 
in alleviating the impact of market price reforms and support 
continued efforts toward economic and political liberalization 
he said the new aid will include but go far beyond the 8000 
metric tons of surplus commodities already targeted for the east 
bloc country for fiscal 1990 under the american aid to poland act 
we intend to provide to poland supplies of sorghum corn and 
butter subject to the availability of those commodities he said 
we anticipate that all this aid will be on a grant basis the 
commodities would be sold in poland with proceeds used to fund 
agricultural development efforts there he said 
an urgent call for international help to avert food shortages in 
poland went out both from last months western economic summit in 
paris and from mondays meeting in brussels of 24 concerned nations 
chaired by the european community commission 
bush who promised in poland to seek 100 million from congress 
for a new polishamerican enterprise fund said this new food aid 
should be of real benefit to the polish people both through 
the commodities themselves and through the projects funded by sale 
of those foodstuffs 
bush promised in warsaw the united states will stand with 
poland and support its economic and political reforms he said 
change cannot come without sacrifices upon the part of the polish 
people but promised that the united states stands ready to help 
as you help yourselves

the democraticcontrolled senate judiciary 
committee on tuesday rejected william lucas as the nations top 
civil rights enforcer on a 77 tie vote and the justice department 
said the nomination was doomed 
hes lacking in experience and qualifications his managerial 
accomplishments are debatable said sen howell heflin dala 
who cast a critical vote against confirmation 
attorney general dick thornburgh blamed the rejection on raw 
politics and senate minority leader bob dole rkan urged the 
president to name lucas to the post on an interim basis that would 
not require senate appproval 
the committee first refused to give a favorable recommendation 
to lucas for the post of assistant attorney general for civil 
rights on a second 77 tie vote it rejected sending the nominee 
to the full senate without any recommendation 
sen dennis deconcini dariz joined six republicans in 
supporting lucas while seven democrats voted against him 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
committees action on mr lucas is very disappointing to the 
president we felt he deserved better treatment and he deserved 
that position 
in terms of where we go from here were now exploring our 
options fitzwater added 
asked about doles idea of a recess appointment he said i 
dont know whether he had any discussions with the white house or 
not no decisions have been made however about either mr lucas 
future or how we might approach the job at the justice department 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel called giving lucas a 
recess appointment a bad idea 
congressional and white house sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said such an action would touch off a confrontation 
between bush and the senate 
a white house source said the president would not likely want to 
up the ante with congress so early in the administration 
civil rights groups and their senate allies campaigned for 
lucas defeat saying the 61yearold former sheriff of wayne 
county michigan lacked the experience and knowledge to be 
effective in the civil rights position 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp who opposed 
lucas nomination praised the committee vote and added mr 
lucas is qualified for many positions in the administration and we 
would certainly urge that his services not be lost 
before the committee acted sen strom thurmond rsc the 
panels ranking republican urged approval saying it seems to 
me that we ought to give this black man a chance 
hes a minority of course years ago minorities didnt have 
a chance i know said thurmond one of the best known critics of 
civil rights legislation in the era of racial segregation 
if it had been a white man who had been nominated who had the 
same background no experience in the field no experience as a 
lawyer no expertise in this specialized field he wouldnt have 
gotten anywhere said sen howell heflin dala who cast the 
deciding vote against the nomination 
i think the fact that mr lucas was black caused much more 
consideration to be given to him he said 
biden said efforts by lucas supporters to portray opposition to 
him as racially motivated amounted to a cynical set up he 
noted that opponents included sen edward m kennedy dmass and 
other lawmakers who have been strong champions of the civil rights 
cause 
the committees action represented thornburghs second recent 
rebuff from the panel in june he reluctantly withdrew the 
nomination of robert b fiske jr as deputy attorney general after 
conservatives complained 
thornburgh said in a statement that rejection of lucas a former 
democrat who was the republican candidate for governor of michigan 
in 1986 came as a result of raw politics 
justice department spokesman david runkel said it was obvious 
that the opponents felt they didnt have the votes to defeat him on 
the floor so they killed him in committee 
runkel said lucas would remain at the department as a 
28450aday consultant and said there were no other candidates 
as of today 
thurmond said he knew of no realistic way for the lucas 
nomination to come to the senate floor in theory the senate could 
vote to take the matter out of the committees hands but that 
route is strewn with potential for filibusters and other roadblocks 
on the senate floor however dole urged bush to make a 
socalled recess appointment under which lucas could serve in the 
post for a number of months without being confirmed bush could 
make such a move as soon as congress recesses scheduled for the 
end of the week 
dole criticized the judiciary committee saying that political 
partisanship has taken over and twisted the nomination process 
the primary argument against lucas was that he lacked 
experience sen howard m metzenbaum dohio cited a remark by 
the nominee that he was new to the law 
would we accept a key economics adviser who is new to 
economics would we accept a science adviser who is new to 
science metzenbaum asked 
supporters said lucas would apply the hard lessons he learned in 
his climb from dishwasher to policeman to fbi agent to wayne county 
official 
in addition to lucas lack of experience critics cited problems 
that included the failure to declare 8800 worth of goods at 
customs en route home from an asian trip neglecting to make 
courtordered improvements at the jail when he was wayne county 
sheriff and making untrue statements in seeking admission to the 
new york bar 
lucas said he had not known the goods were in his familys 
luggage and that he made the jail improvements as soon as he could 
the justice department said misstatements lucas made on the bar 
application resulted from misinterpretation of the questions 
the name of robert bork rejected by the senate for a supreme 
court seat surfaced repeatedly in the panels sometimes bitter 
debate sen alan k simpson rwyo said lucas deserved to be 
sent to the senate floor to receive the same rehabilitation 
accorded bork 
biden retorted that bork had been defeated on the floor if 
thats rehabilitation i dont know what rehabilitation is he 
said 
simpson however declared that civil rights groups have just 
gone goofy over the lucas nomination and should themselves be 
investigated

customers gaped in disbelief tuesday at 
freshly lettered signs announcing the highest meat price increases 
in recent memory the cost of other key food items also skyrocketed 
where is the meat cried out an old man in a store without 
meat 
there is no meat just the price list a woman complained 
there were empty shelves and bewildered shoppers at meat stores 
and markets throughout poland as official price increases took 
effect 
authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to 
deliver their meat and produce to market and stabilize the level of 
state subsidies to the food industry 
price increases occur regularly in poland but the scale of the 
latest boost drove many customers to despair lifting of the ration 
system after seven years caused no joy since meat was so scarce 
i am going to america of course i am going to america 
shouted one woman after taking a look at the newest list of meat 
prices in the supersam supermarket 
the price of pork roast an expensive and popular cut rose from 
980 zlotys 118 to 3850 zlotys 464 a kilogram 22 pounds 
regular sausage rose from 52 cents to 180 a kilogram 
the average monthly income in poland is 127 
private farmers standing outside a state market in central 
warsaw demanded even higher prices one farmer wanted 723 a 
kilogram for ham and 482 a kilo for beef that was covered with 
flies 
inside the hala mirowska market supplies of statesupplied meat 
were all sold up by 2 pm 
customers at other shops were less fortunate a large meat store 
near parliament closed tuesday for a monthlong vacation the 
usually wellstocked supersam was down to scrawny chickens and 
cheap cuts of pork by midafternoon 
a sign in the empty meat shop on krakowskie przedmiescie street 
said the store had frozen duck and goose available and a sales 
clerk said she hoped chickens would be delivered later in the day 
how much will the chickens cost asked one customer i 
dont know dear i dont know replied the sales clerk 
until now meat prices in state stores have been the same 
throughout country as of tuesday however prices will be 
determined by the supplier and may vary from store to store 
among other items that cost more tuesday were sugar which went 
up from 42 cents to 60 cents a kilogram but was unavailable in 
many shops butter was up from 27 cents for a quarter kilogram to 
48 cents flour increased from 7 cents a kilogram to 12 cents 
in one food store some items available were unfit for 
consumption stacks of moldy bread were piled in a corner bottles 
of milk with flies inside were on the shelves 
why bother to stand in line for stuff like this said a 
woman as she picked through the available items 
even the normally wellsupplied restaurant in the parliament 
where deputies met to debate the formation of a new government felt 
the pinch of the new prices 
bean soup and tripe were the main items as the restaurant was 
out of one of the lawmakers favorite breakfast dishes hot dogs 
wrapped in bacon we dont have any and we dont know how much 
well have to charge when we get them a waitress told a 
solidarity deputy 
the food price increases are part of a government 
marketization program aimed to prompt farmers to produce more 
by introducing freemarket concepts 
some solidarity lawmakers claimed marketization was only a way 
of disguising price increases over the weekend the government said 
reduction of subsidies would diminish eventually 
parliament on monday passed by a 33529 vote legislation 
designed to cushion consumers from the impact of price increases 
and inflation now rising at an estimated 160 percent rate annually 
the law on indexing agreed to in principle in april by 
government and solidarity negotiators calls for incomes of 
workers farmers and pensioners to be automatically conmpensated 
by 80 percent of the rise in the cost of living 
lawmakers hope indexing will reduce the chance of strikes and 
overall wage increases from outpacing price rises

all options are open to president bush if 
he intends to retaliate for the apparent murder of lt col william 
r higgins a pentagon spokesman said tuesday but he refused to 
define them or say whether any action had been taken to ready us 
forces in the mideast 
spokesman pete williams said the aircraft carrier coral sea 
which is on duty in the mediterranean left the egyptian port of 
alexandria a little early tuesday but he declined to give its 
destination or say why it had put out to sea earlier than planned 
we dont discuss future deployments we dont discuss 
alert status williams said when asked about the ships movement 
queried about the list of miliary options that defense secretary 
dick cheney delivered monday evening to the white house williams 
replied all options are open and refused to discuss them 
further 
navy sources said the coral sea on duty with the 6th fleet in 
the mediterranean left a few hours ahead of its scheduled 
departure 
the carrier is accompanied by its battle group which included 
the nuclear cruiser virginia and the aegis cruiser san jacinto 
said the sources who spoke on the condition they not be identified 
also on hand is a 2400member marine contingent known as the 
amphibious readiness group which is aboard three ships designed to 
aid any landing assault they are ordered to carry out the sources 
said 
overall there are some 24 us ships in the mediterranean at 
this time with approximately 20 others in the persian gulf and 
indian ocean region the sources added 
the battleship iowa which is not allowed to use its 16inch 
guns pending the outcome of a navy inquiry into the april explosion 
in one of its three turrets is on a port call in marseilles 
france the sources said the ship is equipped with a variety of 
weapons including cruise missiles that could be used if 
necessary sources said 
a pentagon official familiar with the options presented to the 
president confirmed that they included such possibilities as the 
bombing or shelling of certain areas a surgical strike against 
specific terrorist camps or even a simple showoftheflag of 
the us forces on duty in the region 
a lot of these options have been around for some time said 
the official who noted that crises in the middle east have 
bedeviled more than one recent president 
the joint chiefs staff draws up such options for consideration 
by the president and national security council and includes the 
pros and cons of each step 
this isnt a situation where they had to come up with a lot of 
original thinking some of these options have been on the shelf for 
some time in many cases they dusted em off and evaluated them in 
light of the current situation said the official 
he cautioned however that there is little indication that any 
highlevel planning for a fullblown military strike is underway 
for example the joint chiefs of staff have not met he noted 
and the pattern of the pentagon in recent history has been to 
use military force as only the last resort the source said 
these guys have been on the cautious side he said 
each option must be assessed for the kind of target it presents 
the type of weaponry eeded the type of forces that may be deployed 
against us forces and the kind of collateral damage or 
number of civilians that might be killed in any action the source 
said 
but as in many past cases dealing with the us hostages such 
considerations are not viewed from a strictly limited military 
point of view the pentagon officials noted 
as one army source said with the power of the 6th fleet we 
could blow beirut off the map but what good would that do

polands communist president and roman 
catholic prelate dedicated a monument tuesday to the fighters in 
warsaws doomed 1944 uprising against the nazis in which more than 
200000 poles perished 
sirens wailed throughout the city at 5 pm the hour when the 
uprising began 45 years ago 
in the evening after the official ceremony attended by 
president wojciech jaruzelski and cardinal jozef glemp the 
opposition movement held its own observance attended by solidarity 
lawmakers they went by bus from parliament to a different newly 
dedicated monument in powazki cemetery that monument is dedicated 
to the leaders of the underground resistance during world wasr ii 
the waraw uprising and its brutal aftermath remain controversial 
in poland because most of the underground leaders were loyal to the 
wartime governmentinexile in london which was not recognized by 
soviet dictator josef stalin 
many poles believe stalin deliberately withheld help for the 
warsaw fighters allowing the nazis to wipe them out while the red 
army stalled its advance on the eastern side of the vistula river 
that runs through warsaw 
stalin also refused british requests to let relief planes land 
behind red army lines to supply the 63day uprising 
when the red army arrived in warsaw in january 1945 after the 
nazis had systematically destroyed the city no significant force 
remained to resist the communist takeover of the country 
in the years immediately after world war ii the anniversary of 
the uprising was not observed and soldiers of the resistance home 
army who remained in poland often were imprisoned and deported to 
siberia or executed 
jaruzelski referred indirectly to those events in his speech at 
the new monument near the citys old town section 
this epoch included injustice human harm and concealment 
he said this book has already been closed 
the atmosphere is different today said jan kostrzewski who 
served as a doctor in the uprising and who headed the committee 
that erected the monument after more than 40 years efforts are 
made to repair the wrongs but it is not easy to remove from 
our hearts the bitter sediment 
glemp later consecrated the monument with holy water as 
jaruzelski in full military uniform looked on the first time in 
memory that a polish leader took part in such a religious ceremony 
the communist government normalized relations with the polish 
church this year and established diplomatic relations with the 
vatican

anguished relatives of hostage joseph 
cicippio reacted to his twoday reprieve tuesday with caution and 
hope that his captors would free him after three years 
i am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endure 
this for another two days said david cicippio 27 we are 
being held hostage just like my father he said waiting out the 
crisis at his uncle thomas home 
david cicippio an electronics technician from north wales pa 
voiced frustration with the latest ordeal which was provoked by 
the israeli abduction of a shiite moslem cleric sheik abdul karim 
obeid last week 
cicippios shiite captors on monday set an 11 am edt deadline 
tuesday for obeids release but more than two hours later at 115 
pm edt the extremists announced a 48hour extension 
the revolutionary justice organization announced cicippios 
reprieve in a 13line handwritten statement in arabic delivered to 
the independent beirut newspaper annahar 
the threat came shortly after another group said monday it had 
hanged hostage lt col william r higgins in retaliation for 
obeids abduction 
cicippios brother thomas who earlier tuesday told reporters he 
was depressed and nervous as the deadline approached called 
the extension good news for all of us 
when i got up this morning i really didnt think there was 
much of a chance we would get a reprieve cicippio said for 
the next two days we want to see what kind of movements take 
place 
peggy say the sister of terry anderson the longestheld 
hostage agreed that the extension could improve the situation 
i think the longer they talk the longer they delay the 
greater the chances that we may turn this around and get them all 
home said ms say in nashville tenn 
anderson 41 was the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press when he was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
former hostage david jacobsen said the israeli action that 
apparently led to the reported hanging of higgins may have spoiled 
plans for andersons release 
jacobsen speaking from his colorado home said sources in 
london told him that anderson was to be freed last saturday by the 
new iranian government as a gesture of good will 
joseph cicippio 58 was acting comptroller at the american 
university of beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus sept 
12 1986 
among those gathered at thomas cicippios home were joseph 
cicippios sons david and joseph jr 34 whose mother and cicippio 
are divorced and his brother anthony 
its time we took some kind of action who knows what kind of 
threats are going to be made in the next 48 hours i have president 
bush in my prayers and i pray that he makes the right choice 
david cicippio said 
he was asked if he meant military action and the possibility 
that it would endanger his fathers life 
if my fathers life was taken it would be for a worthy 
cause he said i feel whatever it takes to get them home 
should be done it would be a message no more hostages should be 
taken 
thomas cicippio on tuesday however repeated his opposition to 
the use of military action to rescue his brother 
this has to be solved by diplomacy cicippio said 
while the cicippio family waited in norristown joseph 
cicippios current wife elham tearfully pleaded with his captors 
at a news conference in beirut 
please dont execute him please said mrs cicippio who 
works at the american embassy in east beirut 
she read a message to her husband joe i know the difficulty 
of the situation in which we are but all i ask you is to keep your 
hopes high

five gunmen dragged a leader of 
guatemalas ruling christian democratic party out of his home 
tuesday and shot him dead witnesses and officials said 
police said no group claimed responsibility for kiling danilo 
barillas rodriguez and the motive was not clear president vinicio 
cerezo who went to the scene called his friend a victim of 
democracy 
i am deeply concerned this is deplorable cerezo told 
reporters 
cerezo took office in january 1986 for a fiveyear term as the 
first elected civilian president after 16 years of rightist 
military rule 
leftist guerrillas have fought the government for four decades 
and rightwing death squads also have operated in guatemala

commission in charge of urban planning and development since 1987 
he previously served as guatemalas ambassador to spain general 
secretary of the christian democratic party and member of the 
chamber of deputies 
cerezo blamed extremist groups for the slaying and promised 
the killers would be found 
witnesses said five armed men barged into barillas home and 
dragged him out they said the five opened fire after he managed to 
slip away and started running wounding him 
barillas then tried to dive under a parked car and one of the 
gunmen shot him dead the gunmen then fled on foot one of the 
witnesses said 
a police examiner at the scene said barillas body had at least 
30 bullet wounds 
as guatemalas ambassador to madrid barillas participated in 
talks between leaders of the revolutionary nationalist unity a 
coalition of the four guerrilla groups and a government delegation 
the talks were to establish grounds for peace negotiations but 
did not progress principally because the military insisted on 
complete surrender by the rebels 
barillas death comes amid mounting labor unrest and terrorist 
attacks one person was killed and several were injured in half a 
dozen bomb explosions in the capital over the past two weeks 
about 50000 public school teachers and government employees

a federal agency recommended tuesday that two 
companies involved in a sewer tunnel explosion that killed three 
workers be prosecuted on criminal charges 
the occupational safety and health administration sent the 
recommendation to the us attorneys office which will review the

return a phone call to his office in denver

lost 1495 million in the six months ending last march 31 and its 
losses for the previous fiscal year totaled 369 million 
hud officials have said the losses were a temporary phenomenon 
that resulted more from a predictable rise in mortgage defaults 
that followed a spurt in the housing market 
but a report last spring by the departments inspector general 
also said some of the losses are due to fraud 
despite the actions taken by the department the congress and 
our office schemes to defraud the insurance program continue 
the inspector generals report said we are unable to estimate 
exactly how much of the billions of dollars lost on foreclosed 
homes is due to these schemes 
the report also said the department cannot continue to 
sustain a high level of fraudrelated losses without an adverse 
effect on the overall mission of the insurance fund 
but in his letter kemp said fhas 9 million borrowers were in 
no peril 
kemp said fha has surrendered most of the decisionmaking to 
outside parties mostly the lenders 
hud has mismanaged this process such that lenders view this 
delegated authority as a right instead of a privilege and hud has 
failed in its efforts to firmly monitor and control lender 
activities kemps letter said 
kemp said fha would improve its accounting procedures so the 
agency would have a better idea of the financial health of the 
mortgage insurance fund in addition he said the agency would hire 
a large accounting firm to point out ways it can improve its 
mortgage underwriting practices

people exposed to asbestos or other toxic 
substances cant collect damages just because they may have an 
increased risk of cancer the state supreme court ruled tuesday 
the court ruled that people could collect damages only if they 
develop cancer or can prove through expert testimony that they have 
a better than 50 percent chance of getting the disease 
this is a decision that will have major national repercussions 
for asbestos and other toxic substance cases said attorney gita 
f rothschild who represented the three companies involved in the 
lawsuit 
there are 80000 cases like this pending in state and federal 
courts said ms rothschild in every single case involving 
toxic substances the plaintiffs allege the possibility of 
contracting cancer 
ms rothschild said the decision allows companies to pay 
damages for people who actually get sick 
the court relied heavily on a lower court ruling that allows 
workers and others who are exposed to toxic materials to collect 
damages after they have contracted cancer regardless of how long 
after exposure that occurs 
it also upheld a ruling that in new jersey damages may not be 
awarded for any future injury which is merely possible but not 
probable 
in a 51 decision the supreme court said roger mauro and his 
wife lois cannot collect damages for his fear that he may 
contract cancer after being exposed to asbestos fibers while 
working as a plumbersteamfitter for more than a decade at ancora 
state psychiatric hospital in hammonton 
mauro who said the exposure occurred when he ripped out old 
insulation found in 1981 that he had thickening of his chest walls 
and calcification of his diaphragm his doctor wrote that mauros 
exposure to asbestos has been significant and there is some 
evidence that this exposure may have increased the risk of 
developing lung cancer 
mauro sued product manufacturers owenscorning fiberglass of 
toledo ohio pittsburghcorning corp of pittsburgh keen corp of 
new york and eaglepicher industries of cincinnati claiming the 
companies failed to warn him of the risk 
the court said that although there is a high probability that 
mauro has an increased risk of cancer there is no evidence 
of the likelihood that the plaintiff will contract cancer 
mauros attorney gene locks did not return telephone calls on 
tuesday the opinion did not list mauros hometown

military spending underwent a sharp decline in 
developing countries in the 198587 period reflecting depressed 
economic conditions according to a government report released 
tuesday 
the report by the arms control and disarmament agency said world 
military spending reached the 1 trillion mark in 1987 for the 
first time but added that the higher level is less a reflection of 
increased military spending than of the statistical distortions 
created by the declining value of the dollar 
the report also said 
the soviet union outspent all other countries in the world in 
1987 with military outlays of more than 303 billion that year 
was the last for which comprehensive figures were available the 
study did not take into account recent promises by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to reduce military spending 
when the soviet total is combined with us military spending 
of 296 billion the superpower total exceeded the next largest 
spender by more than 8 to 1 in 1987 
france west germany and great britain assumed the third 
fourth and fifth positions respectively in military spending in 
1987 despite constitutional restrictions limiting military 
expenditures japan moved from 10th to sixth place worldwide 
military spending in the third world underwent a steady decline 
starting in 1985 when there was a 2 percent drop this was 
followed by a 58 percent decline in 1986 and 91 percent in 1987 
the report attributed the decrease to the depressed economic 
conditions in much of the developing world 
the spending decline was the sharpest was the middle east 
where the average outlays were down 12 percent for the 198487 
period and 15 percent in 1987 
the acda report published annually said there were 291 
million persons in uniform worldwide in 1987 a slight decline from 
1986 fifteen of the 20 largest armed forces were from developing 
countries including china india vietnam iraq turkey north 
korea iran south korea and pakistan 
in the area of arms transfers the report said the middle east 
was by far the largest weapons purchaser outstripping europe by 
almost 2 to 1 and latin america by 5 to 1 
the soviet union was the major arms supplier to the middle east 
accounting 34 percent of the total iraq was by far the largest 
recipient of soviet weaponry in the area acquiring 139 billion 
in 1987

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze announced tuesday that moscow was willing to mediate 
deadlocked peace talks between iran and iraq tehran radio reported 
shevardnadze who left tehran tuesday after a twoday visit 
also was quoted as telling irans presidentelect hashemi 
rafsanjani that iraq should withdraw from any iranian territory it 
still holds 
we deeply regret that a group of iranian and iraqi people are 
held captives but their release would be impossible before iraqs 
withdrawal from iranian soil the broadcast monitored in 
nicosia quoted shevardnadze as saying he referred to more than 
100000 prisoners of war held by both sides 
in a meeting with foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
shevardnadze said the soviet union was willing to exploit good 
relations with both persian gulf war foes in an effort to further 
the talks according to the broadcast 
iraniraq peace talks started five days after a unmediated 
ceasefire halted the 8year war last aug 20 but they deadlocked 
immediately 
further negotiations faltered over tehrans demand that iraq 
withdraw its troops from 380 square miles of iranian territory and 
baghdads insistence that the shatt alarab waterway should belong 
to iraq iran argues that sovereignty over the waterway should be 
shared 
referring to recently improved bilateral ties shevardnadze 
saidour two countries have opened a new chapter in relations 
the radio said velayati welcomed shevardnadzes offer to 
intercede in the peace talks 
the soviets iraqs main arms suppliers in the gulf war are 
thought to have leverage with baghdad 
shevardnadze also met tuesday with iranian premier hussein 
musavi the radio said 
during a june trip to moscow rafsanjani signed agreements worth 
6 billion including an arms agreement 
details of the arms deal were not released but iran is known to 
seeking new weaponry to rebuild its armed forces after the 
iraniraq war 
the soviets also will help iran rebuild several key industrial 
complexes damaged in the war construct new power stations and 
assist in offshore oil exploration 
the deals are to be partly financed through annual exports of 
iranian natural gas to the soviet union

highdefinition television is unlikely to be 
the salvation of the us electronics industry predicted by its 
boosters according to a report tuesday that instead pictured hdtv 
as a small fish in a big hightechnology pond 
the congressional budget office report said hdtv proponents have 
made very optimistic forecasts about big a market the next 
generation of video will gain the cbo also said that even under 
the rosiest forecasts hdtv sales will be small compared to other 
electronic equipment markets 
the cbo report said it was questionable how quickly consumers 
would accept hdtv which promises images with quality approaching 
those of 35mm motion pictures particularly if there are cheaper 
types of advanced tv receivers available 
it discounted claims that hdtv will drive the technology of the 
us electronics industry the cbo said the total world market for 
electronic equipment grew by 54 billion in 1988 to reach 461 
billion and the world market for hdtv receivers and vcrs is 
forecast to be less than 30 billion by the year 2010 
hdtv also will spur only marginal production of sophisticated 
memory chips which are widely used in other applications even now 
the report said 
for hdtv to add much to chip technology would be a case of the 
tail wagging the dog the report said 
nevertheless the report said government support of hdtv 
research might be justified by reason of increased employment 
national prestige or scientific advancement 
written by philip c webre the report was introduced at a 
hearing of the senate governmental affairs committee that is 
considering a possible government role in fostering the growth of a 
us highdefinition tv industry proponents say a quick government 
decision is vital in overcoming the japanese and european lead in 
the hdtv arena 
committee chairman sen john glenn dohio said the united 
states needs to preempt foreign competition on the product 
invented in this country 
in other hdtv developments tuesday 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee gave 
voice vote approval to a 305 million authorization bill for the 
commerce departments new technology administration in fiscal 1990 
the bill essentially doubles spending for the departments national 
institute of standards and technology and includes 75 million for 
nists internal lab work on advanced tv and 30 million in seed 
money to spur industrialled hdtv consortia 
the bill was amended to allow foreign companies to participate 
in the hdtv research consortia 
a house science space and technology subcommittee approved an 
amendment to the nist authorization bill to provide 100 million 
annually for three years for creating publicprivate consortia for 
hdtv development 
peter mccloskey president of the electronic industries 
association applauded the cbo report and said it would help shift 
the discussion from just hdtv to the need to find solutions for 
major economywide problems of primary importance to national 
competitiveness 
he said the real impact of hdtv will be on industries in which 
the united states already is a leader such as fiber optic 
communications movie and entertainment creation transmission and 
delivery systems 
tom long representing the american electronics association 
said the cbo report was narrowly focused on hdtvs potential 
use in home tv receivers long said hdtv would be a far more 
important technology driver in engineering workstations and 
personal computers and for development of better manufacturing 
techniques 
the aea has proposed a package of federal support for hdtv that 
would include 1 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 
manufacturing facilities and 300 million over three years to 
expand the 30 million already allocated to the defense advanced 
research projects agency for hdtv research 
the bush administration wants to spur hdtv through lower capital 
gains taxes a permanent tax credit on research and possible 
antitrust exemption for joint industry ventures

us district judge alcee l hastings of miami 
swore before his senate impeachment committee tuesday that he had 
nothing to do with a conspiracy to obtain a 150000 payoff in a 
florida racketeering case 
no sir hastings answered when asked by attorney terence 
anderson of miami if he had ever participated in such a scheme 
hastings 52 the first black federal judge in florida history 
is accused of plotting to obtain the bribe of lying about it to 
the 1983 jury that acquitted him and of an unrelated count of 
improperly disclosing information obtained from a federal wiretap 
impeached by the house last year he is now before a 12member 
panel gathering evidence before the whole senate votes on whether 
to remove him from the bench and deprive him of his 89500 annual 
salary 
besides hearing from hastings the committee on tuesday also 
voted 120 to move disbarred washington attorney william borders a 
step closer to being held in contempt and perhaps jailed for 
refusing to testify 
borders who spent 33 months in prison after being convicted in 
the case refused twice last week to discuss his part in the 
alleged conspiracy citing his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and other constitutional rights 
the matter now goes to the full senate and if approved from 
there to a court that would be asked to force borders to testify or 
be held in civil contempt and jailed 
under questioning from anderson hastings offered an explanation 
for one of the key points being used against him on sept 16 
1981 he appeared for dinner at 8 pm in the dining room of the 
fontainebleau hotel in miami 
a few days earlier borders had promised to produce hastings in 
the dining room at that time on that date the idea was to prove he 
could influence the judge and thus encourage a payoff from a man he 
believed to be a defendant trying to buy his way out of a 
threeyear racketeering sentence 
actually he made the remark to an fbi undercover agent wearing 
a hidden tape recorder 
hastings testified he went to the fontainebleu that night with a 
date because borders had suggested that he would meet him there at 
the time borders was in las vegas for a prizefight between sugar 
ray leonard and thomas hearns hastings said the failure of borders 
to materialize was not that unusual and that it did not surprise 
him 
throughout the case hastings has maintained that borders a 
longtime friend and law school classmate was a rainmaker who 
boasted of influence he did not actually have as a means of 
drumming up clients 
hastings also offered an explanation for behavior that 
prosecutors say suggests an effort to elude the fbi on oct 9 
1981 the day that borders was arrested as he drove out of a 
suburban virginia motel with a garment bag stuffed with cash and 
undercover agent h paul rico by his side 
at the time hastings was in the lenfant plaza hotel in 
washington preparing for a testimonial dinner in honor of borders 
then a leader in the national bar association and according to a 
house report and several witnesses a figure who wielded influence 
at the white house in the late 1970s 
told of the borders arrest hastings swiftly left for florida 
and went miles out of his way to baltimorewashington international 
airport to catch a plane when washingtons ntional airport was only 
minutes away 
i went there to get a flight that i thought would get me to 
fort lauderdale hastings testified i really expected to 
see the fbi at the national airport the baltimore airport or fort 
lauderdale 
agents found him later that night in miami at a friends home

senate republican leader bob dole of kansas on 
tuesday threatened a parliamentary maneuver that could help force 
passage of president bushs savings and loan bailout before 
congress goes on vacation by attaching it to essential legislation 
a democraticcontrolled housesenate conference committee last 
week voted to send landmark sampl legislation to the full house and 
senate for final action this week 
but bush and congressional democrats are feuding over the 
democratbacked financing plan in the package bush proposes an 
accounting maneuver to exclude 50 billion in sampl spending from the 
official budget deficit while the democratic plan would send the 
deficit soaring over the next three years but not count the sampl 
portion against official deficit limits 
the two sides are deadlocked with each claiming to have enough 
votes to block the plan in the senate under that chambers rules 
60 of 100 senators must vote to approve either financing plan 
in a letter to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and house speaker thomas foley dwash dole said he may move to 
attach the sampl legislation with the republican financing plan to 
another piece of legislation that must be passed for the government 
to continue operating 
dole said he may attempt to package the sampl bill with another 
bill raising the nations debt limit above 28 trillion the 
administration says unless the debt limit is increased the 
government is in danger of running out of borrowing authority in 
midaugust while congress is scheduled to leave town on friday of 
this week 
if the government cant legally borrow money theoretically it 
would be forced to shut down 
a bill passed by the house and sent to the senate on tuesday 
would raise the debt limit by 70 billion enough to keep the 
government operating through october 
dole said he was responding to a threat by the house to pass the 
sampl bill with the democratic financing plan and then recess for a 
month that would leave the senate with no choice but to accept the 
democratic plan or put off passage of sampl legislation until after 
labor day 
i strongly object to such a takeitorleaveit approach since 
this action may delay final passage of the sampl legislation until 
september dole wrote in my view neither house of congress 
should adjourn until the sampl legislation is completed 
on wednesday the house rules committee is expected to schedule 
a house vote on thursday the senate vote would follow on friday 
the day congress expects to recess 
in other sampl news federal regulators said late tuesday they 
took control of a thrift institution in lubbock texas bringing 
the number under government control to 254 in 33 states 
the institution caprock savings and loan association had 
assets of 457 million and deposits of 414 million in 12733 
accounts the takeover by the federal deposit insurance corp 
will not affect depositors 
the fdic has been taking over the sickest of the nations failed 
sampls since february the goal is to minimize losses and supervise 
operations until congress approves the funding needed to close or 
merge the institutions

the united states pressed diplomatic efforts 
tuesday for the release of all american hostages in lebanon and 
hoped that soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze could 
make headway in that direction on a mission to iran 
the immediate concern us and other diplomatic sources said 
was joseph j cicippio a 58yearold university comptroller whose 
execution was threatened after the reported slaying of marine lt 
col william r higgins the deadline set by cicippios captors was 
extended 48 hours 
intrigued by the reprieve us officials left open the 
possibility it was prompted by iranian intervention 
having no diplomatic ties to iran whose surrogates in lebanon 
are believed to be holding eight americans other than higgins the 
united states appealed to saudi arabia and other arab governments 
as well as the soviet union for help 
during the day president bush telephoned the pope and turkish 
prime minister turgut ozal and spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bushs strategy was to stay alert to opportunities be constantly 
assessing the situation and talk to a lot of people involve a lot 
of people to help the hostages 
in israel meanwhile ambassador william brown held a fastpaced 
series of meetings with prime minister yitzhak shamir defense 
minister yitzhak rabin and foreign minister moshe arens 
one of the aims is to find out what israel plans to do said 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity he denied the 
united states was exerting pressure on israel whose abduction last 
week of shiite sheik abdul karim obeid and two others prompted 
higgins captors to threaten to hang him unless the three were set 
free 
brown was under instruction from washington to find out from the 
israeli government what further steps it planned to take in the 
dangerous hostage situation 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
united states had not asked israel to release obeid 
she cited us policy against dealing with or making concessions 
to terrorists 
no we have not because you know our longstanding policy on 
hostages and israel understands the us policy on the matter of 
hostages ms tutwiler said 
referring to israels offer to trade the cleric and the two 
others to hezbolloah for all foreign hostages including three 
israelis ms tutwiler again cited us policy which prohibits 
deals with hostagetakers 
israel as a sovereign nation has a different policy she 
said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and others had urged 
president bush on monday to seek some understanding with the 
israelis about future conduct that would endanger the lives of 
americans 
marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary appeared to 
agree that israel was operating at crosspurposes with the united 
states he said it was fair to say that many people do share the 
senators concerns 
but a senior us official aboard the us air force jet that 
carried secretary of state james a baker iii home monday night 
from a conference in paris on cambodia said bush and baker were 
not criticizing israel for what it did 
the official who demanded anonymity said thats not the 
interpretation to be given statements by bush and baker 
criticizing kidnappings in general 
and dole in a speech tuesday on the senate floor said a 
line has been drawn in the sand its not between the united states 
and its allies between the united states and israel it is a 
much clearer and more permanent line between those who practice 
and profit from terrorism and those who are its victims 
arens interviewed by cbs news tuesday night said i dont 
see why anybody in the civilized world that is engaged in the fight 
against terrorism would now suggest that this murderer should now 
be released or that his apprehension was a mistake 
areans said i think in retrospect we will see that we struck 
a very effective blow against terrorism also he maintained i 
dont think there is a wedge between israel and the united states 
in stockholm sweden the united states asked the soviet union 
tuesday to use its influence with iran to gain the release of 
western hostages john kelly assistant us secretary of state 
was meeting there with nikolai kozyrev a soviet official on the 
subject of afghanistan 
we asked the soviet union to use its good offices to influence 
the iranian government to bring about their safe and immediate 
release kelly told reporters 
shevardnadze was asked before baker left paris to use his 
influence with the iranians in behalf of the hostages all of whom 
are believed held by proiranian factions other us diplomats 
made similar appeals to soviet officials 
the soviets are improving relations with iran after the death of 
the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the united states has been 
concerned about soviet willingness to provide military assistance 
to iran and stressed freedom for all foreign hostages should take 
priority 
a diplomatic source said israeli officials in their talks with 
ambassador brown were sharing information about the militant party 
of god of which obeid is a senior leader 
israel has offered to release the cleric and the two others if 
all foreign hostages are freed the offer still stands said 
the source declining to be identified 
asked if the bush administration was pressuring israel to 
release obeid or to take some other action he said there is no 
such thing 
if higgins was executed and us officials viewed the 
videotape of his reported hanging there is no certainty within 
the administration when he was slain that he might have been 
executed weeks or even months ago is one reason us officials are 
reluctant to conclude the israeli abduction of obeid sealed his 
fate 
meanwhile the israeli embassy issued a sevenpoint statement 
defending its counterterrorism policy and registering shock and 
horror about the higgins situation 
in our ongoing struggle against terrorism we have found the 
hezbollah to be a most bloody deceitful and extremist terror 
organization the statement said so far they have killed 
about 300 americans more than 70 frenchmen and dozens of israelis 
if it were not for the vigilance of the israeli defense force 
which has repeatedly thwarted their terrorist incursions many more 
innocent lives would have been lost

add one more lump to the list of hard 
knocks gov michael s dukakis has endured this year his own 
hometown planned tuesday to sue his administration over how local 
aid is doled out to cities and towns 
brookline an affluent town just outside of boston has 
faithfully backed dukakis since his political career began as a 
state representative in 1962 but at 9 am wednesday attorneys 
for the town planned to file a lawsuit in suffolk superior court 
essentially accusing dukakis of being unfair to his home town and 
scores of others 
selectman chairman jeffrey allen a longtime supporter of 
dukakis called the move painful and emotional but necessary 
the administration responded icily by saying that the concerns of 
all communities would be considered regardless of who lived there 
its a very difficult decision for those of us in brookline to 
take allen said tuesday 
to get to the point of where were actually suing the state or 
the governor over his actions is a very painful emotional step for 
me to come to but i think he was wrong and i dont think his 
actions in changing the local aid formula are legally defensible 
the issue of state financial aid to cities and towns for 
schools police and fire protection has been a particularly hot 
topic this year the states budget troubles which many blame on 
dukakis have led to sharp reductions in local aid 
brookline argues that dukakis has violated state law by using 
one formula to distribute local aid and another to cut it in 
brooklines case the use of two formulas means that instead of 
facing a local aid reduction of 11 million the actual reduction 
will be 19 million 
weve benefited in good years and if we have to suffer in lean 
years well do that what we wont do is suffer disproportionately 
with other communities allen said 
dukakis was at a national governors conference in chicago 
tuesday and unavailable for comment 
john hanson a fiscal aide to the governor defended the use of 
a different local aid formula designed to favor poorer communities 
in cutting grants to cities and towns 
but he added that the governor has not made a final decision on 
whether the controversial formula will even be used dukakis has 
until thursday morning to make that decision thats when local 
aid figures are slated to go out to communities 
the concerns that cities and towns are expressing certainly 
weigh into consideration hanson said i dont think the 
concerns of one particular town whether its the governors home 
town or not is particularly relevant at this point 
dukakis last month reduced local aid by 210 million the use of 
a second formula came to light when it was revealed that 100 
million of those cuts would be made on a per capita basis instead 
of a complicated needs basis formula by which aid is 
distributed 
hanson defended the per capita formula which he said would hurt 
the poorest communities least because it avoids cutting local aid 
under the same formula as it was given out that method distributed 
most of the money to the neediest communities 
to cut local aid under the original formula hanson said 
undoes what weve been trying to do for the last six years 
when the legislature overrode the 100 million cut dukakis 
announced he would withhold the money anyway using his power to 
impound funds but his fiscal aides said this week he is not bound 
to the controversial per capita formula 
brookline town administrator richard t leary said the town 
planned to sue before dukakis made his decision on the formula 
because thats the only way an allegedly unfair distribution of 
funds can be prevented were the town to wait he said the checks 
figuratively would already be in the mail

union leaders on tuesday called off a 3weekold 
national dock strike that had faltered because more longshoremen 
were back on the job than were out on strike 
about 1000 returned to work monday after employers threatened 
to fire anyone who stayed out on tuesday employers said 3727 men 
were working 2682 remained on strike and 43 of the 60 affected 
ports were operating normally 
the transport and general workers union called the strike after 
the government abolished a guaranteed lifetime employment 
arrangement at the 60 ports 
members of the unions executive committee voted 1812 to end 
the strike four days after longshore leaders voted overwhelmingly 
to continue and intensify it 
ron todd secretarygeneral of the union said ending the strike 
was a question of recognizing the realities that are going on 
around us 
the union said it would continue pressing for reinstatement of 
longshoremen who were fired for striking and would bargain for 
local agreements to replace the national guaranteedemployment plan 
nicholas finney director of the national association of port 
employers said this is a profoundly sensible decision which 
will save the tgwus members any further heartache the industry 
can now get on with the task of building a prosperous and 
successful industry in partnership not conflict 
michael meacher of the opposition labor party called the outcome 
proof positive that it is becoming impossible even with 
overwhelming right on your side to hold a legal strike in 
britain 
curbing the power of unions has been a priority of margaret 
thatcher the conservative party prime minister

a senate subcommittee on tuesday approved a 
bill omitting federal funds for a refurbishing of vice president 
quayles official residence but panel members said the money could 
still be put back 
four days ago the house provided 200000 to remodel the third 
floor of the 1894 victorian mansion since shortly after last 
falls election the quayles have said the third floor would have 
to be renovated to accomodate the familys three children but they 
have repeatedly said the work would be financed privately 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the appropriations 
treasury and postal subcommittee said his panel omitted the money 
from a spending bill because he had not received justification for 
the work from the administration 
we will surely take care of their needs deconcini said 
just give us a little plan even on the back of a napkin or 
something 
the ranking republican on the subcommittee sen pete domenici 
of new mexico said he had been told by an aide to quayle that the 
failure to request the funds was an oversight 
thats such a different group of occupants than weve had in 
the past domenici said of the quayle family 
the lawmakers indicated they expected the money to be approved 
either by the full appropriations committee or by the senate 
perhaps later this week 
the funds would be part of the 184 billion measure for the 
treasury department postal programs and related purposes for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 that the subcommittee approved tuesday 
like the house version the senate bill contained a oneyear 
delay in implementation of section 89 a portion of the tax code 
designed to encourage companies to provide health plans to lowpaid 
employees businesses have complained that complying with the 
measure is timeconsuming and expensive 
the threestory mansion at the naval observatory grounds on the 
embassy row section of massachusetts avenue in washington has 
been used as official residence for vice presidents since 1975 
when george bush was vice president the third floor was used for 
storage barbara bushs office and a maids bedroom 
friends of the quayles have raised about 200000 in donations 
for the work according to denise balzano chief of staff to the 
vice presidents wife marilyn 
earlier this year mrs quayle invited members of the house 
appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee to examine the 
mansion balzano said the invitation was made to keep congress 
informed of the planned work 
a subcommittee aide visited the mansion and agreed that the work 
was needed the treasury and postal bill approved friday by the 
house included 200000 for the job 
we didnt plan to put it into this budget rep edward 
roybal dcalif chairman of the subcommittee said in an 
interview on monday she called our attention to it 
none of the work has been done balzano said plans call for the 
construction of four bedrooms a family room an office for mrs 
quayle three bathrooms and a room for a washer and dryer 
the first floor of the mansion is used for entertaining while 
the second floor has a master bedroom and a guest room 
the quayles children are tucker 15 benjamin 12 and corinne 
10 currently they sleep elsewhere in the house

through its very limited said coast guard spokesman lt pat

the selfpropelled rig avco 5 was headed to shore with 14 people 
aboard early monday when it capsized about 20 miles off the

facing criticism that israels abduction of a 
shiite moslem clergyman endangered foreign hostages israeli 
officials mounted a counterattack tuesday and said the action was a 
necessary part of the war on terrorism 
despite a public show of unity sources said sharp internal 
divisions emerged in israels government about the operation in 
which sheik abdulkarim obeid was kidnapped from his home in 
southern lebanon on friday 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists said monday they killed one 
of the us hostages marine lt col william r higgins because 
israel did not release obeid 
we will see if decisions were taken without thinking about the 
results and not taking into account possible developments israel 
tv quoted one legislator as saying 
the broadcast said opposition to the abduction is increasing but 
most legislators were observing silence 
the television report said defense minister yitzhak rabin will 
address parliament wednesday in response to three motions of 
noconfidence submitted by farleft parties over the raid the 
debate will be broadcast live on army radio 
the decisionmaking inner cabinet is set to discuss the raid on 
wednesday 
to prevent further strains in usisrael relations the foreign 
ministry set up a sixmember team to monitor reaction to the 
hostage crisis several israeli leaders also appeared on us tv 
programs to explain israels actions 
i understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in the 
united states foreign minister moshe arens said on abcs good 
morning america 
but i think that it is important that we reserve our anger 
against those who are responsible for this situation against the 
terrorists of the hezbollah movement 
arens later said on cbs evening news that obeid was a man 
who was in charge of terrorist activities for the hezbollah in 
southern lebanon he is directly responsible for the kidnapping of 
col higgins if col higgins was executed he obeid was 
directly responsible for the death and i dont see why anybody 
in the civilized world would now suggest that this murderer 
should now be released or that his apprehension was a mistake 
i think in retrospect we will see that we struck a very 
effective blow against terrorism 
israels abduction of obeid prompted indirect criticism from 
president bush who said all hostagetaking hindered peace efforts 
in the middle east 
in toughly worded statements after the reported killing some 
members of the us congress criticized israel for not coordinating 
its actions with the united states in advance and for failing to 
anticipate that the abduction would threaten the lives of americans 
held hostage in lebanon 
the statements raised concern about israels relations with the 
united states which provides 3 billion a year in annual military 
and economic aid 
we call upon the american people not to allow this outrage to 
drive a wedge between the united states and israel let us stand 
together in the fight against terrorism said foreign ministry 
spokesman alon liel 
harry wall israel director of the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith said israel is in a war fighting against an enemy 
that doesnt play by the norms and rules that the west shares put 
otherwise you cant wear kid gloves in a brassknuckle 
neighborhood 
israeli officials disputed that the obeid kidnap triggered 
higgins death saying there were strong indications he was killed 
six months to one year earlier in retaliation for the us downing 
of an iranian jetliner 
they portrayed obeid as a guerrilla leader in the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god even though some experts characterized 
him as more of a propagandist 
the army said that based on interrogations obeid was involved 
in car bomb attacks infiltration attempts and the kidnapping of 
higgins 
hes quite a big fish he knows and has been telling us a 
great deal about hezbollah terrorist operations deputy foreign 
minister benjamin netanyahu said on cbs this morning 
israeli media said there was behindthescene criticism that the 
cabinet failed to consider the possibility that hezbollah would 
retaliate against western hostages instead of israels three 
prisoners of war 
it is now clear that in the cabinet meeting in which the 
kidnapping was approved a script was not presented to the 
ministers which took into account the execution of the foreign 
hostages in lebanon israel radio said 
both police minister chaim barlev and mordechai gur a cabinet 
minister without portfolio disputed the claim saying all possible 
ramifications were taken into account 
one member of the cabinet energy minister moshe shahal of the 
leftleaning labor party disclosed that he had voted against the 
abduction at a cabinet meeting july 26 the operation was approved 
by 111 
another official said israel did not anticipate the intensity of 
world reaction perhaps we underestimated the extent of the media 
coverage of this crisis he said

a diesel fuel spill stretched two miles 
over a lake tuesday after a freight train partially derailed 
sending two 25000gallon fuelcarrying cars crashing down an 
embankment authorities said 
burlington northern railroad crews were clearing wreckage from 
the site four miles north of whitefish in northwest montana where 
29 cars of the 100car train derailed monday several cars 
including the fuelcarrying tankers went down the 100foot 
embankment into whitefish lake no injuries were reported 
burlington spokesman gus melonas said the company was using 
containment booms to stop the fuel slick from spreading further it 
will take about four days to pump the fuel off he said 
melonas did not know how much fuel had leaked into the lake a 
popular recreation site but said the tankers were full when the 
train derailed 
workers were using wooden pegs and other material to slow the 
leakage 
they were actually using limbs and whatever they could put 
their hands on to plug the holes said roger jacobsen a 
burlington operations manager 
the spilled fuel covered an area two miles long and nearly a 
halfmile wide said whitefish city attorney tom muri 
gov stan stephens planned to tour the area wednesday morning 
he declared a state of emergency on monday 
the derailment occurred just as the train emerged near the west 
shore of the lake burlington officials said an empty box car in 
the middle of the train derailed before the train entered the area 
it became wedged sideways in a narrow rock cut like a cork in a 
bottle and cars behind it jackknifed and then popped loose once 
they emerged from the cut above the embankment 
twentyone of the cars were empty melonas said of the eight 
remaining cars five contained diesel fuel and three were carrying 
lumber 
melonas said officials hoped to reopen the track wednesday

three hours tuesday before finding four people guilty of plotting 
to kill six federal witnesses 
the us district court jury also found three of the defendants 
guilty of plotting an escape from the cabell county jail

and vondia clary 35 both of huntington were found guilty of one 
count of conspiracy to kill a federal witness four counts of 
attempting to kill witnesses one count of conspiracy to escape 
from federal custody among other charges 
mccoys son kennis kip mccoy 22 of pike county ky was 
found guilty of all the charges except the escape charge and one of 
the attempted murder charges 
were just glad were finished with all the prosecutions of 
john p mccoy said assistant us attorney ben bryant 
what the evidence in these various prosecutions has 
demonstrated and whats remarkable is the way john p mccoy 
managed to use other people and recruit them into his criminal 
schemes and how many other people have become involved and 
subsequently prosecuted and convicted including his young son 
at the time of the plots in march april and may john mccoy 
faced federal bank robbery counterfeiting and murder charges 
nance and clary had been charged with distributing cocaine 
attorneys for three of the defendants declined to comment after 
the verdict 
joseph martorella attorney for kip mccoy said he would file a 
complaint alleging prosecutorial misconduct martorella said 
prosecutors brought a witness in at the last minute without 
informing him 
us district judge charles haden ii revoked bond for clary and 
kip mccoy after their convictions nance and john mccoy already 
were being held without bond 
in closing arguments earlier tuesday defense attorneys ripped 
prosecutors use of a career criminal as star witness bryant 
however called the defendants cutthroats who would do anything 
to escape prosecution 
these are desperate people each and every one of them 
bryant said they were in a desperate situation and they took 
desperate actions 
in their closing arguments all four defense attorneys ridiculed 
the prosecutions chief witness willie cremeans of huntington 
cremeans allegedly the triggerman in the wouldbe killings 
cooperated with authorities and secretly tape recorded several 
telephone and personal conversations with the defendants in 
return prosecutors promised to help cremeans on a robbery charge 
willie cremeans is going to make up any story that will keep 
him out of jail said wright 
willie cremeans was a puppet said flora willie cremeans 
is the one constant factor here willie cremeans dont want to go 
back to prison 
bryant said that if cremeans had not cooperated with 
authorities several people would be dead 
thank heavens for willie cremeans bryant said as much as 
theyve dumped on him in this case he did the right thing for the 
first time in his life 
the mccoys contended that they had asked cremeans to help 
investigate the charges against john mccoy nance said he plotted 
with cremeans to rob several people not to kill them clary said 
she sold an ar15 semiautomatic assault rifle to cremeans but 
didnt know what he planned to do with it 
bryant called the defenses crazy 
if ever in modern times there is a set of more clear facts 
colder facts presented to a jury in this state i hope i dont hear 
it said bryants coprosecutor paul billups 
sentencing for nance clary and kip mccoy was scheduled for oct 
10 in huntington john mccoy will be sentenced aug 14 the same 
day he is scheduled to be sentenced on earlier convictions of bank 
robbery and killing a federal witness

what remains of the jet engine that is 
believed have exploded and led to the crash of a dc10 in sioux 
city was shipped tuesday to the plant where the engine was 
manufactured investigators said 
national transportation safety board investigators at the 
evendale ohio general electric plant plan to take the engine 
apart and try to determine the sequence of events that led up to 
the july 19 crash of united airlines flight 232 in which 111 
people died 
ntsb spokesman alan pollock said the disassembly process would 
begin sometime in the next couple weeks 
the tailmounted no 2 engine apparently exploded and flying 
pieces severed all three of the airliners hydraulic systems which 
allow pilots to control the aircrafts altitude and direction 
without them the pilot has little control over the airplane 
investigators want to determine if something within the engine 
malfunctioned or if something entered it from outside pollock said 
the flight crew said the jet lost all of its hydraulic fluid 
shortly after the no 2 engine failed they struggled to guide the 
plane to the sioux city airport but one wing dipped and touched 
the ground just short of the runway and the jet cartwheeled 
breaking up and bursting into flames 
the investigation at the cras site at sioux gateway airport was 
nearly complete pollock said 
the field phase of the investigation will wind down by the end 
of the week and disband he said 
he said one ntsb investigator would remain in sioux city to 
oversee the search for missing engine parts particularly a fan 
assembly from the no 2 engine that is thought to have fallen in 
corn and soybean fields 
some pieces of the jet had been recovered near alta about 60 
miles east of sioux city 
investigators also have reconstructed part of the jets tail 
section and were examining it to determine how pieces of the engine 
penetrated the tail and hydraulic lines pollock said 
pollock said 12 ntsb teams were involved in the investigation

movement urged congress on tuesday to allow chinese students to 
remain in the united states as long as they feel endangered by 
returning home 
wuer kaixi also told admiring members of the congressional 
human rights caucus that if china persists in its brutal policy 
it is a government which is neither stable nor has a future 
he said he supports economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation 
against china that do not sacrifice us interests nor the 
sentiments of the chinese people 
the 21yearold beijing normal university student went 
underground and fled china in the wake of the june 34 crackdown in 
beijings tiananmen square that left hundreds perhaps thousands 
dead he has been named by china as one of the fugitives most 
wanted as a leader of the prodemocracy movement

through an interpreter he was treated as something of a hero by 
members of the caucus 
god bless you youve inspired the entire world rep 
charles bennett dfla told him 
wuer is on a fourday visit to washington that is to include 
meetings with congressmen unidentified white house officials and

embassy 
he is accompanied by liu yan a leader of hunger strikers in 
tiananmen square and shen tong a participant with wuer kaixi in a 
dialogue with chinese premier li peng before the armys violent 
crackdown 
wuer said china has already arrested 120000 prodemocracy 
students in its attempt to stamp out the movement 
one of the greatest worries of the more than 40000 chinese 
studying in the united states is that on return they will be 
subjected to all sorts of harm in reprisal for support of the 
democracy movement he said

congress would do everything possible to enable chinese 
students to remain in the united states so long as they feel

a special grand jury was impaneled tuesday to hear 
numerous allegations of safety violations at the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons plant including the illegal dumping of hazardous 
wastes 
chief us district judge sherman g finesilver told the 23 
grand jurors their only task during the 18month term would be to 
determine what criminal acts if any were committed at rocky flats 
nuclear weapons plant 
the plant which manufactures plutonium detonators for nuclear 
weapons is located 16 miles northwest of denver 
about 75 fbi agents and special officers from the environmental 
protection agency raided the plant on june 6 after a search warrant 
was issued on an affidavit containing more than 100 pages of 
allegations 
the affidavit accused rocky flats officials and employees of 
illegally dumping hazardous wastes into two streams that flow into 
water supplies serving four denver suburbs illegally operating an 
incinerator in a building closed by department of energy 
inspectors and altering documents to cover up those alleged 
activities 
government agents have recovered boxes of documents and numerous 
samples of soil and other material at the plant operated for the 
department of energy by rockwell international 
since the raid gov roy romer and doe officials reached an 
agreement allowing the colorado health department to monitor the 
plant more closely than before 
finesilver told jurors they had the option to return indictments 
or a written report twelve jurors must reach agreement on an 
indictment before one can be issued he said 
although prosecutors will present the case you are not a 
rubber stamp for activities of the us attorney finesilver 
said you must exercise your own individual judgment 
finesilver also told them they could expect to work about one 
week each month until the investigation is concluded 
working with us attorney mike norton on the case are assistant 
us attorney ken fimberg of denver and peter murtha a special

an american bar association panel recommended 
tuesday that public health officials rigorously protect the privacy 
of aids patients saying confidentiality is critical to the 
success of efforts to stop the spread of the deadly disease 
the organizationss aids coordinating committee said its 
18month study found discrimination persists against people who 
have aids or have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus 
that is believed to cause the disease 
the panel said the lack of laws ensuring confidentiality is 
keeping people who believe that they may have been exposed to the 
virus from seeking testing and counseling services 
confidentiality protections encourage individuals to come 
forward for voluntary testing counseling and research the 
committee said 
the committee recommended federal state and local laws barring 
discrimination against those who suffer from aids both to help 
treat the victims and to help advance research for a cure 
since the aids epidemic began people with aids and hiv 
infection have experienced discrimination in employment 
housing public accomodations and government services the report 
said 
it added discrimination impairs the countrys ability to 
limit the spread of the hiv virus by interfering with educational 
testing counseling and health care efforts 
those who oppose confidentiality for aids patients argue people 
may contract the contagious disease through unwitting contact with 
aids victims the debate has been the sharpest in public schools 
where residents of some communities have protested the presence in 
the classroom of children who have contracted aids or been exposed 
to hiv 
the aba report said that because aids is not spread through 
casual contact students who have been exposed should not be 
separated from classmates except in the rare instance when a 
particular child presents a substantial risk of transmitting the 
virus in a school setting 
the committee also recommended that its members provide more 
free legal aid to people infected with hiv 
the conclusions which were released in a statement by the aba 
are to be presented to the organizations annual meeting next week 
in honolulu where members will decide whether to make the 
recommendations formally on behalf of the entire association 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the incurable condition is believed caused by hiv and 
is spread through contact with blood or with semen from infected 
persons

the energy department unveiled on tuesday a 
fiveyear program costing 195 billion to correct environmental 
and health problems at the nations atomic weapons plants the 
first part of a cleanup that officials predict will take 30 years 
and cost many billions more 
energy secretary james d watkins provided a blueprint for the 
initial phase of the cleanup and restoration plan acknowledging 
the cost will be high and even an optimistic timetable passes 
much of the burden to the next generation 
after a toplevel review of the shortcomings in environmental 
and health protection measures at the government nuclear 
facilities the department said it proposes to spend 24 billion 
next fiscal year in correcting the shortcomings 
after that the annual bill is expected to steadily increase 
peaking at more than 4 billion in both fiscal 1994 and 1995 over 
the span of the cleanup effort which will stretch well into the 
next century the cost have been estimated anywhere from 90 billion 
to 150 billion 
the money which must still be approved by congress would be 
used to cleanup pollution where federal and state safety laws are 
violated repair faulty equipment and develop new procedures and 
technology for future waste disposal the department said 
the plan commits the department to develop a cleanup priority 
list containing known contamination and assessing the extend of 
yet unknown hazards the deparment also said it would release 
health records of workers at weapons facilities for scientific 
evaluation to determine the extent of risk 
a series of disclosures this year has revealed widespread 
neglect of safety and environmental safeguards at the weapons 
production plants a number of facilities including major weapons 
plants in colorado and ohio have been the subject of 
investigations by both the environmental protection agency and the 
fbi some key facilities have had operations shut down because of 
safety and environmental problems 
watkins also promised more openness on the part of the 
department and plant managers with state and federal authorities 
and an open dialogue on environmental health and safety 
concerns to ease public concern about the operation of the 
facilities 
watkins in remarks to the national press club reiterated that 
the departments efforts over the years to protect public health 
and the environment at the federal nuclear facilities has been 
shoddy and in some cases virtually nonexistent 
if we graded for quality control we wouldnt pass said 
watkins but he said the answer is not simply to fire everybody 
and put everybody in jail but to correct the operation of the 
facilities and establish safe procedures for the future 
most of the 195 billion will be used at 17 nuclear weapons 
plants or related facilities in a dozen states but some funds also 
will be allocated for cleanup efforts at more than 70 other 
government nuclear facilities most of which have long been shut 
down officials said 
the plan includes more than 4 billion in spending on the 
hanford complex of nuclear facilities in eastern washington state 
including 27 billion to deal with the highly toxic wastes that 
have accumulated there since world war ii 
the hanford cleanup is the most costly during the fiveyear 
period the department also wants to spend 34 billion at the 
savannah river site in south carolina most of that going for 
development of an improved waste storage and removal program 
other facilities that are earmarked for large portions of the 
195 billion are the oak ridge reservation complex in tennessee 
more than 27 billion and the idaho national energy laboratory 
nearly 22 billion 
watkins in a letter to members of congress called the 
fiveyear plan a major initiative in order to restore public 
credibility in the departments ability to operate safely its 
unique defense research and test facilities 
energy department officials estimated that about 1 billion over 
the next five years will be devoted to repairing equipment and 
correcting conditions at the facilities to bring them into 
compliance with federal and state environment and health laws 
another 9 billion is earmarked for cleaning contaminated sites of 
radioactive or otherwise hazardous wastes and another 9 billion 
to develop future waste management operations 
watkins acknowledged that the cleanup effort will be difficult 
and likely will run into problems not yet foreseen 
during his remarks watkins disclosed that the controversial 
rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado came within 
hours last friday of having to shut down for violating federal 
environmental laws 
the problem arose when a number of drums containing radioactive 
wastes were found stored in violation of epa regulations they 
were simply situated there at the plant and not in anybodys 
management plan watkins told reporters 
he said only hours before the epa had directed that the plant 
would have to shut down because of the violation an agreement was 
reached on how to deal with the drums 
i believe were now at the point that rocky flats can stay on 
line said watkins we now have a plan to deal with these 
contaminants

japanese gangsters raked in more than 93 billion 
last year in a mix of legal and illegal businesses the national 
police agency said in a report released tuesday 
it estimated that japans gangsters made about 32 billion just 
from sales of illegal drugs 
gambling blackmarketeering protection rackets and extortion 
were also listed as major operations 
income from construction real estate financing and other legal 
activities also contributed to the haul the report said 
the 1988 estimate was nearly 22 billion higher than in 1978 
the most recent year available for comparison said an npa 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the agency reports annually on gang activity but estimates gang 
income only every 10 years 
the report said the 86552 known gangsters as of the end of last 
year belonged to 3197 gangs across the nation the figures were 
roughly equal to those of 1987 
police say they can reliably estimate gang membership because of 
the japanese underworlds high profile it is not uncommon for a 
gang to operate from a wellmarked office or to make a list of its 
members available to police or the media 
the report said that while the number of gangsters seems to have 
leveled off over the past few years syndicates are showing a 
continued trend of consolidation increasing their strength by 
forming alliances over a wide area 
nearly 40 percent of all japanese gangsters commonly known as 
yakuza belong to the nations three largest syndicates the 
yamaguchigumi inagawakai and sumiyoshi rengokai which have 
branches covering most of the country 
though their operations are primarily domestic japanese gangs 
smuggle in drugs and guns from abroad and are believed to be 
setting up bases and operating overseas the report said it did 
not specify where but police have acknowledged yakuza activities 
in the philippines taiwan thailand and hong kong and also guam 
and hawaii 
yakuza find their expansion abroad hindered by the lack of large 
japanesespeaking communities police say 
the report said an increasing number of foreign gangs are 
operating in japan often with the consent of the domestic 
underworld it singled out taiwanese gangsters known to be an 
important source of stimulant drugs mostly methamphetamines

british imports tuesday in what the foreign minister called a 
gesture toward better relations between the two countries

exports to britain 
trade with britain will be treated in the same way as trade with 
any other country foreign minister domingo cavallo said

invaded and occupied the falkland islands a british colony since 
1833 british forces recaptured the islands off argentinas 
southern coast in a 74day war 
argentines call the islands the malvinas and claim they 
inherited them in 1810 after declaringindependence from spain 
argentina never formally declared an end to hostilities it has 
refused to allow british planes or ships to use argentine ports or 
to allow british companies to bid on argentine public projects 
britain says it wants to normalize trade relations with 
argentina negotiate a fishing agreement reestablish air links 
and reduce tension 
tuesdays trade development will be conveyed to britain by the 
brazilian embassy in london argentinas diplomatic representative 
there 
menem said after taking office on july 8 that he wants to 
normalize relations with britain last month menem said argentina 
would formally declare an end to hostilities if britain ended its 
150mile militarily enforced protection zone around the 
islands 
if mrs thatcher british prime minister margaret thatcher 
doesnt insist on the issue of sovereignty we wont either 
menem said shortly after taking office

mission controllers ordered voyager 2 to 
increase velocity and change direction slightly tuesday as the 
spacecraft began to come under the influence of the gravity tug of 
neptune some 21 million miles away 
data that voyager sent more than 27 billion miles back to earth 
confirmed the start of a command sequence to begin a 7minute 
firing of its thrusters said a statement from jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the firing had actually begun four hours and two minutes 
earlier the time it took the radio signal to reach earth from the 
distant craft 
confirmation of the maneuvers success was not expected until 
review of spacecraft telemetry later in the day 
the maneuver was to boost voyagers speed by 21 mph and nudge 
the oneton spacecraft slightly sideways jpl said voyager was 
traveling at 42187 mph 
two more corrections are planned to put voyager on a course to 
pass just 3000 miles above neptunes northern polar region on aug 
24 
flight engineers also reported that data shows neptunes 
gravitational attraction has slightly but detectably accelerated 
voyager 
the point at which the planets gravity began to have an effect 
is hard to pinpoint said lanny miller manager of the voyager 
flight engineering office 
voyager is always under the influence of the planets gravity 
but you dont see it in the data until youre real close miller 
said 
the spacecrafts cameras have thus far been observing the entire 
neptunian system but on saturday will begin observing specific 
points such as a large dark spot and smaller spots in the 
atmosphere 
the search for moons and ring arcs will also continue neptune 
was known to have only two moons until voyager 2 found a third moon 
last month 
voyager 2 was launched from florida in 1977 and flew past 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986

capsized fishing vessels in the stormy gulf of mexico by coast 
guard helicopter crews the coast guard also sent a patrol boat and 
a jet into the storm tuesday to take water pumps to two shrimp 
boats in trouble 
up to 15 inches of rain was forecast for parts of eastern texas 
where many areas remained saturated from tropical storm allison six 
weeks ago meteorologists said that with rivers and creeks still 
high from the earlier heavy rain residents in low floodprone 
areas should begin taking precautions 
the hurricanes sustained wind speed never exceeded 80 mph and 
decreased to 75 mph as it moved inland 
about three hours after the storm made landfall at 8 am cdt 
tuesday at high island it had weakened further and was downgraded 
to a tropical storm by tuesday night the storm had been downgraded 
to a tropical depression and all warnings had been discontinued 
but it continued to be a major rainmaker and tornado threat 
although there were no immediate reports of tornadoes 
at 8 pm cdt the center of the storm was located near latitude 
308 north and longitude 964 west or just north of college 
station texas maximum sustained winds had decreased to 30 mph 
also tuesday forecasters at the national hurricane center in 
florida were tracking tropical storm dean which carried top winds 
of 50 mph as it churned across the open atlantic but was not yet 
considered a threat to land 
in louisiana flash flood and tornado threats lingered but more 
than 11000 coastal residents headed back to their homes unscathed 
by their brush with chantal several beachfront homes in grand isle 
were destroyed but officials said the small town had missed the 
worst 
about 20 miles off the coast divers returned to another 
capsized chevron oil rig to search for 10 missing crewmen despite 
10foot seas and 43 mph winds left behind by the hurricane 
the rig leased from avis bourg co of folsom had left the 
worksite because of the threat of chantal and capsized on the way 
the agriculture department of mexico said tuesday that heavy 
rains brought on by chantal helped put out fires in the yucatan 
peninsula that have ravaged up to 370000 acres of jungle during 
the past two months 
tides at galveston texas were reported near normal within two 
hours of chantals landfall 
the johnson space center was closed when the nearby clear lake 
area recorded more than 10 inches of rain tuesday 
a galveston shelter housed some 1000 people for the night but 
it was closed by midday as the worst of the storm passed shelters

island a lightly populated fishing and resort community midway 
between port arthur and galveston 
my house started to move and its not a mobile home said

lyndon young of gilcrest found his house on stilts in good shape 
with only minor roof damage although it was surrounded by water 
by hurricane standards so far this is pretty minor if i get 
through this without losing my appliances and lawn mower and those 
kinds of things ill be lucky 
side roads on the bolivar peninsula east of galveston remained 
under water and people gathered at high spots to wait for the water 
to recede 
its one of the hazards of living down here said harry

second meeting in less than 24 hours with top advisers 
cicippios captors extended the deadline for his execution by 48 
hours to thursday it was not known if the message to iran had any 
influence on that decision a deadline set by kidnappers of british 
hostage terry waite passed with no immediate word from them 
although the white house said there was no direct 
confirmation of higgins death bush made a telephone call to 
pope john paul ii to ask his intercession to seek the return of 
higgins body as a humanitarian gesture fitzwater said 
the press secretary said the president and the pope in a 
12minute call also discussed the situation in lebanon the 
escalation of the fighting amid intense shelling and the difficulty 
of the arab leagues peace efforts 
officials said the united states also sent a strongly worded 
message to iran on behalf of the hostages we expect those who 
have influence over the hostage takers to exert that influence 
said one official who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
asked if iran had intervened to win the 48hour reprieve for 
cicippio the official said you could speculate it was perhaps 
through irans intervention but it could have been through syrias 
intervention or somebody elses intervention or it could have been 
none of the above 
fitzwater said we sent all the countries of the region the 
same kind of message privately that we sent them publicly he 
said there was no special appeal to iran beyond that since the 
united states does not have diplomatic relations with iran the 
swiss government serves as a conduit 
bush also called prime minister turgut ozal of turkey fitzwater 
said bushs strategy was to stay alert to opportunities be 
constantly assessing the situation and talk to a lot of people 
involve a lot of people to help the hostages 
trying to dispel any notion of a white house gripped by crisis 
bush went ahead with plans to entertain members of congress at a 
texasstyle barbecue on the white house south lawn with country 
music by the oak ridge boys 
alluding to the hostage crisis as he thanked the band and his 
guests bush said these are not easy days either in the congress 
or in the white house 
there are overwhelming events that concern everybody here 
bush said but even though there are complicated times i think 
an evening like this of just plain relaxation with friends is very 
significant and very important the audience applauded 
on capitol hill there was renewed debate about the decision of 
the israeli government to kidnap the moslem cleric abdul karim 
obeid his seizure last friday triggered the latest hostage crisis 
diplomatic sources said the united states cautioned israel 
against taking any precipitous action that might endanger the 
hostages 
amid apprehension over the hostages plight the united states 
pressed a diplomatic campaign for the release of all american 
captives in lebanon appealing for help from saudi arabia and other 
arab governments as well as the soviet union 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who was visiting 
tehran and other soviet officials acceded to us requests that 
moscow use its growing influence in iran on behalf of the hostages 
higgins wife robin said in washington through a spokeswoman 
it was impossible to determine from a videotape released by the 
kidnappers whether it was her husband who was shown hanging bound 
and gagged 
she called on his captors to give us proof of his condition i 
want my husband returned home 
fitzwater said the administration was relying largely on press 
reports about the hostages and he called the news troublesome 
and very discouraging to us as we follow this situation 
he said bush has expressed his personal outrage and openly has 
talked about the frustration in dealing with this kind of 
situation 
other than higgins there are eight american hostages held in 
lebanon including terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press 
stephen studdert a senior presidential assistant said bush was 
concerned that every military option has with it the 
possibility that those sites may be a place where american or in 
the case of terry waite british hostages are held 
studdert said white house chief of staff john sununu discussed 
the constraints of military options at some length during a 
morning staff meeting 
hinting against any imminent action fitzwater said he wanted to 
emphasize the importance that everyone acknowledges in taking the 
time to fully ascertain the facts to give a thorough assessment of 
the situation to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies 
and anyone else who has information on these kinds of issues and to 
generally give the matter a very thorough kind of assessment 
the crisis has not preoccupied the government on a fultime 
basis said fitzwater 
we do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere but we do want 
to portray one of concern and one in which the government shares 
the concern of the american people for its citizens held hostage 
fitzwater said 
former hostage david jacobsen said tuesday that his sources in 
london told him american hostage anderson was to have been released 
last saturday but that the israeli action put an end to the talk 
there was enough of a feeling that with the new leader in iran 
that perhaps he might want to reach some kind of accommodation with 
the west jacobsen said 
observers in the middle east and washington and andersons 
sister peggy say said they had heard no report about a pending 
release 
in congress on tuesday senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas said today i am not happy that one of our closest and 
most important allies israel has also struck out alone 
freelancing apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to win 
the release of some of its citizens held hostage 
dole added that he did not blame israel for higgins apparent 
death saying instead that his blood is on the hands of the 
assassins 
some white house officials privately expressed irritation at 
israel but fitzwater publicly tried to take some of the sting out 
of the criticism 
israel is a strong ally of the united states fitzwater 
said we have an enduring and vibrant relationship and interest 
in continuing their security and that certainly has not changed and 
will not change 
while israel has offered to swap obeid for israeli and american 
hostages in lebanon fitzwater said our policy has been very 
clear that we do not negotiate for the release of hostages 
israeli officials insisted that no pressure was being applied by 
the united states for israel to free obeid

yugoslavia recalled its ambassador 
to the united states because he was unable to stop congress from 
accusing yugoslavia of human rights abuses a newspaper said 
tuesday 
zivorad kovacevic yugoslavias envoy in washington since 1987 
returned to belgrade on monday he served only half the usual 
fouryear term as ambassador to washington said the newspaper 
vjesnik published in zagreb 
it is no secret that kovacevic was not viewed favorably by the 
political leadership of serbia the newspaper wrote serbia is 
the largest of yugoslavias six republics 
kovacevic a serb has come under fire from serbian politicians 
and the republics press since the us congress last month passed 
two resolutions claiming there were human rights violations in the 
strifetorn southern province of kosovo 
hundreds of protesters were given jail sentences following riots 
there in february and march by ethnic albanians protesting 
constitutional changes that gave serbia greater control over the 
provinces internal affairs 
at least 238 prominent ethnic albanian politicians businessmen 
and intellectuals were detained after a state of emergency was 
declared in the province 
serbian authorities said the measures were necessary to prevent 
ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent of kosovos population 
from aharassing the minority serbs 
although no official reason has been given for kovacevics 
recall vjesnik said it followed serbian accusations that he had 
not done enough to make the true situation in kosovo known in

twenty people mostly former officials or 
prominent republicans were able to snag about a fifth of the 
federal funds intended to renovate existing housing for the poor 
according to a report prepared for a senate committee looking into 
the scandals at the housing and urban development department 
the 20 were paid more than 57 million in consultant fees by 
developers who hired them to chase hud grants said the study 
prepared by the agencys inspector general paul adams 
adams work prepared at the request of senate banking committee 
chairman donald riegle jr dmich was to be presented at a 
committee hearing on wednesday a copy was obtained in advance by 
the associated press 
while adams has reported before on the use of consultants in 
obtaining funds from hud and many names involved have been made 
public previously the current study is the first attempt to 
determine the extent and expense of the practice 
of projects using consultants 45 were put in states notably 
colorado oklahoma nevada and wyoming which would not have 
qualified for the funds if huds eligibility formulas had been 
used the report said 
since october 1983 51 projects with 7268 apartments used 
consultants the report found that accounts for about 20 percent 
of all huds work in this area during that time 
joseph strauss a former assistant to thenhud secretary samuel 
pierce jr made nearly 17 million the most of all the 
consultants found by adams inquiry 
others earning high fees included former interior secretary 
james watt who got 300000 former hud secretary and now us 
trade representative carla hills who received 138445 and paul 
manafort a lobbyist and republican political strategist who got 
442000

reported not paying consultants bills in full 
one of those consultants was fred bush ambassadordesignate to 
luxembourg who has had 45000 in payments withheld since april 
bush who is no relation to the president but was the chief 
fundraiser for his 1988 campaign for the white house was paid 
215000 to help land hud funds for developers who hired him 
a related study by the general accounting office prepared by 
john m ols jr said developers were willing to pay high fees to 
the consultants because the structure and oversight of the hud 
programs made them virtually nolose propositions 
in this manner developers were able to realize substantial 
gains on their limited investments while undertaking very little 
risk ols wrote

the government has dropped a criminal contempt 
charge against joseph bonanno because the 85yearold reputed 
exmob boss was found to be senile according to court papers filed 
tuesday 
the charge stemmed from bonannos refusal to testify about the 
ruling commission of organized crime in a federal case against 
eight men accused of participating in commission rackets all were 
convicted at us district court in manhattan in 1986 
bonanno served 14 months for civil contempt rather than testify 
federal prosecutors brought the criminal contempt charge after the 
trial ended 
bonanno described the commissions formation in his 1983 
memoirs a man of honor and prosecutors at the commission 
trial sought his testimony to help them establish the commissions 
existence he claimed he was too sick to testify 
bonanno a resident of tuscon ariz was released oct 31 
1986 from federal prison in springfield mo when the government 
rested its case in the commission trial and withdrew its subpoena 
for his testimony 
the criminal indictment brought in november 1986 charged that 
he willfully disobeyed the courts order to testify at a 
deposition in tuscon 
us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum signed an order 
dismissing the criminal charge after prosecutors said in court 
papers that two psychiatrists concluded bonanno suffers from 
senile dementia 
bonannos book said the commission was established in new york 
in 1937 to keep peace among the five cosa nostra families operating 
in the city he said he retired in the 1960s

michael harrington a political theorist and 
social reform activist who advised the rev martin luther king jr 
and helped inspire the war on poverty has died at home after a 
long bout with cancer he was 61 
harrington a professor of political science at queens college 
of the city university of new york and honorary president of the 
socialist international died monday night at his home in suburban 
larchmont the university said in a statement tuesday 
harringtons book the other america attracted national 
attention in the early 1960s in all he wrote 16 books on the 
problems of massive poverty in the midst of affluence and on the 
cultural stress associated with technological advance 
in a 1987 interview with the associated press harrington 
recalled how key individuals including king and president kennedy 
made his book a rallying cry for issues they already considered 
important 
the luck was that the book came out at a time when there was a 
president of the united states who read books john kennedy and he 
read it harrington said it led him to decide to make poverty 
an issue in the 1964 campaign he was killed before he could do it 
but that set in motion the process that led lyndon johnson to 
declare war on poverty 
victor navasky editor of the nation said of the other 
america 
it was one of the very few times that a book led to a federal 
program ever since then theres been a new consciousness that 
we should do something about poor people 
harringtons latest book socialism past and future was 
published last month by arcade press 
michael harringtons intellectual energy dynamism and social 
commitment enriched an entire generation city university 
chancellor joseph s murphy said in the statement he was the 
conscience of america a champion of the downtrodden and 
afflicted 
harrington who became involved in social reform as a youth was 
on kings advisory committee from 196568 he also was active in 
the antiwar movement and the movements against apartheid in south 
africa and against american intervention in central america 
he was a founder of the democratic socialists of america 
serving as national chair and cochair from 1982 until his death 
he was secretary of the socialist international committee which 
drew up a new declaration of principles in 1985 last month 
harrington was named honorary president of the socialist 
international at its centennial conference in stockholm sweden 
he was chair of the socialist party from 196872 and of the 
democratic socialist organizing committee from 197382 he was also 
a member of the senior seminar of the us department of state 
harrington taught at the universities of paris illinois 
michigan and california at los angeles as well as at harvard 
university and the national war college 
gerald mcentee president of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees said in a statement more than 
any other writer in recent memory michael harrington helped 
translate the dry and statistical analysis of poverty into 
passionate human terms and in so doing he lent moral and 
intellectual strength to the notion that government can and should 
make the elimination of poverty a primary goal for society 
harrington received his bachelors degree from holy cross 
college and attended yale university law school he received a 
masters degree from the university of chicago in 1949

an outraged president bush is weighing us 
options for responding to the brutal and tragic murder of 
marine lt col william higgins while ruling out negotiations with 
lebanese terrorists threatening to kill more hostages 
the reported execution of higgins by shiite moslem kidnappers 
monday touched off the first foreign policy crisis of the bush 
administration it also led the president to pointedly criticize 
israel whose abduction of a shiite moslem cleric from lebanon on 
friday was cited by higgins kidnappers in announcing the 
americans execution by hanging 
on friday i said that the taking of any hostage was not 
helpful to the middle east peace process the brutal and tragic 
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement 
bush said monday night 
with shiite groups in lebanon threatening to kill more hostages 
unless the cleric sheik abdul karim obeid is released bush 
called on all parties who hold hostages in the middle east to 
release them forthwith

gains made by secretary of state james a 
baker iii in weekend talks with his soviet and chinese counterparts 
are being overshadowed by the reported execution of an american 
hostage in lebanon 
baker returned from paris on monday night indicating he was 
pleased that us relations with the soviet union had edged up a 
few notches and that highlevel contacts with china had been 
reestablished 
but he was at a loss about how to cope with a resurgence of 
terrorism that apparently led to the death of marine lt col 
william r higgins and threatens other american hostages in 
lebanon 
apart from denouncing higgins kidnappers as outrageous and 
uncivilized baker gave no hint that the bush administration had 
yet found an effective strategy for coping with its first major 
foreign policy challenge

after decades of hostility the vatican is 
seizing on what it calls a new spirit of cooperation by moscow to 
strengthen the roman catholic church in the soviet bloc 
over the past six months the vatican has succeeded in naming 
new bishops in lithuania and czechoslovakia forging diplomatic 
ties with poland after a 40year lapse and nailing down a visit by 
pope john paul ii to hungary 
and last week the vatican named its first bishop in the soviet 
republic of byelorussia since the aftermath of the russian 
revolution 
all the steps taken together are very important said a 
senior vatican diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity it 
is an encouraging picture

us diplomat felix s bloch suspected of 
spying for the soviets sipped grapefruit juice and calmly watched 
for 45 minutes as a foreign correspondent showed him videotapes and 
clippings of how his story is being told in his native austria 
i tried and tried but he said he wouldnt answer questions on 
the substance of his case said robert weisner the washington 
correspondent for staterun austrian television he said bloch 
looked rather surprisingly relaxed monday as he sipped juice 
and watched videotapes of the bloch story prepared for austrian 
television 
bloch also read austrian newspaper accounts of the case which 
weisner showed him during blochs 45minute visit to the offices of 
austrian television monday afternoon in the georgetown section of 
the capital 
meanwhile the justice department in its first public statement 
on the case expressed concern that its investigation may have been 
hurt by premature disclosure and acknowledged objecting to the 
state departments confirmation of the investigation on july 21

television critics meeting here to preview 
the new fall programs had already suffered the indignities of one 
standup comedian who didnt exhibit much reverence for the 
process jackie mason 
then it was richard lewis turn 
lewis and the new coexecutive producer of the abc sitcom 
anything but love peter noah were discussing changes in the 
show which premiered midseason last season and got a pickup for 
the fall 
one critic asked how many scripts were in hand half a dozen 
noah replied 
so actually countered the critic what youve been 
telling us up to this point is that youre going to go in a very 
vague sort of a different direction but you have a definite 
direction in those scripts that do exist 
well noah stammered i dont remember saying it was going 
to be vague 
like watergate up here all of a sudden lewis chimed in as 
noah continued to try to answer the question lewis put his hand 
over the microphone and whispered in his ear 
well im not trying to hide anything noah said id just 
rather not if its ok 
bzzz bzzz bzzz whispered lewis 
on advice of my counsel said noah ive been told that 
no id rather not 
noah did reveal however many of the changes in the show which 
did well in the ratings last season in a cushy spot behind the hit 
roseanne but won little praise from these same television 
critics 
lewis whose angstridden standup routine was toned down for 
his role as magazine writer marty gold in anything but love 
appeared to be doing basically his own material in the show which 
was not surprisingly very funny but there were problems getting 
much comedy mileage out of the other main character played by 
jamie lee curtis 
in the upcoming season curtis character hannah miller gets a 
change of scene that will hopefully lend itself to more laughs she 
gets a promotion from researcher to writer moves out of her 
fathers house and in with a female roommate and she and marty get 
a new boss 
the toughtalking throwback editor of last season will be 
replaced with a new female editor 
we decided to model that character on a kind of a character 
thats very prevalent in the new york publishing world noah 
said one of these kind of highpowered young executive women 
new york performance artist ann magnuson has been cast in the 
role 
we also thought there was something interesting in having a 
boss who was the same age as jamie and even younger than richard 
noah said 
noah said the producers are also bringing in another new 
character played by british actor joe maher a television critic 
we think theres a fair amount of humor possibly in that kind 
of character noah said 
the television critics thought it was pretty funny with any 
luck noah will be just as cheerful when reviews of the revamped 
show come out

elsewhere in television 
duet goes somewhat solo there are big changes ahead for 
the fox broadcasting co comedy duet originally intended as a 
love story between two single people mary page keller and matthew 
laurance the shows supporting characters a married couple 
played by alison laplaca and chris lemmon became more interesting 
especially laplacas materialistic socialclimbing linda phillips 
this fall the series evolves into open house and centers on 
linda as she embarks on a career as a real estate agent philip 
charles mackenzie brothers joins the cast as lindas 
archrival in the office keller stays as lindas friend laura 
kelly but laurance and jodi thelen who played kellers sister 
are gone 
laplaca said she never expected to be a regular on duet 
much less star in a new version of the series 
i came on actually as a twopart guest spot when i first came 
on the show and at that time it was to play richards lemmons 
wife who probably wasnt any more welldefined than those two guest 
spots she told television critics and i think it was the 
ninth episode when we got the script after the taping one night 
and all of a sudden i opened the script and it said lindas 
pregnant and i went what 
laplaca said despite her characters scheming nature audiences 
seem to like her well maybe not all of them 
all the guys tell me im just like their exwife she said 
 
ryan makes small sacrifices ryan oneal has been added to

stars oneals wife farrah fawcett who plays a woman accused of 
shooting her three children oneal plays her former lover it will

to most outsiders bangkoks largest 
slum klong toey is a repulsive maze of densely packed shacks 
tottering over a marsh awash in garbage and other reeking waste 
ive seen a lot of things in my slum 12yearold suree 
lokavit wrote recently some people steal and others brawl they 
inject heroin sniff glue thinner and smoke marijuana many parents 
dont have money to send their children to school and many children 
simply dont have parents 
researchers bear out her observations 
nearly 70 percent of the slum children do not live with their 
natural parents and along with a drug epidemic the slums 60000 
inhabitants face devastating fires chemical pollution eviction 
and a new scourge aids 
and yet suree and many of her schoolmates graphically highlight 
the good people the bigheartedness amidst the violence and 
poverty of klong toey 
in interviews and school essays the youngsters told of a warm 
sense of belonging to a community not unlike the rural villages 
from which their parents migrated in search of a better life 
people of high status live in condominiums most poor people 
live in slums i live in a slum wrote fifth grader rungroj 
sriruang whose father is a bus driver i walk to school through 
stinking garbage and polluted air but im used to it now its been 
that way since i was a small boy 
some people look down on slums as low class his essay 
concluded but when there is free time we will come together to 
share real happiness and fun even with the filth and the bad 
people our slum seems like heaven then 
after sirinath phumsongwons home burned to the ground three 
years ago she and her family moved next to the pig slaughterhouse 
in the slum this neighborhood is said to have klong toeys 
toughest kids the vilest stench and the highest rates of pulmonary 
disease flies swarm around pools of congealed blood and discarded 
entrails from the slaughterhouse 
earlier residents had to wade through the refuse to get to 
their homes when the nearby chao phraya river rose to inundate the 
marshland 
but the neighborhood decided to take action sirinath explained 
wooden planks nails and tools were obtained and families worked 
together to build a walkway above the fetid water one that now 
connects their patchwork of stiltraised shanties 
i would like to name this bridge the bridge of generous 
neighborly spirit she says 
meeting suphawan ngencharoen is a surprise after reading her 
essay which starkly observes unhappiness in her family and around 
her aids spreading from the shared needles of addicts the 
emaciated frames purplish lips and lost stares of heroin users 
the bright willowy 12yearold girl is dressed in clean neatly 
pressed clothes her manners and choice of words are impeccably 
polite her eyes sparkle 
when asked about the most distressing moment of her life she 
describes running out of her house at night as chemical fumes 
swirled into the slum from a nearby explosion and vomitting in an 
open field 
the happiest moments of my life are when my daddy and mama 
dont fight and we live together happily as a family she said 
with family turmoil common suphawan and her companions seem to 
find a womblike comfort in their school samaggi songkroh which 
many of its more than 300 pupils describe as their second home 
this primary school for slum children is largely subsidized by the 
thai government aided by the roman catholic church and run by 
sister somsri a nun who personally administers a whacking to 
errant students after calling in their parents 
the children arrive at 6 am and often dont return home until 
dark after classes they play musical instruments and engage in 
sports 
we can never get rid of them says rev joseph h maier 
jokingly some even sleep in the classrooms and we get all sorts 
of tearful sessions why cant my mommy be like my teacher and not 
beat and curse me 
father joe as everyone calls the 49yearold priest is 
another source of hope and help in klong toey especially for the 
young who are the focus of many of his projects 
after 15 years in the slum the streetsmart and compassionate 
american knows hundreds by name life history and prison record he 
comforts prostitutes puts down thugs with a few wellchosen words 
and cajoles parents into sending their children to school now hes 
working on a father who sends his armless 7yearold son into the 
streets where he can make more than 100 baht 4 a day begging 
another beacon of the better life is prateep ungsongtham known 
as the slum angel of bangkok an unassuming 37yearold woman 
who had the chance to move out of the slums she stayed to start 
schools and fight the eviction of squatters who she charges are 
victims of mysterious slum fires crooked deals and gangster 
harassment 
she and father joe maintain that there is less alienation and a 
more villagelike atmosphere in klong toeys ramshackle squalor 
than in the massive concrete tenements to which government 
officials would like the slum dwellers relocated 
at four or five in the morning darkness the adults of klong 
toey leave for work writes kanitha thithama many labor on 
construction sites their 75 baht 3 daily wage enabling 
entrerpreneurs to profitably fill bangkoks skyline with office 
towers condominiums and shopping centers 
there is not much free time fathers return late and mothers 
frequently supplement incomes by crafting artificial flowers and 
shopping baskets or collecting used plastic bags for recycling 
kanitha looks forward to the block parties at new years and to 
mothers day and fathers day when community leaders strictly 
admonish everyone not to throw out trash so our community is 
clean on at least those days of the year 
the slum is our world kanitha writes i love it more than 
anything

when abbass hamadi and three coworkers 
lost their jobs as government agronomists they went off and did 
something that could help iraq for years to come they farmed the 
desert 
this land is virgin not barren hamadi said on his desert 
farm where he grows high quality vegetables and fruit it only 
needs patience and it will yield 
the project got going two years ago when the staterun poultry 
unit where he worked was sold off under a government privatization 
program and he and his three friends were laid off 
he decided to fulfil a longheld dream of acquiring his own farm 
and putting his agricultural skills to work he and the others 
leased land in the desert west of this shiite moslem holy city 
about 65 miles south of baghdad iraqs capital 
they settled for parcels of desert west of the euphrates river 
because they could not afford to lease productive farmland in more 
fertile areas 
i never wavered when they offered me a plot in the desert 
hamadi said 
using fertilizers liberally to make the sandy gypsumfilled 
soil more productive the desert farmers have been especially 
successful in growing tomatoes cucumbers watermelons and potatoes 
desert farming had long been considered impractical because of 
iraqs searing summer temperatures poor soil the high cost of 
transporting produce and the lack of surface water for irrigation 
hamadi said his biggest problem in trying to develop the 123 
acres he leased from the government was finding water 
he and his colleagues dug wells going down as much as 100 feet 
to reach an underground reservoir 
it is one of many deep below the arid surface fed by 
underground channels that carry rainwater from the najd plateau in 
northern saudi arabia to the west 
now more than 140 farmers are planting about 17300 acres of 
land outside karbala and a thriving settlement has grown up at the 
edge of the desert 
hassoun saleh who heads the provinces agricultural corps said 
the government is trying to encourage farmers to exploit the desert 
by providing equipment for digging wells sprinklers for 
irrigation fertilizers and seeds 
when the farmers need help we give them scientific 
instructions on how to cultivate desert land saleh said we 
prepared all the facilities for making this project a success 
united nations figures indicate that iraq has more than 1334 
million acres of cultivable land out of a total area of 11243 
million acres 
with extensive irrigation that could rise to 593 million acres 
government experts say 
but only about 74 million acres are now being farmed 
the irrigation systems used in the central plains north of 
baghdad are thousands of years old 
despite heavy government outlays on irrigation projects the 
amount of cropland varies considerably from year to year according 
to the rainfall 
iraq which is 60 billion to 70 billion in debt after an 
8year war with iran relies heavily on food imports that cost 
close to 3 billion a year 
the united states sells iraq food valued at more than 1 billion 
a year mostly wheat rice corn vegetable oil livestock and 
dairy produce 
australia and the 12nation european economic community also 
export farm produce to iraq and cuba provides sugar 
a decade ago iraq had ambitious plans to become selfsufficient 
in food production during the 1990s but officials now say that 
productivity on farms has declined because of a labor shortage and 
a need for more mechanization 
about onethird of iraqs work force are farmers and 
agriculture contributes 20 percent of the countrys total output of 
goods and services 
mendi sagher another agronomist who joined the desert project 
in 1987 said he believes its success will encourage people to 
start desert farming in other regions 
im certain many others will follow our example but it 
does depend on the kind of facilities provided for the desert 
farmers he said 
sagher who built his family a home on his desert farm said his 
tomato harvest this year matched top production levels in the 
countrys fertile zones 
he added it should be even higher next year as the soil quality 
on his plot improves

archaelogical finds by a team of american 
french and israeli professors indicate primitive man may have been 
able to do more than grunt as commonly believed 
the team has discovered a twoinch bone called a hyoid from a 
60000yearold skeleton which they believe is a key to the 
beginnings of speech in ancient humans 
for the first time it is possible to say from an anatomical 
point of view that primitive man could speak said professor 
baruch arensberg of tel aviv univerisity a member of the team 
studying the remains found in northern israel 
the findings of arensberg and his team however have set off a 
debate among scientists and linguists over the origins of speech 
some dispute the teams conclusions 
the skeleton of a 30yearold neanderthal man discovered at the 
kebara cave near haifa in northern israel in 1983 has yielded the 
first hyoid bone ever found in primitive man said arensberg 
the ushaped bone is an integral part of the vocal tract that 
lies at the base of the skull in the neck and is linked to the 
muscles of the tongue 
arensburg a professor of anatomy who worked on the 
archaelogical dig and analyzed the human remains said the hyoid 
bone proves primitive man had the same ability as modern man for 
speech though it does not prove he actually had language 
arensberg and a group of nine other professors directed by ofer 
baryosef of harvard university and bernard vandermeersch of the 
university of bordeaux in france have studied the findings at 
kebara for the past six years 
using the hyoid and a jaw fragment from the same skeleton they 
estimated the location of neanderthal mans vocal tract 
they first published their conclusions concerning speech and the 
hyoid in april in the british scientific journal nature 
on july 8 a scientific debate over the hyoids significance 
appeared in the american journal science news 
linguist phillip lieberman of brown univeristy in providence 
ri was quoted as saying at this point the kebara hyoid 
doesnt tell us anything about the evolution of speech and 
language 
lieberman argued that there is no basis for comparison because 
no other hyoids have been found from the ancestors of modern man 
arensburg maintained however that the hyoid and jaw fragment 
demonstrate that the location of the vocal tract in primitive man 
and modern man is identical giving primitive man the ability to 
speak 
before the discovery he said scientists believed the vocal 
tract was located higher in the neck as in other primates which 
would have made speech as now known impossible 
my colleagues many years ago claimed that on the day the hyoid 
is found we will understand speech much better arensberg said 
but those colleagues were surprised by the kebara findings 
because they contradicted their theory that primitive man could not 
speak he added 
anatomist jeffrey laitman of new yorks mount sinai school of 
medicine also disputed the kebara teams findings he told science 
news you cant reproduce the position of the entire vocal tract 
with just a hyoid bone and a jaw fragment 
anthropoligist dean falk of state university of new york at 
albany supports the kebara findings in the science news article 
through her own reconstruction of neanderthal mans vocal tract 
based on other skeletons she concluded in 1975 that ancient man 
could produce the full range of speech sounds 
the kebara man is extraordinary in its completeness arensberg 
said the team discovered almost an entire skeleton missing only 
the skull and parts of the legs he was about fivefeetfour and 
stood erect 
the kebara findings also indicate that neanderthal man lived in 
collectives or families used tools extensively and buried the dead 
similarly to modern man arensberg said

couples foxtrot on the hangar floor to 
the strains of bigband 1940s hits and a woman in a world war ii 
uniform chats with a man in a helmet festooned with camouflage 
foliage 
on the tarmac the moon casts a ghostly glow over a wartime 
bomber and all that is missing is a shout of scramble 
but there is no stampede to battle stations this hot summer 
night this is 1989 and the timecapsule scene unfolding at this 
central england airfield is an exercise in nostalgia for a war that 
began 50 years ago 
duxford is a war museum and the dance is to raise money for 
restoring a wartime blenheim bomber the guests have come in 1940s 
clothes paying 15 pounds 24 each to eat rations and dance 
to golden oldies played by the raf squadronaires 
a few wear german army uniforms with swastika armbands 
explaining that the costume rental shop was out of british and 
american uniforms no one seems to mind 
surprisingly many of the guests are in their 20s born long 
after the war but enthusiasts all the same who hanker for what sir 
winston churchill called their finest hour when the british 
stood alone against adolf hitler 
i think britain was a nicer place then people were more 
united said adam dzieciolowski a 24yearold from cambridge 
wearing a wartime flying jacket 
john rae former headmaster of exclusive westminster school in 
london said its a feeling that in peacetime it never is the 
same that were all moaning at each other railwaymen on strike 
political strife its harder for young people to get a sense of 
purpose in peacetime 
with the approach of the 50th anniversary of the sept 1 1939 
outbreak of the war some schools went to remarkable lengths to 
make children aware of the war ton pentre junior school in wales 
recently recreated the war years by having students carry gas masks 
for a week spend a night in a mock air raid shelter and eat only 
the foodstuffs that were rationed in the war 
i think its good for children to realize that they couldnt 
just go into a sweetshop and spend money on sweets because there 
werent any said head teacher mair williams 
the imperial war museum in london has just opened the blitz 
experience a dank air raid shelter in which visitors hear sirens 
and shell explosions shake the floor there are screams children 
whimper and simulated smoke wafts down a meticulously recreated 
bombedout street 
it isnt fun nor meant to be 
i think there is a certain nostalgia for the war a certain 
mythology about certain aspects the blitz being one said museum 
director alan borg it wasnt fun and one of the aims of our 
experience is to show that it must have been a terrifying thing 
to live through 
britain was never occupied and therefore was spared the guilt 
that haunts the european countries whose citizens had to choose 
between resistance and collaboration 
our whole psychological experience and memory from 1940 
onwards is so totally different from any european country said 
historian correlli barnett the nostalgia britons feel would be 
unthinkable in any other european country if you are frenchman 
how do you romanticize the german occupation 
for many britons 193945 has taken on a burnished glow in which 
death and deprivation are subordinated to the notion that britain 
was somehow a better place then 
a clothes store chain promoting a line of 1940sstyle garments 
polled 250 people and found 148 thought that life was better during 
the war that people cared about each other were less acquisitive 
ate healthier food 
the war was also a social revolution with buckingham palace as 
vulnerable to german bombs as an east end tenement block class 
divisions were bound to narrow victorian morality collapsed in the 
climate of love today die tomorrow ordinary britons came back 
from the battlefields feeling they had earned a new deal they 
threw out their wartime hero winston churchill elected a 
socialist government and received a welfare state 
historians like barnett argue it was this costly welfare state 
set up when britain was exhausted deep in debt and about to lose 
its empire that accounts for the malaise which has left the nation 
lagging behind other european countries 
we had the psychology of the victor they of the totally 
defeated he said they therefore prepared to make fresh 
starts try to work together find common institutions the brits 
in 1945 were still dreaming of being a world power looking to the 
empire

in a country where a steak and a 
bottle of wine were on practically every table every day thousands 
now eat at soup kitchens or go hungry in a nation blessed with 
natural resources unemployment and poverty are soaring 
middleclass argentines among the most affluent in latin 
america at one time are so strapped now that they are selling off 
heirlooms that had been in their families since the days when beef 
and grain made argentina one of the worlds wealthiest nations 
this country had no limit said analyst enrique zuleta 
looking back on those prosperous times this was the only country 
where poor people were fat 
where did argentina go wrong 
the most widely accepted explanation is the collapse of the 
statedominated economic system laid down by juan d peron in late 
1940s when argentinas treasury was filled with gold 
now it is in the hands of his successors in the peronist 
movement to rescue the nation 
the problem is very clear to us says sen carlos tenev of 
the governing peronist party which now is trying to sell companies 
it nationalized in the early days of peron the state is very 
weak geriatric the productive apparatus is totally wasted 
warning lights already were blinking when middle class 
argentines flew to beaches in brazil for summer vacations last 
january and february the fiscal deficit was soaring the austral 
currency was tremendously overvalued foreign currency reserves 
were running low 
but such things have happened often in recent years and the 
significance was dismissed what was in store for argentines turned 
out to be even worse than the depression of the 1930s 
when the central bank on feb 6 stopped selling us dollars 
argentines frantically bid up the price at exchange houses in six 
months the austral lost 97 percent of its value inflation doubled 
and then doubled again in july it was running at a monthly rate of 
at least 200 percent 
real wages contracted by onehalf unemployment unofficially 
stands at a record 14 percent an estimated one in four argentinas 
31 million people lives in poverty 820000 people in buenos aires 
province alone eat at least one meal a day at some 1500 soup 
kitchens that have opened according to gov antonio cafiero 
in late may lootings of food stores nationwide prompted the 
government then headed by president raul alfonsin to declare a 
state of siege and suspend civil liberties for one month while 
there have been no major clashes with police since sackings and 
arrests have continued 
few argentines had seen anything like this before 
i dont think anyone thought things would collapse so 
quickly said angel pena an economist with the mediterranean 
foundation research group and the bottom he said may not have 
been reached 
economic collapse was waiting to happen 
annual inflation has been tripledigit in 14 of the past 15 
years the national budget usually is severely in deficit the 
gross national product has remained in stagnation at about 80 
billion the informal economy has blossomed private argentine 
money stashed in safer havens abroad may total 30 billion 
the country was starved of resources said marcos victorica 
director of the institute of contemporary studies it paid its 
expenses by printing money until inflation got out of hand 
payments havent been made in 15 months on the foreign debt of 
64 billion the thirdhighest among developing countries 
maintenance on thermal electricity plants lagged so badly that a 
drought touched off an energy shortage that has lasted since 
december the start of the southern hemispheres summer 
the government stopped capital expenditure stopped research 
stopped maintenance said diana mondino a professor at the 
argentine center for macroeconomic studies a business school 
the government just stared at what was going on wondering what 
to do 
president carlos menem who took office july 8 cannot defer 
hard choices by borrowing abroad or waiting things out as did 
alfonsin his predecessor in his first week as president menem 
increased statecontrolled transport telephone electricity and 
gas rates by 200 to 600 percent 
a gallon of gas jumped immediately to the austral equivalent of 
165 from 23 cents while average monthly incomes remained in the 
40 to 200 range 
noticeably fewer cars were on buenos aires broad boulevards and 
cobblestone sidestreets 
it looks like saturday a taxi driver said on a recent 
weekday morning 
most people cant afford taxis either fares have soared 
sixfold 
similar increases in the prices of food cigarettes movie 
tickets and clothes have produced waves of shock anxiety 
frustration and resignation among argentines particularly the 
middle class

people come in and talk about their problems their illusions 
their fears their conflicts said roger montenegro president of 
the argentine psychiatric association in the last couple of 
months the economy theme comes up almost obsessively 
his colleagues montenegro noted charged the equivalent of 25 
to 40 an hour three months ago now theyre lucky to get 5 
everyone is pauperized he said 
said flavio chiari a 21yearold employee at a foreign exchange 
house a year ago you could invite a bunch of friends over for a 
cookout no problem now to do that everyone has to bring 
something 
thats because food prices have risen so rapidly a kilogram 
22 pounds of beefsteak cost 500 australes 76 cents at the 
beginning of july and rose to 1000 australes 153 by the end of 
the month 
in the same period a quart of milk doubled to 120 australes 18 
cents and a loaf of bread increased by 100 percent to 280 
australes 43 cents 
the price increases come in sudden jumps the cheapest pack of 
cigarettes doubled in one day to 420 australes 64 cents 
and increases have been coming that way for months a movie 
ticket that cost 25 australes in february now costs 700 a pair of 
leather mocassins that cost 770 australes in february now cost 
19000 
hardship and gloom obscure the fact that argentina as recently 
as the 1920s had a per capita income on a par with switzerlands 
buenos aires put in a subway system just after new york city did 
argentina still is potentially rich the flat fertile pampas 
continue to produce huge surpluses of grain and beef argentina is 
nearly selfsufficient in oil and has vast natural gas reserves 
fisheries in the south atlantic are virtually untapped 
argentinas climate is temperate and most of its citizens share 
a common european ancestry the same language race and roman 
catholic religion 
zuleta the analyst who also is a pollster sees argentinas 
problem as political not economic however schisms often 
violent sometimes bloody between and within labor unions 
businesses political parties and the armed forces which have 
overthrown six governments since 1930 are the real problem he 
maintains 
the political failure is the key to understanding 
everything he said its not just a rich country that is badly 
administered its badly administered because of political 
ideology 
the ideology may be shifting the crisis has undermined 
cherished beliefs that the state should provide services education 
and jobs 
all of us together will cure argentina or argentina will 
die menem said in his inaugural address this is the cruel 
choice 
in his first two weeks menem forged alliances with rival 
political parties reached out to business and farm groups whose 
members probably did not vote for him and took steps to resolve a 
military impasse that sparked three barracks revolts against 
alfonsin 
on the theme of the statedirected economy that is a legacy of 
his partys founder juan peron president in 194655 and 197374 
menem says we want a state that allows the nation to live that 
is its servant and not its jailer 
so far menems solution is much like alfonsins raise utility 
rates but also salaries reduce government expenditures and 
increase tax revenues 
the new elements are menems plan to sell state companies whose 
operating losses contribute to the fiscal deficit and the 
suspension or elimination of subsidies to private businesses that 
cost the government billions of dollars a year 
legislation has been introduced in congress to do both quick 
approval is likely though the first privatizations may not be seen 
for a year or more 
jose luis manzano president of the peronist bloc in the lower 
house of congress said menem is racing against the clock 
argentines who can barely pay heating electricity and telephone 
bills wont wait long for things to get better 
how long 
three months manzano replied

the rev leslie craske is worried 
a crack in the north aisle of his 14th century church has traveled 
up to the apex and down the other side outside two large graves 
show signs of collapsing 
the church of england minister suspects the church and grounds 
may be sinking into a network of munition and rail tunnels the 
nazis dug under the church during world war ii 
the problem is not unusual in guernsey one of britains channel 
islands off the coast of france using foreign slave labor the 
germans dug 41 tunnels on the 25squaremile island 
the tunnels are the wars most troublesome legacy in the channel 
islands the only british soil occupied by the germans 
in may the government evacuated two elderly couples from 
stateowned rental houses because a tunnel underneath was crumbling 
slightly 
were not taking any chances said brian castle the 
islands housing administrator 
a couple of years ago a bowling green collapsed overnight in 
delancey park before that a garden fell in fort george every now 
and then a field will subside and the lawn in front of the st 
saviours rectory undulates because of air raid shelters below 
the germans just tunneled like rabbits said gerald 
przenislawski who operates la valette underground military museum 
there will always be a problem as long as they the tunnels are 
there 
the channel islands were occupied from june 30 1940 to may 9 
1945 and were among the last places in europe to be liberated 
theres quite a bit that the occupation left castle said 
constant reminders are the unsightly german fortifications and 
the cemetery for german soldiers and there are the descendants of 
germans who came back after the war and married guernsey women 
guernseys young brought back a variety of accents from england 
where they were evacuated during the occupation for many there is 
still pain from having spent such a large chunk of life apart 
i got one red cross message from my parents during the 
entire five years recalls roydon falla a politician 
but not all memories are bitter 
owen le vallee president of the liberation day committee said 
his mother found a starving german in the outhouse during the year 
after dday the 1944 allied invasion of europe 
mother felt a great deal of compassion for him and gave him 
some food the little that she had le vallee said 
at st saviours parish craske frets we have an impression 
that the crack is lengthening the minister said 
pointing to the large graves which date back to 1860 he said 
they buried whole generations in these youve got as many as 24 
bodies piled one on top of the other 
the parishs 2300 taxpayers are responsible for the church 
in guernsey law everything that is under your ground is 
yours which is not a comforting thought as far as this is 
concerned craske said of the tunnels 
we dont know whether it will be five years or five centuries 
ultimately they will collapse he said they are bound to

the national association of realtors said monday that for the

that a typical american family did not have enough money to buy a 
medianpriced home 
the index dropped to 993 percent in june down from 1007 
percent in may that means that a family earning the national 
median of 32760 a year had 993 percent of the funds needed to 
qualify for conventional financing covering 80 percent of the 
purchase price of a home costing a median price of 93200 
the decline in affordability in june was blamed on an increase 
in mortgage rates and a 600 increase in the median resale price of 
a home mortgage rates at closing climbed to 1059 percent in june 
up from a nationwide average of 1046 percent in may the

officials noted that since june mortgage rates have begun 
declining in response to crediteasing moves on the part of the

consumer confidence increased in july despite 
indications of sluggish economic activity a research group 
reported 
the conference board said monday its consumer confidence index 
rose 35 points during the month to 1207 
the continued high level of consumer confidence despite signs 
that the economy may be slowing can be attributed to the strength 
of the particular economic circumstances which affect daily life of 
the average citizen said fabian linden executive director of 
the boards consumer research center 
unemployment has been hovering around 5 percent and we are 
generating about 200000 new jobs a month he said declining 
interest rates and the inflation rate which is fluctuating between 
modest and barely visible also contribute to the consumers sense 
of security 
based on a monthly survey of about 5000 households the board 
said consumers expressed considerable satisfaction with present 
business conditions and slightly fewer people believe the current 
climate is bad 
the survey found 318 percent of those responding thought 
business conditions were good up from 283 percent in the survey a 
month earlier there was a drop of 2 percent in the number of 
people who termed conditions as bad 
people continued to be positive about the employment situation 
and a third of all the survey respondents said jobs were plentiful 
in the july survey 186 percent of those participating said that 
more job opportunities will become available in the months ahead 
up from 179 percent in the june poll

boise cascade corp has unveiled a plan to 
install one of the worlds largest paper machines at its mill in 
this androscoggin river town a 450 million project that will 
continue the mills twodecade trend toward a smaller work force 
the new machine with an annual capacity of 318000 tons will 
be the centerpiece of a 770 million modernization program designed 
to turn one of the nations oldest pulp and paper mills into one of 
the largest and most productive manufacturers of coated papers for 
catalogs and magazines the boise idahobased company said monday 
coated paper from the mill in western maine is used in such 
publications as time national geographic people and vanity fair 
as well as such catalogs as ll bean horchow and macys baxter 
said 
the company said it expects to begin installing the machine and 
building related facilities in 1991 with a startup of production 
planned for late 1993 
the new machine will lead to an unspecified reduction in the 
1600member work force at the rumford mill according to eric s 
baxter spokesman at the offices of boise cascades coated paper 
division in portland 
well be shutting down four very old machines to make way for 
the new machine said baxter he said there will be no layoffs 
and all job losses will be carried out through attrition 
the president of local 900 of the united paperworkers 
international union which represents some 1250 production workers 
at boise cascade declined comment on the merits of the project but 
expressed surprise that it was announced at this time 
they management told us about a month ago that it was being 
put on hold for at least nine months to a year before it was going 
to be announced now they go ahead and announce it don barker 
said 
barker whose union was involved in a violent strike at boise 
cascade three years ago noted that the mill had more than 3000 
workers before automation began to shrink the number of jobs 
built around the turn of the century at a bend in the 
androscoggin river the mill has produced both coated and uncoated 
papers when the new machine is installed production will rise to 
753000 tons a year and be made up entirely of coated papers the 
company said 
the project hinges on obtaining state and federal environmental 
permits to install and operate the machine 
other elements of boise cascades modernization include 
a 180 million power generation project to be completed next 
year that will eliminate the need for 600000 barrels of oil a year 
and reduce particulate emissions by 50 percent 
a 75 million pulp mill expansion project that will increase 
pulp production capacity by 212 tons a day or 25 percent 
a 52 million complete rebuilding of one paper machine and a 
12 million enhancement of another machine

consumer and business borrowing expenses should 
head down even further now that major commercial banks have lowered 
their prime lending rate a half percentage point to 105 percent 
the reduction announced monday had been called long overdue by 
many economists since most other interest rates had dropped as 
economic growth continues to slow down 
it followed an identical rate reduction three weeks ago by chase 
manhattan bank but aside from a few smaller banks only bank of 
america which lowered its prime friday had taken chases cue 
banks view cutting the prime rate the way most of us view a 
trip to the dentist but they know that sooner or later they 
have to said robert a brusca chief economist for nikko 
securities co international 
economists speculated the big banks didnt immediately follow 
chases july 10 rate cut partly because they wanted to determine 
whether the federal reserve would keep pursuing lower interest 
rates as it had recently to prevent the economy from falling into a 
recession 
the sentiment in the marketplace was that chase was too early 
and everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed 
below 9 percent said elizabeth g reiners an economist with 
dean wittter reynolds inc but they could have easily done that 
by the end of last week 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 8 1516 percent late monday unchanged from 
friday the fed controls the key rate by adding or subtracting 
banking reserves 
other interest rates in the credit markets have been falling 
steadily the yield on the widely watched 30year treasury bond was 
791 percent late monday down from a 798 percent close on friday 
that marked the first finish below 8 percent since spring 1987 
rates on 30year fixed mortgages also have fallen dropping below 
10 percent over the past few weeks 
meanwhile rates on savings accounts have slipped with the 
average yield on a sixmonth certificate of deposit down to 847 
percent last week from 852 percent the previous week according to 
the newsletter bank rate monitor 
the prime reflects a banks cost of money such as the interest 
it pays on savings accounts or cds and therefore generally trails 
more subtle changes in other rates 
as a result of mondays concerted ratelowering action 
borrowing costs for some consumers and businesses are expected to 
decline more broadly because the prime is used as a basis for 
calculating many fixed and adjustablerate loans such as credit 
card rates and home equity loans 
bond and stock prices rose following mondays action which 
began with an announcement by first bank of chicago shortly before 
the stock market opened other big banks quickly followed suit 
including citibank the nations largest 
f ward mccarthy a principal at stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc said banks had been reluctant to cut their prime 
before monday because business had been sluggish 
when the economy is slowing down loan demand slows down 
banks try to bolster revenue by keeping their lending rates 
up mccarthy said 
the government reported last week that the economy expanded at a 
rate of 17 percent in the second quarter the slowest rate in 
three years 
mccarthy and other economists said interest rates should 
continue to fall through the end of the year with some predicting 
rates would fall far enough to push the prime below 10 percent 
the prime stood at 105 percent at the start of 1989 it was 
raised twice in february to 115 percent then lowered a half 
percentage point on june 5 those movements reflected changing 
perceptions about economic growth and inflation

the house has heeded pleas by the aviation 
industry and agreed to let the government push back the deadline 
for installation of an anticollision device on airliners by at 
least two years 
on a unanimous voice vote monday lawmakers passed legislation 
allowing the federal aviation administration to extend the current 
dec 30 1991 deadline for installation of the socalled traffic 
alert and collision avoidance system or tcasii to dec 30 1993 
the faa would be empowered to allow even a longer delay if 
problems continued the bill also requires a oneyear study of the 
equipment beginning by dec 30 1990 
the senate has yet to approve the legislation 
a law enacted in 1987 set the current dates for installation of 
the devices in airliners with at least 30 seats the requirement 
would cover 4000 us aircraft and would cost an estimated 
310000 for each unit including installation 
industry groups have complained that the devices which are not 
massproduced will take a long time to manufacture install test 
and maintain properly a slower installation schedule was also 
recommended by the office of technology assessment a congressional 
research agency and supported by the faa 
there are problems in both the manufacture and the 
installation said rep james oberstar dminn chairman of the

wang laboratories inc is so troubled that 
it would be put up for sale were it not for the objection of the 
founding family which controls the stock voting rights and is 
struggling to turn the computer maker around analysts say 
the lowellbased company reported a 375 million quarterly loss 
monday and announced it had suspended dividend payments it also 
said its financial condition put it in violation of a bank lending 
agreement 
in addition to the objection of the wang family to a sale the 
company is burdened with lines of business that are not attractive 
to potential buyers analysts said the family controls 80 percent 
of the stock voting rights 
most of the quarterly loss stemmed from a 237 million pretax 
charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing 
factories cutting jobs and lowering the book value of outdated 
assets 
but the company also lost money on its ongoing operations 
a third of the loss is current operations and clearly they 
have to reduce their expense structure further said john w 
adams chairman of adams harkness amp hill in boston im sure 
theyre aware of it the computer business has just gotten to be 
more and more competitive 
the latest bad news pushed wangs stock down 37 cents to close 
at 612 a share on the american stock exchange 
wang stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since 
early 1984 when it traded above 35 a share 
the most pressing crisis for wang is that the loss in its fourth 
fiscal quarter reduced its net worth below the level required by 
its commercial banks under a 300 million revolving credit 
agreement 
wang said it had received waivers from the banks through aug 10 
and was continuing to negotiate new terms that would give it some 
breathing room the company said it hired lodestar group and 
salomon brothers inc as financial advisers 
founded in 1951 wang ranks 145th on fortune magazines list of 
the 500 largest american industrial companies but in recent years 
the computer maker has shown a pronounced limp 
after building a reputation in office word processors in the 
1970s wang watched as sales slowly eroded due to powerful personal 
computers that have taken their place its minicomputer business 
likewise faltered as the popularity of workstations has risen 
wang is trying to make a comeback by focusing on four types of 
customers financial services government manufacturing and 
professional services its most promising asset is freestyle a 
technology that allows interaction with a personal computer through 
an electronic pencil instead of a keyboard or mouse 
wang also is promoting its imaging equipment which allows 
companies to electronically scan documents photographs and other 
material and enter it into a computer for storage and collation 
the materials may later be recalled on a computer screen in their 
original form 
wang cut its work force by more than 10 percent to 28300 in the 
year ended june 30 while executives have taken pay cuts of 5 
percent to 20 percent 
more jobs will be shed in the coming months with the previously 
announced decisions to close a 240employee factory in stirling 
scotland and reduce employment at its juncos puerto rico plant 
to 125 people from 500 
on top of wangs financial problems are the health problems of 
an wang the companys 69yearold founder and chairman who 
underwent surgery july 14 for cancer of the esophagus he left the 
hospital thursday and doctors said he is progressing according to 
wang spokesman joseph roy 
he has a freestyle at home and hes been in contact with us 
quite frequently roy said 
wangs son frederick is president of the company 
for the quarter ended june 30 the net loss of 3747 million 
came on revenue of 7837 million compared with earnings of 134 
million or 8 cents a share on 8228 million in revenue for the 
same period a year ago 
the company reported a net loss of 4243 million for all of it 
its 1989 fiscal year as compared with net income of 927 million 
or 56 cents a share on revenue of 307 billion in its fiscal 1988 
the company said directors voted not to declare a quarterly 
dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 1990 but will consider an 
annual dividend policy as soon as operating performance allows

a new yorkbased commodity futures trading 
concern philipps brothers inc and three affiliates have agreed 
to pay a record 4 million in penalties to settle federal 
allegations of fraud in cocoa futures contracts 
philipp brothers is a wholly owned subsidiary of salomon inc 
which controls the venerable wall street investment firm salomon 
brothers but federal officials stressed that present management at 
salomon was not involved in any alleged wrongdoing 
company and federal officials also said the allegations released 
monday had nothing to do with an ongoing investigation into trading 
practices at commodities exchanges in chicago 
the commodity futures trading commission which regulates us 
futures markets has been criticized in recent months for allegedly 
lax enforcement of regulations at the nations futures exchanges 
critics point to the twoyear undercover justice department 
investigation of alleged trading fraud in the chicago exchanges 
which reportedly could lead to scores of indictments against 
traders and others 
in announcing the settlement monday dennis klejna director of 
the cftcs enforcement division said it represented by far the 
largest civil penalty ever imposed by this commission 
the cftc charged in a 19count administrative complaint that 
philipp brothers and others engaged in several deceptive practices 
from july 1981 to september 1984 
but the essence of the case said klejna was the practice known 
as bucketing 
in bucketing a broker misrepresents trades by buying or selling 
futures contracts away from the floor of a futures exchange while 
indicating to the customer that the trades were made on the 
exchange all futures transactions are required by law to go 
through an exchange 
the alleged practice resulted in 165 million in fees for the 
firm that it should not have earned the cftc said 
philipp brothers in a statement issued in new york said the 
firms current management brought the alleged violations to the 
attention of the cftc after an internal investigation 
the trading practices that led to the settlement were 
terminated in the summer of 1984 and the employees involved were 
discharged at that time no present employees of the company were 
involved said a company spokesman robert f baker who said the 
alleged activities occurred before philipp brothers became a 
subsidiary of salomon 
the cftc charged that philipp brothers told customers their 
trades were being handled on the coffee cocoa and sugar exchange 
in new york when the trades actually were handled off of the 
exchange floor 
customers never really held a futures position on the 
exchange said klejna they thought they did when in fact they 
had orders that were booked at the firm 
while the traders in question werent providing the service they 
claimed to be providing the customer nevertheless was required 
to pay the same commissions fees and margin collateral deposited 
to buy futures charged for properly executed transactions and 
positions according to the complaint 
about 100000 cocoa futures were bought or sold in this manner 
carrying commission fees of about 16 each or a total of 165 
million said klejna 
the commission also alleged that philipp brothers and others 
entered into improper prearranged trades and fictitious sales and 
failed to accurately prepare order tickets 
in addition to philipp brothers three affiliates phibro corp 
and philipp brothers commodities corp both of new york and cocoa 
merchants ltd of london settled the allegations without 
admitting or denying guilt said klejna 
five former employees of philipp brothers were charged in the 
complaint and have not yet settled with the cftc anthony hd 
weldon of london daniel f tulig of sparta nj peter gilliam 
of surrey england esther lander greenfield of monsey ny and 
mark glowatz of east meadow ny 
the alleged violations occurred during primarily on behalf of 
commercial customers said klejna

a farm export subsidy program is meeting its 
goals of increasing sales of agricultural products abroad and 
pressuring us competitors to negotiate in international trade 
talks government officials told congress 
the agriculture department and the general accounting office 
the investigative arm of congress delivered the favorable 
assessments of the export enhancement program to a house 
agriculture subcommittee monday the usda which just completed a 
study of eep said fears the bush administration might halt the 
program were unfounded 
we believe that eep is an important trade policy tool said 
richard t crowder usda undersecretary for international affairs 
and commodity programs 
gao credited the subsidy program for increasing farm exports to 
a number of countries including the soviet union china egypt 
jordan and iraq and said abandoning eep would weaken the us 
negotiating position with the european community 
under eep private exporters can sell us commodities at lower 
prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
there have been 84 billion in farm sales through the program 
since it was established by the 1985 farm law and the subsidies 
were valued at nearly 26 billion about half of the 770 million 
allocated for the program this year has been awarded with most of 
the subsidies going for wheat sales 
in its study usda estimated that eep subsidies caused wheat 
exports to grow 10 percent to 30 percent more than what they would 
have been without the program the department concluded the program 
operated at little or no cost to the government by moving more 
grain into export markets which in turn helps lower the cost of 
federal price supports to farmers 
white house budget officials directed usda to review the program 
last year to answer questions about its cost and whether it was 
meeting its goals farmstate lawmakers expressed concern earlier 
this year that eep subsidy offers appeared to have been put on hold 
during the review although administration officials have said 
there were no delays 
at the hearing members of the wheat soybeans and feed grains 
subcommittee criticized usdas management of the subsidy program 
and questioned why the agency had not used the program for soybean 
oil sales to the soviet union 
rep dan glickman dkan the subcommittee chairman complained 
that usda had not finished a review of a swissbased companys 
possible ties to a fugitive commodities trader the company richco 
grain ltd received at least 65 million in subsidies through eep 
you have yet to tell us how the largest tax evader in the 
history of the united states of america one of them was able to 
participate in the export enhancement program said glickman 
glickman contends the company is tied through a series of 
subsidiary arrangements to marc rich who fled to switerland in 
1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion racketeering 
mail and wire fraud

the agriculture department has failed to 
impose sufficient management controls over a new computer system 
aimed at allowing spotchecks of certain meat and poultry 
processing plants the general accounting office said 
in a report prepared for a house government operations 
subcommittee the congressional investigative arm found fault with 
many aspects of the departments performance based inspection 
system in general it concluded the departments computer system 
aimed at singling out plants for inspection on the basis of their 
health risk had not lived up to its billing 
the report released monday concluded the agriculture 
departments computerized inspectionscheduling system cannot be 
relied upon to give the type of quality information needed as a 
basis for making decisions on which plants should be scrutinized 
the gao report confirms the evidence from our april hearing 
that pbis does not adequately protect consumers from unsafe 
processed meat and poultry rep ted weiss dny chairman of 
the human resources subcommittee said in a statement 
i am alarmed that since april usda has installed this flawed 
system nationally and intends to spend more than 13 million on 
pbis by 1996 he said hopefully usda will heed gaos advice 
to stop wasting any more money on pbis until the agency has 
regained control over the program 
mitchell zeller counsel to the subcommittee said in an 
interview that congress enacted legislation in 1986 allowing the 
agriculture department to go to a system of spotchecking certain 
suspect meat and poultry inspection plants in doing so the agency 
abandoned routine inspections of individual plants and began 
reducing the number of inspectors from 2300 to 1100 the agency 
said that would save the government 27 million a year 
the theory was fine zeller said but theyve taken 
control of inspections away from the inspectors and put too much 
reliance on a computer system that doesnt work 
in his report to the house panel james w harman director of 
food and agriculture issues at the gao said investigators found 
various problems with the computerized inspectionscheduling 
system and said they stemmed in large part from the agencys 
failure to apply management controls 
agricultre department officials had no immediate comment on the 
gao report but in his report harman said he had discussed the 
problem with agency officials 
while generally agreeing with our assessment of pbis the 
agency said the computerized system was its highest priority 
and said they would make a concerted effort to correct any 
problems he said

more than 30 years after it was created as 
a special lubricant for auto engines stp is being called upon to 
help its parent company slip into the 25 billionayear automotive 
services market 
first brands corp of danbury says it will open up to 100 
automotive service centers under the familiar red white and blue 
stp logo over the next three to five years the company also 
expects to see revenues from the new venture grow to 150 million a 
year during that period 
stp has connotative qualities of high performance high 
technology durability and dependability all of which were 
considered highly favorable in launching this brand into another 
business said ronald a artzer president of stp consumer 
services inc a subsidiary of first brands 
the stp centers will offer oil changes car washes cooling 
system maintenance and tuneups they will compete directly against 
other established automotive service companies such as jiffy lube 
international inc goodyear tire amp rubber co and sears roebuck 
and co 
the competition is getting a lot stiffer said analyst 
franklin l morton a vice president with alex brown amp sons inc 
in baltimore 
the market is growing and so is the number of people entering 
the market morton said noting other newcomers include the ford 
motor co and avis inc 
morton said a shakeout is inevitable due to the vast growth of 
car service companies he said a key to success will be careful 
marketing 
in another sign of the industrys growing competition pennzoil 
co agreed last week to buy 80 percent of jiffy lube and take over 
management of the chain which has more than 1000 franchised 
outlets the oil company is expected to strengthen the chains 
market position 
the first stp center opened last month in atlanta three more 
are planned for atlanta and another is planned for charolotte 
nc as first brands tests its new concept the cities were chosen 
because they are in autoracing country where stp is well known 
for its long affiliation with nascar racing and driver richard 
petty 
the business marks the second new subsidiary for first brands 
which has been looking for ways to expand since it was created in 
1986 through a leveraged buyout of union carbide corps home and 
automotive divisions 
the buyout engineered by executivies of the former carbide 
divisions created a 12 billion corporation with such wellknown 
products as prestone antifreeze simoniz car wax and glad plastic 
bags in addtion to stp but the deal also left first brand 
executives with the challenge of finding new markets for their 
wellestablished products 
the company wanted some growth horizons i wont say the 
businesses were in are mature but theyve been around awhile 
artzer said 
a marketing study was done and the results showed potential 
growth for stp in automotive repair and maintenance artzer said 
the study showed a particularly strong growth area in the quick 
lube business where consumers can get an oil change in a matter of 
minutes 
he noted that car manufacturers are suggesting more frequent oil 
changes for smallengine cars the study also showed that there are 
not enough service centers to keep up with the demand for routine 
maintenance and people are keeping their cars longer due to the 
costs of replacing them he said 
the dynamics are great said artzer who was hired in 
september because of his expertise in franchise marketing 
stp will test two types of service centers the atlanta shops 
will be stp service plus centers that will offer quick lubes 
car washes cooling system maintenace and tuneups in charlotte 
it will test stp super plus which will offer all the same 
services plus sell gasoline 
to reduce the hassle of getting a car repaired stp will keep 
computer records of all work done for its customers customers will 
be able to obtain maintenace records when they want to sell their 
cars and also will receive notices reminding them when regular 
maintenance is needed 
aside from serving the customer the computer records will help 
stp determine operational standards artzer said in the 1990s 
this information will be used to sell stp franchises 
first brands has set no limit on the money that can be spent to 
develop the business into a national chain artzer said 
this is a business we want to have a major impact on first 
brands he said

investor warren buffetts intention to expand his 
stake in cocacola co has pushed the soft drink companys stock 
sharply higher 
buffett who has made a reputation and rishes as a savvy 
longterm investor filed a statement with the securities and 
exchange commission monday seeking clearance to purchase up to 15 
percent of cocacolas common stock 
earlier this year cocacola disclosed that buffett had acquired 
a 68 percent stake he was elected to the companys board of 
directors in july 
cocacola stock spurted 450 to 68 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange even though a spokesman for buffett said that 
the filing was not a purchase announcement 
an analyst said buffetts plans could inspire other investors to 
back coke 
this may make other investors more interested in cocacola 
because warren buffett has an extraordinary track record said 
analyst emanuel goldman of paine webber inc in san francisco 
his even talking about 15 percent in cocacola is a tremendous 
endorsement of the company 
randy donaldson a cocacola spokesman said the company was 
delighted when mr buffett made his significant investment in the 
cocacola co and the relationship that has developed since that 
investment has reinforced that initial positive view 
buffett who has said he is a cherry coke drinker is chief 
executive officer of the diversified omaha nebbased conglomerate 
berkshire hathaway inc he and his wife control 45 percent of 
berkshire hathaway stock 
berkshire hathaway chief financial officer j verne mckenzie 
said that mondays filing was not an announcement of immediate 
stock purchases 
this does not say there are plans now to buy mckenzie said 
noting that purchase plans would be made based on stock price and 
market conditions this gives us a flexibility to buy to match 
our flexibility to sell 
mckenzie said the filing also addresses buffetts clearance to 
sell his cocacola stock but there are no plans to sell now 
when cocacola disclosed in march that buffett had acquired more 
than 6 percent of the company buffett called the purchases 
simply a passive investment and said he is happy with the way 
the company is being managed 
mckenzie said there had been no change in buffetts view of the 
investment buffett was not available for comment monday

eastman kodak co said tuesday its profit 
fell 85 percent in the second quarter mainly because of onetime 
charges to cover the cost of a corporate restructuring 
even without the special charges though net earnings would 
have dropped 26 percent from last years record the company 
attributed the weakness to higher costs including interest 
expenses and the impact of the dollars rise 
while volume gains so far this year have been gratifying 
especially in the united states our earnings have not kept pace 
chairman colby chandler said in a press release strong steps are 
being taken to address the earnings shortfall 
net earnings from the second quarter were 60 million or 18 
cents a share down from a record 390 million or 120 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose to a record 45 billion from 413 
billion a year earlier 
for the first half earnings fell 60 percent to 260 million or 
80 cents a share from 650 million or 2 a share a year earlier 
revenue rose to a record 84 billion from 746 billion a year 
earlier 
earnings from operations were 276 million for the quarter 
compared with a restated 769 million for the second quarter of 
1988 for the halfyear operating earnings dipped to 745 million 
from last years restated 124 billion 
the company announced july 24 that it was taking a 225 million 
charge against earnings for the second quarter of 1989 because of 
consolidation of its photofinishing and consumer photography units 
and associated writeoffs of equipment salaries and goodwill 
along with special separation payments to outgoing employees 
for the balance of the year we look for continued gains in 
sales with earnings improved over the half year to approximately 
the same level as the record earnings reported for the 1988 second 
half chandler said

massachusetts got 50000 for a 
mercedesbenz it seized and auctioned in its corporate tax fight 
with the west german luxury auto maker but that will do little to 
resolve the 7 million in taxes it claims the company owes 
the red fourdoor mercedes sel 560 was valued at 74000 but 
fetched only the minimum bid of 50000 at an auction monday the 
cars owner was mercedesbenz of north america inc until the state 
took possession of the car on july 6 from the home of a company 
employee 
the people who bought it got a very good deal on it said 
betsy houghteling a spokeswoman for the state department of 
revenue 
massachusetts officials allege that mercedes owes the state 71 
million in delinquent corporate taxes the company disputes that 
claim but has failed to appear in massachusetts courts on the issue 
the state is preparing to take the case to courts in new jersey 
where mercedes north american corporate headquarters are located 
houghteling said the states usual strategy in corporate tax 
cases is to seize the assets of a company but beyond an occasional 
employee car mercedes has few assets in massachusetts dealerships 
are independent operations 
mercedes spokesman ab shuman said tuesday that mercedes has no 
formal operations in massachusetts 
in those states where we do have operations we pay our full 
taxes the business in massachusetts is interstate commerce and 
that is exempted from this kind of taxation shuman said 
the massachusetts revenue department argues however that 
although mercedes has no corporate headquarters or major facilities 
in massachusetts it has employees there and makes money by selling 
cars to massachusetts dealers 
the tax case against mercedes began in 1985 as an investigation 
of delinquent taxes against several foreign car manufacturers the 
others in the case have paid their debts and are abiding by the 
states position on taxation because those cases are settled the 
revenue department does not release the names of the companies 
weve collected 10 million from those other companies and 
mercedes is the only holdout houghteling said it would be 
fair to say that mercedes position is unique in the industry 
massachusetts is closely watching cases in other states in which 
revenue departments try to collect taxes merely on the basis of a 
companys advertising in that state 
you dont need to have your company headquarters in a state to 
be found to be doing business there houghteling said 
shuman declined to comment on the seizure of the fourdoor 
mercedes in massachusetts but criticized the revenue department for 
its pejorative language in discussing the tax case 
were made to look like scofflaws he said 
houghteling said most of the 50000 will go into the state 
general fund but the amount may be largely symbolic because the 
state may have to pay thousands to fight its legal battle against 
mercedes for the rest of the back taxes

us bankruptcy judge harold abramson said 
creditors in the bankruptcy case of william herbert and nancy hunt 
can submit suggestions on how the hunts should repay their debts 
the judges decision monday shifts leverage in the case from the 
debtors to the creditors creditors previously had to base 
negotiations on a plan developed by herbert hunt 
abramson said he will allow the suggestions because he did not 
see a resolution coming from herbert hunts proposed settlement 
i find that the mere filing of competing plans will not impede 
debtors negotiations said the judge who ultimately will decide 
how creditors are paid 
the internal revenue service and manufacturers hanover trust co 
of new york two of the largest creditors in the herbert hunt 
bankruptcy said they will file a repayment plan by friday 
this is exactly what we have been asking for said grover 
hartt iii an attorney for the irs 
the irs claims herbert hunt owes about 300 million in back 
taxes while brother nelson bunker hunt owes 700 million the irs 
has agreed to settle both cases for about 350 million 
bunker and herbert owned onethird of the worlds supply of 
silver bullion from a silvershopping spree that began in 1973 
government attorneys claim 
as the price tumbled to 10 an ounce from 50 an ounce the 
brothers found themselves with debts totaling as much as 2 billion 
and creditors threatening the familys beloved placid oil co 
barbara houser attorney for the peruvian silver mining company 
minpeco sa which seeks 251 million said she also has a plan 
prepared 
abramson gave bunker hunt and his wife caroline until aug 31 
to work out a repayment plan with their creditors 
the judge said the hunt cases are two of the most difficult 
chapter 11 cases a lawyer could envision 
stephen a mccartin attorney for herbert and nancy hunt said 
that allowing creditors to submit repayment proposals will make 
it more difficult to reach a consensual plan 
the irs plan to be filed this week in the herbert hunt case will 
recommend that the agency receive 70 percent of a liquidating 
trust or about 60 million under the plan the irs also would get 
90 million in a nondischargeable claim that would be paid after 
herbert emerges from bankruptcy 
the irs is negotiating a similar settlement proposal with bunker 
and his wife caroline 
the hunt brothers including lamar hunt are in us tax court 
contesting the millions of dollars in taxes the irs says it is owed 
from the 1982 dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their 
debts after the silver price collapse 
the hunts nonjury tax trial reconvenes in washington dc

the senate commerce committee today voted 152 
to approve president bushs three nominees for the federal 
communications commission and sent the appointments to the floor 
for expected speedy confirmation 
committee chairman sen ernest f hollings dsc said he 
expected the full senate to vote on the nominations of alfred c 
sikes sherrie p marshall and andrew c barrett before the 
scheduled beginning of the congressional recess on friday 
sen albert gore dtenn and sen jay rockefeller dwva 
cast the dissenting votes 
the vote came one day after a hearing that was dominated by the 
issues of sex and violence on the airwaves 
gore said he voted against the nomination as a symbolic protest 
of eight years of freemarket deregulation of the communications 
industry under the reagan administration he said he believed the 
new nominees would continue the reaganera philosophy 
hollings gore and others hit hard on tv indecency noting that 
until congress stepped in to ban all indecent tv programs in 1988 
the fcc had established a safe harbor for such shows from 
midnight to 6 am when children were presumed not to be watching 
garbage is garbage regardless of the time of day hollings 
said 
barrett sparked a confrontation with gore when he said that he 
abhorred indecent programming but that the fcc must recognize 
there is a market for indecency and that the agencys role is 
to decide what the law will allow us to tolerate 
americans gore responded are sick and tired of whats going 
on 
sikes said he would vigorously attack obscene material on the 
airwaves but that the supreme court has proscribed much of 
congress power in the area of free speech and indecency 
the fcc last year tried to implement the 24hour ban on indecent 
programming but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged it 
on constitutional grounds a federal appeals court in january 
stayed imposition of the law 
hollings and other committee members expressed hope that 
relations between the fcc and congress would improve after eight 
years of battles with a commission headed by outgoing chairman 
dennis r patrick and his predecessor mark s fowler 
because of his displeasure with patricks policies hollings had 
refused for more than a year to hold hearings on other nominees to 
fill two vacancies on the fivemember fcc patrick will step down 
when sikes is confirmed 
sikes a selfdescribed moderate is the assistant secretary of 
commerce for communications and information a former broadcaster 
and a longtime political ally of sen john danforth rmo a 
member of the committee 
barrett is a member of the illinois commerce commission and 
marshall is a lawyer and former legislative aide to patrick 
the nominees face a host of important issues such as the 
government role in fostering international competitiveness in areas 
such as highdefinition television further deregulation of the 
telephone industry reregulating cable television and assignment 
of the airwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephones 
and direct broadcast satellites

american express co confirmed tuesday it has 
agreed to pay 8 million or twice as much as it originally 
announced to settle accusations that people acting on its behalf 
spread false information about banker edmund j safra 
there is a second 4 million the company said in a 
statement released after the new york times reported in tuesdays 
editions about the higher total 
the second 4 million intended to reimburse expenses safra 
incurred was not disclosed last week because we didnt view it 
as part of the apology to safra said american express spokesman 
larry armour 
in a letter dated july 24 american express chairman james d 
robinson iii apologized to safra for an unauthorized and shameful 
effort by people acting on american express behalf to encourage 
false media reports that safras banks had been involved with money 
laundering 
in the letter he said american express would donate 4 million 
to charities of safras choice 
the times reported that american express actually had agreed to 
pay 8 million including the 4 million in donations mentioned in 
an exchange of letters that the two sides released friday in 
disclosing their settlement 
we regarded the 4 million mentioned in fridays exchange of 
letters as a clear and simple apology for conduct we regretted 
american express said in its statement tuesday on the matter 
safra an international banker who lives in geneva switzerland 
made a career out of providing banking services to the very rich a 
former american express executive he controls safra republic 
holdings sa and holds a large stake in republic national bank of 
new york 
american express said tuesday that it had made no attempt to 
hide the second 4 million but added we didnt discuss it 
either because we didnt regard it as part of the apology 
american express said the safra people had wanted us to 
reimburse them for expenses which they said were in the 4 million 
range 
we felt that was an inappropriate request but rather than drag 
out what had already become a long and difficult negotiation and in 
an effort to resolve matters we were willing to make the 
additional 4 million contribution to charity as a further gesture 
of goodwill the statement read 
asked if there were any other undisclosed payments or other 
features of the settlement with safra that american express had not 
disclosed on its own armour said there were none to the best of 
my knowledge

us corporate purchasing managers said tuesday 
their gauge of industrial health fell to the weakest point since 
the economic expansion began more than 6 years ago a report that 
fanned recession fears 
the purchasing managers index a widely watched barometer of 
the economys direction plunged to 46 percent in july from 488 
percent in june the third straight monthly decline 
that makes the level of last month was the lowest since january 
1983 the early days of what has become the countrys longest 
peacetime expansion the january 1983 reading also was 46 percent 
the news from the purchasing agents comes at a time when 
economic vital signs are under intense scrutiny in the business 
world because of questions about whether the economy has enough 
strength to continue growing 
most analysts think the economy needs the stimulation of lower 
interest rates to avert a general recession some sectors of the 
economy already seem to be sinking into deep declines analysts say 
i think the index is pointing very ominously toward serious 
problems for the economy right now said david resler chief 
economist at nomura securities international it looks to me like 
the odds of recession are going up every day 
allen sinai economist at the boston co said the report on 
business by the national association of purchasing management 
underscored the weakened state of the economys industrial base 
the industrial side of the economy is weak flirting with 
recession said sinai parts of the economy and some regions of 
the country do appear to be in or near a recession 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan has said the 
central banks chief mission now is to prevent the economy from 
sliding into a harmful recession with that aim in mind the fed 
has loosened its hold on credit 
many commercial banks on monday reduced their prime lending 
rates to 10 percent from 11 percent the cut in the benchmark rate 
is expected to reduce borrowing expenses for businesses and 
consumers and encourage spending 
robert j bretz chairman of the purchasing groups business 
survey committee said members representing manufacturers in 
certain industries such as automobiles and consumer durable goods 
are pessimistic about the next several months because they know 
lower interest rates dont immediately change behavior 
there typically is a lag of several months before lower credit 
costs start to encourage increases in spending 
bretz said a reading in the purchasing agents index below 50 
percent indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is 
in decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates growth 
but he said the index would have to fall below 44 percent in 
order to suggest an overall decline in economic activity meaning 
that the inflationadjusted gross national product the value of 
all goods and services produced was contracting rather than 
expanding 
the monthly report contained what private economists called some 
fairly upbeat news on inflation and trade 
the price index declined to 469 percent in july from 485 
percent in june and reached the lowest level since april 1986 when 
it was 428 percent 
exports were the strongest element of the economy as slightly 
more members of the association reported that they were exporting 
in july 
here are some details from the report 
manufacturing production fell in july snapping a string of 35 
straight months of expansion the index of manufacturing output 
fell to 483 percent from 524 percent in june and was the lowest 
since a reading of 482 percent in july 1985 
new orders declined in july for the second consecutive month 
the new orders index fell to 448 percent from 472 percent in 
june last months reading was the lowest since 415 percent in 
november 1982 when the last economic recession was bottoming out 
employment dropped for the sixth straight month reflecting 
manufacturer reluctance to hire in the face of a slowing economy 
the employment index fell to 444 percent in july from 474 percent 
in june 
inventories fell for a seventh straight month in july down to 
455 percent from 497 percent 
the pace of vendor deliveries quickened in july with the index 
at 469 percent vs 475 percent indicating fewer commodities were 
in short supply 
the associations monthly report is based on replies to 
questions asked of purchasing executives in more than 250 
industrial companies the purchasing managers index is a composite 
of five separate indicators including new orders production 
vendor deliveries inventories and employment

grain futures prices closed mostly higher in a 
technical rebound tuesday on the chicago board of trade but 
soybeans for august delivery plunged to a new 16month low 
reflecting a rise in supplies from south america 
in addition to the increased movement of newly harvested 
soybeans from argentina and brazil soybean speculators saw an 
important technical support swept away monday when august soybeans 
crashed below 625 a bushel 
mondays 24cent plunge in the august contract prompted selling 
in an attempt among some traders to depress the market further to 
the next support level of 6 a bushel said william biedermann 
director of research with allendale inc a futures brokerage based 
in crystal lake ill 
the moderate gains in most of the other grain and soybean 
contracts were perceived as a technical correction in a bear market 
with farmers believed to still be holding fairly large amounts 
of corn and soybeans and the harvest season approaching market 
fundamentals look pretty bleak biedermann said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 387 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 4 cents higher with september at 222 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 133 a 
bushel soybeans were 10 cents lower to 8 cents higher with august 
at 614 a bushel the lowest settlement of a nearby soybean 
contract since march 16 1988

international paper co has agreed to pay 
fines totaling 990000 and has installed 45 million worth of 
airpllution equipment at a local mill under a proposed consent 
decree with the state and federal governments officials announced 
tuesday 
the fine is the largest environmental fine ever levied in maine 
and the stiffest ever imposed in new england for violations of the 
federal clean air act state and federal officials said 
it used to be that dirty air had to be suffered by all maine 
people so that some corporations might prosper this settlement is 
an indication that those days are over maine attorney general 
james e tierney said at a news conference at which the agreement 
was announced 
state environmental protection commissioner dean c marriott 
portrayed the settlement as only the latest result of his 
departments steppedup efforts to crack down on polluters 
theres more to come he told reporters 
the company which denied all the allegations issued a brief 
statement noting that the agreement is still subject to approval by 
a federal judge and that the alleged violations occurred during the 
late 1970s and early 1980s 
none of the situations which are alleged to have been 
violations are recent or ever posed a danger to the health and 
wellbeing of our employees or surrounding community members 
said richard white a spokesman for international papers jay mill 
international paper based in purchase ny is the largest 
us paper producer 
at issue in the case which dates back to 1983 is a waste fuel 
incinerator that is the largest source of particulate emissions at 
the mill 
the company had planned to restrict the amount of oil burned in 
the incinerator thereby exempting it from tough new source 
pollution standards established under the clean air act but the 
state and federal governments alleged the company repeatedly used a 
greater amount of oil and that emissions from the incinerator 
should be subject to those more stringent standards which cover 
such materials as particulates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
in addition the state had charged additional violations of 
state law including the companys failure to properly monitor 
ambient air quality around the mill 
under the consent decree ip must pay a 540000 fine to the 
state and 450000 to the federal government further the company 
has modified the incinerator to permanently restrict the amount of 
oil it burns and installed 45 million worth of pollution control 
equipment 
ip also agreed to cut emissions of particulates by half and to 
conduct tests next year to determine whether further reductions are 
possible 
tierney stressed that the settlement is unrelated to a state 
lawsuit filed a year ago that alleges widespread violations at the 
mill of many state environmental laws that suit is still pending 
he said

gte telephone operations group plans to break 
ground wednesday for its new headquarters a plum the nations

texas in the wake of unfavorable regulatory decisions 
gte corp announced last year it planned to locate the 
headquarters for its largest operating unit in the dallas suburb of

reconsidering the decision after the texas public utilities 
commission refused to grant gte southwest inc a rate increase 
instead ordering the utility to cut rates and issue refunds to 
texas customers 
at the time state officials accused the company of using the 
headquarters move to pressure regulators into changing their minds 
the commission has twice refused to reopen the case 
although gte announced in april it would go ahead with the 
headquarters move gte southwest continues to appeal parts of the 
puc decision even though it has begun cutting phone bills

six months after a court settlement in 
the bhopal gas disaster fueled speculation about possible takeover 
attempts union carbide corp said tuesday it has implemented 
poison pill measures to ward off unwanted suitors 
carbide spokesman david n kernis called the antitakeover 
measures routine and said officials at the danbury connbased 
company dont know of any possible takeover attempts and none has 
been offered 
nearly 1000 companies have these things were sure from time 
to time these things have come up for review at carbide but 
obviously this is our first one kernis said 
the poison pill measures announced last week would allow 
carbide shareholders to acquire additional stock at a deep 
discount thereby making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
for a potential acquirer 
analysts have said the corporation became a prime takeover 
candidate in february when the supreme court of india ordered the 
multinational chemical giant to pay 470 million to settle claims 
arising from the 1984 bhopal disaster but they were cautious in 
evaluating carbides poisonpill plan 
while immersed in the legal battle over bhopal in 1985 carbide 
successfully fought off a 43 billion hostile takeover attempt by 
gaf corp by repurchasing some of its common stock directors said 
later they never considered a poisonpill defense 
harvey stober an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said 
monday that carbide is attractive because it has tremendous cash 
flow businesses that can be separated and sold off and it has 
easily understood businesses in addition he said the 
companys stock is currently undervalued closing up of a point 
monday at 2712 
carbide last week reported second quarter earnings of 186 
million or 133 a share on sales of 228 billion the earnings 
were down slighty from 1988 second quarter earnings of 187 
million or 139 a share on revenue of 21 billion 
stober said corporate takeover strategist carl c icahn has been 
mentioned as one possible carbide suitor but stober said he 
believed the company when it said no takeover offers have been made 
its something that many companies have done its usually 
done to get fair treatment under a hostile attempt and usually to 
preclude the use of greenmail he said greenmail is an 
antitakeover maneuver in which the target company buys the raiders 
stock at a price above that available to other stockholders 
leslie ravitz an analyst with salomon brothers inc said that 
carbides action was typical of the chemical industry he said it 
would be misleading to interpret carbides plan as an indication 
that it will soon become involved in an acquisition noting that 
the company has had no suitors in the many months that it has been 
the subject of takeover talks 
ravitz agreed that carbide is an attractive takeover target but 
so is virtually every company out there in the chemical 
industry he said adding that the stock of most chemical 
companies are currently undervalued 
ravitz said carbides poisonpill measures are good only as long 
as the board of directors wants to keep them in place he said if a 
large enough cash offer is made the directors would have to revoke 
measures 
it doesnt preclude a takeover it just gives you a hurdle to 
jump he said 
under the carbide plan shareholders of record as of aug 31 
will receive one right to purchase a share of common stock at a 
discount for each outstanding share of stock they own the rights 
will expire on aug 31 1999 unless redeemed by the company at a 
cost of 1 cent per right 
the rights are exercisable only within 10 days after a potential 
buyer acquires 20 percent or more of carbide common stock or only 
within 10 days of an announcement of a tender offer to acquire at 
least 20 percent of carbide stock

crude oil futures prices dropped tuesday giving 
back part of the previous sessions gains as a hurricane in the 
gulf of mexico swept ashore enabling offshore oil producers to get 
back to work 
the contract for september delivery of west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude fell 28 cents to 1803 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange after rising 
38 cents in the previous session contracts for delivery in later 
months posted similar losses 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange the 
september contract of unleaded gasoline also tumbled falling 127 
cents to 5143 cents a gallon after spurting 115 cents a gallon on 
monday later contract months posted smaller declines 
the september contract for delivery of no2 heating oil settled 
011 cent lower at 4920 cents a gallon after rising 049 cent on 
monday 
it was the mirror image of yesterday in crude oil and 
gasoline said bob baker who follows oil futures prices for the 
investment firm prudentialbache securities inc 
on monday prices had risen on fears that the storm would 
severly disrupt production off the texas and louisiana coasts 
but baker said those fears proved largely unfounded on tuesday 
and the market concluded the hurricane was not going to be much 
of a factor in reducing supplies

the dollar tumbled in choppy us trading 
tuesday weighed down by additional evidence of sluggish economic 
activity and expectations of further interest rate declines 
gold prices traded near recent levels on the commodity exchange 
in new york gold for august delivery closed at 37080 a troy 
ounce up 30 cents from mondays settlement the republic national 
bank quoted bullion at 37050 an ounce as of 4 pm in new york 
10 cents higher than mondays late bid 
after some initial strength in early new york dealings the 
dollar started to slide after release of a monthly business report 
from the national association of purchasing management showing 
weakness in manufacturing 
the purchasing managers index dropped to 46 percent in july 
from 488 percent in june falling to the lowest level since 
january 1983 
the news from the nations purchasing agents coupled with 
report of a drop in construction spending reinforced expectations 
of further reductions in interest rates 
decreases in us interest rates would cut returns on 
dollardenominated investments and lessen demand for dollars 
thomas palladino an assistant vice president at amsterdam 
rotterdam banks new york office said currency dealers have been 
operating under the assumption that the federal reserve board has 
been nudging interest rates lower 
a rumor swept through the market tuesday that the central bank 
was about to slash its discount rate a move that would underscore 
the feds desire for looser credit conditions to revive the 
flagging economy 
although there wasnt any substance to the rumor it intensified 
the selling which drove the dollar down toward thresholds 
considered technically significant palladino said 
the rumor may have been triggered by fed chairman alan 
greenspans remarks to the senate banking committee he confirmed 
that the central bank lowered interest rates another notch last 
week as part of its continuing effort to keep the country out of 
recession 
earlier on currency markets abroad the dollar headed higher in 
subdued trading

their dollar holdings ahead of fridays release of us 
unemployment figures for july a potentially marketmoving report

energy futures prices eased tuesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange as the hurricane threat to gulf coast oil and naturalgas 
operations lessened and traders turned their attention to weekly 
supply statistics 
the market expected the american petroleum institute report to 
show increases of 1 million to 2 million barrels across the board 
the report released after the close showed crude oil stocks up 
882000 barrels gasoline stocks up 46 million barrels and 
distillate stocks up about 21 million barrels 
the report also showed a rise in refinery runs contrary to 
expectations 
on other markets coffee futures surged nearmonth soybean 
futures continued to slide but most grain contracts advanced pork 
bellies led the livestock and meat markets lower and precious 
metals were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 29 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in september at 1803 a 
barrel heating oil was 11 cent lower to 04 cent higher with 
september at 4920 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 80 cent 
to 127 cents lower with september at 5143 cents a gallon 
the market gave back most of mondays gains which were 
triggered by fears of damage to gulf coast oil refineries and 
offshore platforms by hurricane chantal 
today they were selling on the fact that it was not nearly as 
bad a hurricane as they were expecting said ray mazzeo energy 
futures specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the hurricane lashed the gulf coast with heavy rain and wind up 
to 80 mph but was downgraded to a tropical storm about 2 hours 
after moving ashore near high island texas midway between 
galveston and port arthur 
some offshore oil and gas operations were shut down monday 
afternoon but they were back in operation late tuesday 
analysts said the only danger to refineries appeared to be the 
possibility that the heavy rains could cause some flooding of pumps 
located near the ground 
coffee futures prices surged on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange in a reversal of the recent trend 
some analysts called the rally a technical correction while 
others cited folger coffee cos announcement of a 
20centsperpound cut in wholesale prices of ground roast coffee 
folger said the price cut reflected the sharp drop in green 
coffee prices following the international coffee organizations 
july 3 suspension of export quotas 
coffee settled 202 cents to 338 cents higher with september at 
8237 cents a pound 
most grain futures advanced in a technical rebound on the 
chicago board of trade but soybeans for august delivery plunged to 
a new 16month low of 613 a bushel reflecting a rise in 
supplies from south america and growing confidence that us 
supplies would last until harvest time 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 
387 a bushel corn was unchanged to 4 cents higher with 
september at 222 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher 
with september at 133 a bushel soybeans were 11 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with august at 613 a bushel the lowest settlement 
of a nearby soybean contract since march 16 1988 
pork belly futures prices dropped sharply on the chicago 
mercantile exchange the nearmonth contract fell below 25 cents a 
pound reflecting the continuing weak demand for bacon and the 
nearrecord supply of bellies in cold storage 
weak cash markets also weighed on the pork and cattle markets 
live cattle settled 08 cent to 50 cent lower with august at 
7242 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 32 cent lower 
with august at 8345 cents a pound live hogs were 30 cent to 65 
cent lower with august at 4550 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 25 cent to 135 cents lower with august at 2482 cents a 
pound

exchange while silver finished slightly lower after posting strong 
gains in the previous session 
gold settled 80 cents lower to 30 cents higher with august at

indictments will be announced wednesday 
resulting from the fbis undercover probe of suspected corrupt 
practices and traders at the nations two largest futures 
exchanges law enforcement sources said tuesday 
the justice department said attorney general dick thornburgh 
fbi director william sessions and anton valukas us attorney for 
the northern district of illinois would hold an afternoon news 
conference in chicago wednesday 
the justice department did not give the reason for the news 
conference 
two law enforcement sources in washington and chicago who spoke 
on condition of anonymity told the associated press the news 
conference was being held to announce indictments stemming from the 
twoyear investigation 
one of the sources said wendy gramm chairwoman of the commodity 
futures trading commission also would attend 
the chicago suntimes reported tuesday that several commodities 
traders who have agreed to plead guilty to crimes have been 
bargaining for reduced civil penalties 
a lawyer was not identified told the newspaper said he and other 
attorneys have been negotiating with the cftc to try to minimize 
penalties against their clients 
the commission which regulates the exchanges has the power to 
pull trading licenses levy fines and ban future participation in 
the markets 
eight to 15 traders have agreed to cooperate in the federal 
probe of an estimated 50 to 100 traders engaging in allegedly 
corrupt practices at the chicago mercantile exchange and the 
chicago board of trade the newspaper reported tuesday 
when charges against cooperating traders are announced the 
commission is expected to disclose administrative penalties the 
newspaper said 
meanwhile the merc has brought its own charges against four 
traders in connection with yenpit trades with an undercover fbi 
agent who was part of the federal probe according to the wall 
street journal 
the merc charges represent the third of four possible levels of 
repercussions traders could face if found to have defrauded 
customers or been guilty of wrongdoing according to one lawyer who 
spoke with the associated press 
the four are federal criminal prosecution federal 
administrative penalties disciplinary action by the exchanges and 
consequences from the national futures association which registers 
certain categories of traders and has its own rules and penalties 
for violating them the lawyer said 
lawyers are calling it quadruple jeopardy he said 
merc spokesman andrew yemma declined to comment tuesday on the 
wall street journal report which said the merc charges concern 
prearranged trading in yenfutures contracts expiring in december 
and march 
it is our policy not to comment on an investigation 
until disciplinary action is taken yemma said 
the charges could result in fines and expulsion of traders the 
journal said administrative action by the cftc is likely to be 
similar according to the suntimes 
even traders who cooperate will lose their licenses but may be 
spared enormous fines the suntimes said also traders might 
avoid longterm bans from participating in the markets by 
cooperating 
for traders who arent cooperating with federal prosecutors 
however the trading commission plans to withhold charges until 
after trials end the newspaper said 
anyone convicted is expected to face maximum administrative 
penalties while anyone found innocent of criminal wrongdoing may 
still be liable for civil action based on court testimony 
prosecutors met with about 20 traders lawyers late last week to 
open the way to possible pleabargain arrangements for clients 
facing indictment under the federal racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act 
in the twoyear futures probe fbi agents infiltrated the 
trading floors to gather evidence of suspected illegal practices

northwest airlines has told its 5000 pilots 
that management is optimistic a labor agreement can be reached 
despite the breakdown in 29monthlong negotiations 
sl henning northwests vice president for flight operations 
said in the letter mailed late last week that many key issues 
already have been resolved including a guarantee of no layoffs for 
all pilots now employed by the airline and the right to reopen the 
contract if the company changes control 
i am well aware of the frustration that you feel over the 
unusually long period of time this process has taken henning 
wrote 
i share your frustration we must however keep in mind that 
this process has been complicated by the difficulty of combining 
two very different pilot contracts republic and northwest the 
ongoing unresolved seniority integration and the takeover activity 
during the past several months 
an investment group led by los angeles businessman alfred 
checchi recently completed its 36 billion tender offer for 
northwests parent nwa inc and appeared to have won control of 
nwa 
insurance coverage for retired pilots wages and a b wage 
scale for new pilots are among the major remaining issues in the 
negotiations 
northwest has offered a 5year reduced pay scale for new pilots 
at 70 percent of the existing scale the air line pilots 
association wants a 3year scale at an 80 percent rate 
the contract talks broke off last week and alpa has asked the 
national mediation board to declare an impasse so that a 30day 
coolingoff period would begin at the end of 30 days the pilots 
could legally strike 
henning noted that northwest and alpa have agreed to a 94 
percent wage increase in the first year of the contract the wage 
increase for the remaining three years of the contract remains 
unsettled the company has offered increases of 3 percent 2 
percent and 3 percent respectively through 1992 the pilots want 
45 percent 5 percent 45 percent and 2 percent through 1993 
also in dispute is a lumpsum payment to replace retroactive pay 
for the 29 months during which the old contract has been expired 
northwest has offered 5 million to be distributed among pilots 
according to their own formula the pilots are seeking 30 million 
the company remains optimistic that progress can yet be made 
that will ultimately lead to an agreement in these remaining 
areas said henning 
alpa spokesman andy murphy said tuesday that the letter was 
largely factual but he said it overlooks unattractive portions 
of the companys latest offer 
they certainly have painted a brighter picture than we see 
it murphy said for all the highlights there are a lot of 
lowlights and we have problems with some of those things

of its banks by federal regulators said tuesday it earned 15 
million in the second quarter its first full quarter of operation 
after the reorganization 
the company which has filed for chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
protection was left with five banks after the federal deposit 
insurance corp seized 20 mbanks in texas on march 28 the rescue 
is expected to be the second most expensive thrift bailout in the 
nations history 
those five banks earned 15 million or 3 cents per share in 
the three month ended june 30 the company said 
in the first three months this year the same five banks had a 
loss of 34 million mcorp said releasing the numbers for the 
first time tuesday 
the losses during that period reflected a very harsh 
examination by federal regulators who forced the company to write 
down assets more severely that bank officials thought necessary 
mcorp spokesman joe stroop said 
we took a big hit in the first quarter that in our view should 
not occur again he said 
deposits at the five banks fell from 275 billion at years end 
to 262 billion on march 31 and 25 billion on june 30 
assets dropped from 35 billion at the end of 1988 to 31 
billion on march 31 and 306 billion on june 30 nonperforming 
assets were 167 million in the second quarter up from 147 
million in the first quarter and 130 million at the beginning of 
the year 
mcorps five banks are in brownsville corpus christi el paso 
new braunfels and waco the company includes a statewide trust and 
investment subsidiary 
after operating the 20 mbanks as deposit insurance bridge bank 
since the takeover the fdic sold the bank to banc one corp of 
ohio the resulting bank one texas has assets of about 13 billion 
although that could drop to about 10 billion after bad assets are 
pruned 
the fdic has estimated the bailout could end up costing as much 
as 23 billion ranking second only to last years rescue of first 
republicbank corp with an estimated cost of 3 billion

court says millionaire businessman marvin warner is trying to 
strike a deal with creditors to prevent the seizure and sale of 
warners assets

said he will not let the 11thhour settlement efforts interfere 
with his assignment to track down warners assets for distribution 
to creditors 
mr warner wants to stop me bakst said in an interview with 
the cincinnati post published tuesday just because warner is 
flopping around trying to make deals doesnt mean i cant do my 
job we are going forward

from his creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act 
warner who now lives in ocala fla and filed the petition in 
us bankruptcy court in jacksonville fla sought protection from 
creditors seeking more than 4 billion from him 
home states march 1985 collapse precipitated a crisis among 
ohio thrifts warners creditors include the state of ohio which 
obtained a march 1987 court order that warner pay back to the state 
22 million needed to guarantee home state deposits 
warner a former us ambassador to switzerland was convicted 
on ohio felony charges in home states collapse but was acquitted

home shopping networks 15 billion 
lawsuit accusing gte corp of failing to provide adequate equipment 
to handle a large volume of calls went to a jury tuesday 
in closing arguments a gte attorney blamed hsns telephone 
problems on the video retailers failure to inform gte officials in 
advance of plans to enter 11 new markets in 1986 
the case went to the sixmember jury after a sixweek trial 
before pinellas circuit judge howard rives after about two hours 
the panel was excused with deliberations to continue wednesday 
morning 
home shopping attorneys said in final arguments monday that gte 
told little white lies to the network to cover up the 
communications companys failure to provide for the volume of calls 
in 1986 and 1987 
but gte attorney roy reardon said tuesday that hsn said in a 
dec 2 1986 letter that the telephone company had been 
responsive to all our previous needs and was lookimg forward 
to continuing this highly successful relationship 
ten months later hsn filed suit claiming it lost millions of 
calls and some 500 million in potential sales because the gte 
telephone network equipment was ineffective 
named as defendants were the stamford connbased parent 
company its florida subsidiary and gte communications gte has 
filed a slander and libel counterclaim that blamed hsns decline in 
the electronics market and stock market on mismanagement 
reardon said hsns purchase of 11 uhf stations in new markets 
combined with its entrance in the cable television market caused 
the number of subscribers to soar from 9 million to 465 million in 
one year 
he said gte knew about the cable arrangements a 1 million 
stock option offered to cable companies enhanced their interest in 
hsn he said and 70 cable outlets were obtained 
but even when hsn made its initial public stock offering on may 
13 1986 the company failed to mention plans to purchase the uhf 
stations as a second operational network reardon argued 
he said an hsn official warned in september 1986 that the 
network didnt have enough people to answer the growing number of 
calls but board chairman roy speer didnt want to hear they 
needed more operators 
competition from similar retailers also has led to hsns decline 
in sales reardon said 
responding to hsn charges gte didnt mention the overload 
problem to protect its business reardon said hsn was aware of 
alternative services before it contracted with gte in 1985 
when club members rose to 126000 in november 1985 he said hsn 
signed contracts to purchase three omni automatic call distribution 
systems from gte 
the first was installed in the middle of februrary 1986 and hsn 
launched its uhf network with the second omni on march 1 about 10 
weeks before going public
