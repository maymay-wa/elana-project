of the wrongful death lawsuit filed against the widow of arthur 
kane who killed a merrill lynch manager and himself after the 1987 
stock market crash 
kane financially wiped out by black monday walked into the 
merrill lynch amp co office in miami on oct 26 1987 one week after 
the crash killing office manager jose argilagos and paralyzing his 
broker lloyd kolokoff 
attorneys rw buddy payne and frank areces representing 
argilagos announced the case was settled but that dade county 
circuit judge martin greenbaum ordered that the amount of damages 
not be disclosed 
kane 53 was actually arthur katz a disbarred lawyer and 
federally protected witness relocated to miami his testimony in 
philadelphia helped convict mob figures in a 1977 stock fraud case 
which drew death threats from organized crime figures 
in testimony thursday kolokoff said kanes depression grew 
steadily worse 
after the crash he was really depressed in a state of 
shock kolokoff said as the week wore on he talked about 
wanting to kill himself 
kolokoff his wife wanda and argilagos survivors filed the civil 
suit against kanes wife judith 
the settlement friday resolved a lawsuit by kolokoff one by the 
family of argilagos and on thursday that he had listened to kanes 
increasingly desperate talk about overdosing on drugs or carbon 
monoxide and tried to convince him he could bounce back 
it was money it wasnt his life kolokoff recalled telling 
him he just wouldnt listen to anything 
the day before the shooting a week after the market crash kane 
called kolokoff at home the broker said kolokoff assured him that 
he was a valuable customer and that merrill lynch would work with 
him 
however when kane came in monday planning to pay 60000 to 
70000 to keep his account open he was told he needed 130000 
kane said he would return with the money 
he came back later went into argilagos office with kolokoff 
and pulled his gun mr kane took out the gun and said take 
this jose and fired one shot kolokoff said and thats the 
last thing i remember 
now a paraplegic kolokoff said his life is dominated by pain 
his income has dropped to 45000 compared to 1987 when he was on 
track to earn 295000 he said and his medical bills exceeded 
324000 
kolokoff said he overcame early depression with determination to 
live i want to live he said i have a really good family i 
cant even think about losing them

a couple who were the only two of 62 
defendants who went to trial in a 12 million couponredemption 
fraud have received stiff prison sentences 
william winokur refused to plead guilty for his part in the 
scheme but was sentenced thursday to 17 years his wife florence 
who turned down the states offer of five years probation was 
sentenced to seven years 
broward circuit judge leroy moe gave william winokur the maximum 
sentence under the states guidelines that was more than triple the 
time the coupon fraud mastermind larry krasnick received after 
admitting his guilt in a plea deal 
florence winokur faced a maximum penalty of nine years besides 
serving prison time moe ordered the winokurs to pay 230000 in 
restitution and each serve 10 years probation 
the state offered winokur a 2year sentence when he was arrested 
more than a year ago i would have loved to give him 2 years 
moe said before he sentenced the winokurs 
all he had to do was say he did it and hed probably be 
walking the streets now because prison overcrowding means that 
most inmates serve only about a third of their sentences 
i dont think there wasnt a person associated with the case 
that didnt urge them to take a deal moe said im not 
responsible for their choices 
the winokurs were convicted three weeks ago on charges of 
racketeering grand theft and conspiracy they operated stores in 
dade palm beach and broward counties in 198688 solely to illegally 
redeem coupons 
the stores had products on their shelves but the winokurs seldom 
made a sale according to prosecutors the shops were set up as 
facades to redeem 200000 worth of coupons for products never sold 
the enterprise which involved 81 stores bought coupons in bulk 
from charitable organizations and had other people clip sort and 
crumple coupons to make them look handled by consumers

waitresses and workers he opened for a sneak preview about three 
weeks ago but many truckers stayed away waiting for the publicity 
to die down cortese said 
on friday the first trucker pulled into the parking lot off 
interstate 25 a halfhour after the shop opened about noon two 
others arrived a few minutes later 
i just kind of wondered what was going on said jeb hansen 
driving an 18wheel truck for a montana company i dropped some 
lambs off i had to make a phone call and i thought id have a 
doughnut and a cup of coffee

two women hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint 
friday snatched two inmates from a prison yard and fled the region 
in a waiting van but all four were captured after a shootout in 
nebraska authorities said 
we can confirm they were taken into custody all four of 
them said juanita novak a spokesman for the colorado department 
of corrections 
the wild shootout in holdrege neb involved a 
gunfirepunctuated pursuit of a rented van through a residential 
neighborhood said a witness to the final showdown 
they crossed a median and hit a tree the witness a woman 
who spoke on condition of anonymity we could definitely see they 
had guns and were shooting the police tried to arrest them by 
swerving in front of the truck but they ran up into a yard 
the nineminute chase began when a holdrege police officer 
spotted the yellow van at 618 pm and the pursuit wound through 
town until it ended at 627 pm said phelps county attorney glenn 
clark 
the shooting started after the van struck a police car headon 
clark said after the first encounter they went down the street 
shooting houses and at people he said 
about eight officers were involved in the chase and about five 
were shot at he said at least eight shots penetrated the cars 
windshield police said 
the van stopped and the four were arrested without further 
resistance after one of the men was shot clark said one of them 
was hit and was bleeding pretty bad clark said hes fine he 
just got hit in the hand 
ralph brown was at good samaritan hospital in kearney with a 
shotgun pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand said 
phelps county sheriff dwayne newman 
holdrege police chief ken jackson said there were no other 
injuries despite indiscriminate shooting by the suspects as police 
converged on them in this farming town of about 5600 people in 
southcentral nebraska about 40 miles north of the kansas line 
deputy county rebecca miller said police confiscated a 9mm 
automatic and a 22caliber pistol 
clark said the other man and woman were being held at the phelps 
county jail the other woman was being held at holdrege police 
headquarters the prosecutor said he expected the four would be in 
court monday 
none of the four was formally charged clark said weve got 
plenty to hold them on he added 
another witness john swenson said he and his neighbor jim brenn 
ducked ducked behind brenns pickup truck when the shooting began 
about two houses away 
i saw the gun come out of the passenger side of the van and 
then they never stopped shooting swenson said it was just like 
on tv these were big guns not little ones 
mayor helen anderson said the town was quiet again at about 9 
pm theres probably some pretty excited people she said 
were not accustomed to this 
in the brazen daylight prison break frustrated guards held 
their fire because they could not get a clear shot at the helicopter 
and feared that the pilot was being held hostage said liz 
mcdonough a corrections spokewoman 
nevertheless authorities ordered an investigation to determine 
why a guard refused three orders from prison superintendent jim 
brittain to open fire on the helicopter 
from the time the helicopter came into view from the point of 
touchdown to takeoff was 10 to 15 seconds brittain said my 
recollection was that as the inmates were diving headfirst into the 
helicopter it was lifting off 
the pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the 
mediumsecurity state prison and the helicopter was found nearby 
after authorities received an anonymous telephone call 
authorities said the women were believed to be wives of the 
escaped inmates even though one of the women gave the name of a 
former deputy sheriff who had been fired for fraternizing with 
inmates 
the two escaped inmates were cellmates the women and the 
escapees apparently transferred to a rented van and eluded police 
authorities set up roadblocks on highways leading from the prison 
and the colorado national guard provided helicopters for the search 
the inmates were identified as freddie gonzales 21 who was 
serving a fouryear sentence for robbery and brown 21 who was 
sentenced for sexual assault theft and criminal impersonation in a 
bad check charge 
gonzales would have been eligible for parole in september 1991 
while browns parole eligibility date was october 1996 
one of the woman who rented the helicopter identified herself as 
julie quinn a former arapahoe county deputy fired for 
fraternization but from descriptions given by the pilot 
authorities now believe the hijacking was carried out by pat 
gonzales and rebecca brown wives of the two inmates 
the women apparently had planned to hijack a helicopter earlier 
in the week but their plans had to be delayed for several days due 
to bad weather mcdonough said 
the women rented the helicopter from helicopter airways in 
denver saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near 
the prison said walter kautzky director of the state corrections 
department 
once near the prison one woman pulled a gun and ordered the 
pilot to land kautzky said the arkansas valley correctional 
facility in crowley county is about 50 miles east of pueblo on the 
plains of southeastern colorado 
after the escape the helicopter flew north and the pilot was 
forced to land near a farmhouse and the rental truck the pilot tim 
graves was taken to the farmhouse where he was bound and gagged 
graves later was taken to the lincoln county jail in hugo for 
security authorities said he was being interviewed by police 
the incident was the latest in a rash of helicopter prison 
escapes and attempts in april a helicopter crashed after its tail 
rotor snagged on a fence at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center in miami fla the pilot and the prisoner survived 
in july 1988 a woman hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot 
to land in the prison yard at the penitentiary of new mexico near 
albuquerque three convicts escped but later were captured 
in november 1986 an inmate escaped from the minimumsecurity 
federal prison in pleasanton calif he later hijacked a helicopter 
and returned to the prison to free a woman inmate who worked with 
him in the prison business office they were captured 10 days later 
while buying wedding rings

theyre nuts about white squirrels in 
marionville just ask the folks at the white squirrel furniture 
store the white squirrel car wash or the white squirrel hollow bed 
amp breakfast 
and watch where youre driving a 21yearold city ordinance 
imposes a 500 fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of the 
rare albino squirrels motorists must yield right of way to them 
no one has ever been arrested for violating the law but that 
doesnt mean its taken lightly 
if i catch somebody killing a white squirrel i will issue a 
citation said police chief jesse merritt who wears a 
squirrelemblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform its no joke 
some people even go so far as to trap the albinos gray cousins 
and banish them from the small southwest missouri town to give the 
white squirrels first crack at the nuts 
marionville home to 2000 people and nearly half that many white 
squirrels has a billboard welcoming visitors to the home of the 
white squirrel 
only one other community in the nation olney ill is known 
to have a sizable concentration of the snowwhite squirrels but 
marionvilles colony is much larger says james smart a local 
authority and booster of the animal 
weve blown olney off the map he boasts olney has a measly 
few dozen squirrels he figures 
wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size of 
marionvilles is rare 
normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a population 
such as squirrels or birds or deer but entire populations are not 
something you come across all that frequently said eric 
kurzejeski a state wildlife research biologist 
signs of marionvilles affection for the white squirrel which 
mates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin are 
everywhere 
the lions club sells white squirrel tshirts and pins to raise 
money to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for the 
squirrels more than 500 dens have been put up and volunteers have 
planted hundreds of nut trees 
weve had orders for tshirts from kalamazoo mich to los 
angeles san francisco memphis kentucky says smart a lions 
member marionville is a small town but people who grew up here 
and moved away still remember their roots and want to help the white 
squirrel 
white squirrels first appeared in marionville around 1860 smart 
says according to local legend a couple of the critters escaped 
from a traveling circus and began multiplying or were the product 
of a weird experiment by a local scientist 
smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up on 
the deck of his home about 12 years ago he set out to increase the 
population by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woods 
around his home and releasing them several miles away to provide 
more room for the whites 
we trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half he said 
it was just amazing what the whites did then 
smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in 
30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property 
i have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it he 
said 
retirees johnie and ann clark spend hours on their back porch 
watching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at their 
feeders the couple had no white squirrels until smart transplanted 
some there a few years ago 
theyll play just like a little kitten mrs clark said 
there will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eat 
and ill say dont leave johnies bringing you something i 
swear they can understand me 
diana wise who runs the white squirrel hollow bed amp breakfast 
with her husband clint says people come for miles to see the 
animals 
a lot of people dont really believe we have white squirrels 
because they stop at noon and dont see them she said the best 
time to see them is 630 or 7 in the morning and around 7 730 at 
night when theyre feeding they dont like the heat and i think the 
light hurts their pink eyes 
smart used to hunt gray squirrels young squirrel fried with 
biscuits and gravy you cant beat it but not anymore 
the squirrels are a hobby a challenge for me now he says 
i guess im paying back for all the hunting i used to do

the national park service is negotiating with 
its counterparts in the soviet union to establish a park spanning 
the bering strait according to saturday editions of the washington 
post 
park officials will visit siberian areas across the strait from 
alaska next month and return with soviet officials who will inspect 
alaskan sites the newspaper said 
the service already administers the bering land bridge national 
preserve a 27million acre wild area just north of nome there is 
no comparable preserve on the soviet side 
such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct 
research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife 
biologists to track migratory species like walrus moving between the 
two countries 
in the last ice age the strait was dry which permitted people 
and animals to move between asia and north america 
the newspaper said the park project still embryonic is known 
around the headquarters of the park service as glasnost and the 
glaciers

two children who were spirited from new 
hampshire to montana by their mother after her exhusband was 
acquitted of sexually molesting their daughter must be returned to 
new england a judge ruled friday 
rockingham county superior court judge douglas gray ruled that 
jesse and mark murabitos 4yearold son and 6yearold daughter be 
placed in a new hampshire foster home pending a hearing sept 1 
mrs murabitos attorney alan rosenfeld criticized grays 
decision on a petition by murabito and said he would try to obtain 
an emergency order to keep the children in fort denton montana 
mrs murabito 40 contends the children would be in danger if 
they lived with her 34yearold exhusband at his home in derry 
in november after murabito was found innocent in the sexual 
abuse case his exwife disappeared with the children and began an 
eightmonth journey to loma via an underground railway that 
helps women in such situations 
murabito later was awarded custody 
last week montana authorities tipped that mrs murabito was 
living in loma under a false name took the children from her 
montana district judge john warner ordered on thursday that the 
children be kept in a state foster home until new hampshire courts 
called for their return 
gray said friday that montana authorities must deliver the 
children to exeter county sheriffs officers at logan airport in 
boston they then will be taken to a foster home in new hampshire 
where all parental visits will be supervised 
the children who are in fort denton will not be placed with 
either parent pending the superior court hearing next month 
murabito did not return telephone calls from the associated 
press and his lawyer raymond kellett jr of salem could not be 
reached for comment

two officials facing a recall election 
today said the town was wasting money on petty politics but their 
opponents said rudeness by officials was a bona fide issue 
for one thing i think its ridiculous because were both up for 
election in six months said selectman raymond gagnon who 
estimated the special elections cost at 10000 
today just more than a year after this towns citizens adopted a 
bylaw allowing for recall elections voters face the question of 
whether the current fivemember board has been illmannered and 
unresponsive 
the election features five candidates including the two 
incumbents running for two seats 
what it comes down to is theres been a small group of people 
in the town hall who have been trying to operate the place like its 
their private club said john r ward who helped lead the recall 
campaign thats pushing three alternative candidates 
ward said the selectmen betrayed the public in a variety of ways 
including at one point locking townspeople out of the town hall 
during a meeting and snickering at people with whom they disagreed 
theres just been abusive treatment laughing at people making 
comments its happened to me and its happened to other people 
said ward who lost a seat on the board in march by a narrow margin 
selectman geraldine f noonan who like gagnon could be forced 
from her post disagreed 
i cant remember any incident where any member on the board was 
rude to people she said we listen to all the issues that come 
before us we certainly wouldnt degrade a person if we didnt agree 
with an issue 
residents in this town of 15500 people south of boston say the 
bickering began in april when the board opted against renewing the 
contract of police chief walter miller who has since been demoted 
the selectmens decision was broadcast live on local cable 
television and many people were bewildered because during the 
chiefs tenure crime had subsided 
there was no debate no discussion and then when it was asked 
why they werent renewing his contract they refused to give a 
reason ward said 
within days 600 citizens had gathered to discuss the turn of 
events ward said within months more than 1800 signatures had 
been placed on a recall petition

tadeusz mazowieckis opposition to the 
communist government once brought him a year in prison now the 
general who put him behind bars appears poised to appoint him prime 
minister 
the tall taciturn 62yearold solidarity journalist is the least 
publicly known of the three candidates the labor movement offered to 
communist president wojciech jaruzelski 
but his links to solidarity date to the august 1980 strikes that 
created the union and his activism goes back to the days after 
world war ii when the communists began consolidating power 
now he is ready to accept jaruzelskis expected offer to be the 
first noncommunist head of an east bloc government a circumstance 
wrought by solidaritys burgeoning political power 
there have been several historical moments that show poles can 
strive for new solutions and unusual ones really innovative ones 
and that we can get somewhere he said friday after meeting with 
jaruzelski 
my hope is that such a moment is now arriving pyschologically 
that people will feel there is such a situation 
a close adviser to solidarity leader lech walesa mazowiecki 
edits the movements weekly newspaper tygodnik solidarnosc 
he also is closely linked to the roman catholic church and in 
1957 helped found the warsaw club of catholic intelligentsia an 
influential forum that served as a bulwark for catholic opposition 
to communist ideology 
mazowiecki was a key negotiator during the pivotal talks earlier 
this year that resulted in the legalization of solidarity and 
opposition participation in elections the talks were initiated by 
authorities unable to control polands sinking economy and 
disgruntled populace 
he led the negotiating team that focuses on trade union freedoms 
participated in political discussions and fought for press freedoms 
in a nation where the government controls all publications 
trained as a lawyer he submitted the court application for 
restoration of solidaritys legal status provided for in the accords 
reached with authorities 
when the petition was granted on april 17 he stood on the 
courthouse steps grinning broadly arms raised and a bouquet of red 
tulips in one hand 
today for me means the restoration of justice he said then 
recalling that he had been on hand when the union was first 
legalized in 1980 it was outlawed 16 months later he added i 
hope i will not have to come here a third time 
on other days though he appears dour and even cold some 
express concern that his catholic faith and legal training have made 
him overly deliberative and unable to react quickly 
a widower who lost his young wife to cancer and still wears his 
wedding ring mazowiecki raised three sons alone in a small 
apartment on warsaws main commercial street 
born on april 18 1927 in the small central poland city of 
plock mazowiecki was raised in a family of intellectuals 
by 21 he had been dismissed from his academic editing house job 
for keeping close ties to the church during the early years of 
communist poland 
he began to work with pax an organization set up by the 
government to dilute churchbased opposition but by 1955 he was so 
at odds with the mix of politics and religion that he was suspended 
in 1958 he founded the catholic monthly magazine wiez or link 
which he edited until 1981 when he began tygodnik solidarnosc 
the catholic magazine reflected and to a degree preceded the 
modernization of catholicism put forth by the second vatican council 
he became aligned with znak a group supporting regeneration of 
poland based on catholic values officially condoned under the 
protection of the church znak had a sejm delegation and mazowiecki 
became a parliament deputy in 1961 
by 1970 mazowieckis agitation for democratization of public 
life and social justice had run afoul of official tolerance and he 
was not allowed another term 
as the opposition began organizing in the mid1970s especially 
after worker riots in 1976 mazowiecki went to western europe in 
search of support and aid mention of free trade unions in a west 
german newspaper interview resulted in withdrawal of his passport 
for four years 
wiez became a more radical forum publishing articles by adam 
michnik and other strong opposition voices 
mazowiecki initiated a letter by more than 60 intellectuals 
urging authorities to find a peaceful solutions to the strikes that 
erupted on the baltic coast in august 1980 and led to solidaritys 
founding 
on aug 22 he arrived at the strikebound lenin shipyard in 
gdansk and after a nightlong talk with walesa mazowiecki became the 
head of a group of experts to help the workers organize the union 
and negotiate with government officials 
with the martiallaw crackdown announced by jaruzelski on dec 
13 1981 mazowiecki was jailed he was released on dec 23 1982 
and resumed as a union adviser 
after historically democratic elections were scheduled in june 
he did not run for office preferring to edit the unions new legal 
and independent weekly

ralf and thomas made it easily 
strolling to freedom in austria but escape from communist east 
germany for joerg and birgitt was a desperate crawl through fields 
and mosquitoinfested woods 
we had no food or water and sometimes we had no more 
strength joerg 27 said friday after he and his wife arrived in 
west germany still tired and sunburned from the threeday ordeal 
thousands of east germans are flocking to west germany to escape 
the strict east german regime many go through liberal hungary 
which is clearing the barbed wire from its border with austria 
about 100000 east germans are expected to reach west germany 
this year by escape or with permission one of the places they are 
taken first is the overflowing camp in this city an hours drove 
northeast of frankfurt 
birgitt joergs 22yearold wife displayed cuts on her forearm 
and said i got these climbing over the barbed wire in a stretch 
of the hungarian border that had not been cleared 
like most of the others joerg and birgitt fled because of the 
east german governments resistance to the political and economic 
reforms now spreading through the soviet bloc with the kremlins 
blessing 
east germans have difficulty getting permission to travel to the 
west but need no special permission to visit communist hungary so 
it became an escape route when barricaded frontier was opened 
earlier this year more than 1500 are believed to have used it 
successfully 
the young couple and other refugees interviewed at giessen asked 
that their surnames be withheld to avoid trouble for relatives at 
home 
we tried it a first time last week but hungarian border guards 
caught us joerg said they were nice they just asked us to 
promise never to do it again 
on the second try a farmer with whom they hitched a ride dropped 
them about six miles from the frontier on aug 13 
joerg said they didnt know where border controls were weakest 
so they crawled through scorching cornfields brush and woods 
searching for the right time and place 
we knew some border fences had been removed but we didnt know 
where he said there are a lot of escapees who get help and 
have access to information 
he and birgitt hid in a cornfield the first night and in woods 
the second joerg said 
we lay low during daylight carefully observing everything 
he said then at night we would go inch by inch very carefully 
to make sure we werent noticed there were millions of mosquitoes 
it was really hot and we had nothing to drink 
birgitt remembered the exhaustion and fear of being separated 
sometimes we lost each other and could only find one another by 
calling out she said there were times when i thought i just 
couldnt go on 
they climbed the fence tuesday near deutschkreutz about 90 miles 
southeast of vienna and had a welcome drink from a brook west 
german authorities arranged passage to vienna then to the giessen 
camp where they will be fed and housed until they can start a new 
life 
because up to 500 east germans arrive at giessen on a single day 
the government announced friday it was opening another camp 
east germans were lined up friday outside the stucco camp 
buildings at giessen waiting to fill out documents or for lunch in 
the cafeteria others leaned through windows of their temporary 
lodgings to talk with fellow refugees 
those who find lodgings with relatives usually leave giessen in 
three or four days but others remain a week or more 
many recent escapees are young people who left jobs to go west 
like ralf a 20yearold electrician and his friend thomas an 
auto mechanic who is 21 
ralf from leipzig said they just walked across the border into 
austria 
it took about three hours he said we had planned the 
whole thing everything went according to our plans 
jeannette a 22yearold from east berlin said it took her 13 
hours to reach austria through woods brush and thorny bushes and 
she brought wirecutters to snip through the fence 
she said she said she found at least 25 other east germans in an 
austrian border village 
all those interviewed said they fled east germany because they 
were fed up with conditions there 
there is no freedom to protest no freedom of the press no 
freedom of opinion and things are not going to change anytime 
soon joerg said

government health officials hope that more 
inspectors tougher laws and other regulatory changes will assure 
the public that the scandaltainted generic drug industry sells safe 
products 
the food and drug administration and its parent agency the 
department of health and human services announced a broad plan of 
attack friday aimed at serving notice to pharmaceutical 
manufacturers and consumers that corrupt and fraudulent 
practices must stop 
i stand ready to work cooperatively with the congress to meet 
the legislative and budgetary requirements that are pivotal to 
assuring full confidence in the generic drugs program hhs 
secretary louis w sullivan said in a written statement 
the plan comes in the wake of months of revelations of gratuities 
paid by companies to federal regulators and of false information 
provided to the government by applicants for new drugs there have 
been no indications of unsafe generic drugs reaching the market 
sullivan and fda commissioner frank young announced they will 
increase federal oversight of drug manufacturers and their products 
and revamp procedures used to review drug applications 
two sources speaking on condition they not be identified said 
the fda would spend 18 million to hire additional inspectors 
agency spokesman jeff nesbit said the final figure had not been 
determined but he said an undetermined number of new employees 
would be hired for field work such as inspections of manufacturing 
plants and to check applications submitted to fda by developers of 
new drugs 
to pay for the additional work sullivan and young proposed fees 
that would be levied on companies applying for permission to market 
new generic drugs there currently are no application fees 
the government has the power to ban the sales of drugs that it 
learns were approved after companies provided fraudulent information 
to regulators 
sources said the proposed legislation would give the government 
authority to remove a drug from the market if investigators prove 
other types of fraud such as gratuities to regulators for checking 
one companys application before anothers in the approval process 
companies wishing to obtain federal approval to sell a new drug 
test it and submit the results to the fda which checks the records 
of the work producers must satisfy the fda that their product 
functions equivalently to the drug they are mimicking 
the government also said it would create an ombudsman within fda 
to hear complaints from the pharmaceutical industry consumers and 
agency whistle blowers the division within fda that currently 
oversees generic drugs would be raised a notch in the agencys 
structure giving it more clout and sullivan said drug review 
procedures would be reorganized and strengthened 
on wednesday the fda said it had started collecting thousands of 
samples of the 30 most commonly used generic drugs so it could 
conduct safety tests on them 
the 5 billion generic drug industry is ferociously competitive 
as dozens of mostly small and midsize companies vie to market 
copies of brandname drugs after patents expire the first such 
generic drug to hit the market generally gets and keeps the lions 
share of sales 
the fda has been under pressure from capitol hill principally 
from rep john dingell dmich whose energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee has conducted its own probe of the 
problems 
staff investigators have shared information with the us 
attorneys office in baltimore which has obtained guilty pleas from 
three fda officials two drug companies and three drug company 
executives 
this spring fda began investigating 11 companies for possible 
violations of federal safety and production regulations

the man former housing secretary samuel pierce 
once called his right hand is refusing to cooperate with 
congressional investigators citing his right against 
selfincrimination in snubbing a subcommittees subpoena that he 
testify 
lance wilson pierces onetime executive assistant told a house 
subcommittee friday that he was asserting his fifth amendment rights 
because the conduct of panel members convinced him he would not 
receive a fair hearing 
wilson said attacks last month by several panel members after he 
failed to appear as scheduled made it clear that the subcommittee 
members have prejudged me and have no intention of affording me a 
fair and evenhanded hearing 
wilsons lawyer raymond banoun lashed out at subcommittee 
chairman thomas lantos other panel members and its staff saying in 
a separate letter that all had made knowingly inaccurate statements 
about wilson during televised hearings which banoun called a 
charade 
attempts to reach lantos dcalif and subcommittee staffers 
were unsuccessful 
there was no answer at the subcommittee office when the wilson 
and banoun letters were obtained late friday lantos home office in 
san mateo calif said the democratic congressman was on vacation 
and unavailable for comment 
wilson was pierces top aide for several years and after leaving 
the agency invested in several projects that received lucrative 
subsidies from hud his successor as pierces executive assistant 
deborah gore dean appeared before congress in may but refused to 
answer questions also asserting her fifth amendment rights 
the subcommittee in recess until after labor day has been 
investigating influencepeddling mismanagement and fraud at hud 
during the reagan administration 
testimony and other evidence indicates that former hud officials 
and prominent republicans received special treatment from the agency 
that helped them reap millions of dollars in government financing 
and subsidies 
the hearings and other sources of information also have shown 
that huds internal controls were so poor that millions of dollars 
cannot be accounted for and that the total of reaganera fraud might 
surpass 2 billion 
wilson a senior vice president at paine webber had been 
scheduled to appear before the subcommittee july 28 but asked for a 
continuance because banoun had to undergo emergency surgery three 
days before 
lantos refused to grant a continuance and ordered wilson to 
appear without counsel or with another attorney wilson refused but 
lantos nonetheless called him to the witness table at the hearing 
then launched into a lengthy attack on him when he failed to appear 
lantos said wilson had joined a lucrative fraternity of former 
hud employees that had cashed in so spectacularly on moderate 
rehabilitation programs 
other panel members joined in criticizing wilson and the 
committee later issued subpoenas requiring wilson to produce myriad 
records of his hudrelated dealings by friday 
banoun in the letter to lantos said the chairman and the 
subcommittee members and staffers had ignored wilsons right to 
counsel and instead grandstanded for the television audience 
you went through the charade of calling mr wilson to the 
witness table in front of live television cameras knowing all along 
that he had courteously informed you that he would not appear 
banoun said in the letter 
the conduct of certain members of the subcommittee and of its 
staff in dealing with mr wilson have made it abundantly clear 
that they have adversely prejudged mr wilson and have no intention 
other than to publicly vilify him in order to achieve their own 
personal motivation the letter said 
this fact is further buttressed by the vindictive subpoenas 
issued to mr wilson 
banoun said the subpoenas included demands for numerous documents 
the subcommittee has access to and a demand that he appear before 
the panel sept 27 an appearance that would be a month later than 
wilson sought when he asked for the continuance 
this raises a question as to the urgency which prompted the 
denial of his initial request for a short continuance banouns 
letter said

kevin bachman was cool calm and unflappable 
during the 36 minutes that fate teamed him with a veteran pilot 
trying to land a damaged dc10 at the sioux city iowa airport last 
month 
but the 27yearold air traffic controller who had completed his 
training just three months earlier broke into tears after united 
airlines flight 232 touched down cartwheeled and burst into flames 
of the 296 people aboard the jetliner en route from denver to 
chicago and philadelphia 111 were killed 
that 185 survived is widely credited to the performance of pilot 
al c haynes bachman and rescueresponse efforts on the ground 
listening friday to a federal aviation administration tape of his 
radio interchanges with haynes bachman recalled his thoughts at the 
time as alternating between pessimism and optimism 
right after it happened i had to turn away because i didnt 
think anybody would come away from it bachman said and then i 
went downstairs and cried 
while he had heard reports of some survivors bachman said it 
wasnt until five hours after the crash and after he had left work 
that he learned watching the news on television that more than 
half those aboard had survived 
you just try to wonder what you could have done differently 
bachman said the first couple of days afterward i didnt sleep 
at all 
later he concluded he would not have done anything differently 
neither apparently would any of his bosses 
there was not a controller there that was not doing his job 
said terry dobson faa air traffic manager at sioux city theres 
no sign that anyone failed to do their job 
while an investigation into the crash is continuing and officials 
have yet to pinpoint its cause transportation secretary samuel 
skinner was so satisfied with bachmans role that he presented him 
with a medal friday for outstanding job performance 
it was 323 pm cdt on july 19 when air traffic controllers in 
minneapolis notified sioux city that a stricken jetliner 40 miles 
away was headed for the iowa airport 
three minutes later haynes and bachman were having their first 
conversation 
ok so you know we have almost no control ability very little 
elevator and almost no aileron haynes told bachman we are 
controlling the turns by power we can only turn right but we 
cant turn left 
ten minutes later the pilot with a gasp in his voice tells 
bachman i have serious doubts about making the airport have you 
got some place near there that we might be able to ditch unless we 
get control of this airplane were going to put it down wherever 
it happens to be 
while faa officials on the ground scrambled to pinpoint possible 
highways where the jetliner could land bachman several times 
directed haynes to change his course to keep away from populated 
areas 
widen out just slightly to your left to take you away from 
the city haynes is told just eight minutes before the crash 
whatever you do keep us away from the city the pilot radios 
back 
three minutes later haynes asks for possible alternatives to the 
airport 
were going to have to put it down on something solid if we 
can 
at 357 pm bachman says ah united 232 if you cannot make 
the airport sir there is an interstate that runs north to south to 
the east side of the airport its a fourlane interstate 
were just passing it right now haynes responds were 
going to try for the airport 
at 358 pm haynes to bachman have runway in sight well be 
with you very shortly thanks a lot for your help 
bachman gives haynes figures on wind speed and direction and 
tells him youre cleared to land on any runway 
haynes chuckles breaking the tension for a brief moment he 
quips you want to be particular and make it a runway huh 
bachman tells haynes about a runway on the same path as the plane 
that has been closed because of lack of use 
were pretty much lined up on this one or we think well be 
haynes says 
at 359 pm haynes asks bachman for the length of the unused 
runway and is told it is 6600 feet hes also told assembled rescue 
vehicles are being cleared from it 
at the end of the runway its just a wide open field 
bachman says so sir the length wont be a problem 
four seconds later haynes replies ok 
eight seconds later at 45 seconds after 359 pm a ground 
proximity warning horn on the plane goes off a voice says pull 
up pull up 
the tape goes silent united 232 is down

the bush administration says its 
premature to consider increasing economic aid to poland as the east 
bloc nation moves to install its first noncommunist government in 
more than 40 years 
the traveling white house of vacationing president bush issued a 
guarded reaction friday to news that a solidarity activist would be 
named prime minister 
its going to take a good deal of patience and determination 
persistence for any government to carry out an economic reform 
program that will turn things around there said press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
we will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as 
appropriate and as we can he said about the possibility of more 
us aid to encourage pluralistic leanings 
its really premature to think along those lines fitzwater 
said adding that us budget constraints mean we dont have a lot 
of money to offer 
bush announced an aid package totaling 119 million during his 
trip to poland last month 
the president was keeping abreast of the situation in poland and 
elsewhere while on his vacation in this resort town 
today bush was to have his speed boat fidelity inspected by 
the coast guard 
the white house arranged a highprofile inspection with the 
president receiving a safety certificate and making remarks as a 
public service announcement on boat safety 
meanwhile fitzwater said the administration was still waiting to 
see how events unfold in poland 
its too early at this point to know how they polands 
leaders are going to make it work let alone how it will work 
fitzwater told reporters 
without delving into specific analysis of the events fitzwater 
for the second consecutive day indicated the administration is 
pleased with the general direction of events in poland 
on thursday fitzwater had described polands move toward a 
noncommunist government as remarkable and history making 
privately administration officials said they were pleased that 
polish president wojciech jaruzelski had chosen solidarity 
journalist tadeusz mazowiecki a close associate of solidarity 
leader lech walesa to be prime minister 
bush continued to vigorously enjoy his vacation which began 
wednesday he went boating and golfing with family members visiting 
the family compound on walkers point 
all of bushs five children and his grandchildren were on hand or 
were expected this weekend 
bush was cheery as he practiced his trademark rapidfire golf 
style finishing 18 holes in 1 hour and 51 minutes 
as he teed off on the first hole bush joked to watching 
reporters 
the crowd is hushed they sense that mr smooth is back 
mr smooth is a favorite name bush uses for himself when 
playing golf and horseshoes

the bush administrations campaign to improve 
ties with ethiopia is getting a lift from reports that some 2000 
cuban troops are preparing to leave the african nation 
the soviet union also is loosening its ties to ethiopia but 
hundreds of soviet advisers and east german military and security 
personnel apparently will remain after the cuban withdrawal 
the death in an airplane crash last week of rep mickey leland a 
texas democrat who was a strong friend of ethiopia in his crusade 
against hunger sparked a cooperative search that also is helping to 
improve us relations 
senior state department officials said they wanted to see the 
process accelerated but they said two us conditions must be met 
those conditions are a continuing improvement in human rights and 
a serious effort by addis ababa to reconcile with separatists in 
ethiopias eritrea region and an autonomous movement in tigray 
but in a brief statement friday the state department said it 
continues to support the territorial integrity of ethiopia that 
means the united states is opposed to a separate eritrean state 
the prospect of cuban troops leaving ethiopia is also welcome 
news to the administration 
the cubans are stationed in the ogaden region along the border 
with somalia in 1978 and 1979 ethiopia used a force of 12000 to 
17000 cubans along with soviet advisers to expel troops from 
somalia 
the remaining cubans mostly are on sentry duty there is no sign 
that somalia intends to become embroiled again in a conflict with 
ethiopia 
diplomatic sources declining to be identified said all the 
cubans apparently would be withdrawn 
while ethiopia does not receive foreign aid it is eligible for 
humanitarian assistance during a 1988 famine the united states 
provided about 120 million the largest outlay to any african 
country that year 
the fact that there are about 2000 political prisoners in 
ethiopia is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier us 
relations than the governing marxist philosophy in addis ababa

progress is being reported in strikes against 
two regional bell telephone companies but union officials in new 
england and chicago are trying to turn up the financial pressure on 
companies there 
the communications workers of america said friday that new 
england telephone should pay customers the money it wasnt paying 
striking workers 
the company said no it has to pay overtime to managers filling 
in for strikers and probably was losing revenue to competitors 
telephone operators at illinois bell asked customers to delay 
paying their telephone bills during the strike chicagobased 
ameritech which serves five midwestern states said using customers 
in the weeklong walkout was irresponsible 
some progress was reported in talks local companies held with cwa 
on friday a day after the union reached agreement with bell 
atlantic bell of pennsylvania was to begin talks today with the 
cwa whose members have been on strike for two weeks 
on the west coast pacific telesis of san francisco also reported 
substantial progress toward a new contract 
wages and employee contributions to healthinsurance plans have 
been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four 
companies nearly 200000 employees in 20 states and the district of 
columbia 
the striking workers include operators telephone installers and 
repairmen factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel 
all four companies have continued service using management 
personnel but there have been delays for installation and operator 
services 
the bell atlanticcwa agreement resolved regional issues while 
leaving local issues to be decided in further talks 
philadelphiabased bell atlantic also was bargaining separately with 
the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
union officials at bell atlantic said 41000 striking workers 
wont return to work until all local issues are resolved and the 
11000 workers represented by the ibew settle but both sides said a 
final accord could be reached within days 
pacific telesis spokesman lou saviano said cwa and company 
negotiators made very substantial progress but unresolved 
issues remained 
no new talks have been scheduled in the ameritech strike 
five people were arrested friday outside ohio bell headquarters 
in columbus after cwa members blocked building entrances those 
arrested were issued summonses and released 
a picketer was arrested at a michigan bell facility near saginaw 
after strikers blocked a driveway the 37yearold woman was charged 
with obstructing traffic a misdemeanor and freed on 100 bond 
in vermont where cwa and ibew workers are striking new england 
telephone a subsidiary of new yorkbased nynex union officials 
said the regional company stood to save 31 million from 1989 
through 1992 if its successful in shifting some costs of health 
insurance to its employees 
this money will not be translated into lower phone bills for 
vermont customers because local rates are frozen said ken peres 
a cwa economist instead the 31 million will flow directly as 
profits to nynexs subsidiary new england telephone 
richard fortier business manager of ibew local 2326 said union 
officials also wanted rebates to vermont phone customers to 
reflect new england telephones decreased expenses on wages and 
benefits during the bargaining impasse 
nynex spokesman john bonomo said were not doing this to save 
money were asking employees to pick up part of the healthcare 
costs because the costs are escalating so much we cant keep pace 
ourselves 
bonomo said the company was incurring increased expenses in 
overtime paid to managers filling in for striking workers and 
probably was losing revenues to competitors 
in chicago cwa spokesman greg kenefick said the union wanted 
telephone customers to put telephone bills on hold 
our focus now is going to be biting into their income asking 
people to put bills on hold kenefick said adding that he doesnt 
believe theres much risk of customers losing service if they 
withhold payment 
pat montgomery spokeswoman for illinois bell called it 
irresponsible to use customers in a managementunion dispute

undiscovered us oil supplies are far smaller 
than estimated early in this decade although prospects in alaska 
have brightened the interior department says 
a department report released friday said 49 billion barrels of 
crude oil outside known fields could if found be developed with 
existing technology 
at the current price of 18 a barrel however only twothirds of 
the total would be economic to produce it said 
in its most recent previous estimate in 1981 the department 
estimated 83 billion barrels of undiscovered crude one barrels 
equals 42 gallons 
throughout the decade the amount of known us oil reserves has 
held steady at about 30 billion barrels and production has remained 
near 3 billion barrels yearly 
thus the new estimate of undiscovered resources means the life 
expectancy of all us oil resources except unconventional sources 
such as oil shales and tar sands has dropped to 26 years the 1981 
figures implied a life expectancy of 37 years 
the change is significant said gary hill chief of the us 
geological surveys office of energy and marine biology the survey 
produced the report in collaboration with the interior departments 
minerals management service 
a key reason for the lower estimate of undiscovered oil 
resources the report said is the failure in recent years of 
drilling prospects once thought to be promising 
the massive exploration effort of industry of the late 1970s 
and early 1980s simply did not confirm some of the geological 
expectations the report said 
hill said in an interview that some of the most significant 
drilling disappointments were in the overthrust belt in the rocky 
mountain area and off the atlantic coast 
although prospects have dimmed in some offshore alaska areas 
that state overall has become the most promising development area 
for oil in the united states the report said 
the report estimated 132 billion barrels of oil are recoverable 
in alaska compared with a 1981 estimate of 69 billion barrels the 
increase is due largely to new geological data on the alaska coastal 
plain the site of the arctic national wildlife refuge industry is 
trying to persuade congress to open the refuge to oil exploration 
the report said the united states has an estimated 399 trillion 
cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas down from the 1981 estimate 
of 594 trillion cubic feet 
the amount of undiscovered natural gas liquids such as butane 
and propane was cut in half to 9 billion barrels 
in response to the report deputy energy secretary henson moore 
said new technologies such as horizontal drilling will 
significantly increase the amount of oil and gas that eventually can 
be developed 
even after considering all these factors there clearly is a 
decline moore said in a statement this is all the more reason 
why we must proceed with a national energy strategy to contend with 
declining domestic production and increasing imports

the lending industry winning a preliminary 
victory in its fight with the department of veterans affairs over 
who will pay for a growing number of va mortgage defaults says the 
agencys refusal to bid on foreclosed property cost the industry 
200 million last year 
in a temporary injunction granted friday us district judge 
george h revercomb said he agreed with the mortgage bankers 
association that va could not use its borrowing costs from the 
treasury in determining whether to buy and hold foreclosed property 
until it could be resold 
the alternative to having va acquire the property is for the 
lender to be left with it with the va paying the lender the maximum 
guarantee amount of 36000 
a hearing on a permanent injunction remains to be scheduled and 
probably wont be heard for several months the industry group said 
the new regulation had been scheduled to take effect monday 
the group which represents 2200 members of the mortgage lending 
industry said congress had considered and rejected the interest 
cost deduction when it told va to acquire fewer foreclosed 
properties 
revercomb said he agreed that the cost of funds in the net 
value definition is a clear violation of the controlling federal 
statute enacted in 1984 to help control the deficit 
congress required va to calculate the net worth of property by 
taking its fair market value the price it would command in the 
present real estate market and subtracting a variety of costs the 
va would not repurchase homes that it would have to sell at a loss 
under the veterans loan program the va guarantees to the 
mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the 
mortgage debt if the borrower defaults up to the maximum 
until congress acted va bought the foreclosed property in nearly 
every case even when it did not make financial sense to do so 
revercomb said 
neither va nor the justice department would comment immediately 
on the ruling 
foreclosures on vabacked loans have risen sharply in recent 
years due largely to the real estate slump in texas and oklahoma 
the government national mortgage association an arm of the 
department of housing and urban development says six lenders that 
had financial problems linked to the socalled nobids defaulted 
in 1988 
president bushs budget message this year estimated the new 
regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions 
the industry group says its average loss on a piece of property va 
does not acquire is more than 18000 
a july general accounting office report said foreclosures rose 
from 13729 in fiscal 1981 to 43316 in 1987 in those same two 
years va annual losses rose from 51 million to 615 million gao 
said 
the report by gao the investigative arm of congress supported 
the idea of including the interest costs

the agriculture department says farmers 1989 
net cash income will be 2 billion more than anticipated a month 
ago but the forecast is still short of last years record 
the latest monthly estimate by the departments economic research 
service released friday says net cash income is expected to be in 
the range of 52 billion to 57 billion compared with 50 billion 
to 55 billion predicted in july 
last year because of rising commodity prices because of the 
droughtshriveled harvest net cash income was a record 599 
billion that figure was also revised upward from last months 
estimate of 58 billion for 1988 income 
net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the 
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses for example 1988 sales of grain stored from harvests 
in earlier years were counted as part of the 1988 gross 
another method of usda bookkeeping measures net farm income 
for the calendar year not simply the cashin cashout system 
involved in net cash income 
by this alternate method changes in the value of farm 
inventories are taken into consideration and allowances are made for 
nonmoney items such as depreciation the family consumption of 
farmgrown foods and the net rental value of dwellings 
net farm income in 1989 was forecast at 48 billion to 53 
billion up 1 billion from projections in july in 1988 net farm 
income was reported at 457 billion which was revised up from 44 
billion a month ago 
one reason for net cash income being down from the record 1988 
level is that farmers have put more land back into production this 
year meaning larger expenses for field preparation weed control 
and harvesting also government payments to farmers are down 
sharply this year 
forecasters are divided on whether the us economy is headed 
for a brief slowdown or a downturn the report said agriculture 
is likely to find the general economy mildly supportive in either 
case lower interest rates and perhaps lower exchange rates common 
to both outlooks would reduce farm costs and boost agricultural 
exports 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 7 percent 
on average compared with a 41 percent gain in 1988 most of the 
expected increase took place in the first half of 1989 the report 
said 
the agency said wheat and rice prices are likely to rise 
although overall grain and soybean production will increase 
markedly from 1988 despite a heavy toll from poor weather

deborah gore dean a central figure in the 
investigation into the scandalplagued department of housing and 
urban development who was summoned to her doorstep by a group of 
protesters says if she did something wrong shell try to make it 
right 
the protesters who gathered friday morning in front of deans 
town house in georgetown accomplished something congress has been 
unable to do get dean to talk about the influencepeddling scandal 
if ive done something wrong im completely willing to try to 
make it right said the onetime executive assistant to former hud 
secretary samuel pierce 
about 20 people gathered outside deans home and one shouted 
we want to talk to you about hud 
thanks but no thanks said dean who took the fifth 
amendment against selfincrimination when called before a 
congressional panel investigating hud 
ive had enough she said 
so have we shouted members of the group mobilized by the 
association of community organizations for reform now acorn 
so barefoot and wearing jeans and blouse turned inside out dean 
came to the doorstep and spoke politely with her unexpected 
visitors she repeatedly denied any wrongdoing 
i dont have a single personal friend who ever got something 
from hud she said referring to reports that she approved hud 
loans to unworthy projects pushed by wellconnected republicans 
i liked sam pierce he was a good person but i think there 
might have been people there who have done things they are trying to 
hide 
one person asked about a program to subsidize rehabilitation of 
housing for people with moderate incomes dean responded that the 
money all went to low and moderate housing except for a couple of 
cases 
the group alerted a washington post reporter who was present for 
the confrontation 
the group was led by alberta shields who lives in a public 
housing project in washington 
we are the people who live in the lowincome neighborhoods that 
suffered as you gave precious hud resources away to your friends 
shields read from a letter 
can you lend us some money we need to fix up those abandoned 
houses in our neighborhoods so we can get rid of the crack dealers 
you have allowed to move in 
dean nodded ok ok i dont blame you 
she later pleaded with the crowd i really loved my years at 
hud i spent all my time on fair housing but you wouldnt know that 
from the press im really really really sorry i wish you knew 
me and what i tried to do at hud 
ive been made such a scapegoat this is what i wanted to do 
the rest of my life she said and when i walk into hud now 
people turn the other way

a gunman assassinated a leading 
presidential hopeful at a political rally friday night the mayor of 
bogota said it was the latest in a series of attacks by drug 
traffickers police said 
the assassin opened fire on sen luis carlos galan as the liberal 
party candidate was about to give a speech before 10000 people in 
soacha 20 miles south of bogota at least 10 others were wounded 
after the attack president virgilio barco used his powers under 
the nations state of siege to reestablish a treaty with the united 
states to extradite suspected drug traffickers 
galan 46 died of several gunshot wounds to the chest said 
bogota mayor andres pastrana galan had escaped an assassination 
attempt aug 5 in the city of medillin by drug traffickers who 
police said had offered 500000 to kill him 
police also blamed the friday attack on drug lords 
galan who had been one of six liberal party candidates seeking 
the presidential partys nomination for the may 1990 president was 
widely considered the frontrunner to replace barco 
photographer jesus calderon said two shots hit galan in the 
stomach as he was about to give his speech at the rally 
when the individual began firing galan fell to the ground 
said photographer jesus calderon calderon said two shots hit galan 
in the stomach but he maintained consciousness and asked only 
that he be taken quickly to the hospital 
at least 10 others were wounded including one of galans 
bodyguards two local political leaders and supporters near the 
podium the crowd panicked 
the people were running screaming and crying said calderon 
the gunman escaped and police mounted a search 
barco in an address broadcast nationwide on television and 
radio said he would renew the extradition treaty with the united 
states which was suspended by the supreme court on a technicality 
in april 1988 
he said his government would take emergency measures to stop the 
medellin cartel which is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine 
that reaches the united states they include hiring special judges 
to investigate drug traffickers and detaining suspects for a week 
without a hearing 
the attack came hours after drug traffickers shot to death a 
provincial police chief who had led a campaign against the drug 
traffickers based in medellin 
the medellin cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying of 
col waldemar franklin quintero in calls to local radio stations 
fridays attacks came amid a strike by the nations judges who 
are protesting the violence and they say is a lack of protection for 
members of their profession 
franklin quintero recently had given up his official bodyguards 
and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges 
franklin quintero 46 police commander for antioquia province 
where medellin is located left his home friday in his 
chauffeurdriven car that had gone about 450 feet when it was cut 
off by another car and five gunmen emerged officials said 
they fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel 
who was hit more than a hundred times an unidentified witness 
told radio caracol the witness said the chauffeur also was injured 
witnesses said franklin quinteros car was destroyed by gunfire 
the interior was covered with blood 
franklin quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine 
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure 
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers 
on wednesday night magistrate carlos valencia garcia was shot to 
death in bogota hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of 
two medellin leaders 
on thursday night an armed band intercepted a police van 
carrying 18 arrested people and set them free they included several 
suspected drug traffickers officials said 
its terrifying what is happening in colombia said justice

lawmakers are fuming over the placement and 
timing of a warning about the dangers of smoking in the latest james 
bond movie licence to kill 
philip morris paid 350000 to the film maker united artists to 
have its lark cigarette appear in the movie according to 
congressional testimony 
in response to concerns from the american lung association 
american heart association and american cancer society the movie 
contains the surgeon generals warning about the effect of smoking 
reps tom luken dohio and bob whittaker rkan have 
expressed reservations about the placement of the warning which 
comes during the final credits 
we believe that the health warning should appear at the 
beginning of the film as many viewers will leave before they 
see a warning in the movies credits luken and whittaker said in 
a letter to the head of the federal trade commission janet d 
steiger 
luken said friday the letter asks whether the commission has the 
authority to issue rules on tobacco advertising in movies 
luken chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
transportation and hazardous materials and whittaker the panels 
ranking republican are cosponsors of a bill that prohibits all

the environmental protection agency says the 
fear of catching lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to 
use insect repellents in potentially harmful ways 
the epa which regulates the pesticides used in insect 
repellents said friday that misuse of repellents could result in 
adverse skin reactions headaches mood changes and possibly 
convulsions or unconsciousness 
only a small number of reports of ill effects have been 
received but they have prompted concern that fear of lyme disease 
or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse 
or overuse of these products the agency said 
cynthia georgeson a spokeswoman for sc johnson wax 
manufacturer of the insect repellent off said the company 
endorsed the epa advisory because its very important to have 
people continue to use these products properly 
among the suggestions from the epa are 
apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing 
never use repellents over cuts wounds or irritated skin 
take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or the 
hands of small children 
avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin one

the agriculture department is expanding its 
recent ban on ostrich imports to include emus rheas and cassowaries 
because they may carry diseasebearing parasites 
larry b slagle acting administrator of the departments animal 
and plant health inspection service said friday that the expanded 
import ban was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely 
the flightless birds affected are known as ratites and include 
ostriches emus rheas and cassowaries 
agency spokeswoman marlene stinson said the ban did not apply to 
penguins because those are of a different family neither will the 
ban affect kiwis because the birds homeland new zealand does not 
permit exports she said 
slagle said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the 
discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in 
ohio oklahoma and texas 
the ticks were identified as african bont and bontlegged ticks 
which are known to transmit heartwater an often fatal disease of 
cattle sheep goats and other ruminants no further tick findings 
have been reported 
slagle said the disease doesnt affect humans and doesnt exist 
in the united states

the national park service is negotiating with 
the soviet union to establish a park spanning the bering strait 
according to a report published today 
park officials will visit siberian areas across the strait from 
alaska next month and return with soviet officials who will inspect 
alaskan sites the washington post reported 
the service already administers the bering land bridge national 
preserve a 27million acre wild area just north of nome there is 
no comparable preserve on the soviet side 
such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct 
research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife 
biologists to track migratory species such as walrus moving between 
the two countries 
in the last ice age the strait was dry which permitted people 
and animals to move between asia and north america

tadeusz mazowiecki may not be a household 
name but the idea of the solidarity newspaper editor running the 
government drew positive responses from poles desperate for economic 
change 
i think hes a pretty wise man but he takes the post in tough 
times so its hard to be an optimist said a transport company 
clerk 
on friday mazowiecki declared that he was ready to accept 
president wojciech jaruzelskis offer to nominate him as prime 
minister and end the communist partys 45year hold on government 
leadership 
a formal announcement was expected today 
if chosen mazowieckis first task should be to put a halt to 
polands rising threedigit inflation said the clerk who added 
that he earns 74 a month inflation causes pessimism among people 
and they are terrified by what is going on he said friday 
a group of young people sitting in front of a department store on 
a balmy summer night seemed less sure of the future 
a solidarity government will surely change something but it is 
not clear in what direction said a 16yearold high school 
student 
asked what they thought of mazowiecki one of solidarity leader 
lech walesas closest advisers one replied its the first time i 
have heard his name 
the group seemed to prefer walesa 
walesa is a person who can get something from the west on 
financial and political matters said one student 
last week walesa said he was ready to offer himself as a 
candidate for prime minister but later said he would rather remain 
with the working masses 
outside a bank independent dealers speculated on politics 
a solidarity prime minister is the only way out its the only 
thing that can gain real social support said one dealer 
clutching a thick wad of zlotys polands currency 
if that doesnt work then its going to be bloody here 
chimed in another dealer in front of the pko bank in central warsaw 
he mazowiecki is a wise person and he knows what he wants 
added a third dealer he served a prison term the country is an 
absolute pit there is no other way out 
however he seemed skeptical about the prospects of democracy in 
poland if the communists are allowed to hang on to the defense and 
interior ministries 
those ministries should also be in the hands of solidarity if 
anything is going to change they could be under civilian control 
like in other countries he said 
mazowiecki seemed to appeal as a prime minister to hurried 
shoppers and early evening strollers in a busy commercial area of 
downtown warsaw but some were too weary from the daily battle to 
make ends meet to care 
were so tired it really doesnt matter what happens said a 
21year old teacher 
some thought the communist party would be reluctant to relinquish 
power 
it seems to me the party wont allow everything to be taken 
away they have been here too long and they are too deep into 
this said an employee of a private company 
one thing was sure a solidarity prime minister was a new thing 
and that aroused curiosity even among those with almost no interest 
in politics 
there has to be something new something people can believe 
in said the head of a private tourist agency who had just 
returned from soviet armenia

in a nation plagued by chronic shortages 
it was not surprising that the car used by the man expected to be 
the next prime minister ran out of gas 
after meeting friday with communist president wojciech 
jaruzelski who appeared prepared to nominate him for prime 
minister solidarity editor tadeusz mazowiecki drove to see roman 
catholic primate jozef glemp 
on the way back from the meeting his car a polonez belonging 
to the weekly newspaper that mazowiecki edits ran out of gas 
briefly stranding him and his driver until he borrowed another car 
when asked by reporters about the difficulties he would face by 
becoming the prime minister in economically troubled poland 
mazowiecki replied my biggest problem if i may joke is that i 
ran out of gas 
for the premiertobe it is not very proper he said 
long gasoline lines in poland make it difficult to fill up in a 
hurry 
by the time he reached the parliament building for a meeting with 
other leaders in the independent solidarity movement not 
surprisingly mazowiecki was feeling the pressure 
asked who he would have in his government he said i have to 
think for a while there is no time but still i need some time 
as tv cameras turned away mazowiecki seemed relieved 
oh finally i can have a smoke he said

after the governor of tamaulipas state negotiated an agreement 
between rival union factions the director of a business 
organization said 
the resolution means the northeastern state of tamaulipas will 
have its first major labor union independent of the powerful mexican 
labor federation 
the strike flags are coming down right at this moment mike 
allen executive director of the mcallen economic development corp 
said friday afternoon mcallen texas is across the rio grande from 
reynosa

a victory for the head of a local union abel hernandez who had 
pulled his union out of the powerful mexican labor federation 
according to the governors spokesman manuel save the new union 
will be an affiliate of the federation but will be free to choose 
its own leaders and set its own policy business leaders said 
earlier friday that the union was to be independent 
talks on forming a new union are scheduled to begin next week 
the strike pitted hernandez against local federation leader 
rafael morales who called the strike on july 25 and said he took 
over hernandezs local the labor board controlled by the 
federation then authorized morales as union leader 
the strike closed 15 plants idled 2000 workers and cost the 
plants about 500000 a day in lost production 
at least 800 workers of the 2000 affected by the strike rebelled 
against morales on tuesday ripping down the strike flags returning 
to work and locking themselves inside their plants

they accuse of corruption at least two plants threatened to pull 
out of mexico 
tamaulipas gov americo villareal met with plant managers rival

mostpowerful labor organization and is a pillar of the governing

polish immigrants celebrated the news that a 
solidarity activist had been named prime minister but like their 
compatriots back home were wary of the intentions of the polish 
communist authorities 
from what we know of the communists they dont give up power 
without a struggle said marian prusek who owns a travel agency 
in the polish community on chicagos northwest side but now we 
need to know what form that struggle will take will it be in the 
parliament 
capping a season of dramatic change in poland journalist tadeusz 
mazowiecki said friday that president wojciech jaruzelski had chosen 
him to lead the eastern blocs first noncommunist government 
chicago alderman roman pucinski said the announcement by the man 
who led the martial law crackdown on solidarity 8 years ago 
indicates the determination of the polish people to have democracy 
they have a one thousand year history of fighting for human 
rights and human dignity and freedom said pucinski a leading 
figure in chicagos polishamerican community and so the eight 
years that have elapsed were but a slight interval in polands 
continuing struggle for freedom 
polish nationals in chicago washington dc hamtramck mich 
and new york cast absentee ballots in the june parliamentary 
elections the first in the soviet bloc since just after world war 
ii in which voters could select noncommunist candidates 
of the 5000 people who voted at the polish consulate in chicago 
which has the largest polish community outside of poland 95 percent 
supported candidates backed by the solidarity free trade union 
poles interviewed friday expressed surprise at the rapid pace of 
change in their homeland at this time last year solidarity was 
illegal 
the changes in poland have come around so fast that no one 
could have predicted one year ago or even six months ago that it 
would come to pass said kazimierz olejarczyk vice president of 
the polishamerican congress in hamtramck 
mazowiecki a catholic activist and journalist who spent time in 
jail for his antigovernment activities will have to convince poles 
to make huge sacrifices in coming months if he wants to succeed and 
get polands economy back on track said mira puacz owner of a 
polishlanguage bookstore in chicago 
wlodzimierz dziubek who moved to chicago from warsaw four years 
ago said he feared things in poland would get worse 
itll be a repeat of 80 and 81 dziubek said referring to 
the imposition of martial law in december 1981 that ended a 16month 
period after its creation in which solidarity flourished 
dziubek noting polands sad history of failed reforms said he 
would not go home 
how many times have they said in poland that theyll change and 
therell be democratization 56 70 80 this is the fourth 
time 
while some people expressed fear of the soviet unions reaction 
to a noncommunist government in poland pucinski said soviet 
intervention is unlikely 
the winds of change are just too strong pucinski said i 
think its too late its too late for the soviet union to react in 
any forceful way 
considering the dire state of the polish economy the communists 
may have no choice but to give solidarity a chance to put things 
right ms puacz said 
poland is devastated economically she said if they want 
to get out of the crisis they need some kind of change

calls to aids hot lines in new york and san 
francisco increased following reports that the drug azt can delay 
the deadly diseases onset as callers also sought information about 
testing for the virus 
new york citys hot line had a 25 percent jump in calls friday 
said its director don troise 
the gay mens health crisis inc added an extra counselor to its 
hot line to handle the increased load of calls most of those who 
called were asking where they could be tested rather than about azt 
said bruce patterson director of that hot line 
this new azt story has tipped the scales for people who hadnt 
decided yet whether to get tested patterson said 
on thursday dr louis sullivan the federal health and human 
services secretary announced that azt azidothymidine has proven 
effective in halting the progression of aids in people infected with 
the hiv virus but who have shown no symptoms 
sullivan characterized the findings as the turning point in the 
battle to change acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a fatal 
disease to a treatable one 
in san francisco organizations reported more questions about the 
availability of azt than about testing 
the san francisco aids foundation hotline and the hot line for 
project inform both reported a moderate but steady increase in calls 
friday 
an operator for the san francisco aids foundation described the 
more hopeful environment previously people might say why be 
tested so i can know im going to die now we can tell them 
theres a reason 
a study among homosexual or bisexual males the largest risk 
group suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected will 
eventually develop the disease both san francisco and new york have 
significant homosexual populations 
there has been a modest increase in interest from people for 
procuring azt and we expect that to be pretty steady over the next 
several weeks said steve petrow a spokesman for the san 
francisco aids foundation the regions largest aids organization 
the news from the government was sort of blunted in san francisco 
by the fact this has sort of been known for some time to just 
about everybody involved 
still sonna craig spokeswoman for the university of california 
at san francisco general hospital where the school operates an aids 
activities ward friday reported no discernible increase in the 
number of people seeking azt treatment 
she suspects that many hivinfected people in san francisco had 
already decided whether they should be taking azt citing extensive 
media coverage of the drug over the last six months 
with health experts now saying it is crucial for people at risk 
of contracting aids to be tested for hiv and receive azt if it can 
help them the news also raised questions about how to promote 
widespread voluntary testing and who will pay for the drug treatment 
a large number of aids patients dont have health insurance and 
are ineligible for the governments medicare or medicaid benefits 
patients spend 3000 to 8000 a year for the drug depending on 
the dosage 
the major task that lies before us now is to make sure that 
this and other preventative treatments are made available to all who 
need them said project inform in a statement to this end we 
urge an immediate reduction in the price of azt in light of the 
greatly increased market that this news creates 
azt is made by burroughs wellcome co shares of the firms 
parent wellcome plc rose 32 percent friday on the london stock 
exchange on news of the us governments study closing at 1053 
the drug developed jointly by government researchers and 
burroughs wellcome is the only one licensed for aids treatment the 
company estimates more than 20000 people are paying for azt and 
another 7000 are getting it free in clinical trials 
aids attacks the bodys immune system and renders it incapable of 
protecting against infection the disease is caused by the hiv virus 
and is spread most frequently through sexual contact the sharing of 
needles and syringes and from mother to newborn infant 
new figures released thursday by the centers for disease control 
show there have been 102621 cases of aids diagnosed in the united 
states since 1981 a total of 59391 us patients have died

a trans world airlines md80 landed safely after 
an engine came apart and spewed out a metal piece that smashed 
through the roof of an auto body shop narrowly missing the manager 
flight 223 bound from st louis to san francisco returned to 
lambert airport less than 15 minutes after taking off friday morning 
airline officials said it was too early to tell what caused the 
pratt amp whitney engine to lose its rear cover twa spokesman don 
morrison said the engine was designed to eject loose parts out the 
back to minimize damage if problems arose 
i heard a large explosion and then i heard a lot of debris 
hitting the roof said mark erp 29 the manager of the north 
county auto body amp used car sales shop about 1 miles from the 
airport a big hunk came through the roof and hit the floor about 
10 or 15 feet frm me i just dived away 
i had been walking that way if i walked faster i would have 
gotten nailed 
morrison said the 112 passengers on board were put on a flight 
for los angeles where they would make connections for san francisco 
fred farrar a federal aviation administration spokesman in 
washington said the plane could have been flown safely without the 
cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting 
the flight 
given the fact that we have 19000 flights per day in this 
country we may have one report like this a month farrar said 
a shower of metal was scattered across the roof of the body shop 
and along a street near the shop 
no injuries were reported and morrison said the plane made a 
routine landing 
erp said the cone about 2 feet long and weighing about 15 
pounds tore a 5foot square hole in the shops roof 
he said twa officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop 
only briefly they just took the cone and picked up some smaller 
pieces and left erp said they didnt say a whole lot i guess 
they didnt want to talk about it 
it was the second emergency landing without incident this week at 
lambert on tuesday a united air lines boeing 737 made a safe 
landing after its pilot reported that cockpit lights indicated one 
landing gear failed to lock into place officials said it was a 
false alarm

discovery of a magnetic field around 
neptune suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts but 
nasa hopes they wont damage the voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies 
past the planet 
right now i dont think anyone is terribly alarmed said norm 
haynes voyager project manager at the national aeronautics and 
space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
similar radiation belts at jupiter disrupted voyagers internal 
clock causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the 
wrong time 
today voyager was 274 billion miles from earth and 501 million 
miles from neptune speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42251 
mph 
the ship will make its closest approach to neptune at 859 pm 
pdt thursday when it zooms about 3000 miles over the cloudtops of 
the solar systems fourthlargest planet the spacecraft was 
launched in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and 
uranus in 1986 
nasa announced friday that voyager 2 detected intense pulselike 
radio signals coming from neptune strong evidence the planet has a 
magnetic field radio waves are generated when highspeed 
electrically charged particles spiral into a planets atmosphere 
along magnetic field lines 
mercury earth jupiter saturn and uranus have magnetic fields 
venus and mars do not whether pluto has one is unknown nasa said 
magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a 
planets core molten iron in earths core for example creates a 
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the van allen belts 
although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a 
nuclear reactor such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft 
electronics 
so far at neptune theres nothing to indicate it the 
radiation is anything worse than we expected said haynes but 
time will tell 
existence of neptunes magnetic field suggests the planet has an 
aurora like earths northern and southern lights created when 
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a 
planets poles 
further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists 
determine the exact length of a day on neptune now believed to be 
between 17 and 18 earth hours and gain better understanding of 
neptunes internal structure said jet propulsion laboratory 
spokeswoman mary beth murrill 
voyager project scientist edward stone has said he believes 
neptunes hydrogenhelium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a 
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planets center 
that would mean that neptune like neighboring uranus probably 
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea 
some scientists believe radiation trapped by uranus magnetic 
field bombards that planets moons and rings to turn them dark in 
color neptunes magnetic field may cause similar radiation 
darkening of the neptunian moons and ring arcs nasa said 
nasa on friday also released new photographs taken by voyager 
blurry blackandwhite images show markings on triton neptunes 
largest moon but it is still too early to tell if the features 
are clouds or features on tritons surface nasa said 
a color photo of neptune shows complex frequently changing 
weather patterns in its atmosphere including highaltitude wispy 
clouds a small cloud dubbed the scooter because it rotates 
quickly and other clouds that appear as long streaks 
in recent weeks voyager also has discovered four neptunian moons 
besides two observed from earth two partial rings or ring arcs of 
debris orbiting the planet and atmospheric patterns similar to jet 
streams on earth

in the spirit of the concert its 
commemorating an unofficial woodstock reunion is slowly coming 
together with borrowed gear and donated services 
by late friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to 
the farm where 400000 people spent three days aug 1517 1969 
listening to music getting high and enduring shortages of food 
water and hygienic outlets 
unlike the original woodstock concert no rock stars were within 
miles but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site 
regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of 
the 1960s 
police estimate this weekends gathering will attract up to 
100000 people and by friday some 35000 had descended on the 
49acre farm 60 miles north of new york city said sgt charles 
kulick of the sullivan county sheriffs department 
most people were willing to pay a 5 donation to gain 
entrance to the farm although there was no guarantee of 
entertainment by friday evening local musicians were performing on 
a makeshift stage using donated sound equipment powered by a donated 
generator 
we had no idea it would grow into this said richard pell as 
he stood on the stage and gestured toward the crowd spread about the 
sloping field 
pell the unofficial coordinator of the unofficial event said 
the project started earlier in the week with a handful of guitarists 
playing for a few dozen people 
a threeday reunion concert held 12 miles away at the imperial 
resort in swan lake flopped thursday when only 250 people showed up 
to hear performers like edgar winter and woodstock veteran john 
sebastian bruce taylor the vice president of the imperial hotel 
offered to move friday nights concert to the woodstock field but 
bethel city officials wouldnt allow it 
its not going to happen said town supervisor allan scott 
theres enough frenzy here already 
authorities had made one drug arrest by friday night and two 
people were hospitalized one for a drug overdose and another for 
acute alchoholism 
the urge to celebrate historys most famous rock n roll concert 
at its actual site and not at a catskill mountain resort drew a 
crosssection of american culture hippies and exhippies bikers 
legions of grateful dead followers known as deadheads businessmen 
on their lunch hour middleaged tourists housewives and hasidic 
jews from nearby catskill communities 
my husband went to the first one and said we should go every 
day this week and we have said lorrie maus a 33yearold mother 
from nearby youngsville who brought her two children 
around them other children played dogs chased each other and 
music from hundreds of car stereos and acoustic guitars filled the

gunmen assassinated a leading 
presidential hopeful and wounded at least 10 others at a political 
rally and police blamed drug traffickers 
sen luis carlos galan was slain friday hours after drug lords 
shot to death a provinical police chief police said 
president virgilio barco responded to the murders by announcing a 
harsh crackdown on drug traffickers in the nation home of the 
medellin drug cartel it is the worlds largest cocaine ring and is 
believed responsible for 80 percent of the drug smuggled into the 
united states 
barco said in an address broadcast nationwide on television and 
radio that he will use his powers under the nations state of siege 
to reestablish a treaty with the united states to extradite 
suspected drug traffickers the supreme court threw out the treaty 
in april 1988 on a technicality 
barco said his government also will take other emergency measures 
to stop the medellin cartel including seizing assets and hiring 
special judges to investigate drug traffickers 
galan 46 had been one of six people seeking the liberal partys 
nomination for the may 1990 presidential election and was widely 
considered the frontrunner to replace barco 
police said drug traffickers had offered 500000 for his murder 
he was shot as he was about to give a campaign speech before 
10000 people in soacha 20 miles south of bogota at least 10 
others were wounded including one of galans bodyguards and two 
local political leaders witnesses said 
they said the shots were fired by a lone gunman who escaped 
the crowd panicked the people were running screaming and 
crying said jesus calderon a photographer 
bogota mayor andres pastrana said galan died of several gunshot 
wounds to the chest 
galan had escaped an assassination attempt by drug traffickers 
aug 5 in the city of medellin 
police also blamed drug lords for fridays attack which came 
hours after the shooting death of a provincial police chief who had 
led a campaign against the drug lords in medellin 
the medellin drug cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying 
of col waldemar franklin quintero in calls to local radio stations 
franklin quintero 46 police commander for antioquia province 
where medellin is located recently had given up his official 
bodyguards and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges 
he left his home friday in his chauffeurdriven car which had 
traveled about 450 feet when it was cut off by another car and five 
gunmen emerged officials said 
they fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel 
who was hit more than a hundred times an unidentified witness 
told radio caracol the witness said the chauffeur was injured 
franklin quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine 
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure 
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers 
the slayings were the latest in a series of attacks in the past 
month and came amid a national strike by judges who walked out on 
thursday demanding more protection from drug traffickers following 
the slaying of one of their colleagues 
magistrate carlos valencia garcia was fatally shot in bogota on 
wednesday hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of two 
medellin cartel leaders 
its terrifying what is happening in colombia justice 
minister monica de grieff said on friday 
the only way to confront this challenge is by fighting 
together the government judges the armed forces and the citizenry 
to stop the wave of violence she said 
in the past 10 years 23 judges have been assassinated and 
officials blame nearly all of the slayings on drug dealers

two women in a hijacked helicopter plucked 
two inmates from a colorado prison yard but the escape attempt 
ended in a police shootout in a small town 400 miles away 
the women were believed to be the wives of the two men freed at 
daybreak friday the four ordered the helicopter pilot to fly to a 
farmhouse where they picked up a van 
a police officer in holdrege a town of 5600 in southwestern 
nebraska spotted the van friday evening that began a nineminute 
chase and gunbattle through a residential area that ended after the 
van had been surrounded 
they picked a bad place for a shootout said police chief 
kenneth jackson 
one of the escaped inmates ralph brown was shot in the hand in 
the battle 
phelps county deputy attorney rebecca miller identified the four 
people in custody after the chase as brown 30 cellmate freddie 
gonzales 21 of the arkansas valley correctional center near 
pueblo colo rebecca brown 26 and pat gonzales 41 
police recovered two 9mm pistols and a 38caliber revolver 
the women rented the helicopter from helicopter airways in 
denver saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near 
the prison in southern colorado said walter kautzky colorado 
corrections department director 
once near the prison one woman pulled a gun and ordered the 
pilot to land inside the compound kautzky said 
frustrated prison guards held their fire because they could not 
get a clear shot at the helicopter and feared that the pilot was 
being held hostage said liz mcdonough a colorado corrections 
spokewoman 
authorities ordered an investigation to determine why a guard 
refused three orders from prison superintendent jim brittain to open 
fire on the helicopter 
from the time the helicopter came into view from the point of 
touchdown to takeoff was 10 to 15 seconds brittain said 
the pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the 
mediumsecurity state prison and the helicopter was found nearby 
after authorities received an anonymous telephone call 
the chase began when a holdrege police officer spotted the van 
and the shooting started after the van struck a police car headon 
phelps county attorney glenn clark said 
after the first encounter they went down the street shooting 
houses and at people he said at least eight shots penetrated the 
windshield of the van police said 
the gunmen fired wildly but there were no additional injuries 
and thats just flat out a miracle jackson said 
if all the bullets they were shooting were aimed at us they 
werent very good shots jackson said 
nebraska state patrol sgt tom nutt was standing by his car 
which he was using as a roadblock when the van approached he 
headed for shelter behind a nearby house but wound up diving for 
the pavement in a hail of bullets 
they tell us in training that the average gun battle with a law 
enforcement officer lasts two and onehalf seconds i think we set 
some kind of record jackson said 
holdrege police state patrol and phelps county sheriffs 
officers finally surrounded the rental van 
their truck had taken some pretty substantial hits in strategic 
locations said jackson one of the men was wounded and i think 
just didnt want to run anymore 
the chase ended at 627 pm cdt and the bulletshattered van sat 
in the middle of a wide brick street in the business district of 
town 
brown was at good samaritan hospital in kearney with a shotgun 
pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand said phelps 
county sheriff dwayne newman 
gonzales and one of the women were being held at the phelps 
county jail the second woman was being held at holdrege police 
headquarters clark said 
none of the four was formally charged but all four would 
probably be in court monday clark said weve got plenty to hold 
them on he said 
gonzales was serving a fouryear sentence for robbery and would 
have been eligible for parole in september 1991 brown was sentenced 
for sexual assault theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check 
charge his parole eligibility date was october 1996

workers at 15 usowned assembly plants 
were back on the job today after a threeweek strike that ended when 
they won the right to form their own union 
the strike by about 2000 workers ended friday afternoon when the 
leaders of rival labor factions plant managers and the labor 
arbitration board signed an agreement negotiated by tamaulipas gov 
america villareal 
the strike cost the plants 500000 a day but management backed 
the workers in their battle against the powerful mexican labor 
federation and said the strike was a victory against union bossism 
and corruption the mexican labor federation is mexicos largest and 
most powerful labor group 
the agreement gives the workers the right to form their own union 
and elect their own leaders even though the new union will 
ostensibly be an affiliate of the mexican labor federation said 
manuel save the governors spokesman 
talks on forming a new union are to begin next week 
the maquiladora industry which takes advantage of cheap labor to 
assemble products for export to the united states is a key source 
of jobs and investment and the strike had raised fears that 
investor confidence in mexico would erode 
there are 230 maquiladora plants employing about 65000 people in 
tamaulipas

the lawyer for a group called concerned 
women for america predicted the reversal of a ruling that required 
landlords to rent to an unmarried couple even though doing so was 
against their religious beliefs 
the fair employment and housing commission on thursday said the 
refusal to rent violated state laws against housing discrimination 
based on marital status but the lawyer for the group jordan 
lorence called the decision outrageous and gutless and said the 
courts would overturn it 
the commission said it lacked authority to rule on the claim of a 
landlady in chico and an identical claim by apartment owners in 
downey that the rental order violated their freedom of religion 
because no california court has decided the religious issue the 
commission said it has no power to find a constitutional exemption 
to the antibias laws 
the marital status law is an ideological statement about sexual 
morality said lorence whos representing the chico landlady 
evelyn smith its not really meant to solve a real housing 
problem i think what the states doing is punishing mrs smith 
for not agreeing with their position 
he also noted that california allows its public universities to 
reserve student housing for married couples 
the state will prosecute mrs smith for doing the very thing 
the state of california does when it is the landlord lorence 
said theyre going to have a very very rough time explaining 
that 
but jonathan lew who prosecuted the chico case for the state 
fair employment and housing department said the state was entitled 
to decide that married students had a special need for affordable 
housing without abandoning its ban on discrimination in other 
rentals 
to exempt a property owner from that ban on the grounds of 
religious beliefs opens the floodgates to such practices as making 
a moral test on the provisions of goods and services lew said 
he said he like lorence was disappointed that the commission 
had not decided the religious issue 
courts in minnesota and massachusetts are also considering 
challenges to their laws forbidding housing discrimination based on 
marital status 
california courts have forbidden public housing agencies from 
excluding unmarried couples on moral grounds but have not yet 
ruled on religious objections by private owners 
the commission ordered mrs smith to pay 454 to an unmarried 
couple kenneth c phillips and gail randall for their costs in 
finding alternative housing and 500 for emotional distress caused 
by her refusal to rent to them in april 1987 
she was also ordered to stop discriminating against unmarried 
couples 
the commission said mrs smith a presbyterian believes 
unmarried sex is sinful and that she would be prevented from meeting 
her late husband in the hereafter if she rented an apartment to an 
unmarried couple 
in the downey case john and agnes donahue were ordered to pay 
2260 for economic losses and 6000 for emotional distress to 
verna terry and robert wilder and to offer them the first available 
apartment 
the commission said the couple was shocked by their rejection in 
february 1987 bickered and felt pressured to lie about their 
marital status in looking for other housing and that ms terry lost 
sleep and had trouble at work 
the donahues are roman catholics and believe that sex outside 
marriage is a mortal sin and mrs donahue further believes it is 
sinful to help someone else commit a sin the commission said

seven months after the murder of oregon 
corrections chief michael francke his brothers are pressing 
authorities to develop their theory that corrupt prison officials 
conspired to have francke killed 
little information has surfaced on the killing since francke was 
stabbed in the heart outside corrections department headquarters 
jan 17 
no arrests have been made but the death is still very much in 
the news 
franckes brothers patrick 46 and kevin 36 have found an 
ally in phil stanford a columnist for the oregonian newspaper in 
portland who has devoted nearly two dozen columns to the francke 
slaying 
stanford said he thinks theres a good possibility the slaying 
was part of a conspiracy to prevent michael francke from exposing an 
organized criminal element in the prison system that was 
involved in drugs and corruption 
i think its something that any good investigator has to look 
at again and again said stanford who worked as a private 
investigator in miami in the early 1980s 
allegations of official corruption have irritated government 
officials including gov neil goldschmidt who at one point 
dismissed stanfords columns as bs and garbage 
the man in charge of the investigation marion county district 
attorney dale penn said stanford and the francke brothers have 
produced no substantiation for their conspiracy theory 
theres nothing wrong with raising it but theyve gone way 
beyond raising it penn said theyre saying this is what 
happened 
police said francke 42 was attacked at about 7 pm as he was 
leaving work and walking to his car 
mortally wounded francke made it back to the dome building the 
prison department headquarters where he broke a glass pane in a 
door before collapsing 
an hour later lateworking colleagues found franckes car one 
door ajar in the parking lot but it wasnt until five hours later 
that a security guard found franckes body 
penn has said francke may have been killed while interrupting a 
car burglar the death may also have been revenge for some aspect of 
franckes law enforcement work he had been running the oregon 
prisons for about two years after heading the new mexico prison 
system 
the francke brothers have rejected those scenarios from the 
beginning and through interviews and daily contacts with sources 
have kept constant pressure on authorities to investigate the 
alleged conspiracy 
patrick francke a printing press salesman who lives in lenexa 
kan said he thinks his brother was killed after he found some 
people in administrative positions within the system who were 
breaking the law 
i think somewhere along the line there was a confrontation 
he said 
kevin francke who owns a construction company in port charlotte 
fla said he firmly believes corrections officers or administrators 
were involved in his brothers death 
his brother told him he had uncovered an organized criminal 
element and was going to make that information public kevin 
francke said but proving that theory will be difficult 
its a very wellrun network he said its like trying to 
put ibm out of business 
penn said his office will continue to study the conspiracy angle 
but we still have not uncovered one witness or one piece of 
evidence that would establish or corroborate the theory he said 
penn also expressed concern that stanfords columns on the 
subject would make potential witnesses reluctant to talk with 
investigators for fear of their identities becoming public 
stanford rejected that criticism saying penn was the one who had 
created a climate of rumors by refusing to divulge details of the 
slaying 
the case is of great interest to everyone in the state 
stanford said its an extremely interesting mystery and i 
wouldnt be doing my job if i didnt write about it

fruits and cereals the agriculture ministers of the 12 ec nations 
agreed last month to give poland which has been hit hard by 
shortages 
the ec is sending the food free of charge on the condition the 
government sell it and use the money to improve the economy 
especially the private farm sector the polish government has agreed 
to set up a counterpart fund which is often used in development 
programs to handle the money 
the trading bloc and polish officials will administer the fund 
jointly according to a letter initialed by the two sides earlier 
this month 
president bush and leaders of other rich democracies holding 
their annual summit last month in paris asked the community to 
coordinate economic aid for poland and hungary they also urged 
emergency food shipments for poland 
western nations want to encourage the drive in eastern europe for 
more open political and marketoriented economic systems 
officials of two dozen western nations met in brussels on aug 1 
to look at how they can help poland and hungary 
at the meeting the united states pledged to remove 50 million 
in food from its surplus stocks for poland on top of 9 million in 
food earmarked earlier austria and switzerland also promised food 
aid 
polish president wojciech jaruzelski sent a letter last month to 
community officials asking for 685000 tons of beef pork powdered 
milk butter oils wheat corn rice and sugar in the next few 
months 
he said poland would need at least 37 million tons of food next 
year and again in 1991 he also asked for 250000 tons of feed for 
animals and at least 220 million worth of pesticides and similar 
products in 1990

the proiranian hezbollah today pledged to 
launch suicide attacks to foil what it called a campaign by the 
united states france and the vatican against moslems in the middle 
east 
police said one person was killed and nine wounded in clashes 
between syrian and christian forces around the christian enclave 
the french naval buildup in the mediterranean the popes 
fanatic and biased stands and americas moves at the un security 
council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming the 
moslems hezbollah or party of god said in a statement published 
in beirut newspapers 
the campaign according to the statement also aims at stripping 
moslems of their rights and covering up israels crimes in the 
territory it holds 
this campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the 
crusaders invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of 
martyrdom that forced the us marines and the french to retreat 
in 1983 the statement said 
that was a reference to the suicide truck bomb attacks against 
the us marine base and the french paratroop headquarters in beirut 
that killed 241 american servicemen and 58 french soldiers in 
october 1983 
the bombings eventually led to the withdrawal from beirut of a 
multinational peacekeeping force that also contained italian and 
british contingents 
reports said the statement was released after a fourday meeting 
of the hezbollah student council 
france recently dispatched the aircraft carrier foch and the 
destroyer duquesne to the eastern mediterranean to help evacuate an 
estimated 7000 french nationals most duel citizens if necessary 
paris has no intention to intervene militarily french ambassador 
rene ala told a news conference in beirut friday 
by police count the 5monthold confrontation between gen 
michel aouns 20000 predominantly christian troops and syrias 
40000 soldiers backed by allied lebanese and palestinian factions 
has killed 780 people and wounded 2118 
druse warlord walid jumblatt syrias closest ally in the 
confrontation has rejected a un security council call for a 
ceasefire in the confrontation with the 54yearold aoun 
french government envoy alain decaux ended a twoday mission in 
lebanon early today leaving via military helicopter for larnaca 
cyprus where he transferred to a jet bound for paris 
ala described decauxs visits which included talks with 
jumblatt aoun and other moslem and christian leaders as 
successful he would not elaborate 
jumblatt according to the leftist daily newspaper assafir said 
hezbollah has also entered the battle against aoun and that a 
ceasefire will not be achieved if iraq continues to supply aoun 
with weapons 
iraq syrias main arab foe has declared support for aouns 
war of liberation to drive the 40000 syrian troops out of 
predominantly moslem lebanese territories under their control 
iraqi president saddam hussein palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat and king hussein of jordan agreed at a 
meeting in baghdad friday to call an emergency arab summit on 
lebanon 
the current round of violence broke out march 8 two days after 
aoun blockaded illegal ports run by the druse militia and another 
syrianbacked forces south of beirut for denying the ailing 
government treasury about 100 million in lost customs dues annually 
the syrians and allied forces retaliated by besieging and 
shelling the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut 
beirut took the brunt of the shelling duels which have forced 
all but 150000 of its 15 million population to flee the city

the husband of the driver of a truck 
carrying warplane ammunition crawled to safety through an exploding 
barrage of shells after the truck crashed and exploded in the desert 
the wreck 30 miles north of phoenix early friday caused a 
10milelong traffic backup on interstate 17 while state police 
cordoned off the area to recover hundreds of live 20mm projectiles 
nearly 40000 rounds of shells and bullets went up in the 
explosion and fire 
the two northbound lanes of the freeway were restricted to one 
this morning while the cleanup continued state department of public 
safety spokesman allan schmidt said 
theyre looking especially for those explosive projectiles that 
are undetonated schmidt said then theyre going to take three 
to four inches of soil as best they can around that truck and load 
it into some sort of vehicle and take that to some range where they 
can sift it out 
the driver lois ann bailey 38 of cullman ala was killed 
instantly in the crash of the truck carrying 17 tons of ammunition 
he said 
rick bailey 36 was thrown from a sleeper compartment in the 
cab which disintegrated in the blaze schmidt said 
one minute he was asleep the next minute he was badly 
injured in the desert schmidt said 
baileys escape involved not only avoiding flames but the shells 
intended for use in f15 and f16 air force jets and other weapons 
schmidt said 
a passerby picked up bailey and drove him to the rock springs 
store where they used a pay phone to notify authorities schmidt 
said 
bailey was taken to john c lincoln hospital in phoenix where he 
was listed in serious condition with broken ribs and other injuries 
mrs baileys body wasnt found for hours because of the danger 
of exploding shells schmidt said 
people were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as 
a fourperson army explosives team recovered about 300 unexploded 
shells and similar amount of bullets which schmidt said were 
partially exploded and still dangerous 
if the public thought of it as a hand grende they might get a 
concept of what its like when one of these projectiles goes off 
its basically that kind of explosion these are designed to 
fragment and blow off into a lot of little pieces and they could 
take off a hand schmidt said 
the truck hauling the ammunition from fort huachuca in sierra 
vista in southeast arizona to the navajo army depot near flagstaff 
apparently was traveling through a storm when it veered left into a 
guardrail schmidt said

japan will conduct a study next year to determine 
the effects of acid rain on its forests which cover 70 percent of 
the land 
the study the most comprehensive of its kind in japan will also 
recommend ways to improve the condition of the forests yutaka 
kawanaka of the forestry agency said in a statement today 
acid rain results from the mixture of rain and sulfur dioxide 
nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants that enter the atmosphere 
mainly as emissions from factories and electric power plants the 
study will begin april 1 1990 and take samples from 1200 locations 
within the nations forests kawanaka said 
until recently japan paid little attention to acid rain and the 
damage it has caused the united states and europe have been 
studying the problem for some time although critics say they have 
taken few steps to stop acid rain 
damage caused by acid rain has been negligible in japan because 
we have rich thick soil that is hard to acidify whereas soil in 
europe and the united states is thin and easily acidified 
kawanaka said also coniferous or evergreen trees including the 
fir prevalent in europe are more easily damaged than the 
broadleaved deciduous forests we have in japan 
however japans environmental agency recently reported the 
results of a fiveyear survey that concluded that acid rain has been 
falling all over japan it did not specify whether damage has been 
done

president hashemi rafsanjani announced his 
cabinet nominees to parliament today and left out one of his rivals 
a hardline interior minister against the request of more than half 
the lawmakers 
rafsanjani replaced ali akbar mohtashemi with abdullah nouri a 
leading figure in the revolutionary guards a branch of the 
military the official islamic republic news agency reported 
earlier today the governmentsupervised tehran times had 
reported that rafsanjani would not include his hardline opponents 
in the cabinet 
irna monitored in nicosia said more than half the nominees were 
new faces and news reports indicated the list could cause a 
political brawl in parliament 
rafsanjani had been expected to present his cabinet to the 
majlis or parliament on sunday the majlis was scheduled to review 
and approve new procedures for appointing ministers today and it 
apparently finished its work early enough for rafsanjani to give the 
lawmakers his list 
the 270member parliament must confirm each nominee 
former prime minister hussein musavi and minister of intelligence 
mohammad reyshahri two other major figures in the faction opposed 
to rafsanjani would also be eliminated from the new government 
irna quoted the tehran times as saying musavis post of prime 
minister was scrapped under constitutional changes that concentrate 
executive power in the presidency 
the paper said unidentified sources provided the details for its 
story 
irna said that 138 deputies signed a letter read in the majlis 
earlier today asking rafsanjani to keep mohtashemi as interior 
minister 
the report indicated that the deputies acknowledged the 
competition between the two men saying the presence of powerful 
personalities in the future cabinet is inevitable 
but it urged him to appoint mohtashemi noting the sensitivity 
of the arrogant world the usual reference to the united states 
to the issue 
rafsanjani acknowledged during his inauguration speech thursday 
that a fight was brewing over his appointments with some ministers 
refusing to serve in his government 
irna did not indicate in its report whether rafsanjanis rivals 
were being dumped or had declined to work with him 
rafsanjani is viewed a pragmatist seeking more private 
investment and links with the west to obtain the technology and 
financing to rebuild an economy shattered by eight years of war with 
iraq 
his hardline rivals support a centralized economy and believe 
that confrontation with the west better serves the islamic 
revolution 
the shape of rafsanjanis government and especially the 
competition with the hardline faction will determine how fast iran 
moves on a number of foreign policy issues such as signing a peace 
treaty with iraq and pressuring proiranian groups in lebanon to 
release the western hostages they hold

defense minister qin jiwei whom chinese sources 
have reported is engaged in a power struggle for control of the 
army appeared on national television today at the funeral of a 
revolutionary veteran 
qin was shown in a news report on the funeral of fu zhong a 
legislator and former colonelgeneral along with other top chinese 
leaders the report did not identify him by name although it 
identified the other leaders 
chinese sources say qin 75 is engaged in a struggle with 
president yang shangkun for control of the army and the nation after 
the death of senior leader deng xiaoping who is believed to be very 
ill deng turns 85 tuesday 
the sources said thursday that troops commanded by yang led qin 
away from his beijing residence on wednesday evening after qin 
argued with yang over which of them should be promoted to first vice 
chairman of the powerful central military commission the post was 
held by former party general secretary zhao ziyang until he was 
stripped of all his jobs in june 
deng is commission chairman and first vice chairman is the 
second only to deng yang currently is permanent vice chairman and 
secretary general of the commission 
several chinese sources in beijing and hong kong said that after 
being led away qin was placed under house arrest but the television 
appearance seemed to rule that out 
the defense ministry denied to foreign reporters friday that qin 
was arrested or deposed as defense minister but did not specificly 
deny he was detained by troops on yangs orders telephone calls to 
the defense ministry were not answered today 
one source in hong kong said yang held a meeting friday night 
of top military commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice 
chairman but that the commanders did not express support yang 
asked them to stay in beijing until a decision can be reached 
the source said dengs health is deteriorating rapidly military 
commanders who visited him this week found he was so infirm that he 
could not speak the source said he said his information came from 
the wife of one commander and secretary of another 
a western diplomat said the reported struggle between qin and 
yang is over more than just the military commissions vice 
chairmanship 
the general consensus here is that its the top post dengs 
position that is at stake he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
zhao was ousted after losing a power struggle with conservatives 
who accused him of supporting student prodemocracy protests this 
spring yang helped lead the army crackdown on the protesters june 
34 but qin was believed to oppose it 
the western diplomat said regional military commanders were 
opposing yangs attempts to elevate himself because of his extensive 
family connections in the military 
yangs is one of the strongest military families in china

pope john paul ii today 
praised plans for a solidarityled government in his native poland 
and indicated he might travel to lebanon soon on a mission of peace 
the pontiff traveling to spain for the third time said he had 
not yet received a response from lebanese authorities to his recent 
statement that he would like to visit the warravaged middle eastern 
country 
however he told reporters traveling on his plane we can say a 
certain interest has been shown 
he refused to elaborate but his spokesman joaquin navarro said 
the interest had come from various foreign ministries which he did 
not identify 
the pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in lebanon 
between christian and syrianled forces and last week said he felt 
an imperative to visit the country more than 750 people have 
been killed since the latest round of battles in the nations 
14yearold civil war broke out in march 
asked whether he was satisfied with developments in poland where 
a noncommunistled government was expected to take power john paul 
grinned broadly and said more or less 
all that has been done is very important a step forward he 
said 
its not easy he added 
the pope is an old friend of tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity 
journalist reported friday to be communist president wojciech 
jaruzelskis choice for prime minister 
john pauls outspoken support of solidarity is credited with 
keeping the independent labor movement alive during the seven years 
it was outlawed 
the pontiff last met with mazowiecki on his third trip to poland 
in 1987 navarro said 
the focus of the trip was the fourth vaticansponsored world 
youth day today which has drawn 300000 young people from 55 
countries to this city one of the three most important pilgrimage 
sites in the history of the church 
the 69yearold pontiff donned a traditional brown pilgrims 
mantle over his white robes and walked the final 100 yards of the 
500mile way of st james to show his symbolic participation in the 
trek from the pyrenees to santiago 
once there he spoke briefly to thousands of cheering youths and 
embraced a statue of st james in the cathedral in accordance with 
another pilgrim custom 
millions of pilgrims have traveled to the northwestern spanish 
city in the 11 centuries since the bones of the martyred apostle st 
james were reportedly found there 
the pope is using the symbol of the santiago pilgrimage to urge 
young people to spread their faith to places where it doesnt exist 
and to revive it in first world countries where religious practice 
has declined 
the church of today is preparing itself for a new 
christianization which is presented to you as a challenge he 
said in a speech at santiagos airport where he was greeted by 
spanish king juan carlos 
of particular concern to the church as it approaches its 2000th 
birthday is the dramatic slide in the practice of religion in 
traditionally roman catholic european countries 
both in europe and the united states john paul has condemned 
what he considers first world ills consumerism and secular 
attitudes promoting premarital sex and divorce 
this weekends celebrations include a papal address to a youth 
rally at a mountain outside santiago today and a mass on sunday 
about 160 bishops are attending the celebrations which were 
preceded by a week of cultural and religious meetings for youth 
leaders 
the events have drawn young people from countries including 
communistruled cuba bulgaria and soviet lithuania most are being 
housed in tents turning the city of 85000 and its environs into a 
giant campground 
many of those participating in the youth day followed part of the 
old pilgrimage route this week police said friday that a french 
priest had died of a heart attack while cycling along the route to 
santiago for the papal visit 
after his visit to santiago the pope is to address catholics in 
the northern cities of oviedo and covadonga 
the pope may speak about the shift away from church practice in 
the 11 years since catholicism was dropped as the state religion 
which it was under dictator francisco franco 
spain now has a limited abortion law and another giving the state 
effective control over subsidies to and curricula of religious 
schools both took effect in 1985 following visits by john paul in 
1982 and 1984 
a security force of about 5000 civil guards and police are on 
hand for the pontiffs visit

the mighty mississippi once carried cargo and cotton and damsels 
and dandies up and down the lazy river now iowans are betting these 
waters will deliver them another precious commodity greenbacks 
iowa known more for hogs than high rollers is moving to revive 
riverboat gambling hoping the romance of the past will generate 
riches for the future and its not alone 
across americas heartland several states are planning or 
considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars jobs and 
tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard 
this decade by factory closings the farm depression and the exodus 
of jobs and people 
if we were still doing well and had not turned into the great 
rust belt you would not see this great influx of gambling in the 
guise of economic development said state sen denny jacobs a key 
supporter of riverboat gambling in illinois its a nice stopgap 
until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet 
soon there will be wagers in the land of wild bill hickok the 
gold rush town of deadwood sd theres gambling talk too in 
indiana missouri and wisconsin 
thats not to suggest there arent skeptics and critics some 
argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation the sites 
too hohum or bleak for tourism 
others fear games of chance will erode the american gothic ethic 
when gambling comes in all of the other social crimes 
increase said owen primavera spokesman for the iowa alliance 
against casino gambling it increases loan sharking it increases 
drug traffic and prostitution 
supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment 
those traditional midwest heartland values are still going 
to be there said larry reed executive vice president of the 
davenport chamber of commerce in iowa 
the only change proponents say is the midwest will being doing 
more to strut its stuff 
the mississippi is well known worldwide said don rinehart 
executive vice president of the river city chamber of commerce in 
iowa its a gold mine in our backyard and we havent taken 
advantage of it 
its all right to be homespun jacobs said thats part of 
the charm of the midwest but it may be time we get a little more 
sophisticated 
and gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity 
of bingo lotteries and horse and dog tracks in north dakota for 
example a record 205 million was wagered on games of chance last 
year including pull tabs blackjack and bingo 
more than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have 
parimutuel betting said william thompson a university of 
nevadalas vegas management and public administration professor and 
coauthor of a book on casinos 
theres more to come 
in deadwood sd there will be poker blackjack and slot 
machines probably in october voters this spring approved gambling 
city proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once 
riproaring black hills town where hickoks last poker game ended 
with a bullet in his head 
what were really doing is returning to our past and saying 
thats really our future said bill walsh coowner of a local 
hotel 
in gary ind a struggling steel capital on lake michigan 
voters will be asked in a nonbinding november referendum whether 
they want resort hotels with casino gambling supporters of casino 
gambling in lorain ohio say they are not giving up despite failing 
to get enough signatures to put the issue on the november ballot in 
1988 detroit rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years 
in illinois wisconsin and missouri some lawmakers want to 
mimic iowa and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of 
the great lakes the mississippi and other waterways 
the illinois house in june rejected such a plan but a task force 
has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider 
it in the fall 
many illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the 
water before iowa which doesnt start riverboat gambling until 
april 1991 iowa requires county referendums before gambling can 
begin in each local area 
iowa gov terry branstad has proposed creating a regional agency 
to monitor riverboat gambling on the states boundary waters 
the lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to 
mississippi river towns in both states which have lost thousands of 
manufacturing jobs in the last decade 
iowa has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could 
generate 17 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business 
theres concern though riverboats could cut into the bingo and 
racing profits 
further reed said at some point you reach a saturation 
point if iowa has it illinois and wisconsin the impact of it 
for any individual state is going to be diluted 
some experts say iowas riverboat project already is in trouble 
because of a 5 limit per bet 200 cap on nightly losses and 20 
percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit 
iowa has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result 
in naught daniel lee senior analyst at drexel burnham lambert 
inc said in a report 
he added in a telephone interview theyre going to throw a 
party no one will go to 
especially some say if its far away 
people from around the country are not going to travel to iowa 
to spend 5 on riverboat gambling said professor thompson 
everything that is good about it lends itself to being small 
but if its small its not going to add much to the economy 
but local folks insist theyre not expecting miracles 
i dont think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the 
answer to their economic woes rinehart said its like chicken 
soup it cant hurt and it looks like it could help its just 
another piece of ammunition to lure people 
thats also what deadwood hopes to do 
theres no other way we could think of to raise money said 
melodee nelson head of the deadwood you bet committee deadwood 
is sitting 45 miles from a major airport 15 miles from the 
interstate no industry is going to come to deadwood 
but big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to 
reverse their fortunes also face obstacles said john dombrink 
associate social ecology professor at the university of 
californiairvine and thompsons coauthor 
its kind of pollyannish to think a bluecollar industrial city 
is somehow tailormade for a tourist industry he said 
tourism is not like a nose job where one day you can wave a 
wand it might take a long time for peoples perceptions to 
change 
but some in gary ind believe the scenic lakefront and 
proximity to chicago will make the city an ideal casino site 
despite its problems with shuttered stores a bleak downtown and a 
shrinking workforce 
i think its garys last shot at an economic development 
project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once 
delivered on said state rep earline rogers a supporter 
nothing else weve looked at will revitalize gary in the same 
manner if casino gambling cant do it nothing can

only a few countries in the communist world have 
benefited from mikhail gorbachevs reform movement the norm still 
is oldfashioned stalinist doctrine and lack of economic and 
political freedom here is a report by an associated press 
correspondent who has reported widely on developments in the 
communist bloc 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
despite momentous reforms in the soviet 
union poland and hungary the march toward democracy and personal 
freedom has made little if any progress elsewhere in the vast 
communist world in the four years since president mikhail gorbachev 
took power in the kremlin 
the soviet reforms however and the increasingly obvious 
failures of statecontrolled economies to match western technology 
and consumer plenty have encouraged people under communist rule to 
demand change 
the responses of their governments range from tinkering with the 
economy while leaving political reform alone to outright repression 
huge security networks still are deployed to crush or at least curb 
free speech as aging leaders from havana to east berlin prague 
sofia and bucharest cling to power 
the most vivid display of oldstyle communist determination to 
stay in power at any cost has come in china 
before the eyes of a world hundreds perhaps thousands of 
prodemocracy demonstrators were felled by military tanks and 
gunfire early in june 
hundreds perhaps thousands more people have been arrested and 
dozens executed since 
romania and cuba are other examples where little has changed 
since gorbachev emerged on the world scene in fact conditions may 
actually have deteriorated 
while in other socialist countries they are taking steps 
toward a more open society in romania its going exactly 
backwards said paula tscherne who monitors human rights for the 
viennabased international helsinki federation 
food in shops is scarcer and rationing of bread and other staples 
more widespread the longer nicolae ceausescu presides over the land 
once known as the breadbasket of southeastern europe 
senior communists and wellknown writers demanding change face 
house arrest jail or mental hospitals less prominent dissenters 
disappear without a trace 
in cuba fidel castro like ceausescu harangues sovietstyle 
reform as a return to capitalism 
in an unexplained move attributed by some analysts to internal 
power struggles the nations top general was recently executed 
after being convicted of drug trafficking three dissidents face up 
to four years in jail after reportedly telling foreigners that 
confessions at the trial were extracted by torture 
in rigid east germany desperation over the lack of political and 
economic reform is driving hundreds of thousands to apply to 
emigrate west 
thousands more who cant stand the years of waiting for legal 
permission to go are escaping in the biggest human flow westward 
since the communists built the berlin wall in 1961 
were just secondclass citizens here or worse one east 
german told western reporters 
my parents said go wed go too if we were younger said 
an east berlin woman in her early 20s one of hundreds fleeing 
across hungarys newly porous border with austria pointing to other 
youths who did the same she added we all work in professions 
where you actually make money in east germany but theres nothing 
to spend it on 
other communist governments that have rejected genuine reforms 
vacillate between concessions and repression 
bulgaria and czechoslovakia whose communists traditionally have 
paid much heed to moscow have lent strong verbal support to 
gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring and claimed to be 
implementing their own versions 
in both countries however reform seems skindeep limited to 
some new freedom in the statecontrolled arts and changes billed as 
improvements in running stagnating state economies 
certain surface lets say official improvements have been 
made said jana starek of the international helsinki federation 
unfortunately nothing has changed as far as strictly political 
cases cases of religious belief and independent civil organizations 
are concerned 
in czechoslovakia which has perhaps the strongest democratic 
traditions of any soviet bloc nation sporadic antigovernment 
protests and petitions for reform have yielded nothing but more 
harassment and jail for dissidents and their supporters 
in bulgaria organized dissident groups have emerged for 
virtually the first time under communist rule but activists have 
quickly found the limits of glasnost bulgarianstyle suffering 
police harassment imprisonment or forced emigration 
bulgarias ethnic turks are fleeing by the hundreds of thousands 
to turkey after at least nine people died in may protests against an 
assimilation campaign and authorities began deporting dozens of 
ethnic turkish activists 
in yugoslavia still freer in spirit than the soviet bloc with 
which it broke in 1948 ethnic tension is also mounting fueled by 
economic chaos resulting from a decentralized political system and 
state mismanagement of agriculture and industry 
hundreds of ethnic albanians have been jailed since they 
protested last spring against constitutional changes they say curbed 
their autonomy in yugoslavia 
while europes communist nations are embroiled in upheaval 
vietnam a nation ravaged by turmoil for decades seems calmly to be 
implementing its version of perestroika known as doi moi 
according to a recent report in the authoritative british weekly 
the economist doi moi has not halted the flow of boat people 
risking their lives to escape communist vietnam but it has raised 
economic production and hopes without yet firing political 
unrest 
in europe steeped in traditions of individual liberty the 
lifting of the rigid clamp of totalitarianism seems fraught with 
more danger 
the restructuring of a vast diverse country such as the soviet 
union seems unable to proceed without the upheaval seen in the 
baltic republics the caucasus and in siberian and ukrainian miners 
strikes 
fear of such turbulence bolsters communist governments that have 
so far rejected change in czechoslovakia for example living 
standards are still relatively high and workers living for four 
decades by the east bloc motto we pretend to work and they 
pretend to pay us are afraid reform will send artificially low 
prices soaring and put them out of their cozy jobs 
popular pressure for change could mount if poland or hungary 
proves that smaller more developed and more ethnically homogenous 
nations than the soviet union can achieve democratic reform without 
major upheaval 
younger communists also may prove more willing to countenance 
change than the older leaders in power now east germanys erich 
honecker 76 czechoslovakias gustav husak 75 bulgarias todor 
zhivkov 77 ceausescu 71 and castro younger at 62 but at the top 
since 1959 
when it does come however change may not be as sudden as it has 
been in the past breathtaking months in the soviet union poland and 
hungary 
interim communist leaders may preside over a period of more 
gradual reform before relinquishing or sharing power argues one 
western analyst speaking on condition of anonymity 
its not like a trigger that will suddenly produce poszgays 
imre poszgay is hungarys most reformminded communist or 
gorbachevs in east germany he added 
precisely because they have held out for such a long time and 
their people see that change can be painful these nations might 
need another tinkering period before they start on their own

it was nov 10 1938 in wittenberg germany 
and 11yearold richard wiener sat in his aunts apartment among the 
broken glass china and furniture left behind the night before by a 
rampaging nazi mob 
only one friend dared visit the apartment to warn wiener it was 
too dangerous to return to a school where he was the only jewish 
student the schoolmate werner lindemann had parents who didnt 
like hitler and he was the only gentile at the school who refused to 
wear the uniform of hitlers youth organization 
that november and the months that followed summon painful 
memories for the 62yearold wiener but one pleasant recollection 
has unexpectedly returned 
after 50 years richard wiener and werner lindemann have found 
each other 
wiener now a patent attorney in washington and lindemann a 
retired physician living near wittenberg in east germany correspond 
regularly and wiener is considering a personal visit 
playing the central role in their reunion was last falls 50th 
anniversary of kristallnacht the night of the broken glass 
when jewish homes businesses and synagogues were destroyed in 
germany and austria 
wiener agreed last november to relive his experience in a special 
service at his synagogue temple sinai in washington while 
preparing for the event wiener opened his mailbox one day to find a 
letter from east germany 
the note from lindemann was short the east german said he felt 
compelled to write because of the anniversary wiener still isnt 
sure how lindemann found his address 
his next letter was very lengthy wiener said he told me 
everything since school to me it meant a lot i have a great need 
to feel connected to my past 
dear richard lindemann wrote last january those were 
stormy times im happy you still speak of wittenberg as your home 
many germans fall silent when they think about the persecution of 
the jews i have felt that since childhood the nazis were evil 
but my eyes were not opened until 1945 until then i knew nothing 
of the concentration camps nothing of the killing which took place 
daily 
you had such a difficult childhood unimaginable 
last month lindemann pleaded please come as soon as possible 
it would make me so happy 
the letters sent wieners thoughts rolling back in time and he 
recalled that his friends visit after crystal night wasnt the only 
time lindemann risked his safety for his jewish friend 
werner and i would occasionally meet in the park after dark 
where he would tell me about school it was dangerous for him but 
it meant a lot to me he was my one connection to the community 
otherwise we were outcasts wiener said 
wiener said he wants to visit his hometown the site of the 
protestant reformation where only a dozen jewish families lived 
when wieners family owned a shoe factory there but wiener 
admitted i dont know if i could handle it 
ive had a lot of therapy which is why i have a fairly normal 
life i had to do a lot of work to deal with the leftovers of my 
childhood when you go to survivors groups you see a lot of sad 
faces 
wiener has traveled to west germany on legal business but never 
tried to cross the border into east germany 
i felt my past was lost when people said why dont you go 
back my answer would be i dont know anybody there anymore they 
would all be strangers he said 
wiener left germany by boat in february 1939 one of the lucky 
children allowed to go without his parents on a special 
kindertransport to england his mother and his father who was 
sent to a concentration camp for several months made their way to 
the united states later before the nazis closed the gates to jewish 
emigration 
in his letters lindemann went into great detail on his own life 
drafted at 15 into the germany army six months in a french prisoner 
of war camp a stint as a teacher a career as a government doctor 
a kidney illness that has left him with a decent government pension 
lindemann has found another link to wieners past wolfgang 
senst wieners best childhood friend before he went along with peer 
pressure and joined the hitler youth group 
wolfgang is now working for the wittenberg institute for 
research into persecution of the jews wiener said relaying 
information from lindemann werner said he didnt give him my 
address because he didnt know if it was okay with me i will write 
him back and say i want to get in touch

japan a crowded country with no tradition of 
welcoming immigrants has since the early 1980s granted safe harbor 
to all vietnamese boat people but now it finds itself overwhelmed 
we are considering whether we should change our policy and 
introduce screening said toshio tsunozaki director of the 
foreign ministrys human rights and refugee division but of 
course the biggest problem that arises from screening is what to do 
with the screenedout 
unlike other countries japan has no screening process to 
distinguish between those fleeing vietnam for political reasons and 
those who simply want a chance for economic security 
vietnam says it will not accept those forced to return home 
the boat people turned away from the shores of their already 
inundated southeast asian neighbors have begun to navigate a 
perilous route 1900 miles across the east china sea to southern 
japan 
but with 1422 refugees so far this year compared to 219 during 
all of 1988 japan says it can no longer handle the flow 
the countrys only refugee reception center at omura in nagasaki 
prefecture already was at double its capacity with 415 refugees 
when 137 more arrived in the nearby goto islands on monday 
it is impossible to receive any more said hisao nishino 
deputy director of the omura refugee reception center 
its just too much and the government should do something 
about it right now he said 
in the latest arrival a coast guard ship carrying 188 boat 
people was to arrive in naha on the southern japanese island of 
okinawa on sunday morning officials said 
hong kong flooded with about 52000 indochinese refugees is 
trying to persuade economic refugees to return home about 150 have 
gone voluntarily and the british colony is considering forcible 
repatriation if the bottleneck continues 
japan is affluent but unlike immigrant nations such as the 
united states australia and canada it is very crowded and not 
accustomed to accepting immigrants 
the indochinese are the first people to be accepted 
systematically into japan said chikako saito of the united 
nations high commissioner for refugees in tokyo japan has 
geographical limitations but as a member of the international 
community it realizes it must share the burden 
the un agency estimates 2 million people have fled indochina 
since 1975 
most of the recent arrivals here braved bands of pirates who are 
believed to have killed several hundred boat people in the south 
china sea this year 
pho van son 34 the leader of a group of 151 who left northern 
vietnam on a 60ton boat said he decided to aim for japan after he 
heard on shortwave radio that japan accepts refugees 
the 20day journey calling at chinese ports for food and 
anchoring at small islands for shelter from stormy weather was 
difficult he said also difficult he said was the discrimination 
at home because of his chinese blood 
now son said after two days at omura all the difficulty 
has passed 
he and his companions want to resettle in japan a poor farmer 
from hong gai son says he doesnt know what he will do here but 
expects the japanese will find jobs for him and his family 
most of the refugees arriving here now dont know much about 
japan said saito they were headed anywhere they just wanted 
to get out of vietnam 
at the camp the refugees wear clean tshirts shorts and sandals 
and look surprisingly healthy they take japanese and english 
classes eat japanese food and write letters to relatives some of 
whom fled vietnam ahead of them and have settled in such places as 
the united states and australia 
their 9by12foot rooms with floors covered in tatami mats are 
crowded with up to six people laundry is strung across the rooms 
and graffitti is scrawled on many of the walls 
above a framed picture of the american oil tanker that rescued 
them in the south china sea loi nguyen hong 44 and his son chau 
nguyen hong 18 have written this american ship saved us from 
death 
on another wall is written liberty nearby the word 
communism is crossed out with red paint 
hong displayed a photo album with pictures of his brother a 
vietnamese translator and sisterinlaw who live in amarillo 
texas hong hopes his brother can sponsor him and his son to 
resettle in the united states 
hongs friend hung nguyen 32 planned to present a petition to 
the staff asking for the refugees from southern vietnam to be 
segregated from the northern people 
we risked our lives to escape communism and to get here and we 
dont want to live in the same place as them said nguyen who 
used to teach english in ho chi minh city 
nguyen bears no ill will toward the northern vietnamese but 
thinks he must make clear he is a political refugee to win 
resettlement in the united states where already about 800000 
indochinese refugees have settled 
japan has resettled 6257 vietnamese since the early 1980s in 
june it pledged to accept 1000 more over the next three years but 
that plan would be already out of date if most of the 1400plus who 
have arrived this year were to remain in japan 
in 1986 japan said it was willing to take a total of 10000 
refugees from indochina

president wojciech jaruzelski today 
nominated solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister 
in a move that will end the communist partys 45year grip on 
government power 
the president thinks that the formation of such a government 
will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties 
and satisfying the needs and aspirations of polish society 
the official news agency said 
moments earlier the pap news agency announced that jaruzelski 
had accepted the resignation of communist prime minister czeslaw 
kiszczak who was unable to form a government in the face of 
opposition from the solidarity labor movement 
pap said jaruzelski would soon forward the nomination of 
mazowiecki a former political prisoner with close ties to 
solidarity leader lech walesa to the speaker of the sejm the lower 
house of parliament 
mazowiecki 62 said friday he was prepared to accept the 
premiership he was reported by an associate to be resting today 
outside of warsaw 
the sejm must now elect mazowiecki a parliamentary majority put 
together by solidarity and two minor parties the united peasant 
party and the democratic party assures mazowieckis election 
even with a noncommunist coalition in charge of the government 
the communists will continue to wield great influence as president 
jaruzelski oversees military and foreign policy party members fill 
the government and courts 
solidarity mindful of the soviet unions strategic concerns has 
said it will let the communist party retain control of the 
ministries of defense and interior which oversee the army and 
police 
mazowiecki was described by pap as a longtime catholic activist 
and former sejm deputy one of the leading activists of solidarity 
and the editor of its weekly newspaper tygodnik solidarnosc 
in the present situation the president sees a need to create a 
government enjoying the necessary support of parliamentary floor 
groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between 
polands political and social forces pap said 
the announcement came as the communist central committee was 
meeting in warsaw and walesa was meeting with union leadership in 
gdansk 
a presidential spokesman said there was some division within 
the committee concerning the historic change but that members were 
expected to back the plan the policymaking bodys approval 
appeared necessary for the changes to work because the party 
controls the powerful bureaucracies that run poland 
pope john paul ii traveling in spain today praised the recent 
developments calling them very important a step forward the 
polishborn pope is an old friend of mazowiecki 
on friday the powerful warsaw branch of the communist party 
argued for a nonpolitical government of experts an apparent 
lastminute bid to keep the government from falling under 
solidaritys control 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said friday that 
president bush would have no comment on the selection of a new prime 
minister until the parliamentary process is completed bush was not 
considering expanding the 119 million economic aid package he has 
announced for poland fitzwater said 
walesa opened a meeting today at solidarity national headquarters 
in gdansk where some union members were wary about the communists 
reaction to the expected government changeover 
the pzpr party of course will defend itself it will begin to 
start provocations for the party the greater disorder that there 
is the better because we are appealing for calm said alojzy 
pietrzyk a solidarity official from the southern coal fields of 
jastrzebie 
mazowieckis nomination caps a dramatic comeback for the veteran 
activist who spent a year in jail during jaruzelskis martial law 
crackdown of 1981 
as prime minister he would lead a country with an economy 
crippled by a 39 billion foreign debt food shortages and 
widespread public discontent 
he would be given several weeks to assemble a cabinet and present 
it to the sejm for a vote 
a solidarityled government would be of historic significance 
because it would be the first government in the soviet bloc not 
under the control of the communists since soviet dictator josef 
stalin consolidated control of eastern europe in the late 1940s 
the soviet government daily izvestia said friday it is clear that 
poland is headed for its first noncommunist government in decades 
perhaps to reassure soviets there would be some continuity 
izvestia also ran excerpts from an interview walesa gave to west 
german tv in which he said poland would remain in the sovietled 
warsaw pact military alliance 
mazowiecki a catholic journalist trained as a lawyer was at 
walesas side when nationwide strikes last year served as the 
catalyst for the governments decision to open talks with the union 
legalize it and allow opposition participation in lections 
those elections resulted in solidaritys victory in virtually 
every race its candidates entered 
mazowiecki was editor of a catholic monthly from 1958 until 1981 
when he founded tygodnik solidarnosc it was banned under martial 
law but resurrected this year after solidarity was legalized

federal investigators are studying the 
activities and finances of lucille bloch in search of evidence that 
could be used in the case being developed against her husband spy 
suspect felix bloch sources say 
mrs bloch has taken a leave of absence from her job as executive 
director of the american austrian foundation a group dedicated to 
improving usaustrian relations bloch was the no 2 diplomat at 
the us embassy in vienna from 1980 to 1986 
sources familiar with the case say mrs bloch is not suspected of 
any wrongdoing or of being an accomplice but in the hunt for any 
motive or evidence of espionage by bloch investigators are looking 
for signs of unexplained wealth or unusual trips which often 
accompany spy cases said the sources who spoke on condition they 
not be identified 
bloch 54 has not been charged with any crime but was placed on 
paid leave by the state department in june 
about two weeks ago mrs bloch asked the foundation which 
receives money from the austrian foreign ministry for a leave of 
absence for an indefinite period said thomas mcgrath a new york 
attorney who serves as the groups secretary 
mrs bloch made the decision on her own and was not prodded by 
officials of the taxdeductible foundation he said 
several of mrs blochs friends described her as distraught over 
the investigation of her husband 
while bloch has remained at the couples apartment in washington 
mrs bloch has stayed with relatives in new york according to her 
friends her office in washington a room she rents from another 
consultant is staffed by a secretary mrs bloch could not be 
reached for comment 
she told a newspaper in vienna last month we are all very 
affected and in these difficult times we stand behind him 
mrs bloch whom mcgrath said was a spectacular and very 
hardworking employee was hired as the foundations executive 
director in 1988 according to forms on file with the new york 
secretary of states office in albany ny she was paid 24375 
last year 
the foundation was set up in 1984 to promote develop and 
support cultural scientific scholarly and intellectual relations 
between the united states and austria its brochure says 
a host of famous people are associated with the group including 
director billy wilder a trustee former secretary of state cyrus 
vance and david rockefeller honorary trustees and conductor 
leonard bernstein an advisory council member 
although mcgrath said the foundation has no official relationship 
with the austrian government records show the group received a 
39370 grant from the austrian foreign ministry in 1988 
the austrian foreign minister alois mock is a good friend of 
the blochs from their graduate school days in the 1950s they met 
at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in 
bologna italy 
last june mrs bloch stayed at mocks home in vienna and 
attended a dinner party there a guest told the washington post and 
last year mrs blochs foundation hosted a 1653 luncheon for 
mock records show 
altogether in 1988 the foundation collected 167414 of which 
120982 came from corporate and other business grants 
philipp hoyos a political minister at the austrian embassy said 
his country channelled some seed money to the foundation when it 
was established since then the government has helped the 
foundation with its projects he said 
despite the foundations good intentions hoyos said the group 
has not had as much success in fundraising as some thought 
initially 
mcgrath said he hoped the foundation would not be unfairly 
tarnished by the bloch affair but acknowledged the group might be 
put in a defensive posture because of the publicity

a farm town that consists of two bars a 
grain elevator a church baseball field and 70 people can now boast 
its the smallest place johnny cash ever played 
cash took the stage in the alfalfa field behind the county line 
bar on friday night before nearly 5000 people just about all of 
them from out of town 
twenty years ago they had woodstock welcome to cornstalk 
the singer kwown for such hits as i walk the line and a boy 
named sue told the mass of fans many sitting in lawn chairs and 
sporting caps emblazoned with feed company logos 
mike kampsen 33 organized the concert in part to please his 
father herman a longtime cash fan who sings with a local band 
called country cruisin 
the elder kampsen a 65yearold farmer got to sing a couple of

jim bakker created the celebrityfilled 
world he had always wanted at the ptl ministry but lost it by 
surrounding himself with advisers who fed his need to be the star of 
the show a new book says 
bakker who was driven from the nowdefunct ptl ministry more 
than two years ago in the midst of a sexandmoney scandal goes on 
trial monday on federal fraud and conspiracy charges jury selection 
begins monday opening arguments are expected a week later 
the rev jerry falwell another television evangelist took over 
the ptl ministry in march 1987 as a caretaker under an agreement 
with bakker but falwell put the ministry under bankruptcy 
protection three months later after uncovering a spreading web of 
alleged financial irregularities and millions of dollars in unpaid 
bills 
bakker survived at ptl by creating a universe where right and 
wrong were relative he wrote the rules and if he needed to break 
one he found reason to rewrite or ignore it charles shepard a 
charlotte observer reporter writes in his new book falwell 
brought to ptl a set of absolute standards a crucible bakker could 
not survive 
shepards coverage of ptl from 1984 to 1987 led to bakkers 
resignation and a pulitzer prize for the newspaper his book 
forgiven the rise and fall of jim bakker and the ptl ministry 
is scheduled to be published by atlantic monthly press in 
midseptember 
the book portrays bakker as a boyish charmer whose classmates in 
his hometown of muskegon mich believed was destined for a career 
in show business 
he enrolled in bible school in minneapolis but dropped out after 
less than two years when he married his wife tammy and decided to 
become a traveling evangelist 
a chance to do a christian childrens television show led the 
bakkers to pat robertsons fledgling christian broadcasting network 
and eventually to charlotte in 1974 where bakker used his gift 
for fundraising to turn a failing television station and a 
storefront studio into a satellite network and the heritage usa 
theme park in neary fort mill sc 
as ptl grew bakker surrounded himself with aides willing to tell 
him what he wanted to hear ministry insiders told shepard 
executives who worried about bakkers spontaneous oncamera 
decisions to finance projects or questioned the funding for giant 
building projects at heritage usa suddenly found themselves out of 
favor if not out of a job 
contractors for the water park at heritage usa ran into the ptl 
philosophy when they asked why the ministry hadnt done a study to 
determine what size the park should be and how much admission to 
charge 
they were told not to press the subject bakker got his 
inspiration from god and that was sufficient cause for ptl to move 
ahead shephard wrote ptl seemed confident that the audience 
for bakkers tv program the stream of visitors to heritage usa and 
the lifetime partners would generate the necessary traffic 
lifetime partners were investors in the park 
two of bakkers former aides brothers james and david taggart 
have been convicted of evading taxes on 11 million in ministry 
funds they diverted to their own uses including cartier jewelry 
designer clothes and a manhattan apartment scheduled for sentencing 
friday they each face maximum terms of 25 years in prison and 1 
million in fines 
richard m dortch bakkers top assistant at ptl pleaded guilty 
earlier this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud he has 
agreed to testify against his former boss as part of a plea bargain 
said bill diehl dortchs attorney 
the taggarts will consider testifying against bakker said their 
attorney ben cotten 
the book details some of the transactions that form the basis of 
the charges saying bakker and dortch arranged bonuses for 
themselves to cover such personal expenses as the bakkers three 
homes 
prosecutors allege that bakker pocketed some of the 158 million 
that poured into ptl from 1984 to 1987 under various lifetime 
partnership programs in eight of the 11 programs contributors 
were promised free lodging at heritage usa in exchange for a 
onetime donation of 1000 or more 
instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other 
facilities at heritage usa to serve the partners the indictment 
said the ptl executives spent more than 4 million on themselves 
and used some of it for operating expenses 
jim and tammy bakker got nearly 35 million in bonuses from 1984 
through 1987 and dortch got 550000 in bonuses while withholding 
informaton about ptls worsening financial problems from its board 
of directors the indictment charged mrs bakker was not charged 
bakker who was listed among those interviewed for the book has 
denied the charges against him but has declined to speak further 
with reporters 
bakker resigned in march 1987 after being informed by the 
charlotte observer that the newspaper was ready to publish a story 
of a sexual liaison between former new york church secretary jessica 
hahn and bakker in florida in 1980

chinas defense minister appeared on national 
television saturday despite reports that he was arrested in a power 
struggle with the president yang shangkun 
senior leader deng xiaoping has been reported to be ill with 
cancer and chinese sources say his poor condition has touched off a 
power struggle between defense minister qin jiwei and yang deng 
turns 85 on tuesday 
the sources had said troops loyal to yang led qin from his 
beijing home on wednesday after the two argued about which of them 
should be promoted to first vice chairman of the powerful central 
military commission 
some sources said qin had been placed under house arrest but the 
television appearance seemed to rule that out 
the position of first vice chairman was held by former communist 
party chief zhao ziyang until he was stripped of all power in june 
during a purge resulting from the prodemocracy protests 
yang led the crackdown that crushed the protests while qin was 
believed to oppose it 
qin 75 was shown briefly saturday in a news report on the 
funeral of fu zhong a legislator and former colonelgeneral the 
report did not identify him by name but a later report by the 
official xinhua news agency listed him among the top officials 
attending 
some chinese sources say yang 81 and qin are jockeying for 
control of the army the first vice chairman of the military 
commission ranks second only to deng who is chairman 
yang now holds the separate lower posts of permanent vice 
president and secretary general of the commission 
qin has been defense minister since april 1988 however the 
military commission rather than the defense ministry long has been 
the real decisionmaker in military affairs 
a western diplomat said however the struggle goes even deeper 
the general consensus here is that its the top post dengs 
position that is at stake he said on condition of anonymity 
the defense ministry denied to foreign reporters friday that qin 
was arrested or ousted as defense minister however it did not 
specifically deny he was detained by troops on yangs orders 
a source in hong kong said yang met friday with top military 
commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice chairman but 
that the commanders did not express support 
the source said dengs health is deteriorating rapidly military 
commanders who visited him this week found he could not speak the 
source said he said his information came from the wife of one 
commander and secretary of another 
the western diplomat said regional military commanders were 
opposing yangs moves because of his extensive family connections in 
the military 
yang belongs to one of the strongest military families in china 
his younger brother yang baibing is director of the armys general 
political department his soninlaw chi haotian runs the 
headquarters of the armys general staff 
but the chinese source in hong kong said yang had obtained the 
support of some elderly retired conservatives and vice president 
wang zhen 
in another development saturday a source at the australian 
embassy said it had sheltered for more than two months a folk singer 
who was active in the prodemocracy movement 
the singer 33yearold hou dejian returned to his home in 
beijing on wednesday and official television showed him chatting 
with reporters the next day about the military assault on beijing 
prodemocracy protesters on june 34 
hou who helped negotiate safe passage of protesters out of 
tiananmen square gave the official version of the crackdown in his 
comments 
i didnt see that anyone was shot there was no such thing as 
tanks crushing people he said 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people were killed when 
government troops pushed toward the square to sweep out protesters 
the australian embassy source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said hou appoved of the conditions of his release to 
chinese authorities 
the source suggested chinese authorities leaned on him to 
make his statements on television

the state department confirmed saturday it has 
rejected a visa request from a top cuban pianist and his band to 
play at a latin arts festival in new york a decision termed 
shortsighted outdated and whimsical by the shows producer 
the pianist gonzalo rubalcaba and his band grupo proyecto 
were scheduled to appear with jazz great dizzy gillespie in an 
openair concert in central park on monday a free event which 
traditionally highlights the annual festival latino 
gillespie has called rubalcaba the greatest pianist ive heard 
in the last 10 years and had sought him for the new york show 
however the state department turned down the visa request under 
terms of a 1985 proclamation by thenpresident reagan which found 
unrestricted entry of cuban government employees to be detrimental 
to the interests of the united states according to spokeswoman 
sondra mccarty 
almost all cuban artists are paid by their government 
new york producer joseph papp whose public threatre organizes 
the latin arts festival called the departments decision 
shortsighted outdated and whimsical it is counterproductive 
and ends up as an attack against artists whose presence poses no 
threat to national security 
papp noted that three cuban filmmakers were granted visas to 
participate in the same festival in a letter to assistant secretary 
of state bernard aronson he wrote when you seem to have no 
problem granting visas to three cuban fimmakers and deny eight 
musicians entry the rationale seems strained 
ms mccarty could not explain the apparent discrepancy in the way 
the requests were handled other than to say waivers are 
occasionally granted however we determined that waivers were not 
appropriate in the case of grupo proyecto 
rubalcaba and gillespie met when the trumpeter played at cubas 
jazz plaza festival in 1985 the american jazz artist invited the 
pianist to perform with him in the film a night in havana which 
documented gillespies visit to cuba

while the bush administration is reacting with 
caution to polands decision to form a noncommunist government 
efforts are ongoing to provide its faltering economy with nearly 1 
billion of relief 
the state department doesnt dance in the streets im sorry 
said department spokesman richard boucher reflecting the restrained 
official us reaction to a week of momentous events 
despite the nomination saturday of solidarity trade union 
activist tadeuz mazowiecki to be polands first noncommunist prime 
minister in more than four decades us officials said warsaw 
should expect no further increases in direct us aid 
we will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as 
appropriate and as we can presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters at the summer white house in kennebunkport 
maine 
behind the austere facade however the united states is pushing 
a multinational effort to provide poland with nearly 1 billion in 
extra cash this year by pressuring western banks and governments to 
reschedule the 39 billion debt it owes 
the multilateral steps also include world bank decisions with 
us impetus to move forward with two economically viable project 
loans one on industrial development and one on agricultural 
development which total 325 million said boucher 
that effort doesnt begin to approach the 10 billion in western 
help that solidarity chairman lech walesa sought in a meeting with 
president bush last month in poland but it is a start 
bush told walesa then that he could provide only 119 million in 
direct us aid capitol hill sources this week predicted congress 
will approve the 119 million but is unlikely to increase it 
the fact is that bilateral aid is not what the poles need it 
is splashy and cheers them on but they really need multilateral 
aid help on their debt said an aide to rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the house ways and means committee 
rostenkowski has been one of the most ardent congressional 
advocates of helping poland and has advised bush to take the 
multilateral road 
there is a very real limit on the amount of aid that the united 
states can provide because of its own budget deficits said the 
rostenskowski aide who spoke on condition he not be further 
identified 
bushs 119 million aid package is tailored to accelerating the 
collapse of socialism in poland it earmarks 100 million over three 
years to create and run a polishamerican enterprise fund that will 
channel lowcost loans to poles trying to start capitalist 
enterprises 
the package also includes 16000 tons of food this year and an 
additional 50 million worth in 1990 as well as 15 million to 
clean up air and water pollution in krakow the ancient polish 
capital 
while the united states maintains that its own financial problems 
preclude additional help for poland political considerations also 
are behind the restrained reaction to the events there this week 
its too early at this point to know how they polands 
leaders are going to make it work let alone how it will work 
said fitzwater 
us conservatives were uncomfortable with walesas assurances to 
moscow that communists will retain sensitive cabinet posts 
controlling the armed forces and the police under the solidarityled 
government and the poland will not leave the sovietled warsaw pact 
military alliance 
key among them is sen jesse helms of north carolina who as the 
ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee has 
the potential power to hamper any aid package 
helms opposes spending more money on poland until it breaks with 
the warsaw pact or dismantles its communist system said an aide to 
him 
a great deal of glasnost as far as the soviet union is 
concerned is for the west to subsidize the failure of the communist 
system said the aide tom boney we certainly want to wait 
until there has been a divorce from communism before we commit us 
taxpayer dollars

a former police officer who forced a woman to 
perform a sex act by threatening to have her put in jail was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison 
state district judge norman lanford gave the maximum term friday 
to frederick hoy abbott 42 for violating the civil rights of a 
27yearold widow he stopped on a highway last year on a possible 
drinking offense 
the sentenced followed widespread public outcry this month when 
another former officer was initially given probation in a similar 
incident 
abbott planned to appeal 
lanford said a probationary sentence would have infuriated some 
people while a prison term likely would anger others 
politically theres no right solution lanford said im 
going to do what a judge is paid to do 
earlier this month another former houston officer james cebula 
29 was granted 10year probation by a jury that convicted him of 
raping an intoxicated woman he purportedly had arrested 
the probation was widely criticized and state district judge 
lupe salinas subsequently imposed a lengthy list of probationary 
conditions including a 120day jail stay 
character witnesses and abbotts lawyer william mcquillen had 
asked lanford not to imprison abbott mcquillen said abbotts bad 
side had been exorcised when he was fired over the case 
abbott stopped the victim at 230 am on feb 9 1988 soon 
after she left a bar 
the woman testified abbott told her she would be taken to jail 
where she would risk being abused by lesbian prisoners she said 
abbott asked her what she might be willing to do to avoid arrest 
when she asked if he was soliciting money abbott named the 
specific sex act she could perform to avert a trip to jail 
he kept harping on her prosecutor don smyth said he kept 
driving around and telling her youre going to go to jail there 
are a lot of mean women there 
smyth said the woman began submitting but balked again when 
abbott began undressing smyth said abbott then forced her to comply

the pentagon is quietly moving ahead with a 
plan to wean bureaucrats battleships and bombers from unwieldy 
stacks of printed paperwork and convert them to compact 
costeffective computer disks 
the effort comes in response to a weighty problem a modern navy 
warship carries 15 to 25 tons of operating maintenance and repair 
manuals the b1b bomber has generated 1 million pages of howto 
documentation 
the pentagon says the campaign could reduce the lifetime cost of 
major weapons by up to 20 percent by converting masses of printed 
technical information into computerized databases 
the cost for technical data delivered with military hardware 
ranges from 10 percent to 30 percent of the total weapon system 
price tag add to that the millions of dollars that must be spent 
year after year to keep the manuals up to date 
to spearhead the conversion of printed data to electronic form 
the defense department in september 1985 launched a program called 
computeraided acquisition and logistics support or cals 
bruce lepisto deputy director of the pentagons cals policy 
office said each of the military services has selected particular 
weapons to lead the way in carrying out the computerization effort 
for the air force he said these lead systems are the advanced 
tactical fighter and the b2 stealth bomber for the navy the a12 
attack aircraft and ssn21 seawolf class attack submarine and for 
the army the lhx helicopter and m1a2 tank 
lepisto acknowledged that there had been some problem weaning 
military personnel as well as defense contractors from reliance on 
traditional paper documents 
were talking about a major cultural change here he said 
some people are overly anxious and want to rush in and some 
people feel that better is the enemy of good enough what were 
implementing is a new way of doing business and certainly there are 
going to be people that want to go either faster or slower 
paul n pechersky cochairman of the cals industry steering 
group representing hundreds of defense contractors said were 
still in the very early stages this is a massive undertaking from 
my own personal perspective i think were doing very well 
the first several years have been devoted to trying to get our 
act together to decide what we want to do and how we want to do 
it and more importantly to try and get agreement on some of the 
early digital information exchange standards that have to be put 
in place he said 
pechersky corporate director of management information systems 
for esystems inc in dallas said the program is evolutionary 
not revolutionary well see various implementations of cals well 
into the year 2000 
the cals program involves development of standardized text and 
image formats so that electronic data can be readily exchanged 
between a wide variety of different computer systems within the 
military and at defense contractors 
the seybold report on publishing systems a publishing industry 
newsletter based in media pa has forecast that cals eventually 
will have a major impact spreading far beyond the defense industry 
peter dyson associate editor of the newsletter observed that 
the defense department handles so much printing and so much 
electronic information that they are the classic 800pound gorilla 
whatever they do sets a standard 
every aspect of the publishing industry is coming to grips with 
this electronic dissemination of information he said and 
theyre sort of mucking around not quite knowing how to do it 
because its still a difficult technology 
what the defense department has done is simply issued a fiat 
this is how you shall do it having said so theyre going to make 
it so large other chunks of the industry are going to go that way 
simply because the vendors of electronic systems will have already 
written the software to do it for dod dyson said

leona helmsley may consider herself the queen of 
hotels but shes discovered her sovereignty is not recognized in 
the court of law 
for six weeks prosecution witnesses at her trial on a 47count 
federal indictment have portrayed mrs helmsley as an abusive boss 
who evaded taxes by charging personal expenses to her business 
extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers and didnt pay her bills 
even her lawyer conceded she was demanding and abrasive 
mrs helmsley 69 who with her husband harry heads a 5 
billion real estate empire has said not a word publicly about the 
stories of greed and arrogance presented by the prosecution which 
rested its case tuesday after presenting 44 witnesses and thousands 
of pages of documents 
through it all mrs helmsley has done her best to remain remote 
and regal her head held high she listened occasionally jotted 
notes and whispered comments to her lawyers 
though always fashionably dressed mrs helmsley has not flaunted 
her wealth she wore tailored suits and simple jewelry like a single 
strand of pearls and a gold wedding band 
welltrained in courtroom procedure she often was the first to 
rise when the jury entered the room she would look directly at the 
jurors and give them a friendly nod 
how or if mrs helmsleys courtroom demeanor will affect the 
jurors remains to be seen 
the jurors heard from contractors about their battles to get paid 
for renovation work at mrs helmsleys connecticut estate dunnellen 
hall 
she disputed many bills negotiated lesser payments and 
ultimately had much of the cost 31 million paid for by 
helmsleyowned businesses testimony has shown 
the jurors also will consider a document that claims she charged 
more than 320000 in personal purchases to the park lane hotel 
these charges ranged from 32 for insect repellent a 58 itty 
bitty book light and 60 in undergarments to nearly 3000 for 
cuff links and tens of thousands of dollars in designer clothing 
the jury also has heard three liquor vendors testify they were 
forced by mrs helmsleys top aide frank turco to pay hefty 
kickbacks to keep their accounts at helmsley hotels 
in testimony july 25 a former helmsley executive milton 
meckler said turco once held up several envelopes and said this 
is cash this is what mrs helmsley wants 
but the jurors wont hear mrs helmsleys version of events her 
lead lawyer gerald feffer says she will not take the stand her 
two codefendants turco and another former aide joseph licari 
also will not testify 
the defense will wrap up the trial next week with testimony from 
two audit experts who claim the helmsleys rather than evading 
681000 in taxes actually are owed refunds 
her lawyers say she overpaid taxes for 1983 1984 and 1985 
because she did not properly depreciate a taxshelter investment 
us district judge john m walker jr said friday that waiting 
until the trial was nearly over to make the claim smacks of a 
desperate need but it will be allowed 
a key part of the defense is that the helmsleys used dunnellen 
hall for business purposes 
harry helmsley 80 also was charged but was found incompetent to 
stand trial 
mrs helmsley has surrounded herself with lawyers and family 
members during breaks in testimony security employees escort her to 
and from her limousine at the beginning and end of each day 
she lunches in the courthouse cafeteria at the beginning of the 
trial she ate the cafeteria food but now is brought sandwiches from 
an outside deli 
while avoiding contact with reporters she sometimes stops to 
chat with the courtroom artists who draw scenes for television and 
newspaper reports 
ill kill myself if i look like that she once joked as she 
looked over an artists shoulder 
the judge imposed a gag order preventing lawyers and defendants 
from discussing the case with the media and mrs helmsley does not 
answer questions from reporters on any subject 
when an advertising company dropped the helmsley hotels account 
during the trial mrs helmsley was asked for comment she zipped 
her lips 
mrs helmsleys imperious armor has shown some cracks she became 
tearyeyed on several occasions when the death of her son from a 
previous marriage came up in testimony 
she joined in the laughter when internal revenue service agent 
john dennehy read from a document that she had charged a 21 yearly 
membership fee for a crossword puzzle club to one of her luxury 
hotels 
and once she gave a big smile of relief when the government 
rested

the united states is unable to enforce 
sanctions banning imports of gold and other products from 
stateowned enterprises in south africa because the state department 
has not identified the banned items congressional watchdogs said 
saturday 
without a list of specific products to work from the us 
customs service has been largely ineffective in enforcing the import 
ban passed by congress in 1986 the general accounting office said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who requested the gao study 
said it pointed to a shocking lapse by top reagan administration 
officials who failed to apply elementary enforcement procedures in 
carrying out the antiapartheid law 
the legislation which was approved over former president ronald 
reagans veto banned imports of a variety of goods from south 
africa including products of socalled parastatals entities owned 
or controlled by the south african government 
the state department issued a list of south african government 
agencies and stateowned corporations that it designated as 
parastatals but did not identify the products produced marketed or 
exported by them the gao said 
because products associated with parastatals have not been 
identified customs cannot use trade data which is kept on a 
productbyproduct basis to obtain leads on illegal imports from 
parastatals it added 
while direct us imports of south african gold ceased in 1987 
the bullion could still be entering the united states illegally by 
transshipment through britain and switzerland which market much of 
south africas gold according to the gao 
between january 1987 and march 1989 british exports of gold to 
the united states totaled 175 million and swiss gold exports to 
this country came to 164 million the watchdogs said 
because it was not widely known in customs that gold was under 
the parastatal sanction it could not use data on trade flows to 
obtain leads on illegal trade and could not identify possible 
transshipment of south african gold to the united states through 
third countries the report said 
as the result of its inquiry gao officials said the customs 
agency is now investigating whether some gold from switzerland and 
the united kingdom is of south african origin and is entering the 
united states illegally

nonviolent social change neigher he nor his mother responded to 
repeated requests for interviews 
the king centers directors emerged from a sixhour meeting 
wednesday with a new job for king but they have not announced what 
it is king has given no indication whether he will accept the job 
the directors have said the centers presidency will remain 
vacant and they consider the matter basically resolved 
as the southern christian leadership conference convened here 
last week there were several who identified with dexter kings 
position that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in a 
movement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control 
among them was us rep john lewis dga a leader in the 
student nonviolent coordinating committee during the 1960s lewis 
49 said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago 
the sitins and the freedom rides in sncc were also a revolt 
against the old leadership he said what made it different in 
that period was we had been provided a role and a place at the 
table 
you cannot take the dream to participate put it in a 
bottle and put a cap on it we should open the doors make young 
people feel welcome 
one thing about martin luther king jr he welcomed the 
involvement of young people lewis said he praised the vigor 
they could bring to a struggle 
civil rights leaders many of whom have acted as surrogate 
fathers to kings children said they are concerned about dexter 
kings welfare 
i do plan to talk to him said sclc president joseph lowery 
a member of the king centers board of directors and a longtime king 
family friend i think some mistakes were made on both sides 
i think hes amenable to working it out he loves the center 
and im sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the center 
does 
but another king aide hosea williams said he aint going 
back in there williams said king left because the centers 
leaders by giving him the role of presidentintraining showed 
they were unwilling to give him power to change things 
they killed the boys spirit he sees now how costly it is how 
tough it is to be a true leader williams said 
they talking about training what kind of training does he 
need williams asked old age is the inability to accept change 
and that is just the problem that dexter ran into 
the rev tony minor 30 could readily identify with what dexter 
king experienced 
minor the sclcs youngest chapter president pulled together a 
conference chapter in cleveland ohio that after eight months has 
150 members mostly people under 35 
a graduate of martin luther kings alma mater morehouse college 
minor spent five years as an aide for lowery and atlanta mayor 
andrew young learning how to move his ministry into the community 
and listening to stories about the movement days 
minor said the sclc has made room at the top for youth before 
and he doesnt mind waiting for his day in the sun 
the challenge is for younger leaders to respect and support 
veterans who have been around he said those veterans should 
in turn adopt the young leaders teach them support them 
but williams said young leaders must not back up or submit to 
old leaders like me 
theyve just got to come up and push old leaders on out of the 
way he said old leaders must realize we should voluntarily 
allow the young leaders to take over and meet todays challenge 
if we dont do that then what we have suffered for will 
perish

police used whips and dogs to 
disperse hundreds of blacks including archbishop desmond tutu 
during mass protests saturday at two whitesonly beaches 
tutu was carried shoulderhigh onto the first beach targeted by 
the demonstrators and later appealed to protesters at the other 
beach to leave when he saw them being beaten with whips by police 
we have proved these are gods beaches he said 
the black sash civil rights group said several protesters 
sustained open wounds from the whips the group said its monitors at 
the second beach watched with horror as officers charged 
families eating picnic lunches and used a helicopter to blow sand on 
them 
about 15 journalists covering the first protest at the strand 
beach east of cape town were detained for two hours 
nearer to the city a black constable was killed by a group of 
youths police said 
according to reports that local newspapers received from a human 
rights lawyer four black civilians also were injured and about 35 
people arrested in clashes that broke out when protesters were 
stopped from boarding buses to the beach those reports could not be 
confirmed 
learning that the strand had been sealed off with roadblocks 
several hundred blacks went to bloubergstrand a segregated beach 
just north of cape town 
tutu who had strolled along the strand beach before he and 
fellow demonstrators were dispersed arrived at bloubergstrand to 
see police whipping protesters 
tutu climbed onto the back of a pickup truck and successfully 
persuaded the protesters to withdrew 
john allen tutus press aide said some white onlookers yelled 
insults at the archbishop 
police also arrested at least 25 antiapartheid demonstrators in 
durban and johannesburg and banned a major rally that had been 
called for sunday in johannesburg to declare that outlawed 
opposition groups were back in operation 
police commissioner hennie de witt warned organizers of the 
escalating nationwide campaign of defiance that lawlessness and 
anarchy will not be tolerated 
leaders of the campaign announced several days ago that blacks 
would have a picnic saturday on the segregated white beach at the 
strand 
late friday police and soldiers cordoned off a threemile 
stretch of whitesonly beachfront and erected signs saying the beach 
was closed because of a police dogtraining exercise roadblocks 
were erected and some blacks arriving in buses to join the protest 
were turned back 
but tutu and about 300 other protesters reached the beach area 
and the archbishop was carried onto the sand on the shoulders of 
some of the crowd before they were dispersed by police equipped with 
whips and guard dogs 
some of the group then went to a neighboring town gordons bay 
where tutu leader of south africas anglican church held an 
impromptu news conference 
it is incredible that the government is prepared to use arms on 
people who wish to have a picnic he said instead of getting 
rid of beach apartheid they protect it with policemen dogs and 
guns 
the detained journalists many of them representing us and 
british news organizations were allowed to go free after film and 
videotapes were confiscated police said the journalists had failed 
to obey an order to leave the area 
in the port city of durban 16 activists were arrested as they 
stood outside a beachfront hotel protesting the presence of an 
international allstar rugby team the teams fivematch tour to 
south africa has been approved by international rugby officials but 
militants have depicted the visit as a breach of the sports boycott 
imposed to protest apartheid 
police said nine people were arrested in downtown johannesburg 
after scores of blacks chanted in the streets during a protest 
against the arrest friday of antiapartheid activist mohammed valli 
moosa several demonstrators carried placards with the initials of 
the united democratic front which was banned last year 
organizers of the defiance campaign had planned several rallies 
on sunday to proclaim that the antiapartheid coalition had 
unbanned itself one rally has been banned and similar action 
was expected against the others 
the campaign began aug 3 when blacks sought treatment at white 
hospitals and has spread as the sept 6 parliamentary elections 
approach the state radio saturday said police must respond 
imaginatively in order to counter civil disobedience without 
triggering violence

the proiranian group hezbollah on 
saturday accused the united states france and pope john paul ii of 
favoring lebanese christians over moslems and hinted that new 
attacks may be mounted on us targets 
druse warlord walid jumblatt syrias main lebanese ally ordered 
a general mobilization in his 200000member druse community to 
prepare for a major battle against the christians moslem sources 
said 
police said two people were killed and nine wounded in clashes 
between syrian troops and christian forces along beiruts 
christianmoslem dividing line and three other fronts in the central 
lebanese mountains and in north lebanon 
the new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and 
2118 wounded since fighting broke out march 8 between gen michel 
aouns mainly christian army units and syrian troops backed by 
jumblatts progressive socialist party 
spradic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since the 
un security council appealed tuesday for a ceasefire 
in its statement published by beirut newspapers hezbollah or 
party of god accused france washington and the pope of favoring 
lebanese christians in the 14yearold civil war with moslems 
the french naval buildup in the mediterranean the popes 
fanatic and biased stands and americas moves at the un 
security council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming 
the moslems it said 
this campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the 
crusaders invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of 
martyrdom that forced the us marines and the french to retreat 
in 1983 it said 
that was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks on 
oct 23 1983 against the us marine base and the headquarters of 
french paratroopers in beirut the bombings killed 241 american 
servicemen and 58 french soldiers and led to withdrawal of an 
international peace force 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for underground 
extremists holding 16 foreign hostages including eight americans 
in lebanon the longestheld is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in a separate interview with the central news agency newsletter 
an unidentified hezbollah official was quoted as saying israel 
should immediately release an influential moslem shiite cleric 
abducted by israeli commandos last month the kidnapping prompted 
one group to announce it had killed an american hostage marine lt 
col william higgins in retaliation 
france dispatched the aircraft carrier foch the destroyer 
cassard and the destroyer duquesne to the mediterranean in recent 
days while its envoy alain decaux discussed the crisis with 
lebanese officials 
aoun who serves as army commander and leader of a christian 
cabinet was quoted saturday as saying he would like to see french 
forces get involved 
i would like a french military intervention but i dont want 
to compromise france with a lebanese request up until now we have 
exhausted much of our human and material resources and we need help 
to continue the resistance aoun was quoted in an interview in the 
paris weekly journal du dimanche 
aouns 20000 troops are outnumbered by syrians 40000 soldiers 
and its allies the syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
french officials say the movement of their forces in the 
mediterranean was designed to help evacuate the estimated 7000 
french citizens if necessary they say paris has no intention of 
intervening militarily 
one source close to the jumblatts group said his militias 
military police toured a druse enclave in the chouf mountains in 
recent days instructing all physically fit men aged 1640 to 
report to party offices the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
jumblatt also has been critical of the french naval buildup he 
said at a news conference saturday france still supports the 
maronites 
he was referring to paris strong links to the christians before 
lebanons independence in 1943 
if they insist on intervening then let the whole of lebanon 
and the whole of the middle eest go up in flames he said 
the pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in lebanon 
and last week said he felt an imperative to visit the country

president hashemi rafsanjani defied half 
the lawmakers in parliament on saturday by nominating a cabinet that 
would remove his hardline rivals from power and replace them with 
allies 
the attempt to oust rivals who probably would oppose his 
political and economic policies raised criticism in parliament 
which must approve all 22 ministers in the new cabinet individually 
rafsanjani is viewed as a pragmatist seeking more private 
investment and links with the west to obtain the technology and 
financing to rebuild the economy shattered by eight years of war 
with iraq 
three major hardliners not included in the new cabinet are ali 
akbar mohtashemi the interior minister hussein musavi the prime 
minister and mohammad reyshahri the minister of intelligence 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati oil minister gholemreza 
aqazadeh and minister of islamic guidance mohammad khatami will all 
keep their posts the official islamic republic news agency said in 
a reported monitored in nicosia 
mohtashemi is a middleranking cleric who was appointed interior 
minister in october 1985 after serving as ambassador to syria from 
1981 he is considered the head of the hardline faction in iran 
earlier saturday the tehran times a governmentsupervised 
newspaper close to rafsanjani said mohtashemi would be ousted 
prompting 138 deputies in the 270seat majlis or parliament to 
sign a petition demanding he be kept on 
in the petition the deputies acknowledged the men were rivals 
but said the presence of powerful personalities in the future 
cabinet is inevitable 
the deputies urged rafsanjani to appoint mohtashemi noting the 
sensitivity of the arrogant world the united states to the 
issue 
the petition was read in parliament saturday and carried by 
iranian news agency 
rafsanjani warned during his inauguration speech thursday that a 
fight was brewing over his appointments but said he wanted to 
eliminate political infighting to concentrate on overhauling the 
economy and feeding irans poor 
the new president was elected in a landslide july 28 
the mujahedeen khalq the main iranian opposition group said in 
a telex to the associated press that saturdays parliamentary 
session was chaotic 
the baghdadbased group said rafsanjani rushed the nominations to 
parliament when he heard the petition was being written 
rafsanjani a middleranking cleric emerged as irans strongman 
after the june 3 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini architect of 
the 1979 islamic revolution rafsanjanis ideological rivals support 
a centralized economy and believe confronting the west feeds the 
revolutions islamic fervor 
mohtashemi and his allies have spearheaded efforts to export the 
revolution through extremist groups such as hezbollah or party of 
god in lebanon 
the strength of rafsanjanis government especially its ability 
to rebuff the hardline faction ultimately will decide the shape 
and speed of new economic and foreign policy initiatives the fight 
will determine whether iran will sign a peace treaty with iraq and 
pressure proiranian groups in lebanon to release 16 western 
hostages including eight americans 
the key position in the battle the interior minister controls 
irans police forces its revolutionary committees which enforce 
islamic laws and irans 24 provincial governors many of them his 
appointees 
rafsanjani would replace mohtashemi with abdullah nouri a 
leading figure in irans revolutionary guards the most fervent 
branch of the military 
nouri is a majlis deputy for the central city of isfahan and 
chairman of the planning and budget committee he was khomeinis 
representative with the revolutionary guards with powers to appoint 
and dismiss its commanders 
also a middleranking cleric he was named by khomeini in april 
1989 to the committee that amended the 1979 constitution 
reyshahri the intelligence minister will be succeeded by his 
deputy middleranking cleric ali fallahian the iranian news agency 
said 
fallahian has been a key official in the security apparatus 
particularly in the campaign against the mujahedeen khalq 
both nominees are considered rafsanjani allies 
constitutional changes approved by the voters july 28 eliminated 
the post of prime minister concentrating executive power in the 
presidency

clothes with cameras around their necks pulled out guns and opened 
fire

end its strike despite having achieved few gains the committee is 
composed of palestinian lawyers but it has four israeli members 
i think we have achieved nothing said committee member ahmad 
sayad 
commitee leader bahij tamami said our purpose was to protest 
and tell the word that there is no justice in israeli courts 
he said the committee had demanded the army promptly report 
arrests or detentions to families translate charge sheets from 
hebrew to arabic and provide better treatment of prisoners the 
lawyers committee also held a twomonth strike beginning in january 
and said it produced few results 
during the strikes palestinians either represented themselves or 
sought the counsel of the few lawyers who are not members of the 
committee 
many major cases were delayed until the end of the strike 
the army says 9136 palestinians are currently in israeli jails 
for uprisingrelated offenses

president bush said saturday the 
united states is prepared to coordinate as expeditiously as 
possible the extradition of suspected colombian drug dealers after 
the assassination friday of a leading colombian presidential 
candidate near bogota 
we in the united states should not forget that others are 
paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the 
international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the 
lives of lawabiding citizens bush said in a statement issued 
from kennebunkport where he is vacationing 
colombias president virgilio barco said friday night he was 
reinstating under stateofemergency powers an extradition treaty 
between the united states and his country that was voided on a 
technicality in april 1988 by the colombian supreme court 
barco announced the measure after sen luis carlos galan a 
leading candidate to succeed barco as colombias president was shot 
just before he was scheduled to give a campaign speech in soacha 
about 20 miles south of bogota 
at least 10 others were wounded in the shotgun attack which 
police blamed on drug lords hours earlier a provincial police 
chief who had led a campaign against drug lords was shot by five 
gunmen less than 200 yards from his home 
in washington the state department issued a statement saying the 
united states is appalled by what it called the latest round of 
vicious attacks by the colombian drug cartels against innocent 
colombians 
these brazen attacks against colombian judges law enforcement 
officials and politicians dramatically demonstrate that unwavering 
international cooperation is essential if we are to win the war 
against the narcotics mafias the statement said 
bush called barcos reinstatement of the extradition treaty a 
courageous move and said he welcomed it in the fight against 
narcotraffickers 
the us is ready to coordinate the extradition of these 
criminals as expeditiously as possible bush said i have 
instructed the departments of state and justice to begin working on 
this immediately 
bush also said he is considering alternative ways to do more 
for the andean countries in the national drug strategy he is 
scheduled to announce on sept 5 
i am ready to meet with president barco at the earliest 
convenient moment to consider a coordinated approach to this 
problem he said colombia must know that we stand by its 
efforts to move aggressively against these criminals who seek to 
destroy both our societies 
bush did not specify the alternatives under consideration for 
helping colombia but his national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said they include providing some help to shore up their efforts 
against really what are private armies inside their country 
as you can see the whole of the colombian government is under 
attack now by the drug cartels scowcroft said in an interview on 
cnns evans and novak program

tens of thousands of people demonstrated in 
azerbaijan on saturday to demand that communist authorities free 
jailed members of an independent group and accept its political 
demands 
nazim ragimov a journalist and interpreter said 600000 
protesters jammed lenin square in baku the capital of azerbaijan 
province aidin amirbekov a member of the group the azerbijani 
peoples front said 200000 attended 
there were no immediate reports on the rally in staterun media 
ragimov speaking by telephone from baku a city of 17 million 
on the caspian sea said peoples front officials reported to the 
crowd on talks they held with azerbaijans communist party chief 
abdulrakhman vezirov 
ragimov quoted the groups leaders as saying vezirov only 
accepted one of the peoples front demands during talks that ended 
friday 
the journalist said the party chief agreed to back efforts to 
disband a special committee created by moscow in february to 
administer nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian region of azerbaijan 
the dispute over nagornokarabakh has inflamed relations between 
armenia and azerbaijan which has controlled the district since 1923 
the peoples front claims that far from being neutral 
moscowbased authorities are proarmenian and that the committee 
they created has led to a loss of azerbaijani sovereignty 
peoples front leaders said vezirov rejected their other demands 
including annulment of the results of this springs legislative 
elections and the freeing of peoples front militants such as naimat 
panakhov and fuat agayev who were detained during mass political 
rallies in baku late last year 
ragimov said peoples front members and supporters will meet 
again sept 2 and declare a general strike if their demands have not 
been granted 
a protest strike called monday by the grassroots group over the 
same issues led to the walkout of about 1 percent of bakus 1 
million workers according to journalists at azerbaijans staterun

prime minister rajiv gandhi said saturday 
that india must play a bigger role in world affairs with the 
superpowers shifting from cold war politics to more dialogue 
in an interview with the associated press and united news of 
india gandhi also said he feared a hasty withdrawal of indian 
peacekeeping troops from sri lanka could lead to partition of the 
island between the sinhalese majority and tamil minority 
he said he expected his own national elections due no later than 
january to be held more or less on schedule while he declined 
to be more specific he indicated early elections were unlikely 
i feel india must play a bigger role and will play a bigger 
role and the global equations are changing people are coming out 
of their old mindsets the indian leader said during the interview 
thats where countries like india can play a much bigger role 
like we have done in the nonaligned movement like we have done 
in disarmament really bringing the opposition poles together 
getting nations to think more in terms of one world not our bloc 
and their bloc 
gandhi has maintained his countrys strong ties with the soviet 
union that date back to the days of his grandfather jawaharlal 
nehru indias first prime minister and his mother and predecessor 
prime minister indira gandhi but he also has broadened ties with 
the united states especially in trade and technology 
india is the worlds secondmost populous nation with 880 million 
people china has 12 billion people 
during the interview gandhi said the withdrawal of the 40000 
indian soldiers from sri lanka still was under discussion with the 
colombo government which has demanded a speedy pullout 
whats worrying us is that if we come back without something 
else taking our place and things get out of control it will lead to 
the division of sri lanka he said 
he said india has asked sri lanka whose armed forces barely 
total 40000 how it proposes to deal with security after an indian 
withdrawal just moving out and leaving a vacuum is not really a 
solution he said 
india spurred by the sympathies of its own tamil minority for 
tamil secessionists in sri lanka sponsored a 1987 peace accord to 
end a separatist revolt in the north and east of the small indian 
ocean island 
the largest tamil rebel group rejected the plan and indian 
soldiers sent to enforce it were soon bogged down in a guerrilla war 
against the same tamil militants india once supported 
gandhi who turns 45 on sunday looked relaxed and confident 
during the interview as he sat in the private cabin of the indian 
air force boeing 737 that carried him and his entourage on a twoday 
tour of south india 
the trip which was a campaign tour in everything but name was 
taking him across karnataka and andhra pradesh states to make 13 
speeches in 28 hours 
during the interview he repeatedly blasted the political 
opposition especially the fractious alliance called the janata dal 
or national front its president viswanath pratap singh was once 
gandhis finance minister and later his defense minister 
in jampacked sports stadiums gandhi told crowds that the 
opposition sought to divide the country along lines of religion and 
caste and oppress women and poor people 
in the interview gandhi predicted his party would do very 
well in the upcoming national elections but he would not estimate 
how many seats it would win 
his victory in december 1984 gave his party an unprecendented 415 
of the 544 seats in the policysetting lower house of parliament 
a poll published in the aug 31 issue of india today a respected 
national news magazine projected congress would win 314 seats in 
the next elections

a woman who was hit in the arm by a stray 
bullet while dining in a 31stfloor apartment says shes uneasy the 
police havent got a clue to where the shot came from 
i understand the police are terribly busy and theres a lot of 
crime going on gail downward said last week but someone out 
there has a gun that they are shooting randomly 
ms downward was eating in a friends topfloor apartment on chic 
rittenhouse square on aug 3 when she was hit 
i had just taken a bite of grilled tuna when i heard a crack 
she said i had the fork in my hand and when i tried to put it 
back on the plate i realized my arm was not working properly 
i looked down and saw a hole in my forearm about the size of a 
dime she said there was no blood just a hole i felt like i 
was part of a salvador dali painting 
police said the bullet went through a screen a window and a 
venetian blind before it struck ms downward in the right forearm 
it was traveling on a level trajectory which perplexes 
investigators because there arent any buildings nearby where a 
gunman could have fired a level shot into the window 
we have no idea where this bullet came from said capt 
richard kirchner if you look out the only thing in that area 
thats really tall is the arco burnoff tower two miles away 
there werent any shooting reports that coincided with the 
incident kirchner said 
ms downward said police initially thought the bullet came from a 
highpowered rifle but later said it may have from another kind of 
gun doctors havent removed the slug for fear of causing more 
damage to her arm 
if the doctors ever decide to remove the bullet we can run 
ballistics on it kirchner said then one day a gun could turn 
up and we could match it

hundreds of east germans escaped into 
austria from hungary on saturday by storming a border gate that had 
been opened for a picnic celebrating european unity officials said

and as hungarian border guards were preparing to stamp the papers of 
participants in the event the austrian press agency 
police said only that hundreds of east germans who were not 
supposed to participate in the event pushed through the gate that is 
normally closed 
the press agency said up to 300 east germans pushed through 
initially and a total of 500 crossed into austria during the day 
while the gate remained open 
in budapest the hungarian interior ministry said the border 
guards could only have stopped the east germans from crossing by 
using weapons said the state news agency mti however they 
decided not to use weapons or force mti said in a brief dispatch 
the event called for participants to cross the border into 
austria return with austrian guests and then picnic in a formerly 
restricted hungarian zone the restrictions were lifted aug 1 
the event was sponsored by hungarys foremost communist reformer 
imre pozsgay and otto von hapsburg a west german member of the 
european parliament and onetime heir to the former austrohungarian 
monarchy he is a leader of the austrian branch of the paneuropa 
movement a private group promoting european unity

may began dismantling the barbed wire fencing and electrical warning 
devices on its border with austria 
at least 1600 east germans are estimated to have crossed 
illegally into austria from hungary since then once in austria 
they seek documents from the west german embassy in vienna for 
travel to west germany 
according to west german law all east germans have a right to 
west german passports 
some refugees say they are seeking political freedom and others 
are fleeing poor economic conditions in their communist homeland 
west german diplomats have been issuing west german passports to 
east germans in budapest hungary and witnesses said many of the 
east germans who fled saturday already held west german passports 
about 300 east germans have sought refuge at west german 
diplomatic missions in east berlin budapest and prague 
czechoslovakia 
west germany closed its embassy and consulate in budapest on 
monday citing the inability of its diplomats to deal with the 
stream of east germans wanting to flee to the west and seeking 
asylum on west german diplomatic property 
the west german mission in east berlin was closed two weeks ago 
after 131 east germans seeking guarantees that they can go to west 
germany sought refuge there 
another 500 east germans are living in a tent city set up in 
budapest and opposition figures estimate that several hundred more 
have overstayed their visas and gone underground

heavy rain unleashed 
mudslides that buried a car temporarily trapped eight others and 
caused flooding that chased 55 tourists from their rented cabin 
park officials said saturday 
the mudslides took place about 8 pm friday on a stretch of road 
below slopes denuded by the huge forest fires that swept the park in 
the summer of 1988 
one car was buried but its occupants escaped uninjured said 
park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
eight vehicles were stranded for about 2 hours in gibbon canyon 
after 13 mudslides took place the spokeswoman said they were on a 
stretch of road 15 to 25 miles inside the park from the west 
entrance that was hit by mudslides earlier this month 
thunderstorms that dumped up to 4 inches of rain on the park sent 
water 3 feet deep through a cluster of cabins in the mammoth area 
near the north entrance forcing evacuation of 55 guests ms 
anzelmo said 
no one was injured in either incident 
workers expected to have the road cleared by sunday but 
considered keeping it closed to traffic as a precaution the

prisoners at the arkansas valley 
correctional facility cheered when a helicopter swooped over the 
prisons baseball diamond and plucked up two inmates 
since then the mediumsecurity prison has been buzzing with talk 
of the shortlived escape and surprise at the unlikely pair of 
inmates that tried it 
theyre talking about it just like the movies it was 
cool said inmate phillip d gonzales serving a life sentence 
for the murder of a denver police officer 
most of these guys are happy to see prison officials get 
beat theyre happy to see someone leave escape whatever it added 
a little drama 
cellmates ralph brown and freddie gonzales no relation to 
phillip sprinted and dove into the chopper when it came down into 
the prison yard friday morning there were few inmates in the yard 
at the time 
the men and their wives who authorities say had hijacked the 
helicopter later transferred to a van and drove as far as nebraska 
where they were captured friday evening in a shootout with police 
one fugitive was slightly wounded 
gonzales his wife patricia gonzales 41 brown and his wife 
rebecca 26 were being held saturday in nebraska ms gonzales was 
described as a onetime prison volunteer who met gonzales during the 
course of her service and married him by proxy 
prison superintendent jim brittain who watched the escape from 
the bulletproofglass window of his office said he was surprised 
brown and gonzales would have attempted it 
when i looked at their time and their crime i have a difficult 
time understanding whats going on said brittain he said he 
would expect that from a much more desperadotype of inmate the 
one guy brown was serving 12 years and the other guy gonzales 
four years 
the escapees were described as an unlikely duo a 21yearold 
with only one major crime on his record and a 30yearold with a 
dozen years of serious offenses 
gonzales had minor brushes with the law in fort morgan until an 
armed robbery last year sent him to ordway he would have been 
eligible for parole in two years 
in the robbery at a 7eleven store he panicked before he got the 
money and took only a sandwich authorities said while awaiting 
sentencing in morgan county jail he tried unsuccessfully to escape 
brown had been in and out of prison for a dozen years on 
convictions including sexual assault theft and forgery he also 
admitted to heavy cocaine use before being sent back to prison for a 
third time last year he would not have been eligible for parole 
until 1996 
despite the festive mood at the prison friday some inmates 
worried they will suffer from tighter security measures in the wake 
of the escape 
it was fun to hear and know it did happen but it is just 
going to make things tougher in the institution said phillip 
aversano serving 10 years for theft and walking away from a halfway 
house 
thats the way is usually works somebody screws up it makes 
it tougher for everyone

two colorado prison inmates and their 
wives captured in a shootout after the women hijacked a helicopter 
for a daring breakout will likely face charges in two states and 
federal courts officials said saturday 
investigators into fridays escape from the mediumsecurity 
arkansas valley correctional facility near ordway colo said one 
of the women involved met her husband while working as a prison 
volunteer and married him by proxy 
the escapees freddie gonzales 21 and ralph brown 30 and 
their wives patricia gonzales 41 and rebecca brown 26 
surrendered friday evening after a nineminute gun battle in this 
small southcentral nebraska town 400 miles from the prison 
this will be the talk of the town for a few days but then 
thingsll get back to normal said ford hubbard night manager of 
the dale hotel 
i couldnt believe it said hubbard who watched the gunfight 
and capture from the roof of his sixstory hotel it was like 
watching a tv movie i know that other people were watching from 
their windows too we havent had anything like this in town for 
years 
colorado department of corrections chief walter kautzky said the 
foursome likely will face federal charges of air piracy nebraska 
charges and then extradition proceedings for likely charges in 
colorado 
three of the four were being held in separate jails saturday 
brown underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the finger and was 
being held at good samaritan hospital in kearney 
authorities in colorado say the women comandeered the helicopter 
after hiring it from helicopter airways inc of denver the fbi says 
the helicopter pilot tim graves is not a suspect in the escape 
after the escape the four abandoned the 1969 bell 206a 
helicopter and transferred to the rented van graves who was tied 
up and left in a shed managed to cut himself free with a pocket 
knife and was found by searchers 
they pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10 
minutes and they said youre going to land in that prison 
graves said later 
graves said his biggest fear was that he would be shot by prison 
guards prison officials said friday that the guards held their fire 
during the escape in part because of fear for the pilots safety 
kautzky said ms gonzales worked as a volunteer at the arkansas 
valley prison in ordway and at the fremont correctional facility in 
canon city where she met her husband freddie before he was moved 
to ordway she was also working on a degree from regis college in 
denver he said 
under colorado law you can get married by proxy and thats 
apparently what they did he said 
he did not know when there were married or what her duties as a 
volunteer were the regis college switchboard operator says no one 
is available this weekend to provide information about students or 
confirm gonzales was enrolled 
gonzales father fred said his son married patricia three 
months ago 
the elder gonzales of fort morgan said ms gonzales visited his 
son every friday and saturday at the arkansas valley prison 
i hope they did catch him because i dont want him to get in 
any trouble god hes the only son ive got the father said as 
he watched news of his sons capture on television friday night 
holdrege police officers and phelps county sheriffs deputies 
fired on the van during the chase that covered roughly an 
eightsquare block area of this town of 5600 
the four were set to be arraigned monday although phelps county 
attorney glenn clark said saturday he is still pondering charges 
they federal and colorado charges he said would come only after 
were through with them in nebraska 
he added that he was strongly considering filing attempted murder 
charges for the shooting at police sgt tom rust who had bullets 
lodged in the air cleaner and the dashboard of his car 
that one in the dashboard was only inches from going all the 
way through and it would have gone all the way through rust 
clark said 
rust used his police car to ram the van twice that action is 
credited with slowing the vehicle moments before police chief ken 
jackson positioned near his pickup truck placed four shots through 
the windshield of the suspects van 
i think they were surprised to see me there said jackson a 
veteran of the lancaster county sheriffs department in lincoln 
jacksons ninemember force recently received approval for the 
purchase of two semiautomatic weapons we definitely could have 
ended this a lot sooner with one of those jackson said 
but people criticized my background in lincoln a city of 
200000 and said wed never need them in holdrege jackson said 
you know the old saying never say never he added with a 
grin 
gonzales was serving a fouryear sentence for robbery and would 
have been eligible for parole in september 1991 brown was sentenced 
for sexual assault theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check 
charge his parole eligibility date was october 1996

drug lords declared they would keep 
killing government officials following the assassination of leading 
presidential hopeful luis carlos galan tens of thousands of 
mourners on saturday flocked to galans coffin 
now the fight is with blood said the medellin cartel in a 
brief communique broadcast by the rcn radio network and printed by 
the bogota daily la prensa 
the cartel the worlds largest cocaine ring is believed 
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united 
states 
we do want peace we have screamed for it but we will not beg 
for it the statement said it was signed the extraditables a 
reference to the traffickers likely to be extradited to the united 
states 
the statement did not specifically claim responsibility for 
galans death but said the group would keep killing officials 
police blamed the drug lords who had offered a 500000 reward for 
his death and had tried to kill him aug 5 in medillin 
galan was shot and killed friday in soache 12 miles from bogota 
as he prepared to address 10000 people at a campaign rally 
in the attack by at least seven gunmen local councilman julio 
cesar penalosa was killed and at least six others wounded the 
gunmen escaped police said saturday they had detained three 
suspects but did not name them 
hours earlier drug lords shot and killed a provincial police 
chief franklin quintero 
responding to the killings president virgilio barco on friday 
announced a harsh crackdown he said in a nationwide television and 
radio address he would use his powers under the nations state of 
siege to reestablish a treaty with the united states to extradite 
suspected traffickers 
the state of emergency was declared in 1984 because of drug 
trafficking and guerrilla activity 
the supreme court threw out the extradition treaty in april 1988 
on a technicality

coordinate as expeditiously as possible the extradition of 
suspected colombian drug dealers

paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the 
international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the 
lives of lawabiding citizens bush said in a statement issued 
from kennebunkport maine where he is vacationing 
barco consistently has refused to negotiate with the drug lords 
who have never made their demands known 
in his speech he cautioned colombians they should be prepared 
to experience more pain and sufferings in what he called the 
war against the nation unleashed by drug rings 
the government sent an elite police command to the drugbastion 
city of medellin and the army was placed under alert this means 
the army can be called any time into action anywhere in the country 
galan 46 presidential candidate of the liberal party was 
leading by wide margins in opinion polls for planned presidential 
elections in may 1990 
a journalist who later became a politician galan favored 
extraditing drug traffickers saying it was instrumental to their 
defeat

while attending public meetingsthe vest shielded him from three 
bullets but a fourth killed him according to a forensic report 
as news of galans death spread through the country crowds 
estimated at hundreds of thousands came out on the streets shouting 
justice justice and demanding action against the drug cartels 
galans body was carried to the national capital building in 
bogota accompanied by tens of thousands of mourners many with tears 
in ther eyes barco and his top ministers appeared to pay their 
respects to the candidates family 
galan lives in the hearts of 30 million colombians some 
shouted death sentence for drug traffickers others said 
the government has decreed a threeday mourning period for galan 
who will be buried sunday

led raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the 
arrest of several dealers 
at his funeral saturday police general director gen miguel 
gomez padilla pledged we will wipe out from our soil now and 
forever the infamous criminals involved in the stigmatizing drug

a federal appeals court saturday stayed the 
execution of william andrews just three days before he was to die by 
lethal injection for three 1974 torturekillings dubbed the hifi 
murders 
a threejudge panel of the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
issued the stay for andrews the nations longeststanding death 
inmate after failed appeals in federal and state courts and the 
state board of pardons rejection of his plea for clemency on friday 
defense attorney robert anderson said andrews had been informed 
shortly after the order was issued at about 10 am 
he was very grateful and was very relieved he still considers 
this matter very solemnly anderson said 
the threejudge panel which had convened here for a hearing 
later saturday issued the stay based on andrews latest writ of 
habeas corpus despite a federal magistrates thursday recommendation 
that procedural rules barred the us district court from hearing it 
the document did not include a reason for the stay but said a 
more detailed order would follow later the order was signed by 
judge monroe mckay on behalf of fellow judges stephen anderson and 
bobby baldock 
special state prosecutor robert wallace who had gone to the 
federal courthouse to get the order declined to discuss it except 
to say i have some thoughts but i really dont want to make a 
comment at this time 
andrews 34 of jonesboro la has been on death row for nearly 
15 years for the slayings of two women and a man during a robbery of 
the hifi shop in ogden five people were forced to drink liquid 
drain cleaner and were then shot two of them survived 
his codefendant pierre dale selby admitted he shot the victims 
after andrews left the store selby was executed in august 1987 
in his writ andrews had argued that his rights were violated at 
trial by inadequate defense counsel that a judges failed to 
instruct the jury it could find him guilty of a lesser offense and 
that a mistrial should have been declared when a juror found a note 
in a restaurant during a lunch break saying hang the niggers 
the juror gave it to the judge its origin was never determined 
the jury was all white both defendants were black 
on friday the state pardons board had announced its 21 decision 
to deny andrews request for life imprisonment instead of the death 
penalty 
board chairman hl haun said he and panelist edward kimball 
decided that although selby shot the victims andrews help in 
forcing them to drink liquid drano and his knowledge they would be 
killed made commutation impossible

when the list of solidarity candidates was 
posted for polands historic elections for parliament two months ago 
the name of one top solidarity adviser was missing 
tadeusz mazowiecki among solidarity leader lech walesas closest 
advisers since the independent union was founded in august 1980 had 
declined an offer to run 
now mazowiecki a lawyer and journalist is poised to become 
polands first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii after 
his nomination by communist president wojciech jaruzelski on 
saturday 
during the election campaign his associates wondered why 
mazowiecki had turned down a political career in favor of editing 
tygodnik solidarnosc the solidarity weekly 
and now the question is why after his apparent reluctance to 
enter the political arena was mazowiecki walesas choice 
walesa proposed two additional names to jaruzelski on thursday 
historian bronislaw geremek the solidarity floor leader in 
parliament and legislator jacek kuron a free union activist for 25 
years 
walesa described the choice as a terrible dilemma 
walesa said saturday that kuron deserved it for his struggle 
but was not acceptable to communist leaders because of his years of 
aggressive opposition 
bronislaw is the best among us it is true he deserved 
it walesa said but it was critical that geremek continue to lead 
solidaritys parliamentary delegation 
thus having a general look at the whole arrangment i decided 
that such a solution is best for poland walesa said of 
mazowieckis selection 
mazowiecki understands the two other pillars of power in poland 
the roman catholic church and communist party he founded the 
influential club of catholic intelligentsia in 1957 and served in 
parliament during the 1960s in a communistsanctioned delegation 
under the churchs protection 
jacek ambroziak a lawyer who works with mazowiecki at the 
solidarity newspaper said the nominee is an experienced negotiator 
who listens to a range of views and shuns hasty decisions 
he is very close to lech walesa but he will be his own man 
ambroziak said 
walesas choice was unexpected by some solidarity leaders 
i am very surprised because mazowiecki was against this idea of 
a soidarityled government at this time said zbigniew bujak head 
of the unions warsaw region 
in a july 14 editorial in his newspaper mazowiecki warned 
against a hasty move by the solidarity to take responsibility for 
the government and its economic problems 
what will be good tomorrow may be fatal today he wrote 
shortly after the 1980 shipyard strike broke out which was to 
lead to the creation of solidarity mazowiecki and geremek rushed to 
the port city of gdansk to deliver an appeal signed by more than 60 
intellectuals urging authorities to find a nonviolent solution the 
two men became advisers to the strikers 
mazowiecki was jailed during the december 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown on solidarity 
released after a year mazowiecki became walesas assistant he 
participated in negotiations this spring with communist authorities 
that led to the restoration of solidaritys legal status 
mazowieckis links to the catholic church are even longer after 
world war ii and the communist takeover he engaged in the struggle 
to preserve the churchs independence he established the 
intellectuals club and then founded link a catholic monthly that is 
still being published 
he is a personal friend of polishborn pope john paul ii and 
after meeting with jaruzelski on friday he was received by polish 
primate jozef glemp with whom he prayed 
although he served in parliament from 1961 to 1970 as part of the 
churchlinked delegation his decision not to run for parliament 
this year seems to have worked in his favor 
mazowiecki is out of the parliamentary club so he is not 
engaged in parliamentary intitiatives said bogdan lis a 
solidarity senator 
mazowieckis dealings with communist legislators while he was in 
parliament may have made him more acceptable to party officials 
mazowiecki is expected to attend a meeting sunday of the leaders 
of the solidarity union and its parliamentary delegation to plan 
forming a government

cook countys sheriff on saturday pressed for the 
firing of two of his officers as a newspaper reported allegations 
that the department had suppressed investigations of mob murders and 
internal corruption for years 
the two officers who are accused of robbing a drug dealer were 
suspended friday after reporters sought comment from sheriff james 
ogrady for an article on the alleged corruption published in early 
sunday edition of the chicago tribune 
the report said sheriffs officers have concealed evidence 
thwarted efforts to interview witnesses and hidden their own 
relationships with suspects and victims in murder investigations 
dating back 15 years 
telephone calls from the associated press to the sheriffs 
department for comment on the tribunes report went unanswered 
saturday 
on friday sheriffs police lt william h martin 55 a 22year 
veteran of the department was suspended for his alleged 
participation in the 1986 robbery of a suburban drug dealer 
deputy larry geanes 39 a sixyear employee of the court 
services department also was suspended for alleged involvement in 
the scheme 
ogrady will press the county states attorneys office to file 
criminal charges against the men and will go before a merit board to 
seek their dismissal spokesman william currie said saturday 
a telephone call to a residence with the listing of l geanes in 
south suburban calumet city went unanswered saturday at the martin 
residence a man who identified himself as william martins father 
said the officer was not available for comment 
the sheriffs department with headquarters in chicago runs the 
county jail and has a 500member police force to cover the 177 
square miles of unicorporated cook county and forest preserve land 
according to the tribune no one has been convicted of an 
organized crime murder in cook county in more than two decades the 
sheriffs department has run the investigations of most of the 
estimated 70 organized crime murders in the chicago area in the last 
25 years 
the case in which the two men have been suspended began to 
unravel feb 2 1987 after dwayne henderson a streetlevel drug 
dealer and police informant was shot twice in the head his body 
was dumped in an isolated area 
for 1 years highranking sheriffs officials prevented 
investigators from aggressively pursuing the case the paper said 
quoting unidentified sources the allegations include accusations 
that henderson along with sheriffs officers and jail guards set 
up a robbery and extortion ring that preyed on suburban drug 
dealers the newspaper said 
rather than expose allegations that fellow officers and jail 
guards were suspects in the case highranking sheriffs officers 
hid evidence and sanitized files the tribune said citing 
interviews and department records 
ogrady elected sheriff in 1986 said he first heard of the 
coverup allegations in the middle of 1988 by ogradys account 
some highranking officers gave investigators the impression they 
should tread slowly in efforts to solve the murder 
i was so concerned about the investigation that i let the fbi 
know about it ogrady said i wasnt happy about the case then 
and im still not happy about the cases status 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified drug dealer as saying that 
four or five men who identified themselves as sheriffs police 
swarmed around him one night and took his money and drugs 
many of the coverups alleged in the article took place during 
the administration of richard elrod county sheriff from 1970 
through 1986 elrod who had little to do with daytoday 
operations told the newspaper he knew nothing of the corruption 
alleged in the article 
i had no inkling said elrod now a cook county circuit court 
judge

warsaw poland president wojciech jaruzelski on saturday 
nominated solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister 
paving the way for a historic break in the communist monopoly on 
leadership in the east bloc 
a statement released by the official news agency said the 
president decided the new solidarityled coalition government was 
necessary to help solve polands crippling economic problems and end 
widespread public discontent 
the president thinks that the formation of such a government 
will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties 
and satisfying the needs and aspirations of polish society 
the pap news agency said 
mazowiecki must be approved by the sejm or lower house of the 
national assembly the sejm speaker will receive the nomination 
monday and the assembly will meet wednesday approval is virtually 
assured because solidarity and its coalition partners two minor 
parties have a majority in the body 
the new government will be the first in the soviet bloc not led 
by communists since soviet dictator josef stalin consolidated 
communist control in the late 1940s 
i am terrified mazowiecki said in an interview on polish 
state television but i think we can do a lot that we can 
release the forces in ourselves i think that it will not be easy 
but it is possible 
a jubilant lech walesa said it is an incredible success for 
our struggle but now let us see it in practice this is just 
the beginning 
speaking in a telephone interview from his gdansk home walesa 
who has led solidarity since it was founded in 1980 said he now 
feels free to leave the world of politics to others and to devote 
himself entirely to union affairs 
once approved mazowiecki will have several weeks to form his 
cabinet which will include solidarity communists and noncomunists 
mindful of the soviet unions strategic concerns solidarity has 
said it will let the communist party retain control of the 
ministries of defense and interior which oversee the army and 
police in addition local governments and the court system will 
remain controlled by party members 
solidarity also has promised that the change will not endanger 
polands participation in the warsaw pact military alliance 
the soviet union while expressing concern last week has said it 
considers the formation of a government an internal polish affair 
mazowieckis nomination marks a onceinconceivable victory for 
the the east blocs first free trade union which was banned by 
jaruzelski after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown mazowiecki himself 
was imprisoned for one year 
solidarity whose success in june parliament elections pressured 
the government into the unprecedented action immediately promised 
mazowiecki its full support 
this should produce a major breakthrough in polish public life 
by doing away with the present policy of nomenklatura the 
system in which only party members are appointed to most senior jobs 
in government and the economy the movement said in a statement 
however some union leaders expressed apprehension about 
solidarity assuming responsibility for governing so quickly after 
its april 17 legalization 
i thought it would be healthier for us to have these things 
happening a little bit later because in the meantime we would gain 
a certain experience said union spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
i think it is very risky 
saturdays government announcement came as the communist party 
met in warsaw and walesa met union members in gdansk mazowiecki was 
said by associates to be resting outside of warsaw 
mazowieckis appointment is a stunning triumph for walesa the 
solidarity founder who put together the plan for a solidarityled 
coalition government with the help of minor parties once affiliated 
with the communists 
the government statement called mazowiecki a longtime catholic 
activist and former sejm deputy as well as one of the leading 
activists of solidarity and editor of its weekly newspaper 
tygodnik solidarnosc 
in the present situation the president sees a need to create a 
government enjoyin the necessary support of parliamentary floor 
groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between 
polands political and social forces the statement said 
an earlier pap communique announced jaruzelskis acceptance of 
communist prime minister czeslaw kiszczaks resignation kiszczak 
approved as prime minister by the sejm on aug 2 wanted to put 
together a grand coalition led by the communists but with 
participation of solidarity 
instead walesa assembled his own parliamentary majority with the 
minor peasant and democratic parties and asked jaruzelski thursday 
to allow formation of a solidarityled government 
in june legislative elections solidarity won nearly all seats 
for which it was allowed to run under an accord that also resulted 
in the labor movements legalization with that hold in the 
government the opposition was able to build its parliamentary 
coalition to challenge the communists 
walesa opening the unions meeting at solidarity national 
headquarters praised his adviser bronislaw geremek who had been 
among solidaritys three candidates for prime minister and said 
geremek would continue to function as his political adviser 
some union members were wary about the communist partys reaction 
to the expected government changeover 
the party of course will defend itself it will begin to 
start provocations for the party the greater disorder that there 
is the better because we are appealing for calm said alojzy 
pietryk head of solidarity for the southern coal fields of 
jastrzebie 
pope john paul ii an old friend of mazowieckis smiled broadly 
when asked saturday if he was satisfied with developments in his 
homeland 
more or less he said 
east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia were restrained in 
their coverage of the developments in romania the most vehement 
opponent of recent east bloc reforms the polish developments were 
not even reported in the media

fourteen rockets hit kabul today 
injuring 18 people on the 70th anniversary of the nations 
independence from britain 
foreign minister mohammad nabi amani who gave the casualty 
figure said the 14 rockets struck mainly residential areas across 
the city 
saturday is normally the first day of the working week in moslem 
afghanistan with bazaars bustling and thousands of people on the 
streets of kabul 
but because of the independence holiday and rumors that 
usbacked guerrillas fighting to overthrow the sovietsupported 
government were planning massive rocket attacks on the city streets 
were almost empty 
the government did not mark the anniversary with a ceremony 
despite reports that president najib would appear at an official 
function 
kabul has been hit almost daily by rocket attacks since late june 
and the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks 
no one claimed responsibility for saturdays attack 
the rebels say they aim for military targets but unofficial 
estimates say 98 percent of the rockets have hit nonmilitary 
targets including schools homes crowded bus stops and bazaars 
one rocket today went through the roof of the home of a family in 
karte parwann just blocks from the british high commission which 
was closed before the feb 15 withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
it went through two floors landing in the living room and 
showering shrapnel on a woman who suffered injuries to the back and 
right arm 
young boys and girls wailed hysterically and the brother of the 
injured woman said the united states was responsible for the deaths 
of innocent afghans 
theyre killing us why are they killing us he asked 
refusing to give his name 
un sources say 335 people were killed and more than 900 injured 
in rocket attacks and a car bombing between june 25 and aug 12 
virtually all were civilians 
the afghan government on thursday accused the united states of 
supplying the rebels with new more deadly rockets that explode in 
the air and shower small warheads over a wide area 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said the rockets 
which he did not identify had us markings 
a promised trip friday to see pieces of the new missiles was 
canceled deputy spokesman naquib sameer said the kabul garrison 
commander had destroyed the pieces because they were too dangerous 
us officials have promised new arms shipments to the mujahedeen 
but have not revealed the types of weapons published reports say 
they include cluster bombs and spanish 120mm mortars to crater 
airport runways 
the governments commemoration of king amanullahs treaty with 
britain in 1919 giving afghanistan its independence was almost 
nonexistent red black and green afghan flags hung limply on 
flagpoles in the afternoon heat and tanks were positioned at major 
intersections for the first time in more than a month 
afghanistan gained its independence at the end of the third 
angloafghan war at a time when this rugged landlocked country was 
a buffer between the two superpowers of the day czarist russia and 
england najib has compared the struggle in the nations 11yearold 
civil war with the fight by amanullah to liberate the country

the nomination saturday of solidaritys 
tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister brought cheer to customers in a 
long line at a gasoline station 
i am really happy we wanted mazowiecki from the beginning i 
trust solidarity and mazowiecki is an honest catholic said a 
station attendent 
cant you tell i work for solidarity it is great i have been 
happy since the union was founded in 1980 said a man waiting in 
his car 
he said he was employed by solidarity as a driver in gdansk the 
birthplace of the free union there was a solidarity pennant in the 
car window 
the next man in line was an auto mechanic from leningrad in the 
soviet union 
what do you think of a solidarity prime minister he was 
asked in polish 
i dont understand he replied in russian 
what do you think of a soilidarity prime minister he was 
asked in russian 
it is very good it is progress he said pointing to a 
solidarity button stuck to the dashboard 
do you keep that button there when you are in the soviet 
union he was asked 
well no he replied with a grin 
others in this city where the soviet blocs first independent 
union was established in 1980 were pleased that communist president 
wojciech jaruzelski had nominated the first noncommunist to head a 
polish government in four decades 
it is very good news because we can hope that finally something 
will get better it is still bad but now all those communist party 
monopolies will disappear said a surveyor 
a high school student said it takes me by surprise the only 
thing that we expected is that the prime minister could not be from 
the communist party because society could not have accepted that 
some people expressed surprise at the choice of mazowiecki they 
said they thought solidarity leader lech walesa would have selected 
bronislaw geremek the leader of the unions parliamentary 
delegation 
it is good the prime minister is from solidarity but i 
expected geremek because he is better known in society said an 
engineer 
and there were those who had not heard of the momentous decision 
ive been listening to music all night said a taxi driver 
waiting in the gasoline line

trigger an explosion at a chemical storage center before being 
brought under control 
thirtynine firefighters suffered minor injuries including smoke 
inhalation and inhalation of ammonium hydroxide fumes said city 
emergency management spokesman michael mayo 
an explosion at the nearby unocalamsco storage and distribution 
center which is filled with flammable chemicals would have caused 
widespread destruction said city fire superintendent richard 
greenberg 
had it not been for a new sprinkler system at the center there 
would be no carteret greenberg said 
the fire at the sampa plastics recycling plant whose owners had 
been cited for improperly storing flammable material broke out at 
520 am and was declared under control four hours later mayo said 
firefighters kept watch over the plants smoldering remains 
throughout the day 
the fire also extensively damaged the neighboring hf butler 
steel works mayo said 
about 600 residents were evacuated from homes in a 20block area 
for fear of an explosion at the chemical plant mayo said they were 
allowed to return around 2 pm 
cartaret an industrial city of nearly 21000 people is six 
miles south of newark where a fire at a scrap metal and recycling 
company aug 7 damaged a stretch of interstate 78 
plastic drums of ammonium hydroxide stored at the unocal center 
melted and spilled the chemical booms were thrown across a nearby 
creek to keep contaminated water from flowing into the arthur kill 
waterway 
about 200 firefighters battled the blaze a coast guard boat in 
the arthur kill pumped water from the waterway to the firefighters 
the sprinkler system at the unocal plant wasnt completely 
installed but firefighters were able to hook pipes up to a pumper 
truck and spray the plant to cool it greenberg said 
greenberg said he cited sampa plastics in 1987 for storing 
flammable and combustible material outside the building he said he 
fined the business 1200 but cut the penalty in half after the 
violation was addressed 
saturdays fire started outside the building in the same place 
where sampa had been cited for storing plastics and cardboard boxes 
greenberg said 
state and county environmental officials didnt find evidence of 
toxic materials at the scene mayo said although the acrid smell of 
burning plastic wafted through the town

historic change and daunting challenges in poland 
were bannered in the western press saturday but given decidedly less 
coverage in the east bloc a grinning pope john paul ii called the 
developments a step forward 
all that has been done is very important the pontiff 
visiting spain said of the nomination of his friend solidarity 
activist tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister its not easy 
britains foreign office also welcomed the nomination we trust 
that this development will help polands progress towards democracy 
and result in a government which reflects the wishes and hopes of 
the polish people a statement said 
coverage in east germany czechoslovakia and bulgaria was 
restrained in romania where the government has been hostile to 
liberalization in poland the events were not reported at all 
many soviet newspapers carried a report from the official tass 
news agency quoting polish communist leaders as complaining about 
the confrontational actions of the leaders of the opposition 
one of the few commentaries to appear in soviet papers was in 
moskovskaya pravda where east european specialist mikhail tretyakov 
stressed the dangers of letting polands government crisis drag on 
the prolonging of the process of forming the government does 
not further social consolidation the establishment of order and the 
removal of the country from its state of crisis tretyakov wrote 
yugoslavias tanjug news agency took a more positive vein 
government crisis enters calmer waters it said reports in the 
hungarian news media also were supportive 
chinas official xinhua news agency carried factual reports but 
no commentary on the developments in poland 
poland was the lead story in most french papers saturday with 
the pointed exception of the communist partys lhumanite which put 
its report on page 10 
an editorial in the leftist liberation newspaper said the 
choice of a prime minister from solidaritys ranks is beyond any 
possible contest one of the most important events since yalta but 
the road leading poland to democracy remains long 
le figaro in a frontpage editorial said a solidarityled 
government will have only a short honeymoon 
some italian newspapers played up the role of the catholic 
church close follower of the pope will be premier in warsaw 
said the headline in the communist party daily lunita 
in a frontpage commentary in corriere della sera of milan 
arrigo levi said the rules of behavior under soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev were now more evident 
but much remains unknown do these rules really apply for all 
the countries of eastern europe not only for hungary but also for 
czechoslovakia and for east germany in reality we dont 
know levi said 
britains conservative daily telegraph said gradual change was 
the only way peacefully to overcome the huge economic and 
political problems poland faces 
the scotsman newspaper of edinburgh said democratic the 
government might be but the communist party still provides the 
bureaucracy that oils the state as well as the local government 
machines 
in egypt the governmentowned algomhouriya reported a 
historic political coup in poland and the conservative 
englishlanguage saudi gazette hailed a milestone of enormous 
significance 
a frontpage commentary in viennas respected conservative daily 
die presse said the situation is unstable and unpredictable in 
the soviet union as well as in east germany 
cold and stormy autumn days could quickly follow the hot 
summer it said 
the us government reacted cautiously to the developments in 
warsaw 
we will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as 
appropriate and as we can presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters at the summer white house in kennebunkport 
maine 
asked about the state departments cautious reaction spokesman 
richard boucher said the state department doesnt dance in the 
streets im sorry 
in chicago polish immigrants celebrated the news of the 
appontment of a solidarity activist but they were wary of the 
intentions of communist authorities 
from what we know of the communists they dont give up power 
without a struggle said marian prusek of the polish community on

father to jump into the drink a small cove off the atlantic that 
laps against bushs 11acre compound at walkers point 
howd you like to be on prime time television bush asked 
8yearold twins jenna and barbara george w bushs daughters

greet the delighted couple and kiss the bride as the couple exited 
the checkpoint a presidential aide caught up with them and gave 
them two decks of cards and a key ring bearing the presidential 
seal saying the gifts were from barbara bush

pop singer melanie who appeared at the 
woodstock rock festival here 20 years ago gave a repeat performance 
saturday for about 10000 people who came to commemorate the epic 
event 
twice in one lifetime what more could you want melanie 42 
asked the audience during her 45minute appearance at the farm once 
owned by the late max yasgur 
the crowd had been waiting all week for a performance by a 
musician who appeared at the original aug 1517 1969 woodstock

pope john paul ii speaking 
after a rockmusic performance warned some 400000 young people 
saturday about pitfalls of materialistic life 
living in the permissiveness of the modern world it is easy 
and attractive to breathe this contaminated mentality and to succumb 
to the passing desire the pontiff told youths from 55 countries 
they gathered on mount gozo outside santiago for the 4th 
vaticansponsored world youth day 
as the 69yearold pontiff watched young dancers and singers 
performed numbers to show that greed selfishness and the pursuit of 
comfort could be unattractive 
many people in the crowd kept time with the music waving banners 
and scarves they applauded the performance by a singer in a gold 
lame jacket who represented selfishness 
the popes appearance and the performances were a highlight of 
the pontiffs threeday visit to spain he arrived saturday and will 
visit the mining region of asturias and the mountain shrine of 
covadonga 
on the flight from rome to spain john paul spoke with reporters 
about the nomination of solidarity journalist tadeusz mazowiecki for 
prime minister of poland 
mazowiecki a personal friend of the pontiff is expected to 
organize polands first noncommunistled governmen in more than 40 
years and the pope was asked if he was satisfied with developments 
in his homeland 
all that has been done is very important a step forward he 
said 
he also indicated he might go to warravaged lebanon on a mission 
of peace 
john paul said he had not received a response from lebanese 
authorities to his recent statement that he would like to visit 
lebanon but added we can say a certain interest has been shown 
he did not elaborate but his spokesman joaquin navarro said the 
interest had come from various foreign ministries 
last week the pontiff expressed outrage at the fighting between 
lebanese christian and syrianled forces and said he felt it 
imperative to visit the country 
john pauls third visit to spain is part of an effort by the 
vatican to stem the tide of secularization spains catholic leaders 
also seek the popes assistance in reversing the decline in church 
attendance in this country which once was a bastion of the faith 
the pope in his remarks to the young people denounced hedonism 
drug abuse divorce abortion and artificial birth control saying 
they were in clear contrast with the law of god 
marisa schaefer 25 of milwaukee said she came to mount gozo 
to hear what the pope had to say to young people i think its 
excellent that young people show theyre behind the holy father 
earlier in the day john paul donned a traditional brown cape and 
holding a pilgrims staff he walked along the final 300 feet of the 
way of st james 
legend has it that the body of st james washed ashore in galicia 
in northwestern spain in a stone boat and the remains were 
discovered in a tomb near santiago in the 9th century

magazine publisher malcolm forbes 
celebrated his 70th birthday saturday welcoming nearly 1000 guests 
to tangiers party of the century 
resplendent in a forbes clan kilt forbes stood in a receiving 
line shaking hands with each of his guests many of whom were flown 
to morocco from the united states for the weekend 
a fleet of buses brought the guests from their tangier hotels to 
the mendoub chateau forbes residence and they lined up to go 
through security checks and draw lots for their assignments to one 
of six tents 
at one time the line of guests extended for about 150 yards and 
it took some 40 minutes to pass through the gates 
hundreds of moroccan dancers and singers entertained the guests 
waiting in line 
officials of the monarchy of king hassan ii cooperated in 
organizing security and the citys main street was closed to all but 
party traffic for hours before the festivities began 
uniformed armed guards and plainclothes men were on duty early at 
the 15acre garden of the chateau 
the chateau purchased in 1971 from a former royal governor of 
tangier is on a cliff overlooking the mediterranean and the straits 
of gibraltar the midsummer haze on saturday veiled the view of the 
european mainland 
most of the guests whose names constitute a list of the wealthy 
and famous in america were flown here in three jet planes 
including a supersonic concorde from new york on friday 
forbes took more than 100 american and european reporters and 
photographers around the garden saturday for a lastminute view of 
the arrangements including six elaborately furnished tents set up 
for tasty moroccan specialties bellydancing and fireworks and 
dancing until dawn 
while walking through the grounds reporters asked forbes how he 
could give such a lavish party estimated to cost more than 3 
million amid the poverty of morocco 
you dont defend it forbes replied we probably all do 
things in our lives that are not essential i dont feel guilty 
about it i feel grateful we can do it 
his four sons and his daughter moira posed for photographers 
with their father theoretically the children were the hosts of the 
evening but forbes said you cant really describe it as a 
surprise party my children are giving me the party and im paying 
for it 
he said he had no clear idea how much it would all cost because 
the bills are not all in but he said the most costly item was 
the three jets to fly most of the guests to morocco 
the catering costs considerably less than it would in the 
west he said catering manager abdelkrim timsamani said the total 
catering bill would come to less than 750000 
a total of 100 sheep 600 chickens and 1500 eggs went into the 
dishes prepared for the guests 
with four exceptions the guests had to draw lots to determine 
who sat in which tent forbes assigned himself the largest tent with 
the other exceptions the two sons of king hassan ii and actress 
elizabeth taylor 
miss taylor appeared briefly with forbes at the end of the press 
viewing she has been a frequent companion since his 39year 
marriage ended in divorce in 1985 
her hair freshly done in a windswept coiffure she smiled and 
waved at photographers and in response to their request kissed 
forbes three times 
the guest list included such world figures as former president 
jimmy carter former secretary of state henry kissinger real estate 
magnate donald trump publishers rupert murdoch robert maxwell and 
katherine graham television personalities walter cronkite and 
barbara walters and former kings constantine of greece and simeon of 
bulgaria 
miss taylor and forbes spent much of friday buying jewelry and 
colorful moroccan kaftans forbes said his greatest birthday wish 
was to live to be around to have many more of the things she gave 
me 
the greatest of those is her passion for men he added

temporarily closed because a world war ii bomb has been found on its 
grounds tass said saturday 
the undetonated german bomb was dropped during the 900day siege 
of leningrad in 194144 the official news agency reported saturday 
the bomb lies several yards under the parks central alley and was 
found during a search for the remains of a nazi bomber it said 
the germans shelled leningrad with more than 100000 
highexplosive and incendiary bombs during the siege tass said 
some failed to detonate immediately and chances of an explosion 
increase as the metal corrodes according to tass 
the bomb in the summer garden cannot be removed but will have to 
be detonated where it lies tass said ninety statues and five 
sculptures will be removed from the park holes bored around the 
bomb and liquid nitrogen pumped into the ground to freeze the metal 
and contain the blast tass said 
sand and cement will also be piled atop the ground to contain the 
force of the blast tass said it said the bomb would be detonated 
aug 27 and that for the moment the summer garden has been closed 
to visitors and cordoned off by police

a congressman from president corazon 
aquinos coalition called for us military bases in the philippines 
to be phased out during a nineyear period 
the lawmaker rep jose de venecia also said washington should 
help this country prepare for the economic impact of closing the 
bases during that time 
the congressman called his plan a middleground approach 
designed to satisfy growing filipino demands for the bases to be 
closed while giving the americans time to relocate the strategically 
important installations elsewhere in the pacific 
de venecia outlined the idea in a resolution submitted wednesday 
to this countrys house of representatives a copy of the resolution 
was released saturday 
under the proposal the united states would pay the philippines 
about 750 million a year for nine years part of the payment would 
go toward construction of a munitions factory for the philippine 
military and a 150 million debt reduction plan 
de venecia also proposed that the united states make a separate 
onetime payment of 750 million for converting the facilities for 
use by civilians 
the united states maintains clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller facilities under an agreement that expires in 
1991 the two countries are to begin talks this year on extending 
the agreement 
mrs aquino refuses to say whether she will support an extension 
any agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 23member 
senate where opposition to the bases is strong amid growing 
resentment of the american presence 
in october the united states agreed to pay 962 million over two 
years to keep the bases here until 1991 
de venecia says his proposal is in line with a growing global 
trend towards demilitarization 
the withdrawal of the us military facilities from the 
philippines would thus be a part a vital part of a univeral 
process of adjustments to the requirements and challenges of the new 
century his resolution said

of the starving in africa and elsewhere

memorial service which drew 5000 people 
bishop joseph fiorenza of the diocese of galvestonhouston read a 
message delivered through the vatican embassy in washington 
pope john paul ii the message said is well aware of 
representative lelands great humanitarian effort to relieve the 
starvation of the sudanese refugees in ethiopia his holiness is 
likewise grateful that his admirable concern helped to bring the 
plight of these unfortunate people to the worlds attention 
the rev jesse jackson spoke forcefully during a service that 
mixed the elements of a traditional roman catholic mass with 
jubilant gospel singing and the jazzy strains of a saxophone and 
electric bass 
there were shouts of amen and bursts of applause throughout 
the mass and the crowd once roared to its feet when jackson asked 
them to applaud the late congressman 
mickey is not in that box he said motioning toward an empty 
coffin just as jesus was not in that tomb 
and because mickey is not in that box and because jesus is not 
in that tomb death has not freed us of the burden of mickeys 
mission jackson said the challenge that we have today is 
for those of us who remain to protect the integrity of mickeys 
mission

beloved member of a small family the congressional black 
caucus and spoke solemnly of its loss 
along with mickey we lived in a world of words where words 
have great significance where words have great power where words 
even have the implications of life and death dellums said 
yet at this moment words are so incredibly inadequate to 
communicate to all of you here this incredible loss for an 
extraordinary member of our family 
fiorenza a longtime friend of lelands said he was driven to 
do this work at tremendous personal sacrifice and personal risk 
but he was driven by their suffering and motivated by an 
extraordinary compassion 
this great city has lost an illustrious son but what is more 
important every houstonian especially the poor has lost a good 
friend

at least 51 people were killed in sri 
lankas ethnic warfare in a twoday period and the west germany 
embassy advised west germany citizens working in some areas to leave 
the country 
military officials said saturday that 37 of those killed since 
thursday were slain in central and southern sri lanka in attacks 
involving sinhalese extremists 
most of the other killings occurred in northern sri lanka where 
separatists in the tamil minority have been battling for six years 
for their own homeland 
west germany has been providing funds for six agriculture and 
rural development projects in central sri lanka and a west german 
embassy spokeswoman said the government has advised german workers 
at those projects to return home 
anna ottohallensleben said she did not have the number of 
germans told to leave the country but the six projects represent 
around onefifth of the number of west german projects funded in sri 
lanka 
the agencies feel if the workers cannot perform satisfactorily 
they should return but they will come back if the situation 
improves 
west germany is the first country to advise its nationals to 
leave sri lanka since the ethnic conflict intensified in recent 
weeks earlier this month the united states said americans should 
avoid unnecessary travel to sri lanka 
it is estimated that the tamil revolt has claimed 11000 lives 
mainly in northeastern sri lanka since 1983 
india brokered a peace agreement in 1987 that called on the tamil 
guerrillas to stop fighting in exchange for limited autonomy in the 
northeast india sent more than 40000 troopers to enforce the 
ceasefire 
but the largest tamil guerrilla group rejected the plan militant 
sinhalese claimed the accord granted too many concession to the 
tamils and began a violent campaign against the sinhalesedominated 
government 
sinhalese militants of the peoples liberation front are blamed 
for 4000 killings in central and southern sri lanka since june 1987 
when the first indian troops arrived 
tamils most of whom are hindus form 18 percent of sri lankas 
population of 16 million and accuse the buddhist sinhalese majority 
of discrimination

plo chief yasser arafat said saturday that 
the 8monthold dialogue with the united states is deadlocked and 
the stalemate could fuel the palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
arafat told a news conference that the bush adminstration insists 
that the palestinians accept israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
election plan for the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
they want us to accept the shamir plan which is nothing but a 
plot aimed at ending the 20monthold uprising in the territories 
arafat said 
the lack of progress in the usplo talks could result in the 
uprising becoming a nationwide rebellion and we may take 
another step after the rebellion he said without elaboration 
shamirs plan calls for the palestininans to elect 
representatives who then would negotiate with israel some form of 
limited autonomy for the territories but israel will not deal with 
the palestine liberation organization saying it is a terrorist 
organization 
the plo has rejected the plan claiming it is designed to abolish 
palestinian aspirations for a homeland 
it also has said any elections in the territories should be held 
after israel withdraws and under international supervision 
in december the united states ended a 13year ban on dealings 
with the plo after arafat renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist 
robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia was then 
authorized to open talks with the organization and the two sides 
held a fourth round monday 
arafat was in baghdad for a meeting friday with iraqi president 
saddam hussein and jordans king hussein on the conflict in lebanon 
between lebanese christians and syrianled forces there were 
unconfirmed reports that the three leaders agreed to press for an 
emergency arab summit to discuss lebanon 
arafat called on the arabs to send a peacekeeping force to stop 
what he called the slaughter and crimes against the lebanese 
he said syria is responsible for the latest round of violence in 
lebanon which erupted in march and has claimed more than 780 lives 
syria has supported antiarafat palestinian groups 
arafat was asked if he expected any foreign intervention in 
lebanon and replied there is a vacuum now in lebanon and if they 
the arabs dont fill it others will

nothing in his 23 years as an air traffic 
controller for the federal aviation adminstration prepared terry 
dobson for what he experienced july 19 when he and seven others 
helped guide a united airlines dc10 to an emergency landing in 
sioux city iowa last month 
i dont know how you can ever train for a situation of this 
magnitude said dobson 47 the air traffic manager at sioux 
gateway airport 
when you witness something like that the emotions and so on 
that you go through youll never forget he said 
cool heads prevailed in the control tower but tensions grew as 
seven air traffic control personnel guided flight 232 after it lost 
its hydraulic control he said 
the tension had run very high and of course the tower became 
very quiet as the disabled plane dove toward the airport dobson 
said at a friday news conference during which the faa released the 
tape recording of the conversation between the sioux city control 
tower and flight 232 
i think it kind of turned to jubilation from the standpoint 
that it appeared to us that capt haynes and his crew had got the 
airplane to the airport he said 
dobson said that when the plane made a crashlanding i think 
most of the folks up there in the tower were just thanking the 
good lord that that airplane made it to the airport where all the 
emergency help was 
of the 296 people aboard the dc10 111 were killed when the 
plane en route from denver to chicago and philadelphia crashed and 
burst into a ball of fire 
i know theres some tension that built right away at the point 
where the crew came over to us and told us about their hydraulic 
problems said mark zielezinski area supervisor in the sioux city 
tower 
the more people on board to help coordinate things and keep 
things smooth in the tower was going to be to our advantage said 
zielezinski 36 who has worked as an air traffic controller for 11 
years 
immediately after the landing there was not a controller in 
that tower who was not back doing his job and doing it very 
professionally said dobson 
at no time was there ever a sign that anyone failed to do their 
job he said 
one week after the dc10 crash dobson and his colleagues were 
faced with another emergency landing when a twinengine turboprop 
plane owned by northwest airlines lost its left engine 
in light of what had happened one week to the day previous to 
that the folks in the tower cab the adrenalin pumped a little 
harder but they the controllers had a job to do and it was done 
very professionally and it had a happier ending 
the plane landed safely 
since then tensions in the sioux city control tower have 
subsided dobson said were getting pretty well back to normal 
what is normal after something like that happens

exxon released plans friday for winter 
operations in prince william sound and said capabilities to 
carry out more oilspill cleanup work will be available in the 
spring 
exxon has cleaned more shoreline miles than it anticipated last 
spring when its plan for cleanup of the march 24 oil spill in the 
sound was announced otto harrison exxons general manager in 
valdez said at a news conference 
he said exxon is prepared over the winter to respond to problems 
and will continue scientific studies 
weather permitting the company plans to put key scientific 
personnel on heavily affected beaches every two weeks during the 
winter so that remaining effects of oil spilled from the exxon 
valdez can be examined the ship struck a reef in prince william 
sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil 
harrison said the level of resumed operations in the spring is 
unclear the company has been under pressure from the state to make 
an unequivocal commitment that crews will be on the job again in 
1990 but exxon has said only that it will abide by reasonable 
requests from the coast guard 
i dont know what its going to look like in 1990 harrison 
said i honestly dont know what it will look like in the spring 
i think the capabilities to do things will be here but i dont know 
what well have to do scientific studies over the winter will 
help us to understand what we can realistically expect to find 
here next spring 
gov steve cowper called exxons winter plan inadequate the 
company made a major effort to clean oil from the surface of 
beaches affected by the spill but winter efforts should be 
strengthened he said 
theres still a lot of oil below the surface theres a lot of 
oil on the beaches and theres a lot of oil in the water the 
governor said we think that oil ought to be cleaned up as best as 
it can 
alaska commissioner of environmental conservation dennis kelso 
described the winter plan as a blizzard of numbers you can 
calculate numbers all day long but that doesnt get the beaches any 
cleaner 
the states proposals include continued treatment of shorelines 
after exxons pullout most of which will occur by midseptember 
small wellequipped crews could work in sheltered areas until the 
onset of severe weather state officials said 
exxons spill response has involved more than 13000 people more 
than 3000 of them beach cleanup workers 
exxon plans to keep about 300 employees in alaska during the 
winter but the organizations headquarters will be moved from 
valdez to anchorage six exxon community liaison offices and seven 
claims offices will remain open over the winter demobilization 
began friday 
the first five of 1700 container loads are on their way to 
anchorage harrison said were in the process of moving surplus 
material out of the yard right now 
harrison said alaskas largest city is the only place with enough 
warehouse space for work such as the cleaning and repair of 
oilcontainment boom 
exxons objective is to leave shorelines environmentally 
stable but its ability to finish the job could be hampered by 
weather and if the coast guard does not approve use of the chemical 
compound corexit 9580 
critics of the compound say too little is known about its 
effects harrison said exxon on thursday again sought the coast 
guards permission to use the substance on heavily oiled beaches 
as of tuesday more than 900 miles or shoreline along prince 
willaim sound and the gulf of alaska had been treated he said 
according to exxon 80 miles along the sound and 80 miles of gulf 
shores still require treatment 
state officials have said many of the treated beaches remain 
badly contaminated and need more work 
harrison said three major vessels assigned to the spill will 
be withdrawn by nov 1 oilcontainment boom will be kept on hand in 
case fish hatcheries in the sound need protection he said other 
aircraft and vessels will be stationed elsewhere in alaska

a nuclear regulatory commission report 
released friday criticized seabrook nuclear plant operators for 
delaying a shutdown despite the urging of nrc officials when a 
valve failed during lowpower testing 
plant operators reacted in an unacceptable way to the 
equipment failure although the malfunction was not a significant 
safety lapse the nrc reported it said pretest staff training 
apparently was inadequate 
the commissions staff also rejected a motion by seabrook 
opponents to reopen hearings on the plants lowpower license 
because of the june 22 testing incident 
the massachusetts attorney generals office the new england 
coalition on nuclear pollution and the seacoast antipollution 
league have asked that the license be suspended and authorization 
for a fullpower license be withheld until a hearing can be held 
massachusetts has opposed the plant on behalf of state 
communities within 10 miles of the plants safety zone 
the plant stopped the tests when a steam valve malfunctioned in a 
nonnuclear part of the plant 
the nrc said control room operators failed to follow procedures 
waiting nearly five minutes after the part failed to shut down the 
plant although an nrc inspection team present urged them to do so 
the nrc in a report issued by its regional office in king of 
prussia pa said the equipment failure and delayed shutdown did 
not significantly challenge the plant margin to safety however the 
operational practice exhibited by the personnel in the control room 
was unacceptable 
the report said the operating staff otherwise performed well and 
it called control room supervisors highly competent individuals 
in an 81page report sent to the nrc by seabrook top executive 
edward brown in july plant officials admitted they initially 
underestimated the seriousness of the incident 
brown said in a statement friday that his earlier report was 
consistent with the nrcs findings he reiterated that plant 
officials accept full responsibility for unacceptable and 
inappropriate personnel performance 
he said the plant management has taken major corrective 
actions since the incident one seabrook executive was fired 
other employees were reprimanded and some others were given new 
assignments after the incident 
the nrc reported that the valve apparently was not given a final 
test before the low power trials began 
the nrc scheduled two hearings to discuss the findings a public 
meeting sept 6 at the university of new hampshire in durham and a 
closed enforcement conference sept 7 at the nrc office in king of 
prussia to determine whether seabrook operators violated commission 
regulations 
the staff opinion rejected opponents contention that stopping 
the lowpower tests was equivalent to starting a proceeding to 
suspend the license and said halting testing did not involve a 
fundamental flaw in seabrooks operational training or its lowpower 
testing program 
the opinion was signed by edwin reis deputy assistant general 
counsel of the nrcs reactor licensing branch in rockville md

the utah supreme court late friday denied 
two appeals from the nations longeststanding death row inmate who 
faces execution on tuesday for his role in the 1974 tortureslayings 
of three people 
william andrews petition to the states high court which 
included claims that he had a biased allwhite jury and was 
victimized by false testimony was rejected by five justices as 
without merit 
earlier friday the state board of pardons refused on a vote of 
21 to commute his sentence to life in prison and us district 
judge david sam denied andrews request for a stay of execution 
the high court also ruled against andrews appeal of the pardons 
boards denial of clemency 
barring a stay of execution from one of several still pending 
appeals in federal court andrews 34 will die by injection tuesday 
morning shortly after midnight for nearly 15 years he has been on 
death row 
his codefendant pierre dale selby was executed in august 1987 
andrews and selby both airmen at hill air force base were 
convicted of killing two women and a man during the robbery at the 
ogden hifi shop one woman was raped by selby before he shot the 
five victims in the head 
earlier friday pardons board chairman hl haun said he and 
panel member edward kimball decided that although selby fired the 
shots that killed the three and wounded two others andrews help in 
forcing the victims to drink a liquid drain cleaner and his 
knowledge they would be killed made the death sentence appropriate 
the aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the hifi 
murders far outweighed any mitigating factors haun said 
haun said andrews and selby forced their bound victims to drink 
the drain cleaner and when they did not die quickly enough 
decided to kill them 
mr andrews waited outside the store while this took place 
but he left his loaded pistol for mr selby to use he said mr 
andrews knew of mr selbys intent and shared in it 
two men survived including orren walker whose son was one of 
those killed walker testified at andrews and selbys commutation 
hearings and was present friday 
defense attorneys were expected to appeal sams decision to the 
10th us circuit court of appeals where they already have a 
pending appeal of his rejection of andrews companion civil rights 
appeal 
a third 10th circuit judge arrived friday to complete the panel 
needed for a hearing on the appeals set for 2 pm saturday said 
court clerk bob hoecker in denver 
in the appeals andrews contends his constitutional rights were 
violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an 
inexperienced attorney and a judges failure to instruct the jury 
it could convict andrews of seconddegree murder 
the appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should 
have been declared for selby and andrews when a juror found a note 
bearing the words hang the niggers

alabamas electric chair in an execution that avoided the foulup of 
the states last one 
state prison commissioner morris thigpen said that richardson had 
requested he be blindfolded from the time he left the holding cell 
adjacent to the execution room at 1157 pm thursday 
he never saw the execution chamber thigpen said in a news 
conference after the postmidnight execution 
thigpen also witnessed alabamas last execution july 14 when it 
took two surges of electricity to execute horace franklin dunkins 
jr because the electric chair was wired wrong and the first surge 
failed to kill him 
thigpen kept an open telephone line from the prison to gov guy 
hunts office in case of a last minute stay 
richardson 43 was pronounced dead at 1214 am six minutes 
after the switch was thrown said state department of corrections 
spokeswoman debbie herbert 
he was convicted in the death of 11yearold rena mae callins of 
dothan whose body was blown apart on the porch of her home when she 
picked up a pipe bomb and it detonated richardson whose 
relationship with the girls aunt recently had broken up said he 
only meant to scare the family 
the execution was carried out after the us supreme court 
followed the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta and us 
district judge robert varner in montgomery in refusing richardsons 
request for a stay thursday gov guy hunt earlier refused to grant 
clemency 
richardson blindfolded and dressed in his prison whites was 
strapped in the yellow chair while he listened to holman prison 
warden charlie jones read the death warrant 
i have no ill feeling and hold nothing against anyone 
richardson said in a final statement after the death warrant was 
read 
richardson was executed with 1800volt charge of electricity and 
doctors pronounced him dead 
richardson was the 159th person to be electrocuted in alabamas 
chair he was the sixth inmate put to death in the state since the

its nothing for which uncle sam can take a bow 
but the gentlemans tendency to complicate oncesimple matters has 
helped spur an innovative creative opportunistic industry 
oddly the spurring was done not through any great enterprise or 
financial infusion by the old codger but by bludgeoning existing 
businesses with such onerous paperwork burdens they had to do 
something or die 
as a result employee leasing is swiftly becoming one of those 
phenomena they call a wave of the future it had 5000 employees six 
years ago today it has at least 500000 by 1992 it probably will 
reach 4 million 
its fast growth can be attributed partly to the busy governmental 
bureaucracy to the complicated regulations emanating from 
washington and state offices that drive smallbusiness people to 
distraction if not madness 
faced with this reality some businesses fire their 
employees the discharged workers stay in place they join a leasing 
company the leasing company pays them their old company pays the 
leaser 
in return the leasing company processes the payroll signs the 
checks reconciles the checking account handles the ifca futa and 
suta taxes and the w2 forms figures the insurance claims deals 
with sec 125 benefits deductions and section 89 and cobra 
compliance and administration 
these details have been known to drive little companies out of 
business they are the talk of any conference of smallbusiness 
people the smallbusiness press anguishes over them the common 
complaint being that fulfillment of all the requirements leaves no 
time for running a business 
in this way did uncle sam quite inadvertently provide 
inspiration and support to the leasing industry in effect he 
created a new area of demand that demanded the abilities of a 
specialist which is the employee leaser 
altogether there are about 500 employee leasing companies in the 
united states half of them in the populous states of california 
florida new york ohio pennsylvania and texas 
most are very small the largest action staffing inc of 
tampa fla has 400 clients and 11000 employees in 23 states some 
have cooperative arrangements those in the national staff network 
encino calif involve 30000 leased workers typical of emerging 
industries franchising is a factor 
david miller action chairman looks for growth not just from 
frustrated business people who want to rid themselves of paperwork 
but from what he views as a trend to greater entrepreneurship 
theres been a direct correlation between our growth and the 
phenomenal increase of small business during the 1980s he says 
the early 1980s recession drove many people to try their hand at 
business more recently he says corporate downsizing with 
resulting layoffs has spurred activity 
while the industry views the four million businesses of fewer 
than 50 workers as its prime market it might eventually target 
larger companies also 
there are administrative nightmares for larger companies too 
says miller whose customers have included divisions of gte ramada 
and greyhound among the nightmares are regulations and compliance 
that differ state to state 
those federal regulations however are the big factor for 
example cobra the consolidated omininbus budget reconciliation act 
that says terminated workers may continue their health insurance 
and irca the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which 
creates new legal obligations for employers 
one of the very toughest is section 89 of the 1989 tax act which 
compels corporations to prove they are conferring benefits equally 
on all employees ask a smallbusiness person about that one and 
youll receive more than a bland response some prefer to pay the 
penalties rather than fill out forms 
it often takes a specialist more accurately a firm of many 
specialists in different areas to handle such burdens small 
business especially and some big ones too say they have better 
things to do with time and manpower 
such as surviving

atlanta has long been a magnet for homosexuals in 
the southeast who felt theyd never be accepted in smaller towns 
its a little island of enlightenment in a sea of bigotry 
said gil robinson a lobbyist for several atlanta gay groups 
theyve never been forced to take to the streets to fight for 
equality here but with an estimated 300000 homosexuals in the 
metropolitan area the gay community has become a wellorganized 
potent political force nowhere has that been more apparent than in 
the race to succeed mayor andrew young 
i think gay and lesbian people here are becoming a real 
political power probably getting close to new york san francisco 
and los angeles said richard swanson administrator of the 
atlanta gay center 
fulton county commission chairman michael lomax and former mayor 
maynard jackson the two leading democratic candidates in the oct 3 
election until lomax dropped out this month vigorously campaigned 
in the gay community 
both had detailed platforms on gay issues promising to seek 
funds for housing for people with aids to appoint gay men and 
lesbians to city posts and to establish police task forces to combat 
unprovoked assaults on homosexuals 
the citys gay population has never before been courted so 
openly said jeffrey laymon executive secretary of the metropolitan 
atlanta council of gay and lesbian organizations we do have the 
numbers now the political situation has changed they have to pay 
attention 
even those who oppose affirmativeaction programs inclusion of 
homosexuals agree that atlantas gay population has developed some 
muscle 
i think its antifamily and its antigod said nancy 
schaefer chairwoman of citizens for public awareness which has 
fought to repeal a city ordinance amendment giving gay residents 
protection from discrimination atlanta has become a haven for 
homosexuals she said 
unlike san francisco or new york the rise of gay power here came 
not with a surge of militancy but rather gradually gay activism 
surfaced in america in the early 1970s and by the time atlantas 
homosexual population reached significant numbers much of the work 
had already been done 
by 1980 attitudes about equality had already changed or 
moderated across the country swanson said there probably 
wasnt a great need to get out and march were able to achieve much 
more with a lowerkey approach 
he cited atlantas status as a center of the civil rights 
movement and its southern gentility for the lack of confrontation 
over gay issuesa lot of gay and lesbian people tend to be from 
the smaller towns in the south they still have a lot of that 
traditional southern mentality 
midtown atlanta a hodgepodge of highrise office towers 
comfortable neighborhoods nightclubs and shopping centers is the 
center of gay life but its a lifestyle that has been quietly woven 
into the citys society 
were invisible said marie murray of the greater atlanta 
political awareness committee gapac we dont just care about gay 
issues were interested in all of the issues that everybody else 
is 
still many gay activists say their greatest victory was the 1986 
addition of sexual orientation to an antidiscrimination ordinance 
it has survived one repeal effort cpa is trying again to have the 
amendment thrown out 
mrs schaefer said she does not believe a sexual preference group 
should be considered a minority particularly in affirmative action 
programs she does believe that heightened gay political power bodes 
ill for the city 
it concerns me where the city is heading when the morals of 
the city start falling apart we will suffer the consequences she 
said adding that the suburbs will become conservative in reaction 
to gay clout within the city 
many gay men and lesbians own prosperous businesses with money 
to contribute to politicians and are active in one or more of the 
dozens of gay and lesbian organizations that rate politics high on 
their agenda 
jackson campaign spokesman angelo fuster said the gay population 
is very important in building a successful coalition with 
atlantas black majority to win a citywide election and many 
politicians no longer fear a backlash if they openly support gay 
issues although there is a lot of homophobia it has lessened 
considerably he said 
lomax recently reached out for the gay vote with a proposal to 
include gayowned businesses in a study of fulton countys 
affirmative action program 
les hough a specialist in southern politics at georgia state 
university said the proposal shows the role gay voters especially 
white ones play in predominantly black atlanta by appealing to 
the margins to the singleissue groups you can solidify your white 
support he said 
in a close race it can make a big difference 
the prominence of gay issues in atlanta shows the differences 
between city and country in georgia where no gubernatorial 
candidates mention gay rights as an important platform plank he 
said anyone who had ambitions of statewide office in georgia 
would downplay gay rights issues in any race 
swanson said gay men and lesbians have simply become part of the 
fabric of atlanta coming of age along with the fastgrowing city 
a high percentage of the gay people in atlanta now have 15plus 
years of being involved in the community all that is paying off 
now

signs of economic strength are keeping the stock 
market in a state of unease and leaving the muchawaited new record 
high for the dow jones industrial average out of reach 
the forecast throughout wall street in july was that the federal 
reserve would move more aggressively to ease credit conditions to 
head off a possible recession 
revised forecasts now point to the likelihood that the federal 
reserve will not relax its credit policy and that interest rates 
which have fallen substantially could stabilize 
july statistics on industrial production homebuilding and retail 
sales released recently suggested a modest revival in economic 
activity although the upward blips in the data were not 
extraordinary they were enough to wipe out the two previous months 
of declines analysts said 
views of an economic revival were further substantiated on friday 
with the release of july consumer price inflation the labor 
departments consumer price index rose 02 percent but excluding 
the two most volatile components food and energy the index was 
up 04 percent 
the report produced mixed reaction among economists as to whether 
the numbers meant inflation is building or receding and helped add 
to the markets confusion 
we do not think the inflation picture is worsening said 
economist cynthia latta of drimcgrawhill a lexington mass 
forecasting company we believe the situation has stabilized and 
probably will improve some 
but economist james solloway of argus research corp said taken 
together the latest reports do not suggest an easing of inflationary 
pressures 
the inflation number is not all that good we could well see 
the overall inflation rate heading higher he said 
the market began the week on a cautious note sellers werent 
aggressive and buyers refrained from participating reflecting 
investor indecision about which way the market would go 
their unease was compounded by the failure of the dow jones 
industrial average to decisively pierce its alltime high of 
272242 reached aug 25 1987 despite flirting with a record 
breaking rise earlier this month 
less than two months after the 1987 peak the market tumbled in 
the worst panic of history 
in the backs of their minds was the 1987 stock market crash 
said richard mccabe manager of market analysis at merrill lynch amp 
co theyre not going to get caught in the same scenario as 1987 
with the market drifting early in the week but refusing to move 
down too dramatically many participants remained sidelined unable 
to find what they considered bargains 
volume was light in contrast to the previous weeks activity in 
which about 1 billion shares traded hands in the busiest week in 
more than a year volume on the big board averaged 14884 million 
shares a day down from 20081 million a day in the previous week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up to 268797 a 
gain of 398 points on the week the average had climbed 3054 
points in the previous week 
the new york stock exchange composite index advanced 037 to 
19264 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
inched 51 lower to 46197 and the american stock exchange market 
value index declined 146 to 37918 
while improved economic growth would usually be good for stock 
prices analysts said investors remained captives of the bond 
market interest rates were foremost in the minds of bondholders 
who bid prices down much of the week 
what the data shows is that the federal reserve has gone as far 
as its going to go for the time being the next two to four 
weeks said hugh johnson senior vice president first albany 
corp theres too much life left in this economy so the fed wont 
lower interest rates

corporate bonds are supposed to be a relatively 
safe investment but how secure are they if the company that issued 
them is hit by a hostile takeover 
thats the kind of information a creditrating company hopes to 
make available to investors though a new service 
last month standard amp poors corp began ranking the protection 
industrial bonds provide in the face of a takeover or corporate 
restructuring these threats called event risks in bond 
parlance can cause bond prices to plunge 
sampp is evaluating the protective language in a bonds indenture 
or the written agreement between a bond issuer and bond holder it 
is the first such ranking by a major credit rating service 
the danger to bond prices from corporate upheaval was pointed out 
graphically earlier this year when rjr nabisco inc was taken over 
by the leveraged buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
rjrs bonds once rated as highgrade investments plummeted to 
the junkbond category due to the huge amount of debt the food and 
tobacco company acquired through the takeover their price soon 
dropped through the floor 
sampps ranking of the protective covenants contained in bond 
indentures judges how well a bond will maintain value in the face of 
a sudden and dramatic decline in its rating 
the rating agency devised a scale of e1 to e5 with bonds rated 
e1 providing the most eventrisk protection and those rated e5 
providing insignificant or no protection 
a common type of protection sometimes called a super put 
requires the issuer to redeem a bond at face value which is called 
a put or raise the bonds interest rate if a creditdamaging event 
occurs 
sampp cautions that its ratings are not a judgment on the 
likelihood that a company is a candidate for a takeover or 
restructuring the event risk rating is separate from sampps ratings 
of corporate creditworthiness 
so far sampp has ranked about 25 bonds for their eventrisk 
protection said gail i hessol a managing director at the ratings 
agency which is a division of mcgrawhill inc for bondholders 
what its found isnt encouraging 
of the 25 only one received the top ranking and the eventrisk 
protection in many wasnt found to be worth much sampp said 
the rating agency was particularly unimpressed with a common 
feature of covenants that triggers the protection if at least 30 
percent of a companys stock is repurchased by management within a 
12month period 
sampp says the 30 percent repurchase threshold is too high giving 
the company the latitude to significantly weaken credit quality by 
taking on more debt to buy back stock 
the bond offering that received the top ranking was issued by 
enron corp a houston energy concern it promises to increase the 
interest rate if the issue is downgraded for any reason by sampp or 
moodys investors service inc the other major creditrating 
company 
sampp says the reaction to its new service has been extremely 
favorable 
my phone did not stop ringing for a month ms hessol said 
last week we think there was a hunger for information on this 
subject 
but not everyone was pleased 
there were a small number of bond issuers who felt we were 
putting them in play or implying they were takeover targets by 
virtue of the fact we were evaluating their bond indentures and 
werent very impressed with the value of the protection she said 
but once issuers understood what we were doing and what we were 
not doing most of them were comfortable 
prudentialbache securities inc in a recent commentary on the 
sampp rankings said it was surprised at the agencys low opinion of 
the protection provided by the super puts 
but it welcomed the ratings saying they should provide more 
and better information for use by industrial bond investors 
moodys says it has no plans for a similar ranking of eventrisk 
protection 
moodys already includes a judgment of protective language in 
credit ratings if it believes the bond issuer is a candidate for a 
ratingsdamaging event said michael mulvaney a moodys senior 
analyst 
in addition moodys ratings are adjusted downward if it believes 
a company is vulnerable to event risk 
in cases where we find indentures that have significant 
protection we may assign a slightly higher rating mulvaney said

another chapter in the ivan boesky insider 
trading epic is history leaving a new entry on the governments 
felons list but a bad taste in many mouths over the heavyhanded 
behavior of federal prosecutors 
robert freeman a leading wall street strategist who bet huge 
sums of money on speculative takeover stocks for himself and his 
venerable employer goldman sachs amp co agreed this past week to 
quit and plead guilty to one felony fraud count for insider trading 
in beatrice cos shares more than three years ago 
at the same time the manhattan us attorneys office which has 
orchestrated an aggressive prosecution of wall street corruption 
stemming from the boesky scandal announced without explanation that 
it was abandoning a probe of two other prominent traders arrested 
with freeman in february 1987 
those arrests executed with extraordinary publicity by thenus 
attorney rudolph w giuliani stunned an industry unaccustomed to 
police raids search warrants and handcuffs 
it has since become a splotch on the prosecution career of 
giuliani who is running for new york mayor based partly on his 
record of convictions in securities cases and other white collar 
frauds 
a few months after the freeman trio was indicted prosecutors 
dropped the charges because a judge wouldnt give them more pretrial 
preparation time giuliani said he would bring new charges soon but 
never did leaving the three no opportunity to exonerate themselves 
giuliani and his successor benito romano have said the 
government may have acted prematurely in the freeman trio arrest and 
prosecution but have offered no apologies 
the governments behavior in that case reflects what many defense 
lawyers have called a display of sloppiness and arrogance that has 
needlessly ruined careers and reputations in the governments 
antifraud crusade 
perhaps more important it suggested the weakness of evidence 
against freeman and codefendants kidder peabody amp co trader 
richard b wigton and former kidder trader timothy l tabor 
the case was based largely on the confessions of martin a 
siegel a former mergers specialist with kidder who was implicated 
in fraud by boesky the notorious speculator now serving a federal 
prison term for insider trading 
defense lawyers have said the case against freeman boiled down to 
his word against siegels over whether the pair conspired to use 
inside information in the trading of beatrice stock 
so it remains unclear why freeman after maintaining innocence 
and with an apparently strong defense chose to strike a deal and 
plead guilty this past week 
freeman said in a resignation statement that he wanted to spare 
his family the publicity of a trial and that he already had 
subjected them his employer and himself to an ordeal 
but some lawyers have suggested he was motivated more by guilty 
verdicts in two other cases that also stemmed indirectly from the 
boesky scandal verdicts that showed the evident willingness of 
juries to treat defendants in securities crimes harshly 
in june a federal jury found stock speculator paul bilzerian 
guilty of securities fraud in four failed takeover attempts last 
month six securities professionals including a friend of 
freemans were found guilty of fraud and the much more serious 
charge of racketeering which carries enormous penalties 
in other business and economic news this past week 
government statistics suggested the economy isnt as weak as 
previously believed nor is it growing rapidly enough to accelerate 
inflation the june trade deficit narrowed to a 4year low and 
consumer prices rose only 02 percent in july 
the securities and exchange commission tightened its control by 
adopting rules aimed at quelling pennystock scams peddled to 
unwitting investors over the telephone president bush meanwhile 
nominated a key adviser on the thrift crisis richard breeden to 
become the new sec chairman 
the oil industry faced a new onslaught of litigation over the 
march 24 exxon corp tanker spill in alaskas prince william sound 
the alaskan government contended all oil companies operating in 
alaska were negligent in their joint responsibility to prevent 
spills 
it was a bad week for eastern airlines strikers but a good one 
for air passengers and ual corp shareholders eastern showed signs 
of strengthening its operations despite the prolonged walkout 
several major airlines extended a round of fare discounting into the 
fall and investor marvin daviss efforts to buy ual for more than 
6 billion drove its stock to record levels

a twoweek rally in copper futures prices has speculators 
anticipating a run at record highs for the third year in a row as 
the market shifts into its seasonal period of peak demand 
spot prices would have to rise more than 40 cents to surpass the 
alltime high of 16475 a pound set last december on new yorks 
commodity exchange but this is a market with a proven ability to 
outdo itself the previous record high of 146 a pound was set in 
december 1987 
the market is looking at all the factors and saying the 
possibility is here for something serious to take place said 
craig sloane a metalmarkets analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
copper for spot delivery on the comex settled friday at 12465 a 
pound compared with 11735 a week earlier and 113 the week before 
that representing a twoweek gain of about 10 percent 
prices climbed as high as 12680 on thursday but declined friday 
following news of cyprus minerals cos plan to restart a damaged 
copper smelter in arizona within the next two weeks 
most other commodity markets showed little change in the past 
week 
coppers rise is rooted in persistent supply tightness caused by 
labor strife at mines in canada and peru two of the largest 
producer nations and by equipment failures sabotage and 
transportation problems in some of the south american and african 
countries that contribute heavily to the world supply 
prices fell sharply earlier this year and had been trading in a 
range between 105 and 115 since midmay the current steep 
ascent began on aug 9 the first of seven straight days of rising 
prices when it appeared peruvian miners were ready to strike the 
strike began on monday and has not been settled 
another supportive factor is the expectation of increased demand 
which typically occurs in the fall and winter as makers of copper 
wire and machine parts replenish their supplies 
finally copper prices are responding to recent economic data 
indicating the economy is stronger than many experts had expected 
the stronger the economy the stronger the demand for copper as a 
component of new offices and homes

extraordinary they were enough to wipe out the two previous months 
of declines analysts said 
views of an economic revival were further substantiated on friday 
with the release of july consumer price inflation the labor 
departments consumer price index rose 02 percent but excluding 
the two most volatile components food and energy the index was 
up 04 percent 
the report produced mixed reaction among economists as to whether 
the numbers meant inflation is building or receding and helped add 
to the markets confusion 
we do not think the inflation picture is worsening said 
economist cynthia latta of drimcgrawhill a lexington mass 
forecasting company we believe the situation has stabilized and 
probably will improve some 
but economist james solloway of argus research corp said taken 
together the latest reports do not suggest an easing of inflationary 
pressures 
the inflation number is not all that good we could well see 
the overall inflation rate heading higher he said 
the market began the week on a cautious note sellers werent 
aggressive and buyers refrained from participating reflecting 
investor indecision about which way the market would go 
their unease was compounded by the failure of the dow jones 
industrial average to decisively pierce its alltime high of 
272242 reached aug 25 1987 despite flirting with a record 
breaking rise earlier this month 
less than two months after the 1987 peak the market tumbled in 
the worst panic of history 
in the backs of their minds was the 1987 stock market crash 
said richard mccabe manager of market analysis at merrill lynch amp 
co theyre not going to get caught in the same scenario as 1987 
with the market drifting early in the week but refusing to move 
down too dramatically many participants remained sidelined unable 
to find what they considered bargains 
volume was light in contrast to the previous weeks activity in 
which about 1 billion shares traded hands in the busiest week in 
more than a year volume on the big board averaged 14884 million 
shares a day down from 20081 million a day in the previous week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up to 268797 a 
gain of 398 points on the week the average had climbed 3054 
points in the previous week 
the new york stock exchange composite index advanced 037 to 
19264 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
inched 51 lower to 46197 and the american stock exchange market 
value index declined 146 to 37918 
while improved economic growth would usually be good for stock 
prices analysts said investors remained captives of the bond 
market interest rates were foremost in the minds of bondholders 
who bid prices down much of the week 
what the data shows is that the federal reserve has gone as far 
as its going to go for the time being the next two to four 
weeks said hugh johnson senior vice president first albany 
corp theres too much life left in this economy so the fed wont 
lower interest rates

a man youve never met touting a company 
youve never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted 
sometimes its an honest broker pushing a lowpriced but 
highrisk legitimate stock but often the call is from a 
boilerroom bank of telephones staffed by smoothtalking sales 
people preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers 
a high pressure salesman might say if you dont buy now youre 
going to miss the boat says robert ferri of the national 
association of securities dealers the only boat youre going to 
miss is the titanic 
the nasd oversees overthecounter stocks and the brokers who 
deal in them 
a rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks inexpensive but 
risky securities that usually arent traded on any stock exchanges 
has worried securities regulators and industry officials across the 
country 
penny stocks in themselves arent illegal but the north american 
securities administrators association a washingtonbased 
organization of state investment regulators calls the fraudulent 
sale of these securities the biggest threat facing the average 
investor 
three weeks ago 14 people and two companies were charged in 
chicago with an alleged 10 million penny stock scam in which the 
companies share prices were artificially raised before being sold 
at large profits 
the securities and exchange commission alleged in a civil 
complaint that the companies were only shams created to peddle 
stock one companys stock first offered at 15 cents per share in 
1985 rose to a high of 6 per share through announcements of bogus 
mergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars from 
investors around the country 
in florida earlier this year state authorities moved to revoke 
the license of a denverbased penny stock brokerage which allegedly 
bilked thousands of investors including an 80yearold woman who 
lost about 30000 
penny stock fraud is the fraud du jour says lawrence h 
fuchs floridas deputy comptroller 
nationally the problem has become epidemic said john b 
hiatt director of the new mexico securities division 
while his state doesnt have a lot of wealthy investors a 
disproportionate number of customer complaints about broker dealers 
in our state derive from the penny stock market he said 
i would say its rapidly coming to the forefront of our 
activities said irwin fisk chief investigator for the california 
division of corporations in southern california 
in the 23 years hes been on the job fisk said his division had 
seen about six penny stock fraud cases weve got that many or 
more pending right now most in the last few months 
officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone to 
scam artists 
trading for a few cents up to a few dollars penny stocks usually 
are issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makers 
of wouldbe wonderdrugs they often have an untested or unevent 
earnings history 
because most penny stocks are not listed nationally information 
about them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to 
dispute 
information is power and you dont have it with penny stocks 
said ferri the nasd spokesman 
he said unscupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicited 
telephone calls known as cold calling might be pushing 
legitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actually 
trading the stocks arent usually carried in newspaper stock 
listings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price 
another scam consists of constantly selling stock buying it back 
and selling it again at increasingly higher prices like a pyramid 
scheme until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are only 
worth a fraction of the price they paid 
the sec has created a penny stock task force and recently 
approved rules that will make it impossible for unscrupulous brokers 
to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over the phone 
the new rule effective jan 1 requires buyers to approve the 
first three transactions with a new broker in writing and requires 
the broker to determine the buyers financial status and the 
suitability of the stock purchase 
sarah b ackerson an sec attorney assigned to the task force 
said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about penny 
stock fraud 
but she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year that will 
end sept 30 the sec received 2462 complaints about penny stock 
fraud compared with 1510 for all of last year 
regulators and industry officials caution investors to be wary 
when considering penny stocks especially when offered through 
solicited phone calls 
hang up on them advises floridas fuchs investigate a 
company thoroughly before you commit money 
i would ask for a prospectus before i bought anything said 
californias fisk 
consumers have to do their homework said nasds ferri who 
advised checking up on whether the broker is reputable 
the front line in this war is the consumer and too often people 
get victimized because they dont let common sense rule the moment

william herbert hunt one of two former billionaire 
sons of wildcat oilman hl hunt who is under protection from 
creditors has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court that 
would pay less than half of the 300 million in back taxes the 
government claims he owes 
meanwhile a peruvian mining company filed a plan with the us 
bankruptcy court in dallas saying it would settle for 90 million of 
the 132 million it lost on hunts failed silver speculation 
the filings were on thursday 
the internal revenue service hunts largest creditor previously 
has said it would settle for about 150 million but hunts most 
recent plan would pay the irs 120 million half from the proceeds 
of a liquidating trust and half from earnings after he emerges from 
bankruptcy 
all competing plans in the bankruptcy case envision selling off 
hunts assets estimated at between 80 million and 125 million 
the differences come in how the pie is split 
hunts plan would give unsecured creditors 37 percent or roughly 
30 million of the liquidating trust 
this plan gives the unsecured creditors the biggest pot hunt 
attorney stephen mccartin told the dallas morning news the only 
issue is whether the irs will agree to the plan 
minpeco sa which won a 132 million judgment against hunt and 
two of his brothers because of their silver dealings filed its own 
plan thursday saying it would settle for 75 million to be paid 
over six years plus an additional 15 million from hunts share of 
the proceeds from the trust 
minpeco also would pay hunt a 3 percent management fee for acting 
as an adviser in the liquidation of his assets 
the filing is the latest result of a split in what had once been 
an informal creditors committee of minpeco the irs and 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
the irs and manufacturers hanover however dispute minpecos 
preferential claim on the assets of herbert or nelson bunker hunt 
who also has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
because minpeco already has been paid about 80 million by other 
silver defendants the irs and the bank claim the other damages 
minpeco is owed are largely punitive damages interest and attorneys 
fees and are subordinate to the claims of unsecured creditors 
bunker hunt meanwhile has until aug 31 to file a 
reorganization plan acceptable to creditors after than the 
creditors may be allowed to file their own plan 
the hunts filed for personal bankruptcy last year after minpeco 
won a lawsuit claiming it had lost money because of the brothers 
attempt to corner the silver market 
at the time of the filing herbert and his wife nancy said they 
had assets of about 19638 million and debts of 887 million 
including the 300 million irs claim 
bunker and his wife caroline said they had assets of 25883 
million to cover 12 billion in debts including 600 million to 
the irs
