in 1984 he was considered a possible running mate for walter 
mondale and was given several roles within the national democratic 
party and the national governors association traveling to 
washington and elsewhere promoting his jobsforwelfare recipients 
program and his tax collection ideas his peers designated him the 
nations most effective governor 
his willingness to make deals and a good sense of timing were 
serving him well 
dukakis who had vetoed a 1984 tax cut signed several tax 
reductions in the next three years even a repeal of the tax 
surcharge that remained in place from his first term 
he won a third term in 1986 with nearly 70 percent of the vote 
now he boasts that he has experience mopping up republican red 
ink while cutting taxes 
the assertion draws mixed reviews back home 
i saw his ads in pennsylvania when i was home visiting said 
barbara anderson executive director of an antitax lobby called 
citizens for limited taxation those people out there dont know 
that he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts the 
reputation is a fabricated myth 
linsky and boston democratic political consultant michael 
goldman disagree 
he did sign those tax cuts and he can say that said linsky 
he doesnt say he proposed them 
anything is fair play in the political arena said goldman 
politicians get more blame than they deserve for some things and 
they also tend to get more credit than they deserve for others 
still some projections say spending will have to be rolled back 
or the state could face a 200 million deficit by the end of the 
current fiscal year 
i think many people who are familiar with financial management 
are laughing when people say our state is in great fiscal shape 
said alexander tennant executive director of the state republican 
party 
the gop and anderson blame dukakis for the new budget crunch 
saying he should have put money aside instead of increasing state 
spending by nearly 1 billion a year since returning to office yet 
they also mounted much of the pressure that led to the tax cuts 
anyone can manage on a billiondollarayear increase said 
anderson wait until the miracle worker is facing the national 
deficit hell do what hes done before cut services and raise 
taxes 
but that first term was a long time ago massachusetts is a 
different state and dukakis a different politician 
despite facing token republican opposition in 1986 he 
campaigned hard mindful of 1978 and perhaps with an eye on 
national exposure beginning with his neighbors to the north hosts 
of the allimportant new hampshire presidential primary 
he had said little during his first term while construction was 
under way at new hampshires seabrook nuclear power plant just over 
the massachusetts border but he became a loud critic in recent 
years 
dukakis now refuses to submit federally required evacuation 
plans for massachusetts towns near seabrook blocking the plant 
from opening polls show a majority of new hampshire residents 
oppose seabrook 
dukakis later began to criticize the troubled pilgrim nuclear 
power plant in his own state the nuclear regulatory commission 
considers it one of the nations worst 
the plant has been closed on the nrcs orders for two years and 
dukakis has demanded that state officials be permitted to question 
managers about safety issues before the plant can be reopened 
shortly after being elected to his current term dukakis 
introduced the health care measure a firstinthe nation proposal 
that guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1992 
he was so eager to get the idea enacted into law that his original 
bill was derided by both parties as poorly conceived and had to be 
completely reworked 
dukakis touts the plan as a national model but critics say it 
will not work in states without a strong economy 
the governor generally is considered a good manager but several 
incidents involving subordinates have stirred doubts 
he was shaken early in his presidential campaign when it came 
out that his top aide john sasso had leaked to reporters a 
videotape showing that one of dukakis rival in the presidential 
campaign sen joseph biden of delaware had used the words and 
sentiments of a british politician as though they were his own the 
disclosure forced biden out of the presidential race 
dukakis who had said he disliked negative campaigning said his 
campaign had not been responsible for the leak 
later sasso owned up to his role showing that dukakis had been 
kept in the dark by his closest adviser on an explosive issue at 
first dukakis said he would not fire sasso then he reluctantly 
accepted his resignation 
in another incident a longtime dukakis campaign organizer 
appointed president at bridgewater state college pleaded guilty 
this month to diverting 80000 in federal money for personal use 
while he was in charge of the states adult education program 
and in 1986 it was disclosed that high state officials 
authorized a 10000 payment to a student who had accused the 
president of westfield state college of sexually assaulting him 
linsky believes voters consider dukakis personally above 
reproach in these incidents because of his role as a reformist 
legislator in the 1960s and the mr clean public image he has 
created by his family man approach to his work 
in that sense hes like president reagan not in the 
teflon sense but in the sense that he himself has a great deal of 
integrity and that he is very comfortable with himself not a 
person who goes around conveying a lot of selfdoubt said linksy

president reagan called it a little homework 
assignment 
prepare a report he told his education secretary william j 
bennett assessing the progress of school reform five years after a 
national commission warned in its landmark study a nation at 
risk of a rising tide of mediocrity 
the resulting 60page report american education making it 
work issued last week at a white house ceremony turned out to 
be more than bennetts notsofond look at what schools have and 
have not accomplished since reform began in earnest in 1983 
try as it might to appear otherwise and its not clear that it 
tried all that hard this little homework assignment is now 
being read for its political as well as educational content coming 
as it does in the midst of the presidential primary season 
the barbs start immediately in the introduction signed by 
bennett 
schools are slightly improved from 1983 said bennett but 
we are still at risk the absolute level at which our 
improvements are taking place is unacceptably low a conclusion 
few quarreled with last week 
however in explaining why reform has not progressed quickly 
the education secretary took aim at those practicing what he called 
opposition by extortion the false claim that to fix our schools 
will first require a fortune in new funding 
he said that narrow selfinterested parties are too often 
succeeding in blocking changes by legislatures and school boards 
teacher unions blocked reform by going to court in 
louisiana under teacher union pressure texas eliminated key 
sections of that states teacher competency test alabama facing 
opposition from administrators and the teacher union abandoned 
its career ladder program 
now who exactly might bennett have been talking about 
hint the national education association was one of the only 
major education groups not invited to the white house ceremony last 
week nea activists instead protested at a nearby park 
the oblique way bennett repeated his old charge that special 
interests and we all know which party they dominate and a 
certain teacher union in particular are big spenders and 
halfhearted reformers sounded a bit like the old archie bunker 
quip i aint mentioning names i just look at the party and 
whistle 
the bennett report then could wind up sharpening the battle 
lines between rival approaches to education reform in this 
political year 
to the extent that it foreshadows its partys platform on 
education the reagan administration is saying here that we could 
have had better schools by now we know how to do it we know what 
works the answer is not more money and new federal programs the 
problem is lack of political willpower and guts to face down the 
special interests who slow reform because it threatens their 
stranglehold on schools 
teacher unions and others in the educational community replied 
last week that the republican position as stated in the bennett 
report is just further proof that the reagan administration offered 
years of talk but not much action and certainly not much federal 
support for school reform 
its conceivable that the democrats will echo those sentiments 
in their platform 
in his weekly paid column scheduled for publication in sundays 
new york times american federation of teachers president albert 
shanker wrote an open letter to bennett bitterly criticizing 
his report especially on the money issue 
of course better schools arent only a matter of money said 
shanker but you lose credibility every time you repeat that 
statement after all families that have more money do move to and 
live in districts that spend more on their schools they seem to 
know that money does make a difference 
and he voiced frustration over bennetts constant barbs at 
teachers and others in the education field 
instead of leading your troops you kept shooting at them as 
though all who disagreed with you were misguided shanker said 
the bennett report was silent on the federal role in education 
a fact criticized last week not just by teacher unions and school 
interest groups but by among others university of california 
president david gardner who chaired the national commission that 
produced a nation at risk 
given the political bent of this latest report practically no 
one was expressing the belief last week that it would have the 
spectacular impact that a nation at risk had five years ago in 
rallying support for and defining the direction of school reform

barbed wire and watchtowers ring this 
communal farm on the lebanese border to fend off attacks by arab 
guerrillas but the heavy security cant keep out the fear 
the tension is growing resident yossi tal said after two 
separate raids last week by palestinian guerrillas on 
hostagetaking missions 
but tal and other kibbutzniks say decades of syrian shelling 
rocket attacks from lebanon and guerrilla raids have deepened their 
resolve to stay put 
i feel that because of what i went through in my childhood 
im more connected to this place said the 38yearold tal 
speaking in his sunlit garden apartment as he hugged his 1yearold 
daughter 
added his wife esti 38 when it gets too difficult i 
sometimes think about leaving but its important that we live 
here because we must show that we cant be run out of our 
country 
in the past five months however her commitment was sorely 
tested as arab guerrillas stepped up border raids to keep up 
momentum of a palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
the latest infiltrations may also stem in part from the 
assassination of khalil wazir the military commander of the 
palestine liberation organization who was gunned down april 16 at 
his home in tunisia 
kibbutz dan is in israels northeastern tip one of the most 
vulnerable areas along the border infiltrators passing through 
south lebanon to reach the border encounter few hostile lebanese 
militias and the rocky mountain terrain provides good cover 
in separate raids tuesday and wednesday palestinian guerrilla 
squads with automatic rifles hand grenades and maps of border 
settlements sneaked past israeli patrols and descended the steep 
slopes of mount dov two miles east of dan 
in tuesdays predawn infiltration three guerrillas hiding in a 
thicket of bushes on the mountain killed two israeli soldiers 
before troops gunned them down 
on wednesday two guerrillas ambushed an israeli truck driving 
up mount dov and wounded the driver they fled and hundreds of 
foot patrols backed by helicopter gunships searched for more than 
three hours before spotting them in a ravine and killing them 
in both cases dan and its 550 residents went on red alert 
tiger three tiger three shouted a voice over the kibbutz 
loudspeakers telling residents through the codeword that 
guerrillas were nearby 
we were in the dining hall eating lunch when the word came 
said robert andersson 21 a volunteer from the swedish island of 
orust everybody was running out 
the men grabbed submachine guns and dashed to assigned guard 
posts and watchtowers along the barbed wire fence while others 
circled the kibbutz in jeeps the women stayed indoors with 
children 
we went to our rooms and locked the doors said hagit bal 
15 we heard very heavy shooting a lot of helicopters 
hagit a softspoken teenager with a blond ponytail said she 
hates the guerrillas because they hate us and want to kill us 
when i was little i used to have nightmares that they would 
come and shoot us she said the figures in her dreams were 
dark and ugly with a moustache 
tals teenage son yoni who was born during the 1973 golan 
heights war said he used to spend weeks at a time in underground 
shelters while guerrillas from lebanon bombarded the northern 
israeli settlements with sovietmade katyusha rockets 
our nurses would tell us our fathers were fighting for us but 
i was afraid something would happen to them said yoni a new 
wave music fan sporting a rats tail hair cut 
i know that my children have to suffer this tension said 
tal who was born in dan and my grandchildren probably will go 
through the same thing and also my greatgrandchildren 
he recalled that before the 1967 middle east war the syrian 
border was only 500 yards from dan and trenches five feet deep 
crisscrossed the kibbutz as a protection against syrian shelling 
i remember one day in 1964 when they fired more than 300 
shells in two hours said tal nobody was hurt but the place 
was devastated 
a day after wednesdays guerrilla infiltration life was back to 
normal in dan farmers donned gray and blue work uniforms and 
returned to their apple orchards trout ponds and honey bee hives 
children rode bicycles along treelined paths linking neatly kept 
white garden apartments 
meir dayan 21 who stood near the communal dining hall with an 
uzi submachine gun resting on his shoulder said kibbutzniks have 
learned to quickly pick up their routine after each alert 
this he said is our way of life

the debate in washington over a bill requiring a 
company to give 60 days notice before closing a plant puzzles 
people in europe where such measures are woven into the fiber of 
national welfare systems 
i cant remember the subject being discussed in the 10 years 
ive been working here said keith faulkner spokesman for the 
trades union congress the umbrella movement of british organized 
labor 
i dont see whats the big deal remarked french economist 
bernard ewenczyk a specialist in company bankruptcy law its 
not an issue here 
washington has debated a clause in the trade bill that would 
require many employers to give workers and local authorities 60 
days notice of plans to close a plant or lay off large numbers of 
people 
president reagan promised to veto the bill which was passed by 
congress he and probusiness lobbies say the bill would lead to 
government interference in the market and hamper competitiveness in 
world trade 
but union and management representatives in several european 
countries sounded surprised that anyone would deny workers the 
right to be notified that they will lose their jobs 
even in britain where prime minister margaret thatcher is busy 
stamping her freemarket antunion doctrines into the social 
fabric at least 90 days closure notice must be given by a plant 
employing 100 or more people for workforces numbering between 10 
and 99 30 days is needed 
this notice is obligatory all over europe said carlos 
liebana a spokesman for the european economic communitys social 
affairs commission its a very common thing it can be 30 
60 or 90 days but the principle of giving notice is universal 
west germany and france do not set specific periods for 
notification but their procedures are so complex that a company 
seeking to close down can expect to wait months to shut the gates 
the same goes for sweden where even the most clear cases will 
take months said jan nordin a senior employers federation 
official 
martin oertel a spokesman for ig metal west germanys largest 
union said it would be inconceivable for someone to simply 
close a plant here it would be seen as antisocial and inhuman 
no major action could be taken here without the relevant 
unions knowledge and cooperation 
in july 1986 the michelin tire giant closed its belgian plant 
without warning as two out of three shifts were away on summer 
vacation 
the reaction was universally vehement workers occupied the 
plant and authorities pressed michelin to keep it in operation 
michelin refused but compensated every worker with at least six 
months pay 
such compensation is fairly normal in europe in france for 
instance laidoff workers get 75 percent of their gross salary for 
14 months and for another 14 months if they can prove they have 
looked hard for another job 
the money comes out of the social security fund and this says 
ewenczyk is the real problem in times of high unemployment the 
social security fund cant cope with the drain 
in the past french companies had to justify closings before 
shutting down and the bureaucratic tangle could be crippling 
prime minister jacques chiracs conservative government has made 
attempts to help smaller businesses by doing away with that 
requirement for workforces numbering under 10 workers and britain 
has enacted a similar change 
but chirac has introduced a new rule companies closing plants 
have to train workers for other jobs or help them open their own 
businesses 
the situation in the united states is much rougher ewenczyk 
said here it is felt that if a company has to close it has some 
responsibility to its workers its a very european point of 
view 
in britain the opposition labor party has outlined a demand for 
companies not only to notify workers of a closing but to justify it 
to an independent body 
but among various groups questioned none expressed any 
dissatisfaction with the existing laws on notification 
in paris a spokesman for the french federation of workers said 
the union was relatively happy with the present situation 
what is happening in the united states is the reaction of a 
conservative economic policy that does not give proper 
consideration to workers he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity

jesse jackson and george bush found themselves in an unlikely 
political alliance saturday as both attacked democratic 
presidential frontrunner michael dukakis with jackson saying hes 
too conservative and bush saying hes not tough enough 
dukakis who avoided any mention of his rivals during a day of 
campaigning in ohio and indiana responded to bushs charges by 
suggesting that maybe its time for him to stop criticizing 
others 
in answer to jacksons criticisms the massachusetts governor 
cited his states economic record as an example of his strong 
leadership ability 
in another development the washington post reported in its 
sunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuit 
portray top aides to bush as being more actively involved in 
central american counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 than 
previously disclosed 
the information however does not contradict assertions by 
senior advisers donald p gregg and col samuel j watson iii that 
they were unaware until august 1986 of the plan to resupply the 
nicaraguan rebels during a ban on us aid the newspaper said 
dukakis spent the day pleading with supporters in both states to 
avoid the overconfidence that may come from his wide lead over 
jackson for the democratic presidential nomination 
i want to ask you once again to do everything you can on 
those phone banks in your neighborhoods with your friends and 
coworkers to make sure the people are taking this primary 
seriously that they know it is important dukakis said in 
cincinnati 
dukakis is heavily favored to win tuesdays primaries in ohio 
and indiana and has built up a 424delegate lead over jackson as 
the two campaigned for the democratic presidential nomination 
dukakis leads jackson by a ratio of more than 21 and has 
increased his lead over jackson in the last month according to a 
poll published in sundays editions of the columbus dispatch 
the poll showed dukakis was the favorite among 62 percent of the 
1974 registered democrats who responded to the statewide poll 
while jackson was the choice of 24 percent 
the newspaper conducted its poll by mail monday through 
thursday it has an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percent on each result 
the april poll compared with a poll the newspaper conducted in 
march that showed dukakis leading jackson 50 percent to 23 percent 
dukakis was the choice of 62 percent of the democrats likely to 
vote in ohios primary according to a statewide poll conducted by 
the university of akron 
the poll paid for by the akron beacon journal and television 
stations wcmh in columbus and wkyc in cleveland found that jackson 
had the support of 22 percent 
the telephone survey was based on telephone interviews with 926 
registered ohio voters between april 20 and saturday it had a 
margin of error of 35 percentage points 
while optimistic of his prospects in ohio and indiana dukakis 
warned his supporters that overconfidence contributed to his 1978 
defeat when he ran for reelection as governor of massachusetts 
it was the most painful experience of my life dukakis told 
workers in cleveland 
bush who also was campaigning in ohio even though he has a 
mathematical lock on the republican presidential nomination called 
for the death penalty for drug kingpins and said that both 
jackson and dukakis lack his toughness on this issue 
both dukakis and jackson oppose capital punishment 
weve appointed tougher judges we are getting more 
convictions and longer sentences but where are the democrats on 
mandatory sentencing on tougher penalties for those who poison our 
kids with drugs i favor the death penalty for drug kingpins those 
involved in drugrelated killings he said 
if michael dukakis and jesse jackson are serious about this 
lets see where they stand on throwing the book at those who are 
poisoning the lives of the young people 
jackson criticized dukakis for not going far enough in 
committing himself to spend money on such issues as child care 
southern africa education and drugs 
we need a massive commitment to invest in people reinvest in 
america and end reaganomics jackson said at a rally in columbus 
he criticized dukakis for offering 250 million in new education 
spending saying you cannot educate every child in america to go 
to college on only 250 million 
however jackson stopped short of saying that dukakis would try 
to pull democrats toward republican policies 
i would not put him in that category he said there are 
some in the democratic party who would pull our party toward 
conservatism 
democratic chairman paul kirk said jacksons charges that 
dukakis doesnt offer an alternative to republicans didnt cross 
the line into negative campaigning 
in any primary in any contest you have to have a healthy 
clash of ideas said kirk who attended a party fundraiser in 
indianapolis but thats a long way from maligning or 
smearing a candidate or having inaccuracies about the issues or the 
record 
later at a rally on the university of dayton campus jackson 
suggested that dukakis was a managerial candidate while he is a 
leader the preacherturnpolitician said attainment of peace in 
the world and altering president reagans economic policy requires 
leadership not management 
to end reaganomics we need a leader we need to change the 
course jackson told the cheering racially mixed crowd at the 
ohio school to find peace in the middle east we must have 
leadership we cannot manage apartheid we must end apartheid 
dukakis during a campaign stop in indianapolis defended 
himself against jacksons criticisms saying when it comes to 
leadership im very proud of the fact that im governor of a state 
which is generally viewed to be a state thats way out front my 
kind of leadership is as a doer and not a talker 
in response to bushs charges dukakis said i think maybe 
its time for him to stop criticizing others and to begin to 
address some fundamental issues that face this country 
bush also renewed his counterattack on the issue of attorney 
general edwin meese iii who is the subject of a number of 
investigations by an independent counsel democrats have cited 
meese as evidence of a sleaze factor in the reagan 
administration that will be an issue in the fall campaign 
ive heard dukakis and jackson talk about sleaze what are 
they talking about who are they talking about said bush are 
they convicting someone before the system works 
bush warned that if the democrats want to go down the low 
road well meet them

an aging navy nuclearpowered attack 
submarine was freed largely unscathed early saturday after going 
aground in sand and gravel off fox island in south puget sound 
navy officials said 
there was no internal damage and the hull was not damaged 
said petty officer 2nd class mike kriesel following an initial 
investigation 
the uss sam houston was moored to a navy barge in carr inlet 
about onehalf mile from where it went aground south of tacoma for 
about half a day of further checks by divers and other personnel 
the only damage they found was to some external equipment that 
was put on the ship for sound testing said lt cmdr kathy 
woodcock at the trident nuclear submarine base at bangor 
the sub which was pulled free by four navy tugs on a rising 
tide at 418 am saturday was towed to bangor late saturday 
night she said she added that she did not know why it was towed 
rather than moving under its own power and would not have further 
word on the vessel before monday 
the ethan allenclass sub based at pearl harbor was grounded 
around 6 pm friday on carr inlet about 100 yards off the 
southeast end of fox island with the tide going out said navy 
spokesman fred watson at the bangor base 
no one was injured and the subs 142 crew members remained 
aboard 
she wasnt that far dug in watson said of the stuck sub as 
an attack sub said watson the vessel carried no missiles 
a small crowd of residents and reporters gathered on the beach 
of the residential island south of tacoma to look at the sub friday 
night 
i looked down the beach and saw this nuclearpowered whale 
beached said dr john west a fox island resident 
a sonar pod beneath the sub was visible as the tide went out 
and the water was way underneath the water line said steve 
collins 41 a resident of the island its an amazing sight 
the tugs were assisted by the submarine rescue ship uss 
florikan the 410footlong sam houston sustained minor damage to 
exterior hull equipment and will undergo repairs at bangor before 
continuing operations watson said 
the navy would not disclose how the ship grounded watson said 
an investigation was under way the sub was commanded by cmdr 
phillip j kuehlen who was not immediately available for comment 
watson said 
the sub was in carr inlet where the water is about 350 feet 
deep for testing to determine how quiet it is in the water watson 
said the navy regularly tests submarine acoustics in the area 
about 15 minutes before the grounding west said he noticed a 
lot of smoke from the sub and they dove under the water 
presumably on a routine measure about 15 minutes later navy men 
in tshirts rushed to the beach and west said he then saw the sub 
was grounded 
jim saathoff another island resident said he had seen the 
submarine moving at a pretty good clip beneath the water with 
its scope up and then for whatever reason it turned toward the 
beach 
the bow of the sub was completely exposed where it ran aground 
on a gradually sloping sandy beach said saathoff 
the sam houston was launched in february 1961 at newport news 
va and commissioned 13 months later 
watson said the 250foot florikan specially equipped for 
assisting submarines in trouble happened to be in puget sound for 
crew rest and relaxation and recalibration of instruments like the 
sam houston the florikans home port is pearl harbor

in moscow sunday for the first time since the 1979 soviet drive 
into afghanistan and saw a parade strikingly free of the strident 
antiamerican rhetoric of the past 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev led 11 other politburo 
members onto the masoleum where the body of soviet founder vladimir 
i lenin lies to view the festivities marking the workers holiday 
one of the most important dates in the soviet calendar 
for two hours muscovites carrying banners and towing floats 
extolling perestroika reconstruction glasnost openness 
worldwide nuclear disarmament and other communist party programs 
strolled past the massed kremlin leadership and across sundappled 
red square 
one float demanded freedom for the people of south africa 
but few dealt with international affairs in detail beyond calling 
for peace and disarmament 
one large float stressed the need for good superpower relations 
depicting a handshake against the background of the us and soviet 
flags with the inscription da 
during the kickoff of the parade gorbachev had an animated 
conversation with party ideologue yegor k ligachev the no 2 
kremlin leader who some reports say recently had a fallingout with 
gorbachev 
us ambassador jack matlock made the first appearance by an 
american ambassador at may day since 1980 when the united states 
began boycotting the ceremony to protest the kremlins armed 
intervention in afghanistan 
im here first of all since this is not a militaryrelated 
holiday and because the agreements have been signed in geneva 
said matlock referring to accords signed in the swiss city last 
month that mandate a pullout of the 115000 soviet troops from 
afghanistan beginning may 15 
our president is due in less than a month and it seems to me 
that one should resume normal attendance at nonmilitary events 
the us ambassador added 
president ronald reagan is due in moscow on may 29june 2 for 
his fourth summit meeting with gorbachev 
gorbachevs wife raisa dressed in a long black coat cinched at 
the waist and a purple silk scarf fastened with a brooch told

meyerlandrut british ambassador sir bryan cartledge french 
ambassador yves pagniez italian ambassador sergio romano and other 
top west european envoys 
the west german ambassador andreas meyerlandrut said it was

explosives beneath a passenger bus crowded with shoppers sunday 
killing 22 people and wounding 30 others in northeastern sri lanka 
a military official said

the figure when rescue workers found more mutilated bodies aboard 
the burnedout bus 
fifteen of the 30 others were injured critically 
it occurred at the village of sittaru 25 miles southwest of the 
eastern port of trincomalee 
the military official who briefed reporters on condition of

trincomalee said sri lankan troops were being rushed to the area

explosion the second bus attack in two days 
six soldiers and five civilians were killed saturday when tamil 
rebels ambushed a bus in the town of vavuniya 135 miles northeast 
of colombo 
the rebels are fighting a nearly 5yearold insurgency to create 
a separate tamil homeland 
tamils comprise about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
population most tamils are hindus and they say they are 
discriminated against by the buddhist sinhalese majority 
sri lanka and india signed a peace accord in july that allowed 
some tamil selfrule in the north and east of the island nation 
but the tamil tigers rejected the pact and refused to lay down 
their weapons 
more than 50000 indian troops are in sri lanka now to enforce 
the accord

david angotti of the jacksonville office of the immigration and 
naturalization service took the unusual step of releasing the boys 
saturday to the temporary custody of jacksonville residents

children 
they want to build a new life said linda bellamy a 
volunteer refugee worker for st phillips episcopal church who 
helped find homes for the youths they were brave in order for

yugoslavs are entering the final 
days of a national shopping binge spurred by fears of huge price 
increases when a government freeze ends next month 
the country looks like it is preparing for war said one 
shopper last week in a crowded belgrade supermarket everybody is 
piling up stocks of staples at home 
dragan petrovic a manager of a downtown belgrade supermarket 
said he now sells one ton of sugar half a ton of coffee and 15000 
bottles of cooking oil every day which equals normal sales for a 
month 
if this shopping spree continues they will even buy my 
counter petrovic said 
the middle of may is shaping up as a crucial juncture in 
communist yugoslavias postworld war ii history the government is 
facing a confidence vote trying to lock up new credits abroad and 
introducing unpopular economic measures at home 
vice premier janez zemljaric said recently that yugoslavia 
faces economic collapse unless foreign creditors grant a 
financial reprieve 
living standards of yugoslavs have already slipped to mid1960 
levels since 1980 resulting in an unprecedented 150000 strikes 
last year 
local media have reported that about 80 percent of the countrys 
manufacturers have prepared new prices for may 15 when the 
government lifts the price freeze new prices are expected to be 50 
percent to 70 percent above current levels 
the government of premier branko mikulic said it has prepared a 
new economic program aimed at defusing the expected price and 
inflation explosion 
however doubting improvement under mikulic the parliament of 
slovenia the countrys most developed region has started a formal 
procedure to unseat the federal government 
its the first such move in communist yugoslavia and is to be 
voted on later this month by the nations five other republics 
slovenian officials have bitterly criticized mikulic and his 
administration for failing to curb the 170 percent inflation and 
for intervening in the economy 
government officials counter that their new program includes 
marketoriented measures expected eventually to curb prices and 
much less state intervention 
the officials said the new measures were worked out with the 
international monetary fund with which yugoslavia recently reached 
a draft oneyear agreement expected to be approved may 13 the 
program aims to reduce inflation to 95 percent annually by the end 
of this year 
a precondition for the new program are fresh loans and 
rescheduling of a large part of the countrys 20 billion debt 
government officials said 
yugoslavias creditors mainly 16 western governments and 
leading commercial banks have told the country that new monetary 
fund credit would be a precondition for a fresh refinancing deal 
over several years

searching for new ways to cut federal 
spending congress may finally be ready to butcher one of its most 
sacred cows outdated and unneeded military bases 
we no longer need to guard the pony express routes to the wild 
west we no longer need to maintain moated forts to guard against 
assault by british sailing ships said sen william roth rdel 
we all know why these unnecessary bases have been kept open 
roth said they have been maintained for selfish political 
reasons in order to maintain a flow of defense dollars into our 
states but the budgetary good times are gone we simply cannot 
justify throwing money away 
roth is the chief sponsor of a measure approved last week by the 
senate armed services committee as an amendment to next years 
pentagon budget bill 
roths proposal would create a ninemember commission appointed 
by the secretary of defense to look at bases around the country 
and recommend solely on the basis of national security needs 
which ones should be kept open the secretary would then be free to 
implement those recommendations unless specifically reversed by 
congress 
the same plan has been introduced in the house by rep richard 
k armey rtexas 
both roth and armey cite various estimates from previous studies 
that closing unneeded bases could save between 2 billion and 5 
billion a year 
bases mean jobs and legislators have been loath to see payrolls 
cut in the decades after world war ii the pentagon was generally 
allowed to do as it pleased on the issue with the exception of a 
handful of bases protected by key members of congress between 1961 
and 1977 the defense department cut or closed 3600 installations 
and saved an estimated 5 billion a year 
but in 1975 the air force proposed shutting down loring air 
force base a b52 base in northern maine that the service said was 
unneeded maines congressional delegation succeeded in winning 
congressional approval for a new law that required costly up to 
1 million each environmental studies for any pentagon attempt to 
close a base 
the studies were also lengthy and gave critics opposed to 
shutting a base plenty of ammunition but requirements for the 
studies would be waived under the pending commission proposal 
since 1975 no major military installations have been closed in 
1979 the pentagon proposed mothballing 157 facilities and laying 
off 45000 personnel but dropped it in the face of congressional 
opposition 
six years later defense secretary caspar weinberger suggested 
22 installations he said could be shut down but congress reacted 
strongly again and the idea went nowhere 
politics cuts both ways armey noted last year republican 
congressman said 28 bases could be closed but 27 of them were in 
districts represented in the house by democrats in 1986 
weinberger said three more facilities could be closed but they 
were all in the districts of democrats critical of weinberger and 
his idea was never seriously considered 
last year armey lost 199192 when he tried to put his base 
closure amendment into the pentagon budget bill 
but the atmosphere is different this year partly because of 
congressional agreement that the military budget is one of the few 
places left to look in the effort to find spending cuts his plan 
now has 112 cosponsors 
the chairman of the senate and house armed services committees 
suggest that this years opportunity to close bases is a unique one 
this is probably an area of waste and inefficiency that can be 
seized this year unlike any other year sen sam nunn dga 
said 
rep les aspin dwis agreed theres a good chance this 
year because of a variety of circumstances he said but even 
though weve got a lot of people on board on this theres still a 
lot of opposition he added 
under the commission plan the panel would have to make its 
recommendations by next dec 31 and defense secretary frank 
carlucci who supports the idea would have 15 days to accept or 
reject the entire list that decision would be made only five days 
before the reagan administration leaves office 
youve got a secretary of defense whos willing to make a 
choice as he leaves office aspin said thats a big factor 
armeys plan is not part of the pentagon budget bill now on the 
house floor but it will be considered separately by the chamber 
within the next month aspin said

the philadelphia naval hospital frequently 
appears on the pentagons chopping block but it has escaped the ax 
so far 
the death blow has been postponed at least until completion of 
two military studies of medical care in the region 
in february 1987 thensecretary of the navy john f lehman jr 
proposed shutting the hospital within eight months and relocating 
patients to walson army medical center at fort dix nj 
when philadelphiaarea lawmakers objected lehman modified the 
plan to allow patients to be treated at a philadelphiaarea 
hospital or medical group to be chosen through competitive bidding 
but the hospital was still scheduled to close by sept 30 
however the hospital did not close and on oct 6 lehmans 
successor james h webb jr told a house subcommittee the 
shutdown was on hold pending completion of the studies 
the hospital also survived two earlier closing attempts 
in february 1986 former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
included the hospital in a list of three installations he said were 
unneeded and could be closed to save money but opposition from 
area lawmakers saved it 
in 1980 the hospital was also in danger of closing but it 
survived then because of the arrival of the aircraft carrier 
saratoga for overhaul at the nearby philadelphia naval shipyard 
the hospital was built in 1935 and had a daily patient load of 
1000 during the vietnam war 
it employed about 820 people in 1986 but just 400 a year later 
when lehman proposed its elimination by february 1987 its daily 
patient load was just 50

proposed closing lowry air force base two years ago colorado

loring air force base may be tucked away 
in the northern maine woods but its existence has not been hidden 
from officials in washington who have slashed costs and tried to 
close the facility many times 
the strategic air command base was hit by several reductions 
during the early 1970s presidents ford and carter tried to phase 
out the base in the late 70s because of fears its proximity to the 
atlantic would make it vulnerable to submarinelaunched ballistic 
missiles 
but the pentagon backed down after maines congressional 
delegation and a save loring committee successfully argued that 
poor rural aroostook county would be economically devastated by 
the loss of the base 
since then the military has spent about 150 million to 
renovate the 2000acre base prompting rep olympia snowe 
rmaine to say in 1984 that that spending indicated the air 
forces longrange intentions toward loring 
and in recent years the base has been called valuable for its 
strategic location to canada and because it is the closest air 
force base in the continental united states to the soviet union 
loring was carved out of a virgin forest hard by the new 
brunswick canada border following world war ii it currently 
employs 3760 military and 564 civilian personnel and assigns its 
pilots to fly b52 bombers and kc135 jets

after a quartercentury of taking 
contraceptives and birthcontrol information to developing nations 
a major medical center is finding that the way you deal with people 
is as important as the technology you bring them 
twentyfive years of experience and a lot of research in 
health care generally have shown that clients tend to forget about 
half of what theyre told in a clinic dr phyllis t piotrow of 
the johns hopkins school of public health said 
in the past efforts to extend family planning to developing 
nations have focused on technical and clinical materials and 
information she said in an interview 
but were realizing more and more that if a good rapport isnt 
established with a client these programs are not going to work 
organizations around the world are beginning to recognize that 
this is a big problem she said so the moment is right to 
focus not only on what we say but how we say it 
health workers are being taught to treat clients as equals to 
ask questions that draw out more information to speak in native 
languages to use more respectful forms of address to let the 
client ask questions and many other approaches piotrow said 
to help in the effort johns hopkins in the past month has 
mailed out some 150000 copies of a special issue of its 
international journal population reports concentrating on 
counseling 
in addition special counseling seminars have been held in egypt 
and programs are being scheduled in such countries as ghana 
zimbabwe burkina faso mali zaire india brazil mexico and 
peru among others 
piotrows counseling program is getting under way even as the 
independent population reference bureau reports that world 
population is growing faster than expected 
current growth of 17 percent annually means the world could 
double its current 5 billion total in just 40 years the bureau 
reported anticipated declines in the growth rates in many less 
developed nations have not occurred as rapidly as hoped the bureau 
said 
at this stage better communication probably will make more 
difference now than any other single factor in these programs 
she said 
the federal agency for international development which supports 
her work places heavy emphasis on voluntary family planning 
programs and that requires good information for the participants 
she says 
in many ways its an effort related to the debate under way in 
the united states concentrating on what has come to be called 
patient rights to be informed and make their own medical 
decisions 
its a big challenge for people in public health because 
doctors have been used to giving orders heres a prescription 
you take it and youll get well piotrow said 
its a new era in health programs and its going to depend on 
individuals making informed choices themselves 
in the age of modern technology medical personnel learned 
how to use all the machines but somehow the interpersonal side got 
a little neglected she added 
once counselors understand better ways to deal with clients the 
same approaches can be used in aids counseling nutrition 
counseling and even drug counseling she added

a grand jury will release its findings on 
criminal intent this week in the police bombing three years ago of 
the radical group move in which 11 people died and 61 homes were 
destroyed by a resulting fire 
police arranged the bombing of the barricaded and heavily 
fortified row house on may 13 1985 in an attempt only to evict 
the move followers neighbors had complained to city officials and 
threatened to take matters into their own hands if nothing was done 
about the group 
members of the mysterious group whose name did not stand for 
anything in particular championed backtonature rituals lived in 
filth refused to send their children to school and openly 
disobeyed health and safety laws authorities said 
an investigating commission said the group had evolved into an 
authoritarian violencethreatening cult 
the police bomb touched off a rooftop fire that soon raged out 
of control while firemen held back afraid they would be hit by 
gunfire that had echoed through the neighborhood the 11 killed 
five of them children were all inside the move house 
no one has been accused of any criminal act in the bombing but 
both philadelphia county and federal grand juries began 
investigating the philadelphia report is due tuesday 
i would really be hardpressed quite frankly to see how any 
grand jury could come out with any indictments other than a 
scathing report said robert hurst president of the fraternal 
order of police 
officers built the bomb and dropped it from a helicopter after 
getting approval from mayor w wilson goode 
a special commission appointed by goode later charged the mayor 
was grossly negligent in approving the bombing it also 
condemned the use of gunfire by police as reckless and 
unconscionable 
relatives of the mostly black move victims denounced goode the 
first black mayor in the nations fifth largest city as a 
murderer and have sued the city for damages 
only two people a woman and boy escaped from the house the 
12yearold boy claimed others tried to flee but were driven back 
by gunfire 
sources quoted in saturdays editions of the philadelphia 
inquirer and philadelphia daily news said the grand jury would 
recommend no criminal charges but would be harshly critical of 
officials involved 
the charges wouldnt survive a preliminary hearing said an 
unidentified source quoted by the daily news which said sources 
told it the panel concluded that proving criminal intent would be 
difficult 
its a very detailed legal analysis of everything that 
happened on that day a source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the inquirer this will lay out in one complete 
document by a grand jury the facts as they found them to be and i 
think will lay rest to virtually every question that exists 
district attorney ronald castille asked about his nearly 
twoyear investigation of the case refused to say whether he 
expected criminal indictments its totally up to the grand 
jury he said 
no comment echoed joseph kovitsky of the justice 
department whose attorneys are in charge of an investigation into 
whether the bombing violated anyones civil rights 
the federal grand jury also is reportedly winding up its work 
goode who took responsibility for approving the dropping of the 
bomb has said repeatedly that he doesnt believe he will be 
indicted 
other possible targets are former city managing director leo 
brooks who ran operations at the move scene former police 
commissioner gregore sambor who planned the bombing and fire 
commissioner william richmond 
damage caused by the police action has exceeded 20 million 
including rebuilding the burneddown neighborhood that originally 
left some 250 homeless 
the mayor barely won reelection last november winning by only 
17000 votes out of morethan 750000 cast in a city where democrats 
have a nearly 3 to 1 edge 
surviving move members have disappeared or are in jail founder 
john africa born as vincent leaphart died in the fire 
children once a central part of the group have been cared for 
and raised by the city to the extent of private tutoring in an 
effort to return them to society

george bush says there isnt a short list 
there isnt a long list yet of possible running mates but he 
indicates with some understatement that he wants to use less frenzy 
in the selection than ronald reagan did eight years ago 
i hope ill make as good a choice but ill use a different 
method says the vice president who clinched enough delegates 
last week to put a lock on the republican presidential nomination 
bush was an 11th hour compromise at the 1980 convention after a 
chaotic few days during which reagan toyed with the idea of sharing 
the ticket with former president gerald ford 
with the luxury of time bush insists he hasnt begun to even 
consider a vice presidential choice or to set up a selection 
process and likely wont pick a running mate until after the 
democratic convention in july 
the only list of names is the one hes got in his mind and he 
isnt telling anybody spokesman peter teeley said 
but that doesnt stop the speculation from flying 
as bush travels around the country he is constantly bombarded 
with questions on the subject more often than not the queries 
have a clear regional flavor 
campaigning in buffalo bush was asked if he might pick 
vanquished rival rep jack kemp rny in hershey pa reporters 
wanted to know about former pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh 
in philadelphia it was new jersey governor tom kean in 
evansville ind sen richard lugar rind 
i really have not sat down with advisers or set out the 
procedures to follow bush told reporters last week of course 
im going to do that 
conventional political wisdom suggests that the nominee can do 
best by selecting a running mate from a different region of the 
country from his own 
for bush that would rule out a lot of potential contenders 
since he claims links to texas where he maintains a voting 
residence maine where he has a home connecticut where he grew 
up and massachusetts where he was born 
that appears to leave the west and midwest and among those 
frequently mentioned as possibilities are california gov george 
deukmejian illinois governor jim thompson or one of the doles 
either former rival sen bob dole of kansas or his wife elizabeth 
but bush downplays geography as a crucial factor 
we are in a new communications age these geographical things 
are important but far less important than they used to be he 
suggested recently 
the vice president has denied reports that he had already set up 
a search team claiming no one authorized by me is involved in 
any such activity 
bush aides say he will exercise more caution in picking a ticket 
mate because as vice president himself for eight years he is 
extremely sensitive to the nature of the job 
bush says he wants to make sure he picks someone whos on the 
same wave length as he is as well as a person he is careful to 
say man or woman qualified to take over as president should 
anything happen to him 
along with elizabeth dole three other women are mentioned 
prominently in speculation as possible running mates former un 
ambassador jeane kirkpatrick supreme court justice sandra day 
oconnor and kansas sen nancy landon kassebaum 
but bush just isnt giving out any hints one way or the other 
i vowed not to get into speculation on that question until 
after the democratic convention and then probably not say anything 
about it he said 
agreeing there isnt much excitement on the republican side of 
the presidential race these days bush also hints that withholding 
the name will provide an element of suspense that might pass as 
excitement 
still bush says suggestions keep coming to him unsolicited 
over the transom under the door in plain brown envelopes 
at one news conference he told reporters that he had in fact 
just received one patting his shirt pocket

a 170member high school marching band from 
pennsylvania barely had room to maneuver their trombones sunday at 
the great wall but may day crowds climbed the ramparts and peered 
over the parapets to see them play 
the pennsbury high school band from fairless hills pa 
entertained thousands of visitors to the wall with renditions of 
the us and chinese national anthems a medley of american songs 
its a small world and other tunes 
i was very pleased now im very harried said band director 
michael grothman as his young musicians trading their orange 
black and white uniforms for tshirts and jeans scattered for 
sightseeing on chinas most famous monument

daughters in the band 
the band was unable to parade on the cramped and crowded wall 
the crowd strung out along the wall was curious but unresponsive 
even when the american shouted out a loud ni hao or hello 
one 9yearold nodded uncertainly when asked if he liked the 
music a young woman commented that chinese high schools also have 
bands but nothing so grand as this 
wendy gallena a 17yearold senior and pompom captain said 
being able to play on the great wall was really emotional she 
said the great wall was awesome 
hansel who sells processing equipment in china helped work out 
the trip after the band was one of eight to play in the 1986 new 
years day parade of roses in pasadena calif 
we wanted to take this art to as many people as we could he

apart sunday and at least 26 passengers were killed when tamil 
rebels detonated explosives buried in the ground military 
officials said 
thirty people were injured and 15 of them were in critical 
condition at local hospitals the officials said it was the second 
tamil attack on a passenger bus in two days 
the blast threw bodies into the dense jungle beside the road 
near the village of sittaru 25 miles southwest of the eastern port 
of trincomalee about 75 passengers were aboard the bus and 
officials were searching for more victims 
most of the victims were sinhalese the majority ethnic group on 
the island said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the dead included two little boys they said 
on saturday tamil militants ambushed a bus in the northern 
vavuniya district killing five civilians and six sri lankan 
soldiers who were guarding the vehicle 
the predominantly hindu tamils who make up 18 percent of the 
nations 16 million population claim they are discriminated 
against by the buddhist sinhalese who are 75 percent of the people 
and control the government and military 
militant tamils have been waging a guerrilla war for an 
independent homeland since 1983 in the north and east where most 
tamils live

when george bush visited ohio state 
university he picked up one legendary buckeyes endorsement from 
beyond the grave 
the vice president got a spirited reception at the student union 
over the weekend after a rousing introduction from gene watts an 
ohio state history professor who is a republican state senator 
watts doubled as a medium on this occasion too delivering up 
this message for bush from the late great ohio state football 
coach woody hayes 
woody and i would often get together not to discuss football 
but rather history and politics watts said 
in one of those conversations and im remembering this i 
believe exactly woody hayes who was just a strong supporter of 
george bush said to me professor george bush is going to be the 
best president in the 20th century watts said to cheers 
bush and hayes were buddies the vice president attended the 
funeral of the colorful irascible coach who lost his job after 
striking an opposing teams player 
bush picked up the football metaphor and ran with it 
this is the age of glamour and hot rhetoric but look at 
woodys record 13 big ten titles eight rose bowls two national 
championships its exactly what were going to do were going 
to pound out those yards 3 yards and a cloud of dust and whip 
either jesse jackson or michael dukakis let me at em come 
fall 
his rivals he said are full of gloom and doom they want to 
drop back fall on the ball and then punt 
bush went from metaphor to reality donning a scarlet athletic 
jacket and walking to midfield before 60000 ohio state fans to 
give the referees the official game ball for a spring football 
scrimmage

bush often talks about how happy he is to have sewed up the 
republican nomination and how eager to get on with the fall 
campaign 
but the race he really seems to want to run has already been 
waged eight years ago 
he seldom fails to invoke the memory of a democratic shade 
jimmy carter who lost the white house to ronald reagan and bush in 
1980 
the memory of carter hangs over democrats like a shadow an 
unwanted reminder of the last time they were in washington bush 
said at a cleveland rally 
in columbus he said the democrats rhetoric sounds exactly 
like jimmy carter prime rate of interest at 21 percent and 
doubledigit inflation and blaming the american people for 
failure it is an exact overlay of what went on from 1977 to 
1981 
bush lauds the longest recovery in history that has occurred 
on reagans watch 64 months long with 15 million new jobs 
he seldom mentions the near tripling of the national debt that 
has also occurred on his watch he calls the deficit the biggest 
economic problem but says i blame the congress they are 
spending us into debt

bushs syntax sometimes gets the best of him and he coins words 
with abandon 
a paean to the american spirit the spirit of optimism and 
determination that enabled american settlers to push past the snows 
and the deserts of the west as he said in marietta ohio came 
out this way in a fort wayne ind factory were the united 
states of america we rolled back the frontiers and battled the 
deserts and the snows 
elsewhere in fort wayne drug traffickers became 
narcotrafficanters 
he complained to reporters in cleveland about the glamorizing of 
drugs in a video that he and his wife rented bush said the movie 
which he did not name was almost a societal condoneation of 
cocaine

patrick johnsons friends winked and 
joked about improvements in his social life when he announced he 
was going to the almost exclusively female mount holyoke college 
for a year 
life at the school of 2000 women however has been no joke for 
johnson 
i felt like the ultimate minority he said its not quite 
so fun as you might think 
fellow male student alex ommaya still gets school mail addressed 
to miss ommaya after more than a year at mount holyoke one 
recent missive reminded him that he will need a white dress for the 
alumni day parade later this month 
im thinking of wearing a toga said ommaya 
johnson and ommaya comprise twothirds of the entire male 
student population at the exclusive school the other third is josh 
winchell who is spending a semester there as an exchange student 
from wesleyan university in middletown conn 
even the ebullient resilient winchell found his first week at 
mount holyoke slightly rough but i have two sisters so i didnt 
see this as a major obstacle he said 
the 151yearold undergraduate college in rural western 
massachusetts has long resisted the tide of coeducation that has 
swept other singlesex schools but does admit men to its graduate 
programs in the sciences 
the school also allows men from four nearby colleges amherst 
hampshire smith and the university of massachusetts to take 
classes and has an exchange program with 11 other northeast 
colleges 
but mount holyoke sends more students off to coed campuses than 
it brings in said dean of studies sarah sutherland she said male 
exchange students consequently stand out but if this institution 
has any mission ultimately it is the obliteration of 
discrimination on the grounds of sex 
ommaya 23 of bethesda md was admitted to mount holyokes 
twoyear graduate program in neuroscience after graduating from 
vassar college in poughkeepsie ny he will be the lone male to 
graduate from the school this month 
he also is the only man to head a student campus organization 
he said he was appointed to run the office that provides student 
entertainment because he was the only applicant 
he did so well at perking up a reportedly dismal night life by 
opening a piano bar and holding casino and masquerade parties 
that he was honored by the student government association for his 
contribution to the college 
ommaya said he wasnt aware mount holyoke was a womens school 
when he applied after reading about the neuroscience program in a 
catalog that neglected to mention men were scarce on campus 
vassar is also a seven sisters school so i should have known 
but mount holyoke is not one of the sisters you remember he 
said vassar is now coeducational 
he said an admissions officers questions tipped him off she 
kept asking me why i wanted to go here what i would get as a male 
from it i finally figured out why when i looked it up in 
barrons a college guide 
the schools singlesex status did not dissuade him it was 
just an interesting factor 
the first few months however were tough ommaya was stared at 
during dormitory meals stopped and questioned on his way to class 
its the first time ive ever been discriminated against as a 
white man he said 
in time the stares stopped and he developed friendships but he 
longed for male company and like some lonely women began to 
ponder obsessively the question how can i meet men 
i had to keep myself from walking up to men and saying hi 
howre you doin do you want to be friends he said 
the son of a mount holyoke english professor johnson came to 
the school for a tuitionfree year to catch up on physics and other 
courses before returning to swarthmore college outside philadelphia 
the 20yearold junior said he wasnt prepared for the 
overwhelmingly female environment i got tremendously freaked out 
at first just sitting in classes full of women he said but 
people were very nice actually 
nevertheless his experience at mount holyoke has soured him 
permanently on womens colleges 
i think that to spend the years of 18 to 22 on a campus with 
all women its got to be a little bit strange he said

three british soldiers were 
killed sunday and three were injured when irish republican army 
terrorists sprayed one car with machinegun fire and blew up 
another in separate attacks 
the ira claimed responsibility for both attacks in a statement 
delivered to media in belfast northern ireland 
we have a simple message for prime minister margaret 
thatcher disengage from ireland and there will be peace if not 
there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will 
regularly be at airports awaiting your dead it said 
the 130 am car bomb tore apart a vehicle as it left the 
parking lot of a discotheque frequented by british troops in 
nieuwbergen a country town on the west germandutch border two of 
the three royal air force men inside were killed immediately the 
third was admitted to the intensive care ward of a local hospital 
his condition was not immediately known 
it was like a plane going through the sound barrier said 
piet hubbers who heard the blast from his home five miles away 
the car was already on fire twenty yards away a boy 
soldier was lying all covered in blood said another witness 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bodies were in such condition that they could not 
immediately be identified police spokesman louis steens said 
an hour earlier in the border community of roermond about 30 
miles away gunmen opened fire on three british air force men who 
had just gotten into their car after leaving a cafe district 
prosecutor rolph gonsalves told reporters 
they were fired on from very close range probably with 
automatic weapons he said 
senior aircraftsman ian shinner 20 died at the scene another 
was in serious condition at a local hospital and a third was 
treated for minor shoulder injuries the injured were not 
identified 
they were the first ira attacks in nearly 10 years in the 
netherlands authorities have attributed the lack of violence to 
the nations apparent reputation as a haven for ira activists 
we of course have to consider that it could be the start of a 
new series of attacks gonsalves said 
the last ira attack here was march 22 1979 when british 
ambassador richard sykes was assassinated outside his home in the 
hague 
the latest victims were all based in west germany and off duty 
at the time of the attacks they were in the netherlands to take 
part in local festivities marking the 50th birthday of dutch queen 
beatrix 
both targeted cars had british license plates 
the ira statement of responsibility was signed with the 
pseudonym p oneil republican publicity bureau in dublin a 
name the ira uses in such announcements 
british security forces are the main targets of the ira the 
mainly roman catholic guerrilla group fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland 
there are several british military installations are along the 
dutchwest german border 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp british 
defense secretary george younger condemned the killing of totally 
innocent people who he said were off duty and were unarmed and 
were nothing to do with any military operation whatever 
denzil davies the opposition labor partys defense spokesman 
said the victims were in germany and holland doing their duty as 
part of our nato obligations and there is not one shred of 
justification for attacking them in this way 
sectarian and political violence has taken about 2600 lives 
since it flared in northern ireland in 1969 the deaths include 819 
members of the british security forces

when the alarm sounded in the chicago fire 
departments 9th division no one raced for the firetrucks 
most of the firefighters only laughed cheered and raised their 
beer bottles when the lights and the sirens went off for the last 
time others took a final slide down the brass pole 
the occasion was the retirement of jim rzonca 74 ending his 
watch as the departments favorite saloonkeeper after 45 years of 
chasing firetrucks and washing the smoke out of firefighters 
throats at his jims fire barn 
jims been to more fires than most firemen said capt jim 
dean president of the chicago fire officials association and he 
probably knows more about the fire department than most fire 
chiefs 
dean was among several hundred firefighters and other friends 
who crowded the tavern late saturday in honor of the closing 
standing three deep at the long bar and clustered around the free 
buffet of italian and polish specialities 
ive been coming here ever since i joined the fire department 
in 1965 and my father who was a captain too came here before 
me said dean there arent nine official divisions in the 
department but we call this place the 9th division as sort of a 
code name 
jim keeps a fire scanner going behind the bar and knows where 
every unit is going but sometimes we had to tend bar ourselves 
because he was out chasing fires 
rzonca fell in love with firefighting as a boy when he delivered 
newspapers to the local firehouse but his only official fire 
department job was for three months with the fire marshals office 
before he and his wife stella opened the tavern now their two 
sons are firefighters 
the tavern walls were covered with fire memorabilia model 
firetrucks oxygen masks diving tanks photographs of notable 
fires badges and helmets 
while posing for a photographer on closing night rzonca donned 
a helmet from the special force that protected the century of 
progress exposition in 1933 
i have helmets from almost every battalion in chicago most of 
the suburbs and plenty from other cities and states said rzonca 
people make jokes about visiting firemen but i always treated 
them like real guests 
i can go to the fire department in just about any city and be 
treated well myself especially if i take the time to be nice to 
the firehouse cook 
one special glass case contained helmets and dress caps from 
firefighters who died on duty or from injuries suffered fighting 
fires 
i had some very sad experiences not being a real firefighter 
and being around these men all the time he said 
on a lighter note rzonca remembered a succession of dogs that 
divided their lives between various firehouses and his tavern 
most in keeping with tradition were dalmatians 
one engine company dropped off buster said he was so dumb 
he couldnt be trained he recalled i taught him to pose for 
pictures with his head and paws hanging out of the hookandladder 
window i even got him to wear football shoulderpads 
rzonca admitted he really didnt want to hang up his own helmet 
oh im closing all right rzonca said but after a month 
or so i wouldnt be suprised if i didnt open up again as a 
threenightsaweek private club firefighters only

with the amnesty program for illegal aliens 
about to end the government is preparing to shift the emphasis on 
immigration reform to employers 
the immigration reform and control act of 1986 mandates 
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers 
starting june 1 the immigration and naturalization service has 
the discretion to issue warning citations or to levy fines against 
employers who violate the law currently the ins must initially 
issue warning citations 
the agency will remain flexible and there wont be a 
crackdown with fines starting june 1 immigration commissioner 
alan nelson said in an interview with reporters last week 
the purpose of sanctions isnt to penalize employers nelson 
said the purpose is to keep employers from hiring illegal aliens 
and if you can do it with a positive twist youre a lot better off 
be sure theyre educated be sure they understand why its 
good business for them to not hire cheap illegal labor nelson 
said 
we can always tighten the screws to the employers and were 
doing that but he said the sanctions portion of the program 
would proceed through a gradual deliberate building process 
the agency is to hire 900 additional investigators through the 
beginning of next year and one of their prime duties will be to 
participate in the employer sanctions program 
to date the ins has issued 2000 citations to employers and 
levied 80 to 90 fines 
nelson expressed satisfaction that congress refused to extend 
the 12month amnesty program for illegal aliens which ends at 
midnight wednesday 
he said the purpose of the yearandahalfold law of which the 
amnesty program is a part is to stop illegal immigration 
we wouldnt want to send a message below the border that its 
still ok to come here illegally and then if you do there still 
might be amnesty nelson said congress made it clear one 
time only and stuck to their guns 
nelson said legalization offices will be open until midnight 
wednesday and amnesty candidates standing in line at that time will 
be processed 
the senate last thursday blocked a sevenmonth extension of the 
amnesty program for undocumented immigrants 
although amnesty requests have soared in recent weeks as the 
deadline approaches applications are running significantly behind 
initial projections amnesty requests total 129 million with 
another 440000 people applying under a program for agricultural 
workers the ins had estimated as many as 2 million would apply 
nelson said nobody knows how many illegal aliens might 
qualify for the amnesty program and he downplayed the 2 million 
figure he said applications are falling somewhat below initial 
estimates partly because nonprofit groups and other nongovernment 
community groups overestimated the number of applications they 
would help the ins handle 
under the 1986 law aliens who came to this country illegally 
before jan 1 1982 and who have lived here continually since then 
may apply for amnesty

michael dukakis who promises to use allegations 
of wrongdoing in the reagan administration against george bush can 
expect swift return fire from the vice president whose campaign is 
being helped by two longtime adversaries of the likely democratic 
nominee 
bush aides said last week they were researching scandals 
during dukakis three terms as massachusetts governor to use if 
dukakis attacks bushs integrity 
the aides also said bush would not hesitate to take the 
offensive against dukakis a point bush himself is underscoring 
there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a 
guiltbyassociation mode where we can find in massachusetts 
politics the vice president said friday weve got some cannon 
fodder 
bush spokesman peter teeley sounded a similar warning 
politicians live in glass houses and they better be damn 
careful when they start throwing stones teeley said i think 
dukakis better be very careful about the socalled sleaze 
factor 
but dukakis spokesman leslie dach indicated the issue would be 
raised 
the vice president knows that the vast majority of americans 
have serious questions about his commitment to ethics in 
government dach said this administration is living in a very 
precarious glass house 
dukakis frequently criticizes attorney general edwin meese 
saying administration officials including bush should force meese 
to resign because of his legal troubles 
aides said he would intensify that attack following a bush 
comment friday that he certainly would hire meese if a special 
prosecutor investigating meeses conduct found no wrongdoing 
dukakis also has derided influencepeddling in the 
administration apparent references to convictions of two former 
reagan aides michael deaver and lyn nofziger for wrongdoing in 
connection with lobbying of the white house 
dukakis has never been tied to wrongdoing but there have been 
several occasions during his tenure when officials have faced 
criminal charges or been forced to resign because of improper 
activities 
the governor has a reputation as a reformist dating back to his 
days as a legislator in the 1960s he was elected governor in 1974 
and 1982 in elections in which corruption was a major issue 
ive been around the politics business for almost 30 years and 
of all the people ive dealt with ive never dealt with anybody 
with more integrity said former massachusetts attorney general 
francis x bellotti the states top prosecutor during eight of 
dukakis 10 years as governor 
new hampshire republican gov john sununu a frequent dukakis 
critic offered a preview of a possible line of attack last week 
frankly i think mike dukakis is going to have to answer to 
such charges of i guess the phrase the media has been using is 
the sleaze issue sununu told a news conference 
atop sununus laundry list was the guilty plea last month of 
former dukakis education adviser gerard indelicato to charges he 
helped steal 80000 in grant money indelicato had been a dukakis 
campaign worker and was appointed president of a small state 
college a post he resigned just before being indicted in the fraud 
case 
controversies during dukakis administrations include convictions 
last year of nine police officers and an exlegislative aide in a 
scheme involving the theft of promotional exams a dukakis 
appointee had named one of those convicted as superintendent of the 
metropolitan district commission police 
the previous superintendent named by the same dukakis 
appointee retired after being reprimanded for approving an 
electronic sweep of the office of a state legislator under federal 
investigation former massachusetts us attorney william weld a 
republican thanked the dukakis administration for its help in the 
examscam investigation 
in 1985 the no 2 man in the state department of public safety 
robert h cunningham resigned after reports he associated with a 
convicted gambler 
helping bush attack dukakis is former democratic gov edward 
king who defeated dukakis in 1978 and then lost in a 1982 rematch 
king now a republican has attacked dukakis during recent 
appearances on nationally syndicated television shows 
but kings own tenure as governor was marred by scandals and 
that could prove a liability in efforts to attack dukakis

jesse jackson striking a combative stance as 
he loses ground to democratic presidential rival michael dukakis 
plans to campaign in every state remaining on the primary calendar 
presenting himself as the clear alternative to the republicans 
in the face of dukakis widening lead in the delegate count 
hes ahead by roughly 400 jackson vows he wont give up his 
fight and he wont entertain what he calls absurd talk about 
his going for a vice presidential spot 
focusing heavily on delegaterich california jackson says he 
will not slacken his campaign pace and will stage advertising 
campaigns in each of the upcoming states 
you cant win unless you go there said campaign manager 
gerald austin were going to be taking our message everywhere 
austins tone was emphatic in the wake of jacksons own public 
contradiction of comments austin made last week in published 
remarks austin downplayed prospects of winning the nomination and 
spoke more in terms of jacksons achievements in broadening the 
democratic party 
although it appears a unlikely that jackson can overtake dukakis 
in delegates before the primaries end june 7 jackson himself is 
telling his supporters not to give up hope 
the last big primaries are june 7 in california and new jersey 
and the campaign for socalled super delegates continues the 
convention begins july 18 
jacksons stilldeveloping schedule calls for him to spend a day 
each in montana new mexico nebraska and west virginia which also 
hold late contests 
he tentatively plans three days in new jersey four days in 
oregon and the rest of the time in california where 314 democratic 
delegates are up for grabs on june 7 said campaign political 
director frank watkins 
austin said jackson will continue to appeal to the ethnic 
groups gays and the economically struggling who have been the 
focus of his campaign so far 
while continuing to rail agains the reagan administration and 
stress the importance of a democratic victory jackson will 
increasingly emphasize distinctions between himself and dukakis on 
the issues austin said 
jackson unveiled that strategy this past week in contrast to 
his earlier aversion to criticizing democratic rivals jackson is 
portraying dukakis as an uninspiring candiate who is lacking a 
clear commitment to reverse reagans economic programs 
austin and other campaing aides declined to discuss what states 
they expect to do best in but austin said jackson should do better 
in tuesdays ohio primary than he does in indiana with a primary 
the same day because jackson has spent little time in indiana 
he filed delegate slates in only 18 of ohios 21 congressional 
districts but austin said the campaign is contesting every one of 
those districts 
jacksons buying up of 400000 worth of air time in ohio 
includes a new ad that will attack dukakis as wiling only to 
manage reaganomics not to bring about real economic change 
jackson is also becoming increasingly sensitive about his aides 
commenting publicly on strategy campaign aides have been 
closemouthed following jacksons reaction to the austin remarks 
about his campaign prospects 
im not commenting today said longtime jackson aide frank 
watkins when asked about the campaign game plan 
he doesnt like poeple boxing him in on options said one 
jackson adviser he is his own person and has his own sense of 
where his campaign is going said the source speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the jackson camp expects to have a significant impact on the 
democratic party platform and discussions on that should begin 
soon aides said 
one adviser even said he has no doubt that the party will allow 
the jackson campaign which has taken the lead in shaping campaign 
issues to write the platform 
the camapign recently won a court victory in new jersey that 
makes it easier for people to vote for for jackson and his 
delegates by pulling the voting lever just once instead of several 
times but austin said he does not envision any new legal 
challenges at this time 
however he added things can come up many states have 
delegateselection processes that continue after their initial 
primaries or caucuses

when a 200ton crane lifted the clipper 
schooner pride of baltimore ii into the inner harbor to the cheers 
of thousands this rejuvenated city got a new clipper but the 
old pride mayor kurt l schmoke said 
the rebuilding of the citys goodwill ambassador ship whose 
predecessor sank 240 miles north of puerto rico in a microburst of 
wind and rain on may 14 1986 came about because of intense public 
pressure the mayor acknowledged 
without your help the pride of baltimore ii would have 
remained just a wish and a promise schmoke told people jammed 
into every available vantage point near the pride and on historic 
federal hill overlooking the harbor 
the pride of baltimore is a labor of community love the 
mayor said the pride in baltimore has been uninterrupted 
from the very start 
the outpouring of public sentiment which changed the minds of 
officials initially opposed to building a second clipper schooner 
was acknowledged in bittersweet ceremonies saturday when baltimore 
dedicated the new vessel in memory of all marylanders lost at sea 
four crew members died in the 1986 sinking of the original pride 
the ceremony included music by the redcostumed us marine 
band a procession of maryland schoolchildren bearing symbols of 
their areas of the state the firing of muskets by the fort mchenry 
guard and a parade of tall ships 
the first pride which promoted baltimore and maryland in 
harbors around the world was launched by the same bethlehem steel 
crane known as big red in 1977 
the new pride 110 tons of finely crafted hardwoods and ballast 
without the masts and engines to be added in coming months took 
form at a waterfront construction site 
gov william donald schaefer baltimores mayor when the first 
pride was launched and when it was lost said he had two wishes for 
the new vessel god smile on this ship god keep that crew 
safe he said his voice breaking 
the launch attended by former pride crewmembers and two 
survivors of the pride sinking also included the ceremonial 
ringing of the pride bell produced by the mcshane bell foundry co 
inc of glen burnie and presented to the pride of baltimore 
organization by us rep helen delich bentley rmd 
we are here today to christen a unique vessel that will 
serve as goodwill ambassador a vessel that will also serve as a 
living memorial to captain armin elsaesser iii nina francesca 
schack vincent lazzaro and barry duckworth who lost their lives 
on that fateful day in may 1986 she said 
moments later with shipwrights guiding thick yellow cables by 
hand and derrick operator bill ward working from the crane control 
booth the pride made the short journey from the construction site 
to the water accompanied by wild cheering cannon fire and fireboat 
sprays 
the ship will undergo sea trials in the fall

an american who is the only rabbi for east 
germanys tiny jewish community said sunday hes leaving the 
communist country because of intolerable working conditions caused 
by attempts to silence him 
isaac neuman a polishborn survivor of auschwitz and nine other 
nazi concentration camps said he will depart for good by years 
end 
in an interview at his east berlin apartment the controversial 
65yearold rabbi talked of interference from jewish leadership and 
objected to government treatment of his religious community 
there regularly are informers at every worship service and at 
every class he said 
neuman became the only rabbi for the nations 350 officially 
registered jews on sept 23 he was the nations first rabbi in 21 
years 
about half of east berlins estimated 200 jews are more than 60 
years old most were locked up went into hiding or fled the 
country during the third reich neuman said some came back later 
from the united states and other places 
the rabbi received great press attention in the west and in east 
germany when he came to be their spiritual leader 
now he says he will leave later this month its conceivable 
it is for good but i may be back in september he said i have 
no intention of being here beyond 1988 because the situation is 
too impossible to work 
he said he would return to his home in champaign ill 
neuman went to the united states in 1950 after his studies he 
served as rabbi in cedar rapids iowa from 1961 to 1974 and in 
champaign from 1974 to 1987 
he had retired before taking the job in east berlin he said he 
had always viewed it as a temporary assignment 
neuman said leadership of the local jewish community kept a 
close watch on his activities he said there might be orders from 
somewhere to keep me under control 
he also said there have been efforts within the jewish community 
to silence him he was hampered in setting up religious education 
classes for adults he said 
other frustrations included a monthly jewish community bulletin 
that omitted mention of last months anniversary of the warsaw 
ghettos jewish uprising against the nazis in world war ii in 
addition neuman complained of an east german cartoonist who he 
said plies antisemitic themes 
during the rabbis stay he also took to task the editor of one 
of the official government newspapers for reporting on clashes in 
israel he came away without a correction or retraction 
neuman in turn has been criticized by germans 
the jewish community in east berlin is startled by the 
unconventionality and the independence of their rabbi the 
authoritative west german frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper 
said in a profile on april 19 the newspaper also said the 
temperamental rabbi had threatened to leave in the past even 
though he has things well over there 
a large apartment and a car are provided for him the 
frankfurter allgemeine said 
neuman is paid by east berlins jewish community which receives 
funds from the communist government 
neuman says he has been careful as a foreigner to avoid 
involvement in the nations growing dissident movement openly 
supported by parts of the lutheran church 
but he expressed frustration with the governments stance toward 
the jewish community he said it should help renovate the 
dilapidated jewish community building 
neuman also said most jews in east berlin will be sorry to see 
him go 
but there were will be a few other people who will be glad 
because then they have it under control again he said

a preliminary report on a 1985 air crash in 
newfoundland that killed 248 us troops omits evidence of a 
possible explosion or flash fire on board critics say 
the report by the canadian aviation safety board distributed 
confidentially in december concludes that failure to deice the 
wings of the heavily loaded arrow air charter probably caused the 
dec 12 1985 crash two canadian newspapers reported over the 
weekend 
but the ottawa citizen and the toronto globe and mail said the 
preliminary conclusion caused a major split in the 10member board 
board chairman bernard m deschenes resigned last week and was 
replaced by a senior civil servant ken thorneycroft 
the board refused to comment on the reported split the papers 
said 
too many items were excluded as posible contributions to the 
cause of the crash les benjamin an opposition new democratic 
party member of parliament was quoted as saying 
the plane crashed moments after takeoff at gander airport and 
all 248 us servicemen on board and eight crew members were killed 
the members of the 101st airborne division were flying home to 
kentucky after peacekeeping duties in the middle east 
the aircrafts cockpit voice recorder was not working and its 
antiquated flight data recorder provided little information the 
devastated wreckage also made the investigation difficult 
but the ottawa citizen said us explosives expert irving pinkel 
of san diego was hired by the airlines insurance company to comb 
the wreckage and concluded that an explosion aboard caused the 
crash 
he said he found strong evidence of explosion damage in a 
blownout section of the fuselage at the front of the passenger 
cabin the paper reported 
pinkel was quoted as saying the fuselage appeared to have been 
punched out by an object that struck the hole at high speed 
but pinkels findings were discounted and not included in the 
boards draft report the citizen said 
it said the boards chief investigator peter boag dismissed 
pinkels view in 1986 our investigators have completed their 
examinations of the relevant fuselage sections and have found no 
evidence to support pinkels contention that the holes were caused 
by the preimpact explosion 
boag said royal canadian mounted police forensic experts found 
no explosives residue 
opposition members of parliament say the boards preliminary 
report also leaves out evidence that the plane may have been on 
fire before it crashed two truck drivers say they saw flames 
coming from the dc8 just after takeoff 
they were in separate trucks driving along the transcanada 
highway said george baker a liberal party lawmaker from 
newfoundland but apparently eyewitness testimony is not 
reliable 
he said the fire evidence was left out simply because it didnt 
concur with the boards conclusions 
one theory on the crash is that the soldiers were bringing back 
flares shells and practice grenades that may have exploded on 
board 
the ottawa citizen said arrow air has asked for a judicial 
inquiry into what it alleges has been a biased investigation 
the toronto star quoted john batchelor chairman of the 
miamibased airline as saying we still dont fully agree with 
the icing theory 
the star said autopsy results showed the blood of some soldiers 
contained lethal doses of cyanide frequently found after airliner 
fires 
thorneycroft a former deputy commander of the north american 
aerospace defense command in colorado springs colo said on 
friday that the board still isnt close to release of its report 
to the public theres still issues we are trying to come to 
grips with 
he denied any suppression of evidence and pledged a full 
review before a final report comes out probably next year 
there was no coverup and there wont be a coverup he said 
in 1986 deschenes ruled out terrorism as the cause of the crash 
the us national transportation safety board us army and 
us federal aviation administration also took part in the 
investigation but ultimate responsibility lies with the canadian 
panel

each of the four irancontra defense teams 
will have a suite in a washington office building rented by the 
federal government as a secure facility to hold thousands of 
classified documents 
the government is paying 24 a square foot annually for the 
12000 feet of space 288000 a year which will be for the 
exclusive use of the defense and available 24 hours a day 
the defense may be reviewing as many as 300000 classified 
documents in what is dubbed a sensitive compartmented information 
facility or scif 
a secure facility is required when classified documents are 
needed in a court case in the past such facilities usually were 
established in a government building such as the justice department 
the new facility is in an office building that sits among trendy 
stores and lawyers offices on connecticut avenue about a 
halfdozen blocks from the white house the space was renovated at 
a cost of 200000 according to jerry rubino director of security 
for the justice department and the official responsible for the 
secure facility 
the office building that independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
has been using is also designated a sensitive compartmented 
information facility 
in addition to the space for the defense teams use the 
government is paying for furniture safes locks alarm systems 
24hour security guards acoustical ceilings and about nine 
personal computers that cost up to 6000 
the computers are modified with a process that lets them emit a 
weaker signal to prevent eavesdropping sophisticated spy equipment 
can eavesdrop on computers used at normal energy levels said 
rubino who noted the system is used by us intelligence agencies 
a halfdozen offices will be provided for each of the four 
separate defense teams representing fired national security aide 
oliver l north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers richard v secord and albert hakim 
rubino said 
that seems luxurious to richard a hibey a washington attorney 
who represented jonathan jay pollard a former civilian navy 
intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty in 1986 to spying for 
israel 
hibeys secure facility was in the justice department where he 
had to borrow desks and equipment of department staffers during 
normal working hours 
on weekends hibey had to use the departments command center as 
a base sifting through documents in the centers hallway 
if the case came to trial it would have been totally 
unworkable he said 
hibey pointed out that in pollard and other espionage cases 
you dont need a scif of the size and magnitude of the 
irancontra facility because the crime was the illegal transmittal 
of classified documents regardless of their content 
in the irancontra case he said the content of the 
classified information is important to understanding the issues to 
know what the intent was you have to sit down read them and 
analyze them 
you cant go on doing it in the hallways of the justice 
department command center he said 
the irancontra defendants are charged with conspiring to 
defraud the government in a scheme to illegally divert to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels the profits from us arms sales to iran 
they also are accused of illegally covering up their actions and 
in the case of secord hakim and north personally profiting from 
the arms transactions

feet long 
the answer about which river wins the trophy for shortness is

the third annual polar bear classic 
sponsored by the great lakes surfing association ran into some 
poor weather it was too nice 
the 35 participants in saturdays event enjoyed clear blue skies 
and unseasonably warm temperatures in the upper 60s for great 
lakes surfers who rely on insulated suits gloves and hoods balmy 
weather makes for poor surfing 
waves reached a respectable 4 to 6 feet friday night but 
saturdays nice weather generated socalled ankle snappers of just 
1 to 2 feet 
jeff vanhoeven of kalamazoo 27 won the mens competition using 
a pushoff method with one foot on his board and one on the lake 
bottom he timed a wave and kickstarted 
dave irwin of bloomfield hills used a similar technique to win 
the long board competition 
michigan is surrounded by fresh water seas said irwin the 
association founder and a former californian youve just got to 
search a little to find waves good enough to surf 
other surfers their competitive spark doused by the lackluster 
waves simply laid on their boards and engaged in friendly paddle 
races 
higher waves come during storms and the associations telephone 
network goes into action when great lakes marine forecasts call for 
rough weather

melanesian separatists holding 
police hostages refused to accept a roman catholic archbishop as 
mediator sunday four gendarmes were shot and wounded in the latest 
incident in 10 days of violence 
the separatists called on the united nations to investigate this 
french island territory where seven people have been killed since 
unrest broke out april 22 
details of the shooting incident were sketchy 
authorities said the four gendarmes were injured by gunfire near 
canala on the eastern coast of the largest island la grande terre 
the officers were evacuated to the capital noumea by helicopter 
for treatment at a hospital authorities said 
they had no other details 
the french high commission in noumea previously the main source 
for information said it was ending its regular news briefings for 
reporters citing concern for the 21 officers held hostage 
journalists have not been permitted to travel to ouvea island 
where the hostages were being held in caves 
the chief separatist movement the kanak socialist national 
liberation front said authorities closed down its radio 
transmitter increasing the colonial powers total blackout on 
information relating to the current events 
the front appealed to the united nations to send a commission of 
inquiry to new caledonia and to demand that france furnish 
information and explanations on this war it is waging 
in its statement the front said the police held hostage as well 
as melanesian separatists who have been detained should be 
considered prisoners of war 
monsignor michel calvet archbishop of noumea agreed to serve 
as mediator to try to win freedom for the hostages and flew briefly 
to ouvea 
in a radio interview calvet said he agreed to the request from 
bernard pons minister of overseas territories in the conservative 
government of premier jacques chirac calvet said he said he was 
prepared to mediate for the release of the hostages but not in the 
political situation 
political negotiations are not within my competence calvet 
said but i told bernard pons i was at his disposition for 
whatever could save lives for the moment i dont see what can be 
done in that direction 
in paris the separatist fronts political bureau issued a 
statement denouncing calvets appointment as a maneuver it 
again demanded a mediator with authority from chirac and president 
francois mitterrand to negotiate a referendum on independence 
only the intervention of a mediator could permit after 
preliminary discussions the study of conditions and procedures for 
an eventual ceasefire as well as for the liberation or exchange of 
prisoners the statement said 
the standoff began april 22 when rebels raided a police station 
kidnapping 27 gendarmes and killing four others 
twelve hostages were later released but eight more officers 
were seized when they tried to negotiate the release of the 
remaining hostages 
two of those hostages the head of an antiterrorism squad and 
an assistant prosecutor were freed and ordered to negotiate on 
behalf of the terrorists they were told the remaining hostages 
would be killed if the two men did not return to the cave where the 
rebels are hiding out 
because of the threat the government said it considers the two 
to still be hostages 
the native melanesians known as kanaks make up 43 percent of 
the territorys 145000 people about 36 percent of the population 
is european with the rest primarily asian or tahitian 
the separatists are fighting a french government plan to give 
partial autonomy to new caledonia it would remain a french 
territory 
the plan was approved last year in a referendum 
regional assemblies were elected april 24 as part of the chirac 
governments initiative the rebels who seized the hostages 
demanded the annulation of those elections held in tandem with 
the first round of the french presidential elections as well as 
the withdrawal of french troops from ouvea island and appointment 
of a mediator to negotiate terms for a new referendum on 
independence

structural integrity wasnt much to 
look at but the massive cardboard barge set a record for the 
largest crew at the 15th annual great cardboard boat regatta 
several crew members steadied the sides of the 20foot by 
20foot cardboard flatbed saturday and chanted more more 
more while a steady line of bodies poured off the dock and into 
the boat 
then as if a portion of earth had broken off into campus lake 
at southern illinois university the 56member crew just floated 
away sort of 
the official count on the craft however was 58 people because 
halfway through the course integrity barreled over the top of 
another cardboard boat and two capsized riders fished from the lake 
were added to the integritys crew 
in the end structural integrity buried the former record of 
34 people on a cardboard boat set in du quoin last year 
it also tried the patience of regatta commodore richard archer 
who growled get that thing outta the way when it was blocking 
other boats in the race 
massive barges like integrity are not much to look at next 
to some of the slickly engineered cardboard marvels entered in 
saturdays race 
but the three mammoth barges carrying a total of 129 riders were 
definitely the showstealers and the crowdpleasers at the 15th 
annual regatta the crowd of 20000 people seemed to relish the 
wonder of it all 
patty mullen who held the old record for the biggest crew 
managed to find 38 fellow navigators called the murphysboro hot 
tub club to take her personally made craft through the course 
at a swift synchronized clip 
i sent out invitations to everyone i could think of mullen 
said i had no idea how many people were coming 
the group which also included a dog was given this years 
team award by regatta judges 
the third entry in the battle of the barge managed 33 people 
but couldnt muster the full trip the back end of the 40footlong 
ship fell off at midpoint in the race and the stern began sinking 
the rest of the boat followed inch by inch 
saturdays crowd was probably the largest in the regattas 
15year history organizers said the 206 boats entered also set a 
record for the most participants

welfare checks for about 400 wisconsin 
families will be cut this month in the first phase of a program 
that uses benefit reductions as a means of forcing dropouts back to 
school 
the learnfare program passed by the legislature last year 
requires reductions in aid to families with dependent children 
benefits for welfare families where teenagers fail to attend 
school regularly 
the program entered its first phase in march when penalties 
were assessed against welfare recipients ages 13 and 14 and to teen 
parents on welfare who failed to meet the schooling requirements 
but those penalties didnt start showing up on welfare checks until 
this month 
the penalties applied if a teenage parent on welfare or welfare 
children 13 and 14 years old dropped out of school or were absent 
more than two days a month without a valid reason 
the program will apply to 15 to 17yearolds in september 
in a recent report to the legislature health and social 
services secretary timothy cullen said only 395 of 16289 afdc 
families affected by the first phase of the program will be 
penalized a breakdown showed 309 cases involved teen parents and 
86 cases involved afdc families 
were pleased that the numbers are this low cullen said 
we know the numbers of dropouts are several hundred lower than 
if there hadnt been a learnfare program 
cullen said there was no way to determine how many welfare 
teenagers had been going to school before learnfare 
although cullen said the program will help students stay off 
welfare when theyre adults one critic said it will do little good 
failure thats what schools should be addressing their 
failure and the kids failure said state rep rebecca young a 
former city school board member we shouldnt be forcing kids 
back to school simply so theres another body there 
benefits will be cut an average 100 a month for each month the 
students remain out of school or miss more than two days 
the state bureau of economic assistance said the average afdc 
benefit check is 517 per month but that the cut would make 
beneficiaries eligible for an extra 33 in food stamps 
the program has no effect on medical assistance to welfare 
families 
cullen also noted that recipients may appeal for exemption from 
learnfare in cases where school officials determine that teenagers 
are so far behind in schoolwork they will not be able to graduate 
by age 19 
some may also appeal benefit penalties if they can show there 
was inadequate day care and transportation services to help them 
attend school cullen said 
a number of those cases exemptions will involve teen 
parents cases where the person dropped out at age 14 and is 17 now 
and could not possibly graduate by 19 he said 
young said learnfare unfairly penalizes welfare recipients while 
ignoring dropouts and truants from more affluent families 
if were going to do this we should extend it to all and 
penalize them nonwelfare families a fifth of their monthly gross 
income young said 
young also said the program puts too much pressure on families 
already hurt by emotional conflicts and does not give schools the 
educational tools they need handle unruly teenagers or students 
who believe they are failures 
if a kid fails in school this is not the best way to enforce 
good behavior we should find out what made them fail in the first 
place young said 
cullen said however that many school districts have upgraded 
attendance policies procedures to notify parents of absences and 
programs to help children who are at risk of educational failure

the irish republican armys deadliest attacks on 
the european continent killed three unarmed british servicemen in 
the netherlands sunday ending a 14month lull in ira assaults 
outside northern ireland 
the shooting and car bombing in which three west germanbased 
british airmen were killed and three were wounded followed the 
march 6 slaying by british commandos of three unarmed ira 
guerrillas in gibraltar 
six policemen and soldiers have been killed in northern ireland 
since the gibraltar slayings and there had been speculation the ira 
was plotting a major act of vengeance 
by attacking british servicemen abroad the ira was reasserting 
itself as an international terror force 
the ministry of defense said the attacks in southern holland 
near the west german border were the worst in terms of fatalities 
carried out by the ira against british targets on the continent 
security forces in northern ireland have been the primary 
targets of ira guerrillas the predominantly roman catholic ira is 
fighting to unite northern ireland a british province where 
protestants outnumber catholics 32 with the mainly catholic 
republic of ireland 
british servicemen on duty in western europe with the north 
atlantic treaty organization are considered soft targets 
because many live off base and tour other areas in their offhours 
usually without arms 
british security forces have been criticized by britains 
opposition parties the irish government and the human rights 
organization amnesty international for shooting the three ira 
guerrillas in gibraltar apparently without trying to arrest them 
government officials have said the three were on a bombing mission 
defense secretary george younger said with events of recent 
times in mind the british servicemen killed sunday were totally 
innocent people who were offduty unarmed and had nothing to do 
with any military operation 
the iras last major attack on the europeana continent was march 
23 1987 it claimed responsibility for a carbomb explosion at the 
british military headquarters in west germany at rheindahlen 9 
miles from the dutch border which wounded 31 people 
in august 1979 an ira timebomb went off under a bandstand in a 
brussels square where a british army band was to perform injuring 
seven bandsmen and 11 civilians 
in march 1979 the british ambassador to the netherlands sir 
richard sykes was shot to death outside his residence in the 
hague the ira later claimed responsibility 
the ira has suffered several setbacks in the past year eight 
ira guerrillas were slain in an ambush by britiish army commandos 
at loughgall in northern ireland in may 1987 and it lost 150 tons 
of libyan arms when the trawler eksund was seized by french 
authorities last october 
retired maj gen richard clutterbuck a specialist on 
terrorism said the holland attacks sunday would be a very easy 
operation for the ira noting the servicemens cars had british 
military license plates 
theres no shadow of doubt that the german red army faction 
would provide safe houses and other facilities for the ira if they 
wanted them but i dont think the ira really needs them in germany 
or holland he said in a british broadcasting corp radio 
interview 
the ira is believed to have a strong network of support in the 
netherlands in 1986 dutch police arrested two ira guerrillas who 
had been involved in a 1983 mass escape from belfasts maze prison 
and had spent several years in holland 
younger said everything possible would be done to increase 
security for british forces abroad 
in a message addressed to prime minister margaret thatcher the 
ira said there will be no haven for your military personnel 
unless britain leaves northern ireland

democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson campaigning in the face of polls indicating he trails far 
behind rival michael dukakis in ohio said sunday that he is 
pulling dukakis in his direction on important domestic and 
foreign policy issues 
jackson brushed off a reporters question about surveys in the 
akron beacon journal and the columbus dispatch that suggested he 
trails dukakis by a 31 margin 
our campaign of hope continues he said our support base 
gets broader and bigger every day 
jackson vowed to continue his campaign past tuesdays election 
and through to june 7 the end of the primary season 
preaching sunday morning at olivet baptist church jackson said 
he intended to turn up the heat in the next five weeks 
he said he has been asked whether he was pushing dukakis to come 
around to his point of view on key issues 
im pulling him jackson called i am out in front on a 
plan to stop the flow of drugsi am pulling him 
im not pushing folks behind me he said im leading 
them 
jackson has been portraying dukakis as unwilling to make strong 
statements about what he would do as president he said sunday that 
leaders cannot afford to play it so safe 
the kitchen is clean and cool he said aint nothing 
cooking 
jackson preached sunday sermons to two strikingly contrasting 
congregations one an allwhite audience at lakewood united 
methodist church where gov richard celeste introduced the 
candidate and the other in the allblack olivet baptist church 
which was filled with the sound of a gospel choir 
celeste is neutral in the democratic race and would not say who 
would get his vote he told reporters that both democrats are 
tremendous candiates but he nodded toward jackson and said 
this message right here is the winning message 
jackson spoke about the poverty and homelessness in america 
saying the nation must fight to change the policies that keep 
working people and children in poverty 
reciting statistics about the increase in the numbers of poor 
and homeless people over the last 20 years jackson said his goal 
is to comfort the disturbed but also disturb the comfortable 
he said budget austerity should not be used as an excuse to hold 
back on spending to help the poor 
dont give up leaders have to think youve got to have 
common sense to make cuts in some areas and spend in others he 
said 
jackson later traveled to columbus for a pair of fundraisers

the emancipated students at bryn mawr 
college a womens college with a capital w put down their 
feminist literature on may day to don frilly white dresses and 
dance around five maypoles in a ritual spanning nine decades 
may day is a kind of bonding for women said debra thomas 
college spokeswoman 
even the nonsense of it is something we need to preserve 
because we have become such a technically oriented career oriented 
society that were almost afraid of the child in ourselves 
anymore 
under a bright blue sky and surrounded by the campus 
medievalstyle gray stone buildings 100 women wearing white 
dresses and colored sashes paraded to the maypoles behind college 
president mary pat mcpherson and the senior class president 
mounted on horseback 
after singing a brief english melody the women 20 at each pole 
representing the four classes and graduate school began skipping 
and running in a race to be the first group to completely braid a 
pole with white and colored ribbons 
more than 2000 spectators cheered and jeered but in the end 
it was the senior class wearing light blue sashes that won 
some past and current students have looked upon the celebration 
of may day with disdain prompting one member of the 1953 class to 
comment that ending the tradition was necessary to speed the 
progress of mankind 
but the majority of the colleges current 1850 students takes 
the tradition in stride reveling in the chance to breakfast on 
strawberries and cream lunch at lawn picnics and dine at a 
medieval banquet 
its also a chance for the normally sedate students considered 
among the top in the country academically to act silly before 
final exams 
seniors roll hoops in a race on campus watch spoofs of greek 
and latin plays and of course dance around the maypole 
i dont think were worried about the image it presents 
said tamara beauboeuf 19 of westtown ny were not a 
finishing school and we know that so we dont have to worry about 
what people will think about 1000 women all dressed in white its 
our day and we deserve it 
the maypole stems from a european custom in which a fir tree was 
stripped of its branches and ornamented with flowers to symbolize 
immortality and renewal 
previous may days at the college were so extravagant that 
planning started a year in advance and new york designers were 
hired to sew the elizabethan costumes 
actress katherine hepburn as a student at the college in 1928 
was the star of a may day play called the woman in the moon 
and that year the entire student body of 500 danced around the 
maypole dressed in white 
may day celebrations were abandoned during world war ii but 
since then the college has staunchly continued the annual 
pageantry 
bryn mawr is ranked by several surveys as one of the nations 
top ten liberal arts colleges the college was the first in the 
country to offer a phd to a woman and it leads the country in the 
percentage of graduates who go on to earn a phd in the humanities

angry religious leaders said sunday that an aide 
to mayor eugene sawyer should be fired for making comments they 
viewed as racial and religious slurs against jews and christians 
but monroe anderson the mayors press secretary said there was 
only a very very remote chance sawyer would fire steve cokely 
an aide who works as a liaison with black nationalist groups 
in taperecorded lectures before followers of nation of islam 
leader louis farrakhan cokely contended that jews have a secret 
society and plan to control the world 
cokely 35 also criticized the late mayor harold washington and 
presidential candidate jesse jackson for employing jewish advisers 
and he attacked christianity by calling the cross a symbol of white 
supremacy the chicago tribune reported 
monsignor john egan director of community affairs for depaul 
university said as long as cokely is there there is a cancer in 
the mayors administration 
michael kotzin regional director of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith said sunday that cokely espouses positions that 
malign the members of the community in ways that echo some of the 
most traditional forms of gutterlevel bigotry 
any person who expresses these kinds of thoughts should not be 
on the city payroll said kotzin who said he has heard 
recordings of the lectures 
words arent mere words especially words of these kinds they 
truly have the potential to do damage kotzin said in a telephone 
interview 
kotzin said he met the mayor four weeks ago and talked with him 
about cokelys baseless antijewish and antiwhite charges 
anderson the mayors spokesman said sawyer had decided to 
talk to cokely and tell him to tune down his rhetoric but had no 
plans to fire him from his 35568ayear job as coordinator of 
special projects 
questioned about the lectures cokely said he is not 
antisemitic and that his role as a community activist is to 
provoke debate 
im responsible for debating various points of view in my role 
as a consciousnessraiser he said 
rev david whitermore executive director of the church 
federation of greater chicago said that based on the contacts 
that i have had with the mayor in many church services i cant 
conceive of him backing or endorsing anything that has been reputed 
to have been said by cokely

a district gop convention here turned 
into a melee when supporters of presidential candidate pat 
robertson clashed with backers of vice president george bush 
officials said 
the confrontation came as the districts republicans were 
selecting three delegates to the republican national convention in 
new orleans in august 
order was restored only after the franklin county sheriff a 
democrat and a platoon of deputies arrived at the national guard 
armory in louisburg where the 4th district convention was being 
held saturday night 
no one was seriously injured said sheriff arthur e johnson 
he said the trouble began when robertson supporters became angry 
when it became apparent that supporters of vice president george 
bush were not going to allow two county delegations controlled by 
robertson backers to be seated 
this is a fraud shouted richard hines of wake county the 
leader of the robertson forces this is a railroad you are 
either going to run this convention correctly or we are going to 
run it 
a group of robertson supporters then rushed the podium and 
pandemonium broke out 
there were at least three fistfights as the bush and robertson 
forces battled for control and calvin vincent of franklin county 
the conventions sergeant of arms was thrown to the floor 
district chairman larry norman said 
after the confrontation robertson supporters walked out and 
held a separate convention to elect their own three delegates 
norman said he was very very very disappointed in the way 
things turned out 
i knew we would have a problem norman said i really 
didnt expect anybody to get out of the bounds of civility and 
begin attacking people

some ohioans who go the polls tuesday to 
cast votes for their partys presidential nominee wont see the 
name of their candidate on the ballot 
vice president george bush the allbutcertain republican 
nominee is on all the ballots as is massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis the frontrunner for the democratic nomination 
but democrat jesse jackson missed getting on the ballot as a 
result of procedural problems in three of the 21 congressional 
district ballots 
jackson was left off the ballots in the 5th district in 
northwest ohio the 10th in southeast ohio and the 13th in 
northeast ohio due to failures by his backers to meet preelection 
filing requirements 
in those districts voters will see the name of sen albert gore 
of tennessee who suspended his campaign april 21 but technically 
remained in the race and is on all ballots 
former colorado sen gary hart who dropped from the race is 
still on the ballot in the 10th and 13th districts among others 
his 10th and 13th district delegates have promised to support 
jackson if hart gets enough votes to qualify them as delegates 
secretary of state sherrod brown says there is no statutory basis 
for them to do so but that the democratic party could allow it 
hart would have to get 15 percent of the votes to get any 
delegates in those districts and he did not do that well in any 
state in which he actively campaigned 
illinois sen paul simon who suspended his campaign a month 
ago will be on the ballot in some scattered districts such as the 
4th in northwest ohio

in at least 15 cities as thousands of people heeded solidaritys 
call for a national day of protest on may day 
authorities detained at least 200 people nationwide according 
to zbigniew romaszewski a spokesman for the outlawed solidarity 
union the violent protests came at the end of a a week of strikes 
and the worst labor unrest in poland since the communist government 
suspended solidarity in december 1981 and later declared it illegal 
there were scattered reports of injuries but figures were not 
available 
government spokesman jerzy urban confirmed 90 detentions and 
said at least 12000 people took part in illegal demonstrations 
nationwide reports from witnesses and opposition spokesmen put the 
number at more than 30000 
the staterun news agency pap said more than 9 million people 
attended official may day ceremonies throughout the country and 
attempts to boycott the may day demonstrations ended up yet again 
with a complete fiasco 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski took a tough line on wage 
demands during ceremonies in warsaw 
a strike was in its sixth day at the lenin steel mill in nowa 
huta outside krakow about 800 strikers gathered for a mass around 
a makeshift altar with a homemade cross in the pressing department 
thirty to 50 people outside the gates were detained when they 
tried to stage a sympathy march to the plant which was ringed with 
platoons of riot police 
earlier about 3000 people marched a halfmile from a roman 
catholic church in nowa huta toward the steel mill but followed 
police orders to disperse 
organizers said about 16000 workers are on strike at the plant 
demanding recognition of their union rights and an immediate 50 
percent raise on the average salary of 105 a month 
police withdrew from around the mill in the afternoon about 120 
strikers and 50 family members and friends then had an emotional 
meeting at the plant gates 
strike leader andrzej szewczuwaniec brushing back tears vowed 
the strike will continue we will not disappoint our wives our 
sons our mothers he said 
in the evening in nowa huta 5000 people rallied at a church 
and taunted police saying so long until the third 
antigovernment demonstrations occur every may 3 polands prewar 
constitution day 
the lenin mill strike committee on sunday wrote deputy prime 
minister zdzislaw sadowski in charge of the economy and planning 
asking him to negotiate directly because management was unable to 
reach an agreement said grzegorz surdy a spokesman for the 
strikers 
solidarity founder lech walesa speaking outside st brygidas 
catholic church in gdansk told about 6000 supporters that the 
time had come for them to take a stand in support of the striking 
steel workers 
i demand from you solidarity with nowa huta tomorrow in your 
shipyards in your ports and in your factories i want it to be 
effective show me tomorrow what you can do he declared 
he said he was not necessarily calling for strikes its up to 
you to do what you can if you have an army general walesa is 
at your disposal 
following the mass and rally in gdansk about 500 young 
militants tried to march through the city they were attacked from 
two directions by police swinging clubs 
during a 40minute melee protesters hurled rocks and police 
beat demonstrators 
when two police officers ran inside the church to catch 
stonethrowers they were disarmed and beaten by youths 
outside police kicked and beat demonstators and at least four 
people were seen bleeding dozens were herded into police vans 
solidarity was the only independent labor union movement in the 
soviet bloc when it was created in gdansk in 1980 during nationwide 
strikes it was suppressed then outlawed after martial law was 
declared in december 1981 
the union movement last month called for a day of protest 
against price hikes and the lack of union freedoms 
the demonstrations came after a week in which poland was hit by 
three strikes one by transit drivers in bydgoszcz that was settled 
monday another by heavy machinery factory workers in stalowa wola 
resolved saturday and the strike in nowa huta 
in the history of polands communist government there has never 
been a largescale strike on may day 
before the start of the capitals may day parade jaruzelski 
told a rally our country is at a turning point now referring 
to his economic programs 
noting wage demands at a time when the annual inflation rate is 
42 percent he said to give more one has to take away from 
somebody else or produce more 
giving in to unjustified wage demands would lead directly to 
the infamous epoch of only vinegar on store shelves he said 
referring to the time of shortages during the solidarity upheaval 
he also stressed the communist party will remain in charge 
may nobody pin hopes on our fatigue he said there will 
be no dismantling of the countrys political foundations 
at a rally in warsaw 6000 people cheered and shouted slogans 
supporting the strikers and condemning the government 
some people tried to march from the rally in front of st 
stanislaw kostka church to a nearby square but police blocked 
them truncheonswinging officers fought briefly with some 
demonstrators 
in other protests 
police used clubs to disperse about 1000 protesters who tried 
to march in the southwestern city of wroclaw and a dozen people 
were detained said solidarity spokesman jozef pinior 
in dabrowa gornicza in southwestern poland some worshippers 
attempted to march after a mass attended by 2000 people said 
pinior he said police moved in and one solidarity member was 
beaten

massachusetts gov michael dukakis holds a 
nearly 31 lead over democratic presidential opponent jesse jackson 
in ohios primary contest two polls suggested sunday 
a poll published in the columbus dispatch said dukakis was the 
favorite among 62 percent of the 1974 registered democrats who 
responded to the newspapers statewide mail survey last week while 
jackson was the choice of 24 percent the remaining 14 percent 
supported other candidates 
a university of akron poll published in the akron beacon journal 
gave dukakis a margin over jackson of 62 percent to 22 percent 
among democrats who said they were likely to vote 
the telephone poll of 926 registered ohio voters was taken 
between april 20 and saturday it was paid for by the beacon 
journal and television stations wcmh in columbus and wkyc in 
cleveland 
the columbus poll had an estimated margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points on each result while the margin for the 
akron poll was 35 points 
the akron poll indicated that jackson was finding it hard to 
broaden his support beyond a solid core of black supporters eleven 
percent of white democrats surveyed in the poll chose jackson 82 
percent of black democrats supported him 
jackson told reporters in columbus sunday he was paying no 
attention to the polls 
im focusing on our mission which is to keep america strong 
and make america better and our message stop drugs from coming 
in stop jobs from going out reinvest in america jackson said 
in akron dukakis quickly shrugged off the favorable survey and 
continued a campaign pace that indicated he was taking nothing for 
granted 
i know theres a poll out today please ignore it dukakis

rightist leader jeanmarie le pen told thousands of 
his followers sunday not to help reelect socialist president 
francois mitterrand but he refused to formally endorse conservative 
premier jacques chirac 
mitterrand and chirac were the top vote getters in the april 24 
presidential balloting and are the only two candidates in the 
runoff election next sunday 
le pen called his antiimmigrant national front the 
avantgarde of france and told his supporters to organize so 
the next time the people will have the last word 
about 30000 people marched in a rain through the heart of paris 
to the rally in the tuileries gardens the demonstration was called 
by the national front to honor joan of arc the partys patron 
saint who led the fight in the 15th century against english 
invaders 
we are in a position of choosing between the bad and the 
worst le pen told the crowd in an hourlong speech 
mitterrand is the worst and chirac is the residual 
candidate he said 
le pen listed three possibilities for his followers stay home 
vote for chirac to avoid the worst or decide at the last minute 
depending on chiracs statements in the final week of the campaign 
if jacques chirac is defeated he has only himself his 
friends and his allies to blame le pen said we have no 
responsibility in the voting 
dozens of groups from around france including monarchists 
waving fleurdelis flags and war veterans filed past le pen and 
the joan of arc statue near the tuileries 
more than 30000 people rallied in two countermarches organized 
by different unions to protest le pens rally on may day the 
traditional territory of organized labor 
in the past le pen has led marches on may 8 the day 
commemorating joan of arc but since the presidential runoff 
election is set for may 8 the national front held the rally a week 
early 
authorities had feared conflict between the national front rally 
and the labor marches no incidents were reported 
le pen who won 144 percent of the firstround vote on april 
24 was eliminated along with seven other candidates 
but the showing by his extreme right party weakened the 
traditional right and chirac will need national front votes to 
defeat mitterrand 
in the first round mitterrand won 34 percent and chirac 
received just under 20 percent all polls show mitterrand winning 
easily on may 8 drawing between 53 and 57 percent of the votes 
since april 24 chirac has tried to attract le pens followers 
stressing the need to stop immigration and conserve frances 
national identity 
le pen claims that france is being drained economically 
socially and culturally because of immigrants from its former 
colonies in north africa

democratic national committee chairman 
paul kirk on sunday attacked the ethical standards of the reagan 
administration and challenged the republicans nomineeapparent 
george bush to speak out on the subject 
when the attorney general of the united states the countrys 
no 1 law enforcement officer can be cited as public suspect no 
1 something is wrong kirk told an audience at the university 
of notre dame 
attorney general edwin meese has been the target of a lengthy 
criminal investigation but has not been charged with any crime 
kirk said bush who has a numerical lock on the republican 
presidential nomination has failed to consider whether the public 
trust is being upheld by the administration in light of criminal 
investigations of meese 
for george bush the only calculation is whether the 
embarrassment will be so great that his own political opportunities 
as a candidate will be undermined kirk said 
kirks comments came in a law day speech delivered the day 
before bush was to make a final campaign swing through south bend 
before indianas primary election tuesday 
kirk read a list of 11 top reagan administration officials 
including meese who have resigned under fire or been investigated 
indicted or convicted 
the hall of shame of the administration is crowded but there 
are profiles in courage as well he said citing two justice 
department officials who quit reportedly in protest over meeses 
continued tenure 
but regrettably among those profiles we cannot include the 
president who waves it off nor vice president george bush who is 
not troubled enough to comment or sufficiently outraged to get 
involved he said 
there comes a time when personal cronyism and loyalty to 
individuals and loyalty even to the highest office in the land 
must be replaced by a loyalty to public honor he said 
since last may 11 meese has been the subject of a criminal 
investigation by a special prosecutor examining various matters 
inlcuding meeses assistance to scandalplagued wedtech corp 
kirk said bush campaigners searching for skeletons in the closet 
during dukakiss terms as governor of massachusetts will find 
nothing comparable to the misdeeds of the reagan administration 
its a nowin political tactic on their part he said 
reagan has defended meese and the justice department despite 
being told by some resigning department officials that a deep 
malaise had set in and that meese should be indicted

a group of spectators watched from the cliffs of dover as the 
blue and white pride of bruges with the p and o european ferries 
emblem on its side left the harbor and entered the english 
channel it arrived about 4 hours later in zeebrugge belgium 
the ferry carried about a dozen freight trucks a handful of 
passengers and a crew of 80 defying the strike 
some pickets had taunted the crewmen with shouts of scab 
when they arrived early sunday at the dock to board the pride of 
bruges for the voyage to zeebrugge the crewmen were taken to the 
vessel in four buses with a police escort 
p and o director sir jeffrey sterling addressing the crew on 
board the ship before it sailed said he would not accept 
intimidation by strikers we know what we are doing is right 
he said 
he accompanied the ferry in a helicopter as the vessel headed to 
sea and met it in zeebrugge when it moored 
despite threats that unions on the european continent would 
refuse to handle p and o ferries the belgian mooring party worked 
without hesitation the ship later sailed for dover carrying 50 
vehicles and 117 passengers p and o said 
the pride of bruges and its sister ship the pride of kent 
arrived at dover on saturday from the dutch port of rotterdam 
where they had been kept since the dispute began company officials 
gave no indication sunday when the pride of kent might sail 
the national union of seamen is striking over a plan by p and o 
to reduce staff impose longer shifts and increase responsibilities

democrat michael dukakis on sunday called 
george bush a blank slate in a republican administration that 
has violated and ignored the law and said the vice president will 
have to begin speaking out on those issues 
dukakis who tried to brush aside a fresh poll showing him with 
an overwhelming lead in ohios democratic presidential primary 
took aim at bush the expected republican nominee on a day in 
which he toured a police station in akron ohio to underscore his 
criticism of the reagan administrations efforts to fight crime and 
drugs 
at a news conference later in cleveland dukakis said the nation 
has gone through seven years under reagan in which rule of law 
and respect for the constitution have not been the order of the 
day 
asked to describe bushs role he said im not sure i can 
answer what that role has been frankly because hes such a blank 
slate 
one doesnt know i hope well learn as time goes on but 
weve had repeated violations of law weve had repeated efforts to 
play fast and loose with the law to ignore congressional 
mandates dukakis said youve got a justice department tht is 
rapidly becoming a laughingstock and i would assume at some point 
hes going to speak out on those issues until now he has not 
dukakis earlier walked through a polish neighborhood of 
cleveland in a parade 
earlier at the akron police department he spoke with officers 
at their morning roll call and examined confiscated weapons and 
drugs 
later in toledo dukakis visited the county jail and met with 
the lucas county sheriff 
if the law enforcement officers who we ask to risk their lives 
in this fight arent getting the support and training and equipment 
and encouragement they need were going to lose that fight 
he said in akron 
dukakis said the administration had cut back on spending to 
combat drugs and he attacked the administration for dealing with 
drug dealers in the irancontra affair and with panama strongman 
manuel antonio noriega 
we have an administration that has been doing business with 
the drugrunning panamanian dictator thats been furnishing aid to 
the contras through convicted drug dealers that are doing time in 
federal penitentiaries he said 
how do we tell our kids to say no to drugs when we have an 
administration that cant say no to drugs and drug dealers 
dukakis spoke on the steps of the akron police station to a 
small noontime crowd of about 150 people the small size of his 
audience was in contrast to the huge support shown for him in a 
poll released sunday by the akron beaconjournal newspaper 
that poll of ohio residents showed dukakis with a nearly 31 
lead over jesse jackson 62 percent to 22 percent with 16 
percent undecided and a 35 percent margin of error the poll was 
conducted over 10 days beginning april 20 
dukakis appeared with prominent local democrats including rep 
tom sawyer dohio and mayor don plusquellic who remain 
officially neutral in the primary battle between dukakis and 
jackson 
dukakis has repeatedly urged supporters to ignore the poll 
reminding them of his 1978 reelection loss and the penchant of his 
favorite baseball team the boston red sox for blowing big leads 
i know there is a poll out today please ignore it dukakis 
said forget about the polls it is not over 
at the police station dukakis saw confiscated automatic 
weapons guns switchblades and an array of drugs including 
cocaine and marijuana he promised his support for local law 
enforcement efforts and said massachusetts had the largest drop in 
crime with one exception of any state in the last several years 
dukakis renewed his denunciation of president reagans plans to 
veto trade legislation because of a provision requiring companies 
to give 60 days notice beford closing plants 
in a fresh attack he said that secretary of state george 
shultz as a labor economist 20 years ago had suggested in a book 
that displaced workers need six months to a year to adjust to the 
loss of their jobs 
maybe the secretary of state and president ought to have a 
conversation dukakis said and maybe the secretary can help 
the white house understand the trauma and the agony and pain of 
being laid off

sandinistas and rebels known as contras agreed only to meet again 
but they didnt set a date or place 
contras uncompromising a banner headline in the sandinista 
newspaper barricada said sunday the story said the latest 
negotiations ended without a single concrete result 
defense minister gen humberto ortega the head of the

the israeli judge who presided over 
the conviction of john demjanjuk of war crimes said sunday that the 
public trial would help prevent a repetition of the nazi holocaust 
the decision to prosecute demjanjuk a former ohio autoworker 
was particularly important in light of recent criticism of israels 
treatment of palestinians in israelioccupied territory said 
israeli supreme court justice dov levin 
when a pure and enlightened movement like zionism is equated 
with rascism the holocaust could happen again he said 
the trial in which demjanjuk was accused by survivors of being 
a death camp guard called ivan the terrible reawakened memories of 
adolf hitlers program to exterminate jews and will help insure the 
tragedy does not happen again dov said at the fourth annual israel 
symposium at beth el temple here 
levin 62 presided over a threejudge panel that sentenced 
demjanjuk to death last week the only other person executed in 
israels 40year history was adolf eichmann who directed the 
extermination program he was tried and hanged in 1962 
levin said he was convinced of demjanjuks guilt 
survivors of the treblinka concentration camp in occupied poland 
remembered every moment of their meetings with demjanjuk he said 
they testified that he went beyond his duty whipping and slashing 
terrified prisoners on their way to the gas chambers 
they dream about it he said that is why we were 
convinced they remember everything 
demjanjuks attorneys argued their client a ukrainian orthodox 
christian was the victim of mistaken identity 
levin also said he was satisfied demjanjuk received a fair 
hearing at his 14month trial we are professional judges he 
said 
some israelis expressed concern that the emotional courtroom 
scene in which many observers cheered and chanted for death after 
his sentencing lent credence to defense claims that demjanjuk 
could not receive a fair trial in israel

of its threeweek american music festival on sunday with the odd 
nightmarish archetypes with ballerinas in clown masks and men

in part 1 the ballerinas in masks take heather watts from her 
partner jock soto and when he sees her again she has become like 
all of them he runs in part 2 men in threepiece suits with 
briefcases are vaguely menaced by men in leotards and ski masks 
part 3 starts amusingly as miss watts black coat is whisked 
into the air leaving her in underwear she dances a long sensual 
duet with soto in admirals uniform and gray hair he tosses away 
his elderly wig but instead of a happy ending other admirals carry 
him away and her coat flies back and she leaves part 4 started 
fast and passionate and ended with what looked like a gang fight 
dancers looked as though they needed more rehearsal 
paul schwartz composed the music on commission from the new york 
city ballet choreographer robert weiss formerly of the new york 
city ballet wrote a program note saying his ballet was inspired by 
paintings by jonathan borofsky

a conscientious objector who had been 
given his last rites called off a 68day hunger strike sunday after 
the government pledged to reform the law on military service his 
support committee said 
michalis marangakis 31yearold wood carver from the northern 
city of salonica started the hunger strike february 22 while 
serving a 26month sentence for refusing to serve in the army 
marangakis said he wouldnt eat until the government established 
an alternative option to mandatory military service such as social 
work 
last month he was transferred from a military jail to the athens 
401 military hospital after losing 61 pounds his weight dropped 
from 198 pounds to 136 pounds during the hunger strike 
on saturday marangakis was reported in critical condition and 
received the last rites from a greek orthodox priest theodoros 
michalopoulos a member of the greek committee for conscientious 
objectors told the associated press by telephone 
he said defense undersecretary stathis yiotas visited marangakis 
in hospital on sunday and gave him a written assurance the law 
would be altered 
a government statement issued sunday said only that legislation 
on military service for conscientious objectors will be reviewed 
a law passed by parliament in february and due to take effect in 
september will permit conscientious objectors to serve four years 
in the armed services as noncombatants instead of the regular 
twoyear stint 
but the law makes no provision for alternative service by 
conscientious objectors who refuse to join the armed forces

contra leaders returned from a second round of 
stalled peace talks sunday blaming sandinista government for 
reneging on promises and creating an oppressive atmosphere that 
jeopardizes future talks in nicaragua 
its obvious the sandinistas have gone backward on their 
promises and dont have any intention of fulfilling the agreement 
we signed in sapoa said contra leader adolfo calero after 
returning here from managua 
calero said he hoped the next round of talks tentatively planned 
for may 1214 will be held in guatemala the dominican republic or 
costa rica because of sandinista restrictions on personal freedoms 
inside nicaragua 
they have been carrying on a succession of repressive actions 
against the people of nicaragua calero said 
sandinista police on friday cordoned off the entrance to an 
antigovernment workers union where about 1500 construction 
workers were protesting economic measures enacted a week earlier 
also friday jose castillo osejo director of the 
antisandinista radio corporation claimed interior minister tomas 
borge summoned him to his office berated radios reporting of the 
demonstrations and punched him in the mouth 
calero also said contra negotiators were forced to stay in their 
hotel like its a prison 
calero and pedro joaquin chamorro two of the fivemember 
nicaraguan resistance directorate who met with reporters here 
denied a government announcement in managua saturday that some 
rebel leaders were staying to continue talks 
we all got on the bus at the airport and left you could have 
taken a group picture chamorro said theres no need for 
anybody to stay well be back 
the talks are hung up on the workings of the ceasefire 
agreement signed in sapoa nicaragua march 23 the pact calls for 
contra forces to enter truce zones after which the government is 
to free 700 political prisoners and allow contras to join talks 
with nicaraguan political parties 
during the truce contra forces may receive humanitarian 
supplies but rebel leaders say the latest round of talks stalled 
over how that food clothing and medicine would be delivered 
the contras friday rejected a sandinista proposal that the 
international committee of the red cross resupply the rebels 
chamorro said red cross in nicaragua is just another arm of 
the sandinista government he preferred that a private carrier 
agreeable to both sides bring in the goods 
the rebels also turned down a government proposal to extend by a 
month the 60day ceasefire that began april 1 saying the offer 
showed a lack of good will to fulfill the sapoa agreement

the pilot of an aloha airlines jetliner 
that blew open at 24000 feet landed safely even though he had lost 
power in one engine and had no indication the nose wheel was down 
a federal investigator said 
the pilot also was not able to lower the planes flaps used to 
slow the craft into normal landing position so he touched down at 
kahului airport at a speed of about 195 mph and braked heavily 
investigator joseph nall said late saturday normal landing speed 
is 155 mph he added 
the plane with 89 passengers five crew members and an air 
traffic controller aboard was on an interisland hop from hilo to 
honolulu thursday when 20 feet of its upper fuselage peeled away 
explosively 
flight attendant clarabelle lansing 57 apparently was sucked 
from the cabin to her death and 61 others were injured 
seven passengers remained at maui memorial hospital sunday in 
stable condition with burns and lacerations nursing supervisor 
beverly perreira said 
meanwhile sunday a coast guard helicopter search for the 
missing chunk of fuselage in waters off the maui coast failed to 
find any trace of the wreckage coast guard spokesman dan 
waldschmidt said 
we believe theres a good chance the piece in almost its 
entirety is floating in the ocean mike benson spokesman for the 
national transportation and safety board said earlier 
federal investigators have focused on possible structural 
failure in the aging boeing 737 as a cause of the accident 
nall of the ntsb said at a news conference that investigators 
have begun looking at the planes maintenance records and have 
asked boeing for all safety advisories issued for that model 
boeing had issued five service bulletins including one in 
april warning airlines to check 737s for corroding fasteners that 
hold pieces of the fuselage together company officials said 
last oct 5 the faa ordered close inspection of the upper skin 
of the early model boeing 737s because routine inspections had 
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap 
officials said friday the agency warned the problem could cause 
rapid cabin decompression they said 
stephanie ackerman an aloha airlines spokeswoman said 
inspections carried out because of the faa order turned up nothing 
unusual 
the federal aviation administration barred the oldest versions 
of the 737 from flying above 23000 feet if they have had more than 
55000 landings the aloha jet had logged between 85000 and 90000 
landings 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the order would affect 66 planes 
in the 737100 and 737200 series the jets are operated by aloha 
piedmont and american airlines he said 
aloha grounded its three planes affected by the order and was 
forced to cancel 30 to 40 flights a day or 20 percent to 25 
percent of its schedule 
according to interviews with the flight crew that were released 
saturday the craft was traveling at 322 mph to 333 mph with the 
first officer mimi tompkins at the controls nall said 
suddenly the crew heard a whooshing sound nall said and 
capt robert schornstheimer took over the controls as the crew 
donned oxygen masks 
the plane bounced as it began its emergency descent he said 
there was so much noise in the cockpit that schornstheimer and 
tompkins had to use hand signals to communicate he added 
the jets left engine had no power when the plane began to slow 
to 195 mph and schornstheimer found the plane became unstable if 
it went any slower nall said 
schornstheimer decided to land the plane even though a green 
light that indicates when the nose wheel is down did not function 
nall said 
an inspection of the interior of the aloha jet found no traces 
of a fire and none of the crew or passengers interviewed reported 
seeing a fire or smelling smoke nall said 
overall however the airplane was extensively damaged nall 
said few aircraft with damage that extensive have ever been 
landed safely 
nall said five beams that run across the width of the plane and 
support the floor of the passenger cabin were broken the beams 
carry cables that control the wings and tail of the plane and one 
of those cables also was broken nall said

chinas march to a freer market economy is 
slowing and its reformminded leaders are at odds over how much 
further to go the central intelligence agency said in a report 
released sunday 
one assessment of the current state of reforms is that china 
now risks stalling out halfway on the road to a market economy 
the cia said in a report to congress that was released by the joint 
economic committee 
although all chinese leaders now consider themselves 
reformers a consensus over the ultimate shape of a reformed china 
is notably lacking the cia said 
the report which examined all sections of the chinese economy 
said it turned in a mixed performance last year 
chinese statistics indicate a substantial decline in the trade 
deficit high industrial growth and improved labor productivity 
the report said but it added that those favorable developments 
were countered by increased inflation slow growth in real income 
in chinese cities disappointing grain production increases and 
higher state subsidies to manufacturing enterprises trading 
corporations and big city consumers 
in 1988 the cia said peking is stressing efforts to reduce 
inflation increase profits of its enterprises and increase grain 
output 
crucial but politically sensitive price reforms will proceed 
slowly in order to minimize economic dislocations among 
consumers it said 
the report said chinas real gross national product rose by 94 
percent in 1987 up from a 78 percent increase in 1986 but below 
doubledigit growth rates in 1984 and 1985 
chinese exports to the united states rose by a third in 1987 
reflecting the success of an exportpush policy 
but while us sales to china rose by 12 percent recovering 
from a slump in 1986 they remained below 1985 records 
the result was that the us trade deficit with china widened to 
34 billion 60 percent higher than in 1986 the cia said 
turning to defense the cia estimated that china spent about 12 
billion on its military forces in 1986 about twice what the 
chinese government publicly reported 
but it said that figure represents an overall declining trend in 
military spending both as a share of the overall chinese budget as 
well as a share of chinas gross national income 
cia estimates indicated that defense expenditures accounted 
for about one third of chinas total budget in 1978 and only 
onefifth of the budget in 1987 the report said 
moreover we estimate that chinas defense spending dropped 
from 12 percent of gross national income in 1978 to only 5 percent 
in 1987 
that compares to 7 percent for the united states last year and 
an estimated 20 percent to 25 percent for the soviet union 
china has cut military spending by slashing personnel costs 
and postponing the procurement of most major weapons the cia 
said 
it reported cuts of more than 3 million men since 1977 
overall it said that chinas military operating budget has 
declined by about a fifth over the last eight years 
chinese purchases of weapons declined by about 10 percent 
between 1978 and 1986 the agency said because of decisions to 
postpone major purchases until more technologically advanced 
weapons systems become available 
but it said spending on research development and testing have 
increased by about 25 percent over the last decade

an upcoming report by surgeon general c 
everett koop will declare that nicotine is an addictive drug the 
head of the federal office of smoking and health said sunday 
dr ronald m davis said he hopes the report will spur the 
public to understand that cigarette smoking is more than just a 
simple habit 
we have to at least give it the serious attention that we do 
for the illicit drugs such as heroin cocaine etc davis said 
on cbstvs face the nation 
government officials have been saying for years that nicotine is 
an addictive drug just like cocaine just like heroin and other 
drugs that people commonly accept as addicting he said 
but this report which will be released in a few weeks looks 
at the evidence in far greater detail than weve ever looked at 
before it compares this drug nicotine versus other drugs he 
said 
the report would be the first by a federal official with as high 
a rank as the surgeon general to declare nicotine addictive 
davis noted that the 1986 surgeon generals report on smoking 
which documented the health hazards of passive smoking accelerated 
the trend toward restricting or banning smoking in public places 
and in the work place among the changes triggered by that report 
is the recently inaugurated ban on smoking on commercial airplane 
flights that last two hours or less 
although davis did not say exactly what steps should be taken 
once the surgeon general issues his report he questioned some 
current ways that cigarettes are distributed 
why do we sell tobacco products in vending machines he 
asked we dont allow other addicting drugs to be sold in vending 
machines why do we allow free samples of the product to be sent 
through the mail or to be passed out on public property where kids 
and others have free access to them when we call this drug an 
addicting drug we have to take it more seriously than we currently 
do 
attempts to reach tobacco industry officials for comment on the 
upcoming koop report were unsuccessful a spokeswoman for the 
tobacco institute and a spokesman for the rj reynolds tobacco co 
did not answer phone calls made to numbers listed for their homes 
on sunday afternoon 
davis attributed the lack of federal regulations on cigarettes 
to the historical social acceptability of smoking and probably 
the political influence of the tobacco industry 
but davis said he believes that as fewer people smoke as it 
becomes a less socially acceptable activity and as people become 
more aware of the hazards of smoking well begin to take actions 
that weve taken long ago for most other consumer products 
he said lower tar lower nicotine cigarettes are not the answer 
because some people smoking such cigarettes actually start to 
smoke more cigarettes per day or inhale more deeply or puff more 
frequently 
davis noted that overall only 27 percent of the adult 
population currently smokes cigarettes compared with 42 percent of 
adults in 1964 when the first surgeon generals report documenting 
some health risks of smoking was released 
but he said higher smoking rates are occurring in certain 
population groups specifically blue collar workers the 
unemployed certain racial and ethnic minority groups and young 
women 
young women smoke at a higher rate than young men which is 
the only age group at which we see women smoking more than men 
he said attributing that in part to advertising ploys indicating 
that cigarette smoking is a form of womens liberation

midnight friday under its 60 a share hostile offer 
combined with the 21 million koppers shares the group already 
owns it now holds or has been tendered about 685 percent of 
koppers outstanding common stock it also has received tenders for 
about 65 percent of koppers preferred shares 
the beazer group may not actually buy any of the tendered shares 
yet because of two federal court injunctions blocking its tender 
offer the injunctions stemmed from court challenges to the buyout 
over alleged antitrust problems and koppers complaint that 
shearson violated securities law in making the bid 
the beazer group has extended its offer through midnight may 6 
koppers has asked us district judge maurice b cohill in 
pittsburgh to force the beazer group to extend its offer until at 
least may 13 when a federal court in san francisco will hear an 
appeal of a lower court ruling halting the bid on antitrust grounds 
cohill has not decided whether to schedule a full trial on 
koppers charges that shearson violated securities laws in the 
offer or alternatively to accept the investment firms recent 
disclosure statements that attempt to answer his objections

small bank depositors and officers say federal 
regulators are slighting them by protecting uninsured deposits in 
texas biggest banks but largely refusing to do the same for 
smaller institutions 
when first republicbank corp began having problems in march 
federal regulators guranteed all of its deposits including 76 
billion worth of deposits that exceeded the 100000 per account 
limit insured by the federal deposit insurance corp 
but businessman randy smith whose cecil carr construction co 
had 202000 in park west bank of plano when the bank failed in 
august 1985 said the company had yet to recover 86000 of the 
deposits that exceeded the 100000 cap 
its a horror story smith told the dallas times herald 
everyone knew that the fdic would bail out first republics 
depositors but park wests uninsured depositors were left to have 
their throats cut 
we were dealing with a widespread crisis of confidence at 
first republic countered fdic spokesman alan whitney whose 
agency pumped 1 billion into the troubled banker to help offset a 
serious runoff of deposits we had no choice 
since the start of 1985 2980 accounts at 28 failed texas banks 
have not been fully covered by the fdic in those closings 58 
million in uninsured deposits have been placed at risk of not being 
covered by the fdic 
the states independent bankers say federal regulators are 
discriminating against small bank depositors and small banks 
they contend that regulators close small troubled banks while 
giving multibilliondollar bailouts to giants such as first 
republicbank and first city bancorporation of texas 
the federal regulators are our judges jury and 
executioners says f hagen mcmahon jr director of the 
independent bankers association of texas which represents about 
1400 independent texas banks they are not closing the large 
banks they are closing our banks 
william seidman chairman of the fdic said the only solution 
for failed small banks was to close them and either pay off insured 
deposits or transfer the accounts to another institution and give 
uninsured depositors a claim against recoveries made in liquidating 
the failed banks assets 
the unworkable alternative he said would be to take over and 
operate each of the 140 us banks that failed since 1985 and 
couldnt be sold 
regulators say that smallbank depositors arent suffering as 
much as texas bankers contend in the 109 texas bank failures since 
the beginning of 1985 about 112 billion in deposits either were 
transferred to acquiring institutions or paid off 100 percent 
whitney said 
of the 50 million in uninsured deposits in closed banks the 
fdic expects ultimately to repay 34 million giving uninsured 
depositors a loss of 16 million or 32 cents per uninsured dollar 
very few depositors lose money in small bank failures 
seidman said 
but mcmahon said the smaller bankers have suffered nevertheless 
while the fdic pumped 50 million into dallasbased banctexas 
group 1 billion into first city and 1 billion into first 
republicbank 
let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy as 
the bankers working for first republic mcmahon said in an open 
letter to congress and regulators we are exasperated with the 
twotier treatment that is dished out by the federal regulatory 
bodies

scientists here believe there is money 
beyond wealth in shiitake mushrooms a popular japanese delicacy 
that they have popping out of 700 neatly stacked logs at a secluded 
vermilion county research site 
the large expensive mushrooms pronounced sheetahkeh could 
help reduce soil erosion improve forest management and create 
wildlife habitat while serving as a cash crop for their growers 
scientists say 
were in this for the environmental aspects said kenneth 
konsis the kennekuk cove park forester who teaches shiitake 
growing the mushrooms are a financial incentive to get 
landowners to do this 
scientists say that adding trees to crop land to provide a 
shiitake growth medium can help reduce soil erosion and that 
cutting smaller logs from trees can improve existing forests in 
either case wildlife should benefit they say 
domestic shiitake production also could take a small slice out 
of the us trade deficit because the nation now imports about 
100 million worth of the mushrooms from japan annually the us 
department of agriculture estimates domestic growers have a 2 
million a year market now and it eventually could be 10 times that 
large 
were growing higher quality mushrooms than they are in 
japan said konsis they are buying our best mushrooms and 
shipping them back to japan 
shiitake mushrooms have been grown commercially in the united 
states for less than 10 years said christopher burnett of the 
illinois natural history survey growers produced nearly 3 million 
pounds last year 
this twoyearold eastcentral illinois research project 
developed by burnett a wildlife ecologist is designed to identify 
the best shiitake varieties and the best type of logs for illinois 
production 
it also is a workshop for people who want to learn how to raise 
shiitake 
my son and i are interested in things like that almost a 
garden type project said larry larimore of urbana who took the 
class last winter we dont expect to be big mushroom growers 
but larimore said his son is a truck farmer and the shiitake 
harvest from their 100 logs will allow him to diversify his produce 
sales at farmers markets and retail stores 
the brownish shiitake caps can be large enough to fill the palm 
of a mans hand and have sold for 1 an ounce in local 
supermarkets he said 
the shiitake is meatier chewier and more flavorful than the 
button mushrooms found in most stores burnett said 
konsis said the mushrooms are grown by placing spores in up to 
90 holes drilled in logs referably oak of about three feet long 
and four inches in diameter 
the holes are sealed with wax and the logs are stacked for about 
a year occasionally rotated and sometimes soaked in a small 
lagoon to encourage the emergence of mushrooms said konsis 
burnett estimates it costs 1 plus labor to ready a log for 
production and the log will yield from three to nine pounds of 
mushrooms over five or six years the grower should be able to sell 
the shiitake for about 6 a pound he said 
my strategy to convince people to do things to create 
wildlife habitat is to convince them woodlands have some economic 
value said burnett who hopes similar demonstrations will be 
done in other parts of illinois its not difficult to do and the 
market is growing
