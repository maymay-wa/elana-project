a former aide in sen bob grahams office said 
monday he had arranged a meeting between bank regulators and 
centrust bank which later failed causing the biggest bailout of 
the savings and loan crisis 
nbc news reported monday that the aide steve josias had used 
his position as a special counsel in grahams office to bring 
pressure on bank regulators looking into the thrifts finances 
but josias denied the report and grahams office said the 
democratic senator had had no knowledge of the meeting 
josias fort lauderdale firm had handled some real estate 
matters for centrust before the 1987 meeting with officials from 
the federal home loan bank board said ken klein grahams 
spokesman 
the day after the meeting grahams office manager met with 
josias to tell him such a meeting was against the senators policy 
klein said graham himself did not learn of the meeting until 
earlier in 1990 and characterized it as poor judgment klein said 
we do not seek to intervene with regulators on specific 
cases klein said 
graham a member of the senate banking committee said in an 
interview from his washington dc office he had done nothing to 
delay the seizure of the miamibased thrift by the government the 
centrust bailout will cost taxpayers 17 billion 
i would say categorically my office did not have any effect 
on any action by federal regulators that would have affected their 
decisions graham said 
josias told the associated press that nbcs report was 
ludicrous he described himself as merely a convener of the 
30minute meeting centrust officials called it because they felt 
federal officials were failing to respond to questions on 
regulatory procedures he said 
josias worked in grahams office for six months as special 
counsel providing legal expertise klein said 
when lawyers called grahams office they were given to the 
lawyer josias said when asked about the centrust call that led 
to the meeting i should have said then that i know centrust and 
my legal firm did work for them 
when regulators seized centrust in february they blamed its 
failure on speculative investing including purchase of more than 
1 billion in junk bonds 
they also cited the lavish spending of the institutions 
chairman david l paul who spent millions of dollars of deposits 
on a museumquality art collection kept at his home a company 
yacht limousines a corporate jet and goldplated toilets in the 
executive washrooms paul has declined comment about centrust and 
its seizure 
a fraud squad of investigators is examining the legality of 
328000 in political contributions by paul 
graham said he has never received political contributions from 
paul or any centrust political action committees

a lawsuit filed monday against 13 
contractors at the hanford nuclear reservation claims people 
working at and living around the plant were hurt by the reckless 
release of radiation and toxic chemicals 
the classaction suit filed in us district court seeks 
unspecified damages for health threats and reduced property values 
said tom foulds who heads a team of lawyers on the project 
twentyone people were named as plaintiffs but the number of 
people affected could eventually reach 5000 according to the suit 
it claims that exposure to high doses of radiation and toxic 
chemicals and hazardous storage conditions have caused death 
disease disfigurement miscarriages birth defects and infertility 
and sterility 
the thrust of the suit is for recovery for personal injuries 
and other bodily damage that already has been done foulds said 
but the subclasses mention damage to property arising out of the 
possibility of explosion and continuing operations we are trying 
to get the hazards abated and removed 
the suit seeks an abatement order against the companies 
requiring them to remove and clean up any continuing contamination 
underground storage tanks radioactive sediments in the columbia 
river and to establish a fund for monitoring health effects 
two federal studies are attempting to determine the health 
effects of hanford operations and the state and two federal 
agencies have signed a 30year 57 billion cleanup pact 
the partial results of a study released last month indicated a 
potential for increased thyroid diseases among people living 
downwind of the 560squaremile government plutoniumproduction 
facility 
this lawsuit came to a head when the dose reconstruction 
report was made foulds said once that came out it seemed 
to verify a lot of very strong indications i had already received 
during my research 
the suit does not name the government agencies that contracted 
hanford operations the department of energy and its predecessor 
the atomic energy commission because the governments immunity 
from tort claims would make it difficult to win foulds said 
it was clear to us we should try to go after the contractors 
that ran this they dont enjoy the same immunity unless they can 
show they complied with all the applicable government 
regulations foulds said i dont think they can prove that 
there is a clear pattern of failure and violations 
bill whiting a spokesman for westinghouse hanford co the 
reservations current prime contractor said company attorneys had 
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment attempts to reach 
attorneys for other corporations after normal business hours were 
unsuccessful 
the lawsuit accuses past and present hanford contractors 
carelessly intentionally recklessly and unlawfully allowed 
the releases of radioactive and nonradioactive materials 
the hanford reservation was begun in top secrecy as part of the 
manhattan project that produced nuclear materials for the atomic 
bombs that ended world war ii 
the lawsuit was filed on the 45th anniversary of the atomic 
bombing of hiroshima which killed at least 140000 people 
documents released since 1986 show a pattern of intentional and 
accidental releases of large amounts of radiation and hazardous 
wastes into the air soil and water from hanford operations

for two years a city within a city lived 
and grew in the shadow of city hall 
then one morning in july buses pulled up to civic center plaza 
to take away the homeless people who camped under knobbybranched 
olive trees amid mildewed mattresses tattered blankets and 
shopping carts heaped with the eclectic possessions of modern 
nomads 
the homeless and their advocates decried the citys 
insensitivity 
its not that they care about these people not having homes 
said jill 28 who had been bouncing in and out of welfare hotels 
with her boyfriend ron for six months they just dont want 
them to be seen 
but mayor art agnos said he does care thats why he allowed the 
homeless to live in the park while he arranged a humane 
alternative two fullservice shelters equipped with everything 
from job training to drug counseling facilities designed to ease 
people off the street for good 
in cities across the nation city officials and advocates for 
the homeless talk about how public emotion hostility and 
compassion frustration and sympathy has escalated as the ranks 
of the homeless swell 
people are frustrated its not over were into quick fixes 
said mary ann gleason director of the denver healthcare for the 
homeless clinic which serves about 6500 people a year there 
are hundreds of thousands of people weve gotten off the streets 
but there are more falling in behind them 
no one knows how many americans are homeless estimates range 
from 300000 to 3 million but no one disputes the fact that the 
number is increasing and greater numbers mean greater visibility 
its a common perception that at least among some parts of 
society theres not only less compassion but more organized 
hostility toward the homeless said gary blasi president of the 
national coalition for the homeless and a legal aid foundation 
attorney in los angeles a city with a homeless population 
estimated at more than 150000 
a large part of the source of the hostility is that its not 
great to have a lot of homeless people around when youre a tourist 
city blasi said its not just the cable cars and the golden 
gate anymore 
what passes for heartlessness often is case of empty municipal 
pockets with compassionate programs succumbing to financial 
pressures the city council in washington faced with a 95 million 
budget deficit voted in june to gut its policy of guaranteeing 
overnight shelter to anyone who requested it that ordinance was 
championed by the late homeless activist mitch snyder and passed 
six years ago by more than 70 percent of the vote 
in philadelphia 80 members of the mayors publicprivate task 
force on homelessness resigned in july to protest massive cuts in 
the citys budget for homeless services after the amount dropped 
from 34 million to 10 million in two years at the same time the 
city plans to spend 1 million closing off spaces under train 
platforms in a downtown station where people like to sleep 
i see no abatement whatsoever in peoples concern people 
calling people coming in people of all ages making an effort and 
reaching out said phyllis ryan director of the philadelphia 
committee for the homeless and one of the former task force 
members the government resources have just not been sufficient 
i think they just looked out there and decided whos a voter and 
who isnt 
in some places voters aggravated by the homeless problem are 
using their electoral clout to protest residents in santa monica 
calif have collected thousands of signatures to place a 
proposition on the november ballot to make the city attorneys 
office an elected one the current city attorney robert myers has 
refused to prosecute people for sleeping outdoors 
i think theres an increasing feeling of helplessness said 
barbara stinchfield santa monicas community development manager 
we get proposals weekly on how to solve the homeless problem 
its frustrating its troubling its unsettling its not getting 
better but most people are not reacting in a really destructive 
way 
citizens in santa cruz calif took their anger to the streets 
when 200 homeless activists rallied outside the santa cruz county 
courthouse demanding an end to the citys camping ban they were 
outnumbered by 600 counterdemonstrators who said they were tired of 
giving bums and squatters a free ride in the seaside town 
about 75 miles south of san francisco 
i think what happened in santa cruz and san francisco has to 
do with something much bigger than homelessness gleason said 
the american public she believes feels angry but helpless over 
things like the hud scandal and the savingsandloan bailout i 
think people are feeling so frustrated from being bamboozled and 
taken advantage of on every front homelessness gets lumped in with 
the rest of it its very easy to take your anger out on the poor 
its more difficult to find effective solutions to the problem 
but citizens in seattle are trying said martha dilts executive 
director of seattle emergency housing service 
seattle residents are trying to raise 1 million for 
transitional housing for homeless families and a local real estate 
companys agents are donating part of their commissions to fight 
homelessness 
i see people starting to realize that homelessness is 
affecting more people that it could happen to your family or your 
neighbor theres a feeling of community and a sense of we can do 
it said dilts a member of the governors homeless task force 
advocates agree that homelessness will persist until society 
deals with the lack of affordable housing access to drug treatment 
and mental health facilities and absence of affordable childcare 
and other support services for the working poor meanwhile cities 
are eing forced to expand and improve shelter facilities something 
many communities are loathe to do 
although washington has been under court order to expand its 
shelter system council members say neighborhoods will not accept 
one without a fight in one area a homeless mans arrest on murder 
charges galvanized the neighbors they held bake sales to finance 
their effort to close the shelter in which he lived 
in a suburban westchester county ny community neighbors 
have filed five lawsuits to try to stop construction of a 108unit 
complex for homeless women and children in a san jose calif 
neighborhood residents are fighting a homeless shelter they 
believe is responsible for a 120 percent increase in felonies in 
their area 
if there was a shred of sympathy in me before one resident 
said after seeing this i have lost all compassion 
sometimes however neighbors find the cure far less painful 
than they had anticipated a project to help mentally ill homeless 
women in denver was welcomed into a neighborhood after residents 
fears were allayed by the projects planners the house has been a 
smashing problemfree success 78 percent of those who passed 
through there in the first year now have homes and neighbors now 
drop by to donate lawn chairs and tomato plants 
i dont think the american public knows whats going on in 
homeless services today gleason said part of it is 
misinformation part of it is honesttogod displaced anger when 
people understand both what the homeless reality is and what were 
trying to do about it it paints a whole different picture

on this i also talked yesterday to kuwaits emir and gave him 
certain assurances whats emerging is nobody is seems to be 
showing up as willing to accept anything less than total withdrawal 
from iraq from kuwait of the iraqi forces and no puppet regime 
weve been down that road and there will be no puppet regime that 
will be accepted by any countries that im familiar with and there 
seems to be a united front out there that says iraq having 
committed brutal naked aggression ought to get out and that the 
this concept of their installing some puppet leaving behind will 
not be acceptable 
so were pushing forward on diplomacy weve gotten tomorrow 
i will meet here in washington with the secretary general of the 
united nations i mean the secretary general of nato and 
margaret thatcher will be coming in here tomorrow and i will be 
continuing this diplomatic effort and im sure you know of the

options are or might be but theyre wide open i can assure you of 
that 
question the saudi arabians and the turks have they have you 
talked to saudi arabia and the turks about turning off the oil 
pipelines through their countries and are they 
bush all options are open and there is a strong feeling on the 
part of the nato countries to whom ive talked turkey being one of 
them that we must have concerted and id say well concerted 
action to isolate iraq economically and you can you can just 
assume from there that those matters are being considered 
question are the saudis inclined to cut off the pipeline mr 
president 
bush i cant tell you the state of play ive discussed this 
with king fahd and i whether ill be talking to him again today 
i dont know but im not going to characterize their position on

there and can you 
bush i wouldnt want to say theyre in danger but i you know 
how i feel about the protection of american life and willingness to 
do whatever is necessary to protect it but i dont have the 
feeling that theyre in imminent danger right now 
question and the people who are now in control in kuwait are 
saying they may close some of the embassies in kuwait city that 
they will regard any reaction against them as you should take 
care if you have your nationals in our country isnt that a 
threat 
bush im not trying to characterize threats the threat is the 
vicious aggression against kuwait and that speaks for itself and 
anything collaterally is just simply more indication that these are 
outlaws international outlaws and renegades and i want to see 
the united nations move soon with chapter vii sanctions and i want 
to see the rest of the world join us as they are in overwhelming 
numbers to isolate saddam hussein 
question mr president how can you and other world leaders 
prevent the installation of what youve termed a puppet 
government 
bush just wait watch and learn 
yeah

saddam hussein since youre calling all these other people 
bush no no i have not 
question king hussein has embraced him

the use of their military bases

in condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get saddam 
hussein out now he was talking king hussein about an arab 
solution but i am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that 
apologizes or appears to condone whats taken place 
question is secretary cheney going to saudi arabia 
bush im not going to comment on anything that were doing of 
that nature 
question mr president are you disappointed in the failure of 
the arab other arab nations to make more progress toward 
resolving the situation 
bush well i was told by one leader that i respect enormously 
i believe this was back on friday that they needed 48 hours to 
find what was called an arab solution that obviously has 
failed and of course im disappointed that the matter hasnt been 
resolved before now this is a very serious matter ill take one 
more and then ive got to go to work over here

a vietnamese man is thrown from a moving 
train a factory fires foreigners to trim its payroll young toughs 
club a kurd unconcious racism is increasing in east germany 
blessed with new freedom and german pride but plagued by a 
crashing economy and competition for scarce jobs east germans have 
become openly hostile to foreign minorities 
i am ashamed of the behavior of the east german people said 
horst kinitz chief of the nations employment agency 
organized bands of neonazi skinheads radical youths with 
shaved heads and aggressive attitudes have attacked asians and 
africans who make up the bulk of east germanys foreign workers 
about 80000 vietnamese angolans mozambicans and cubans have 
been working in east germany under arrangements made with those 
countries by the former communist government 
im very afraid said ngo manh long a vietnamese worker in 
an east berlin textile factory the gangs make problems for us 
the german people are angry we are here 
few such incidents were apparent under the communists who 
maintained order with a suffocating internal security system 
rapid economic and social upheaval and east germanys emergence 
as a central european crossroads have left its people dizzy with 
change after four decades of isolationism 
lt joachim crannich of the national police said the agency 
recorded 32 cases of violence against foreigners in the first half 
of 1990 but added the actual count probably was much higher 
you have to see it in the context of our social changes he 
said with the move toward democracy and introduction of the free 
market many people are anxious if youre an east german and you 
lose your job but you see a foreigner keep his job that creates a 
certain frustation 
among the incidents this year 
skinheads attacked a grooup of vietnamese on a train from 
eisenach to berlin 
a vietnamese was pushed off a train and seriously injured in 
wittenburg 
in leipzig skinheads attacked african students shouting 
racial epithets and foreigners out 
a dozen skinheads covered a vietnamese man with spray paint in 
rudolstadt an iraqi kurd said young toughs jumped him pulled his 
jacket over his head and beat him unconcious 
i felt like a jew during the third reich he said 
many people blame organized radical rightwing groups such as 
the national alternative for such attacks the group denies it 
juergen helfricht spokesman for the interior ministry said 
there was no proof the national alternative was involved in 
anything illegal so police had no grounds to move against it 
experts say the skinheads despite the attention they draw are 
only the violent fringe of a broader problem 
the sensitivity in the east german population about racism is 
abominably low said annetta kahane the east berlin city 
official who deals with foreigners concerns its going to take 
a long time until it reaches the same level as west germany and 
its not very good in west germany 
factories have become bastions of racism east germany switched 
to a free market and merged its economy with west germanys on july 
1 a prelude to reunification in december 
unemployment is growing and there are numerous reports of 
foreign workers being fired first as businesses trim payrolls 
volker daehne deputy chief of the east german employment 
authority said he had 296 documented cases since july 1 of foreign 
workers being fired illegally 
its shameful to bring foreigners into this country and then 
fire them at will he said 
manh the vietnamese worker is employed by an east berlin maker 
of mens clothing called becon classic a former state concern now 
operating independently he said there is open hostility in the 
plant 
a complaint filed with the east berlin government by vietnamese 
workers says rents have tripled in housing supplied by becon and 
two other factories east germans are protected from extreme rent 
increases 
manh said he and eight other vietnamese were living in a 
oneroom apartment and had paid the equivalent of 19 a month each 
but the rent more than tripled in july 
veronika arendtrojah a west berlin lawyer representing 
vietnamese at becon classic said she would file suit to block the 
increases 
plant spokesman wolfgang boerner said there were no plans to 
fire foreigners he said rents had to be raised because subsidizing 
them was a burden on the company

two months after winning an 
overwhelming mandate to govern burmas democratic opposition is 
being kept out of office by a military administration that shows no 
signs of stepping aside 
the ruling state law and order restoration council has added new 
conditions that could indefinitely delay a transfer of power to the 
national league for democracy which swept the may 27 parliamentary 
election 
the scene is set for a confrontation and the feeling is now 
that unless the nld stands up to be counted the military rulers 
will prevail said a senior western diplomat reached in rangoon 
capital of burma 
the nld may have scored a major election victory but the 
military rulers are the still the ones with the guns he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
antigovernment street protests have increased despite 
prohibitions under martial law diplomats said demonstrations by 
young people in rangoon and mandalay to the north were the 
largest in months 
a cartoon in an exile newsletter expressed the feelings of many 
burmese a meanlooking soldier points a revolver at the face of a 
ragged civilian and snarls idiot i said id give you elections 
i didnt say id hand over power 
on july 29 more than 1000 supporters of the national league 
for democracy waited outside a rangoon conference hall where party 
officials adopted a resolution demanding parliament be convened in 
september 
other demands in the resolution included dialogue with the 
government democratic rights and the release of party leaders 
they include aung san suu kyi an outspoken critic of military rule 
who remains under house arrest although her oneyear sentence 
expired july 19 
police and soldiers surrounded the hall throughout the twoday 
meeting 
gen saw maungs government promised the election the first in 
30 years of authoritarian rule after taking power in september 
1988 his soldiers killed thousands of civilians who demonstrated 
for democracy 
western diplomats said the government probably was astonished by 
the magnitude of its loss the national league took 392 of 485 
parliamentary seats and most of the rest went to groups close to 
it 
after it came to power saw maungs government suspended the 
constitution and said the parliament to be chosen in the promised 
elections must approve a new one before power could be transferred 
on march 27 the general said political parties could follow 
their own programs after the election 
some are saying an interim government will be first formed and 
power transferred under an interim constitution and they will take 
time in drafting a constitution he said they can do what they 
want 
before the vote the government spokesmen also said the new 
parliament could adopt a constitution based on the charter of 1947 
the one that replaced it in 1974 or entirely new 
following their victory national league officials said they 
wanted to adopt the 1947 constitution temporarily and revise it 
on july 13 the powerful chief of military intelligence maj 
gen khin nyunt said the 1947 constitution no longer was 
appropriate and a totally new one was needed 
he added more conditions july 27 saying the government would 
convene a national conference to provide guidelines for drafting a 
charter which then must be approved by referendum 
drafting of an interim constitution to obtain state power will 
not be accepted in any way and if it is done effective action 
will be taken according to the law he declared 
a political organization does not automatically obtain the 
three sovereign powers of legislative administrative and judiciary 
power by the emergence of a peoples assembly he said 
the new parliaments function was merely to draw up a 
constitution he said the national league disagreed and declared 
at its conference that the parliament was not merely a constituent 
assembly 
it is against political nature that the nld which has 
overwhelmingly won enough seats to form a government itself 
has been prohibited from the minimum of democratic rights the 
declaration said it is shameful in the eyes of the people and 
the international community 
party leaders had drafted a provisional constitution that would 
be refined by the parliament the statement said 
a western diplomat said the declaration was a direct challenge 
to the military but that the national league was treading 
carefully 
resentment of military rule remains strong and widespread but 
diplomats doubt the huge demonstrations of 1988 will be repeated 
the army has constantly reminded people that it is quite 
willing to take the same action as it did in 1988 one said

spanish director pedro almodovar says lingering 
american puritanism is to blame for the uproar over his latest 
film tie me up tie me down 
everybody talks about this growing puritanism which is 
true almodovar said in the aug 13 issue of newsweek people 
say its the result of aids but in fact its a result of this

its been a long hot summer for ted turner 
mediocre ratings and a loss of up to 26 million plagued his 
goodwill games his cable news network got a new president and his 
relationship with jane fonda burned up the gossip columns 
the fiery entrepreneur from atlanta kept his chin up saturday 
when he spoke to reporters the day before the goodwill games 
concluded 
speculation was rampant that the games founded by turner in 
1986 may no longer be sponsored by turner broadcasting system inc 
turner said he expected a decision from the tbs board of directors 
within six weeks on whether to continue the networks participation 
yes we did lose some money the exact amount will not be 
known until later but in my opinion its a reasonable down 
payment to an event that will grow in stature and at some point 
break even turner said 
the seattle games which lasted 17 days received an overall 
rating on tbs of 32 a rating of 50 was anticipated one ac 
nielsen co ratings point is equal to 921000 homes 
yes the ratings did not meet our estimates but the winter 
and summer olympics did not meet the estimates of abc and nbc 
turner said 
last month turner hired an outsider tom johnson to be 
president of cnn johnson a former publisher of the los angeles 
times left his job as vice chairman of the newspapers parent 
times mirror co to work at turners 24hour allnews network 
turner found time this summer to play his mouth of the south 
role when he insulted religious groups by saying christianity is 
for losers he later appeared at a woodstock ga church to 
apologize 
all the while turner and fonda have been burning up the gossip 
circuit an atlanta magazine lampooned their relationship by 
superimposing turners head on a photograph of a muscleman for a 
cover story 
turner chairman and president of tbs disclosed last month 
during the tbs annual shareholders meeting that the goodwill games 
would lose as much as 26 million twice what had been projected 
he has maintained since 1986 that the games were not designed to 
make money but to foster good will between nations and showcase the 
worlds best athletes but some observers feel turner may have 
trouble convincing the tbs board of directors the altruistic 
benefits of the games justify costs 
hank whittemore whose book cnn the inside story was 
published earlier this year and chronicles the networks first 10 
years said he couldnt predict whether turner would stick with the 
goodwill games but suggested there are some parallels between the 
games and the early days of cnn 
cnn lost 77 million in five years and people said when is 
turner going to sell out and go back to being what he was the 
owner of another network the tbs superstation and a bunch of 
sports teams whittemore said 
turner officials in charge of the goodwill games are cautious 
when discussing the future 
terence f mcguirk tbs vice president in charge of sports said 
financial losses aside the goodwill games were a success the goal 
of the 90 games was to build the credibility of the event in the 
athletic world which was accomplished he said 
still mcguirk added we are not in a position today to tell 
you definitely that the company is ready to commit to a certain 
involvement with the goodwill games in the future 
it is conceivable mcguirk said that tbs will remain with the 
games but in a different role he would not speculate about what 
that role might be

vietnam has been exporting so much rice 
that domestic prices for the staple have doubled in ho chi minh 
city and some provinces in the last month radio hanoi reports 
exporters have rushed to the city to buy up all the rice 
available vietnams official radio said 
this has given the people the impression that there is a 
scarcity of rice thus prompting many families to buy rice to keep 
in reserve 
domestic rice prices have almost doubled in other provinces as 
well said the report which gave no price figures a text of last 
weeks broadcast was seen in bangkok today 
officials were trying to control rice prices by banning sales to 
unauthorized exporters and placing one agency in charge of buying 
and selling grain within ho chi minh city formerly saigon the 
radio report said 
the government also plans to buy grain for reserve stocks the 
report said 
vietnam exported 115 million tons of rice in the first six 
months of 1990 double its exports for the same period last year 
analysts predict the communist country will export a record 2 to 
24 million tons this year 
vietnam went from widespread food shortages in 1988 to become 
the worlds thirdlargest rice exporter last year economic reforms 
have given farmers incentives by allowing them to keep more profits

republicans are putting wyomings nickname 
as the equality state to the test this year asking residents to 
elect their second woman governor in state history 
two women are vying for the gop nomination in the states aug 
21 primary hoping for a shot at firstterm democrat mike sullivan 
who is one of the most popular politicians in heavily republican 
wyoming 
wyoming touts the slogan that this is the equality state ill 
have to run on that premise nyla murphy one of the gop 
contenders says we had the first woman governor in our nations 
history i see no reason why we couldnt have another woman 
governor 
her gop rival is mary mead who says her life on a ranch has 
more than prepared her for the governors office 
i pull a calf at 4 am cook for men for breakfast go to a 
bank meeting at 9 am move cows try to get my damn snowmobile to 
run to check heifers work outside all day and then have a dinner 
party she said thats not untypical for any ranch woman 
but wyoming historian ta larson think it will take more than a 
nickname to get murphy or mead elected this year larson said 
wyoming has been mighty slow in living up to its equality state 
tag 
i think there has been a little more male chauvinism in 
wyoming than many other states so i think this election will be a 
really substantial test larson said 
sullivan surprised many people four years ago when he left his 
law practice to run for governor and handily defeated republican 
pete simpson the brother of us sen alan simpson 
this time around some republicans who had considered running 
for the office pulled out early saying sullivan would be too hard 
to beat 
the governor has been criticized by his challengers as lacking 
leadership to bring about a strong economic recovery to the 
mineraldependent state while the campaigns have been focusing on 
the need for economic expansion neither murphy nor mead has 
offered specific plans on how to bring it about 
sullivan said hes hopeful voters will cast their ballots based 
on the issues not gender but acknowledges i dont think you 
can overlook the fact that you have a woman who is a challenger and 
you have to at least be sensitive to that fact 
mead agrees gender should not be the deciding factor 
i dont think it should make a difference whether its a man 
or a woman she said i would hope wyoming people are very 
discerning people they are so capable and quick to size em up 
mead had all but sewn up the gop nomination earlier this year 
after a halfdozen competitors dropped out of the race 
the disappearances led to charges that powerful republicans 
including meads father former gov cliff hansen were playing 
queen makers and had effectively discouraged all others from 
the race that rankled murphy a 12year veteran of the state 
house who entered the race in june 
i call them king makers she said at the time i guess i 
should say queen makers but i think that theres a small group of 
the party money powers money brokers behind the opponents 
candidacy 
the gender issue has popped up from time to time on the campaign 
trail 
during one campaign stop the governor remarked that he 
considered mead a pretty woman from a nice family while his 
statement was widely publicized the question that prompted it 
wasnt 
the question to me was governor mary mead and the 
republicans say youre a nice man with a nice family what is your 
response sullivan said and flippantly i said marys a 
pretty woman from a nice family 
for her part mead joked during an interview that she was so 
busy on the campaign trail that she didnt have time to iron her 
clothes and perhaps she could borrow the governors wife jane 
mead also initially rejected proposals to debate murphy saying 
it wouldnt be proper for two women to debate one another 
wyomings one and only woman governor was nellie tayloe ross 
who was elected 66 years ago to fill the unexpired twoyear term of 
her late husband she was not reelected

behind the sun sand and carefree 
islanders of the tourist brochures lies another caribbean of 
hardship and frustration that is a breeding ground for radicalism 
it became visible when moslem extremists tried to overthrow the 
government of trinidad 
trinidad was a ticking time bomb but it is only one of a 
number of such situations in the caribbean said larry birns 
director of the council on hemispheric affairs in washington 
economic decay throughout the region provides fertile ground for 
civil unrest analysts say 
economic prosperity solves a broad range of societal problems 
and economic despair breeds them birns said 
abu bakr leader of jamaatalmuslimeen said he and his 
followers seized prime minister arthur nr robinson and 54 other 
hostages on july 27 because of the poverty that has replaced 
trinidads oil bonanza of the 1970s 
most of the caribbeans two dozen islands have similar problems 
because of shrinking world markets for bauxite oil bananas sugar 
and other traditional exports 
unemployment in the region averages 22 percent foreign debt in 
the billions drains tax revenues inflation erodes buying power and 
living standards fall 
foreign investment trade agreements like the reagan 
administrations caribbean basin initiative and expansion of 
tourism have not stopped the decline 
unfortunately the united states thinks in terms of hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to solve caribbean problems when its going 
to take hundreds of millions of dollars said birns whose 
organization often criticizes us policy in the region 
bakr a former policeman who converted to islam demanded 
robinsons resignation and blamed him for the countrys economic 
plight most of bakrs support came from poor blacks 
robinson won a landslide election victory in 1986 but birns 
said the prime minister had become a political pariah largely 
because of austerity measures dictated by the international 
monetary fund as a condition for new loans 
consumer price increases layoffs and reduced spending on 
schools and hospitals demanded by the imf have provoked riots in 
jamaica the dominican republic and guyana as well as several 
latin american countries 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi stepped into this picture 
analysts say with handouts for bakr and radical political parties 
with potential to destabilize governments 
its a wellknown fact that libya has funded leftist 
activities in dominica antigua and st lucia and separatists 
organizations in martinique and guadeloupe said john collins 
caribbean advisor to the puerto rican government 
the leftofcenter parties in these small islands use support 
from gadhafi to exploit the economic underdevelopment which exists 
in their countries to mount opposition to the rightofcenter 
parties that are prous 
the sixday hostage siege in trinidad which prompted widespread 
looting and claimed at least 38 lives has prompted caribbean 
leaders to review regional security measures 
our determination that this must not happen again must be 
given explicit effect prime minister erskine sandiford of 
barbados said at last weeks annual meeting of the 13member 
caribbean economic community or caricom in kingston jamaica 
prime minister eugenia charles of dominica said a regional 
security agreement dating to the 1983 us invasion of grenada 
should be expanded to allow caricom armies to intervene when an 
elected government is threatened 
in trinidads case caricom sent a multinational force of 150 on 
friday two days after the siege ended to aid the army and police 
guyanas independent stabroek news said in an editorial that the 
attempted coup was an affront to the aspiration of the regions 
people 
we know the shock waves have reverberated throughout the 
caribbean where many governments face a difficult economic 
situation and we imagine this will spur them all to greater and 
more purposeful efforts to define a democratic future for caribbean 
peoples it said 
anthony maingot a native of trinidad who teaches sociology at 
florida international university in miami acknowledged the 
regions vulnerability but said democracy was firmly entrenced 
this is the largest gathering of third world democracies in 
the world maingot said 
he noted that in trinidad prime minister robinson is still 
there the elected government is still there and parliamentary 
democracy is still intact this is the silver lining of the cloud

the domestic textile industry and its workers 
are portraying themselves as sacrificial lambs in the 
administrations jockeying to reduce foreign trade barriers to us 
exports 
casting itself as a victim is nothing new for an industry that 
has lost 30 percent of the american textile and clothing market and 
about 400000 jobs to foreigners in the 1980s alone 
in the past decade the foreign share of the us fiber and 
apparel market has climbed from 28 percent to 60 percent as a 
result 1500 domestic plants have been closed and us employment 
in the industry has dropped 25 percent 
the industry blames a wide variety of economic and political 
forces 
ideological free traders in the reagan and bush administrations 
the governments desire to maintain us influence abroad in 
the face of a shrinking ability to provide direct foreign aid 
the development of exportoriented textile apparel and shoe 
industries in lessdeveloped countries so theyll have cash to pay 
back loans from american banks 
there is a belief that many of the debtor lessdeveloped 
countries must be allowed to ship textiles and apparel to the us 
in order to earn foreign exchange said daniel frierson past 
president of the american textile manufacturers institute and in 
some instances we now see where these debts are being forgiven in 
return for barter for textiles 
frierson chairman of dixie yarns inc of chattanooga tenn 
heads an industry coalition that is behind the senates passage 
earlier this month of a bill to limit further growth of textile 
apparel and footwear imports to 1 percent a year 
opponents of the proposed new quotas contend they will raise the 
price of apparel other textile products and shoes to us 
consumers by 25 billion to 27 billion a year 
you do not notice it much said sen bob packwood rore 
just 50 cents a shirt here a dollar two dollars a pair of 
shoes there but add that up by 250 million consumers in this 
country that is a lot of money 
the bill has cleared the house ways and means committee and 
with 243 sponsors passage seems virtually assured when 
representatives return from recess in september whether it can 
survive bushs expected veto is another question 
nearly identical legislation was approved by congress in 1985 
and 1988 but was vetoed by reagan bush has vowed to do the same 
should it reach his desk 
the administration contends the bill would undermine us 
efforts to lower foreign barriers to american farm and computer 
exports banks and other investors 
if this textile legislation is passed into law then other 
nations will take off the negotiating table matters that are 
extremely important to us said ronald j sorini the chief us 
negotiator in the 100nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
talks going on in geneva 
sorini and other us officials contend they will support quotas 
on textiles and apparel in some form for another 10 years but 
industry leaders fear they will only open the door to more imports 
the us government has two bargaining chips to use to obtain 
its gatt goals agriculture and textiles said jay mazur 
president of the international ladies garment workers union 
with few signs that agreement will be reached on agriculture 
only apparel and textiles remain as giveaways he said and 
there is every indication that the administration is prepared to 
give them away

sammie harkless rose quickly in the print shop 
of an investment banking firm and he and his pregnant wife live 
comfortably in a suburban new jersey apartment 
four years ago he was a homeless drug addict 
in between his time on the streets and his arrival at morgan 
stanley amp co harkless discovered binding together inc a copy 
shop that does more than duplicate resumes 
it takes recovering drug addicts and teaches them the printing 
trade 
four years ago i thought there was no hope for me said 
harkless 32 i was living on the streets using drugs really i 
was bankrupt spiritually 
binding together gave him the chance he needed to change he 
said all i have to do now is just maintain this 
students at binding together are referred by drug treatment 
centers they read on average at a seventhgrade level and often 
need tutoring to handle copyshop paperwork 
the program provides six months of instruction in binding 
shipping and receiving and operating stateoftheart printing 
machines graduates get 2000 each most use the money to get an 
apartment and buy clothes for work 
the program has 82 graduates ranging is age from 22 to 40 since 
it started two years ago thirteen people didnt finish the course 
and 30 are in training now 
right now in the graphic arts industry there is a shortage of 
trained people said michael lamberti a spokesman for morgan 
stanley 
the company started harkless as a clerk in its inhouse print 
shop promoted him to a machine operator and then to a shift 
supervisor within 19 months 
its all because he can do the job lamberti said he came 
to us trained 
all binding together graduates are placed in jobs that pay at 
least 7 an hour surveys taken four months after graduates left 
found 85 percent were still at work 
more than half of binding togethers annual 650000 budget 
comes from sales the business makes of printing services to 
corporate clients such as equitable and time warner 
the rest comes from private foundations corporations and public 
agencies including the state division of substance abuse services 
which came up with the idea of opening a business that could pay 
some of its own bills while teaching people a skill 
binding together was one of 17 job training programs honored in 
march with presidential citations 
its a well thoughtout program said yvonne degaetano 
deputy commissioner for the city department of employment which 
also provides money for binding together the staff is incredibly 
good its not just a job they believe in what theyre doing 
people become family and become connected with each other and 
particularly with this population you need to do that 
bruce sims 29 a recent graduate agreed 
i didnt really have faith in myself when i was ready to give 
up the staff encouraged me he said 
sims is a high school dropout and said he would treasure the 
certificate he got from binding together im going to hang this 
up on my wall and look at it every night and morning he said 
binding together is run by phil calderella 40 a retired police 
officer who also worked for four years in the printing business 
some people are in a situation where they have hit rock 
bottom he said when you come across somebody like that you 
have to put forth the extra effort given the right tools to help 
them reenter society theyre going to change

an effort to ban cruising in milwaukee and 
three suburbs has escalated into a legal battle with teenagers 
claiming a right to free travel 
the laws prohibit cars from passing a given point more than 
twice in two hours police keep track by recording license plate 
numbers on laptop computers 
its a ridiculous law i think checkpoint charlie was taken 
down in europe and put up here said diane brandmiller 25 the 
first person arrested in may under the ordinance in west allis 
the american civil liberties union last week sued on behalf of 
ms brandmiller and hundreds of teenage drivers the lawsuit 
filed against milwaukee west allis hales corner and greenfield 
contends the bans trample on drivers rights to travel freely 
ms brandmiller who pleaded innocent to the charges said she 
is not a cruiser by nature but supports the challenge 
its a milwaukee tradition she said i expect my parents 
were cruisers 
greenfield police capt phil hall said that on two streets 
young drivers cruising around were constantly screeching tires 
throwing bottles urinating and playing boom boxes 
it was the volume of traffic where emergency vehicles couldnt 
even move on the street they had to use the sidewalks the people 
in the area were complaining about losing business hall said 
fines for violating the ordinances range from 50 to 200 
depending on the number of violations 
west allis police have made only 10 arrests since the ban was 
enacted but report a dramatic decrease in the volume of traffic on 
main streets other departments have reported similar experiences 
the streets are back to normal back to the way they should 
be theyre so you can drive on them again said lt ronald 
hensel of the west allis police department 
jerome buting an attorney for the aclu said the lawsuit seeks 
to have the laws declared unconstitutional 
the aclu fears that the cities have gone so far to deal with a 
perceived problem that they have enacted laws that hurt more 
than cruisers he said 
greenfield mayor james m besson disagreed arguing that police 
wont go after drivers who dont appear to be cruisers 
protesters angry over the bans picketed in milwaukee in june 
you should be able to go where you want to when you want to 
mostly cruisers are driving around and talking said one picket 
eric nelson 19 theres a few cruisers around looking for 
fights but theyre a small percentage

congress is on summer recess after a weekend 
marathon that produced a pentagon spending blueprint in the senate 
campaign finance overhaul in the house and final passage of 
emergency relief to cities hard hit by aids 
left hanging after the burst of legislative activity were the 
delicate and politically testy negotiations between congress 
and the white house on a deficitreduction plan to avert mandatory 
acrosstheboard budget cuts 
also awaiting action when the house and senate return after 
labor day are conference talks on the first major clean air bill in 
more than 13 years a measure to boost aid for child care and a 
possible new fight over family leave legislation that president 
bush vetoed earlier this year 
lawmakers also face the usual electionyear deadline pressures 
of trying to complete the major spending bills in time to hit the 
campaign trail as early in october as possible 
the senate and house face particularly acute differences over 
the defense bill these include policy divisions on how much to 
spend on b2 stealth bomber production and the future of the 
strategic defense initiative once the glittering cornerstone of 
reagan administration defense policy but now dimmed by warming 
ussoviet relations 
in approving a 289 billion defense bill on saturday the senate 
left intact bushs proposal to build two b2 bombers in the 1991 
fiscal year starting oct 1 but the senate cut 1 billion from his 
star wars request leaving 37 billion 
while the senate pegged total defense spending at 18 billion 
less than the 307 billion bush sought the house favors even 
steeper cuts of 24 billion 
but even though the senate version represents the likely 
highwater mark in defense spending in congress this year the 
white house said defense secretary dick cheney is likely to 
recommend a veto 
cheney objects to the reduction in the star wars program and to 
the senates call for a 100000 reduction in us military 
personnel the senate also voted to eliminate 16 billion in 
procurement money for the mx railmobile missile program 
in their rush to leave the citys august heat behind the house 
and senate approved a number of measures including a campaign 
finance package backed by the house democratic leadership making a 
number of changes and limiting house campaign spending to 715000 
a candidate 
the house bill which seeks to curb contributions by fat 
cat corporate political action committees must be reconciled 
with a differing senate version 
the aids measure would provide more than 4 billion over five 
years to help us cities hardest hit by the disease 
the bill authorizes nearly 900 million per year in aids 
spending for five years with 275 million authorized to be divided 
among the cities in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and such sums as 
may be necessary through fiscal 1995 
a similar amount would be authorized for distribution to the 
states for improving quality and availability of care for people 
with the aidscausing hiv virus 
a major portion of the money for the cities would be earmarked 
to help provide health and social services 
the first half of the money about 137 million would be 
divided among the 16 areas singled out for special assistance the 
other half would be redistributed in fiscal 1992 based on the 
number of aids cases at that time 
the cities authorized to receive the assistance are atlanta 
38 million boston 3 million chicago 42 million dallas 3 
million fort lauderdale fla 27 million houston 56 
million jersey city 28 million los angeles 13 million 
miami 53 million new york 513 million newark 63 million

hiroshima came to a halt for a moment 
today in observance of the worlds first atom bomb attack which 
leveled this bustling coastal city 45 years ago 
for an eery moment the city fell silent automobiles stopped 
and people throughout this industrial center of one million 
residents joined in a moment of prayer to comfort the souls of the 
140000 people who died from the bomb 
i pay my deep respects to the citizens of hiroshima who have 
built this city of international peace from the ashes prime 
minister toshiki kaifu said in an address to a crowd of 55000 at a 
commemoration ceremony 
as the only country in the world to have experienced an atom 
bomb attack japan has resolved not to let it be repeated with our 
three nonnuclear principles and our calls for total nuclear 
disarmament and everlasting peace the united states dropped the 
atom bomb on hiroshima a major military center during world war 
ii on august 6 1945 the bomb wiped out nearly half the 300000 
people who lived in the city killing most immediately many others 
died within months from radiation burns and other afflictions 
some 70000 buildings were destroyed including most of the 
citys hospitals 
in his annual peace declaration hiroshima mayor takeshi araki 
called pledges by the united states and the soviet union to reduce 
their nuclear arsenals the best hope for the future he called for 
the banishment of all nuclear tests and nuclear weapons worldwide 
by early today a wide plaza in front of the cenotaph the 
central monument to atom bomb victims was filled with mourners and 
flowers wilting in the heat 
dignitaries hiroshima residents and foreign guests bowed their 
heads in a moment of silent prayer at 815 am the moment the 
bomb exploded in a blinding flash of light 45 years earlier 
hiroshima has been honoring the dead each year for 43 years 
movies museum exhibits monuments and victims testimony describe 
the bombing that reduced hiroshima to rubble and left its seven 
rivers choked with dead 
each year 15 million people visit the citys peace memorial 
museum where several graphic exhibits refer to the attack as 
genocide and point out that it was carried out against innocent 
civilians 
not all hiroshima residents can face the memories retired 
school teacher minako tanabe said her husband has never attended 
the annual peace ceremony 
my husband wont come here because its too sad so many of 
his friends died that day she said 
at the ceremony 5551 names of victims exposed to the bomb who 
died in the past year were added to the names enshrined in the 
cenotaph 
although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly 
related to the bomb researchers believe the risk of death from 
leukemia and lung bone and breast cancer is much greater for those 
exposed 
three days after the attack on hiroshima the united states 
dropped a second atom bomb on the city of nagasaki killing another 
70000 civilians japan surrendered on august 15 1945 ending the 
war

al capone was sent up the river in 1931 on a 
federal income tax rap but the mobster who ruled the chicago 
underworld would be untouchable today if the jurys verdict at a 
mock trial is any indication 
public enemy no 1 seemed sure of the outcome of the fantasy 
trial as he strode with a smile on his face and confidence in his 
step into a makeshift courtroom sunday 
capone actually was joe guastaferro an actor hired by the 
american bar association which sought to demonstrate modern 
courtroom tactics at its annual meeting here 
all bets seemed to be on capone who ran chicagos gambling and 
booze rackets in the 1920s with a gang of tommy guntoting toughs 
thanks to a stable of fine mouthpieces and favorable changes 
in tax laws capone was acquitted on all 12 counts of money 
laundering willingly failing to file taxes and conspiracy to 
defraud the united states 
the verdict did not surprise indianapolis attorney linda pence 
who played a government lawyer at the trial 
the problem we had was that we were trying to summarize 11 
days of testimony in three witnesses she said usually a jury 
hears evidence over and over again from several witnesses and we 
didnt have that 
and the law has changed a bit when the capone case was first 
tried there were very few guidelines about what you could do 
ms pence did express some mock concern at the mock acquittal 
however 
i just hope the jury doesnt let him off so easily next time 
it worries me a little bit that al capone is roaming the streets of 
chicago again she said 
the bar association enlisted a real federal judge and jury and 
lawyers who studied transcripts and evidence from the trial 59 
years ago sundays trial was held in the ballroom of a chicago 
hotel 
we are going to prove to you that he has exhibited an 
arrogance uncommon to the average american taxpayer ms pence 
told the jury while living like a king he never filed taxes 
never filed a return 
us district judge prentice marshall who presided over the 
trial praised the defense lawyers for their apparently successful 
efforts to discredit the prosecutions key witness 
at the original trial defense attorneys did not attack the 
credibility of capone bookkeeper fred ries a twotime convict 
but the defense this time said the government coerced ries into 
singing like a canary by sticking him in a cell with a colony of 
cockroaches 
it was torture wasnt it asked the defense attorney 
played by terence maccarthy executive director of the federal 
defender program in chicago 
it was not an enjoyable experience ries replied 
and after five days you decided to quote play ball 
maccarthy responded you said ill tell them whatever they want 
to know 
the rev patrick smith a boyhood friend of ries and defense 
witness later said the bookkeeper was known as someone who 
couldnt be trusted 
im afraid if you had a choice between shaking hands with the 
devil and with frank ries youd shake hands with the devil every 
time smith testified 
in 1931 capone was convicted on five counts of evading income 
taxes and failing to file tax returns he was sentenced to 11 years 
in prison and served almost seven years capone died of syphilis in 
1947 at his florida home

rural development efforts by the federal 
government are tainted by money shortages and poor management of 
the limited funds that are available a study says 
the yearlong project financed by the ford foundation focused 
on the farmers home administration an agency of the agriculture 
department the fmha handles a variety of farm housing and 
community programs 
a report was released sunday by the center for community change 
a nonprofit advocacy group for lowincome rural people 
federal support for rural development was cut by nearly 70 
percent during the reagan administration said robert rapoza who 
directed the study yet the majority of the remaining funds 
failed to reach the neediest rural communities the federal 
response to these communities has been plainly inadequate 
joe oneill a spokesman for the fmha said the agency had not 
had the opportunity to study the report but he said were 
always pleased to get these kinds of studies and they can be 
very useful 
the report said rural problems include 
unemployment adjusted to include underemployment is onethird 
higher than in the cities 
rural americans are more likely to be poor onethird more 
rural people than urban residents are below the poverty line 
ninetyseven percent of the nations rural residents rely on 
ground water for drinking yet a 1984 survey by the environmental 
protection agency found twothirds of the wells were contaminated 
almost 2 million rural residents live in substandard housing 
usually lacking adequate plumbing 
maternal and infant mortality rates are substantially higher 
than in urban areas and are rising at faster rates 
rural residents are as a group less educated less healthy 
and less skilled than their urban counterparts the report said 
they operate in a comparatively static more conservative 
business environment and they receive less help from washington 
the report criticized the fmha which has its roots in the 
great depression era of the 1930s for not targeting more of its 
resources to poor communities to help build water and sewer 
systems health centers fire houses and businesses these programs 
add up to about 900 million this year 
according to the report povertylevel communities got only 2 
percent to 3 percent of total fmha loans and grants for water and 
sewer facilities between 1985 and 1988 
the report said one reason for not targeting on the poorest 
communities is the way fmha uses poverty data 
while the agency adjusts the poverty line upward each year it 
uses 1980 census numbers to determine the average income of 
individual communities it said thus some communities whose 
average income exceeded the poverty level in 1980 now fall under 
todays higher poverty line 
the effect according to the report is that those communities 
qualify for fmha assistance even though others are much poorer 
programs operated by the epa also were criticized for failing to 
provide more help for rural areas to meet federal water standards 
epa figures indicate that twothird of rural water supplies 
violate agency drinking water standards said maureen kennedy 
principal author of the report given this need it is disturbing 
that the epa has not provided more support to rural areas 
despite the need the report said epa spends a very small and 
diminishing amount on wastewater projects in rural areas 
figures for epa construction grants between 1981 and 1987 
declined by 91 percent in real terms after adjustments for 
inflation the report said 
the report hedged on recommending a vast reorganization of 
federal rural development programs such as blending them all into 
one super agency but it did propose some administrative changes 
within usdas hierarchy 
also it said many communities lack the knowhow for getting 
access to federal programs that might help them develop 
further the report said most fmha staff people come from 
agricultural backgrounds despite the fact that these programs 
demand training in finance civil engineering and organizing 
consequently fmha should strengthen its substantive training 
programs but more importantly the agency should focus its 
recruiting efforts on those with backgrounds appropriate to the 
changing needs of the agency the report said

the oil war between iraq and kuwait 
jeopardizes an important lifeline for the world economy and 
americans already are seeing the results at the gasoline pump 
here are some questions and answers to help explain the economic 
stakes in the gulf crisis 
q cant we get by without iraqs oil 
a yes and apparently we will since president bush has ordered 
a total cutoff of imports from iraq the united states japan 
canada and the european community announced embargoes on iraqi oil 
after iraqs invasion thursday of kuwait 
q if we dont need iraqs oil why would prices go up 
a often the price of oil is influenced more by fear than logic 
if oil companies and brokers decide theres a chance that the 
persian gulf crisis could worsen they are likely to bid for the 
first available barrel rather than use one already in storage the 
more the bidding the higher the price goes some critics say the 
oil companies take advantage of this uncertainty by jacking up 
their prices at the gasoline pump although the industry hotly 
disputes this 
q does this mean ill be paying more at the pump 
a almost surely the american automobile association says its 
survey of gasoline stations showed prices rose by 4 to 14 cents a 
gallon in just the first two days after the iraqi invasion edward 
rothschild of citizen action a washingtonbased consumer group 
thinks prices will jump 15 to 20 cents a gallon by the end of the 
month but the bush administration says it sees no risk of a big 
rise 
q wouldnt it help if american oil companies pumped more crude 
a probably but theres no chance of that in fact its the 
lack of spare production capacity in part that makes the us 
consumer vulnerable to price increases caused by foreign wars us 
oil companies have been shutting down wells since 1986 when a 
collapse of crude prices made many smaller wells uneconomic 
domestic oil production is down 20 percent since 1985 and the 
number of oil and natural gas operators in this country has plunged 
from 13000 to 4500 since 1985 according to the independent 
petroleum association of america a trade group 
q if more oil supply is the answer to keeping down prices why 
is bush boycotting iraq 
a the embargo is mainly a diplomatic tool the president 
himself said friday he couldnt assure the american public that the 
pressure tactic would pay off in fact the administration may not 
be anxious for it to work too well if every nation refused to buy 
iraqs oil the world would suddenly find itself short of oil at 
least for a short time 
if we were truly successful on the embargo we would throw 
ourselves into a serious recession said rep philip r sharp 
dind chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
energy and power 
q doesnt the united states have emergency oil reserved for 
crises like this 
a yes there is a large reserve but no it apparently wont be 
used under the current circumstances known as the strategic 
petroleum reserve the system is a series of salt caverns in 
louisiana and texas that holds nearly 590 million barrels of oil 
or enough to replace more than onethird of us imports for 170 
days 
the reserve which was started in 1975 in response to the 1973 
arab oil embargo has never been used and the administration says 
it sees no need for tapping it now

states increased taxes by an estimated 76 
billion during 1990 legislative sessions pushed by higher costs 
for schools prisons and health care a study released today said 
in its annual survey of state budgets the national conference 
of state legislatures said it expected state finances to continue 
to deteriorate in the coming year 
state balances fell throughout fiscal 1990 and for most states 
including all the larger states are now dangerously low the 
group said 
the national average balance fell from 45 percent of 
expenditures at the end of fiscal 1989 to 4 percent at the end of 
fiscal 1990 and is expected to fall to 23 percent by the end of 
fiscal 1991 it said 
those balances are considered indicators of state fiscal 
conditions and many states try to maintain a balance of 5 percent 
of general fund spending the balance is considered a cushion 
against emergencies for states required by law or constitution to 
have balanced budgets 
the ncsl released its report at its annual meeting being held 
this week in nashville tenn 
the report said many state fiscal conditions weakened during the 
last year northeast and new england states were the hardest hit 
tax increases were passed in 23 states those tax increases are 
expected to increase revenue by 76 billion in fiscal 1991 an 
increase of 26 percent of state tax collections 
the study said spending for medicaid education and corrections 
grew faster than general state revenue medicaid spending grew at a 
25 percent annual rate putting pressure on state budgets 
of the three major types of taxes 10 states increased personal 
income taxes the report said ten raised corporate income taxes 
and 17 raised sales and use taxes 
the biggest tax increases were in new jersey massachusetts 
florida new york kentucky and texas 
other states raising taxes were connecticut maine new 
hampshire rhode island vermont delaware ohio kansas nebraska 
alabama louisiana tennessee virginia arizona new mexico 
oklahoma and washington 
new jerseys increase totaled 22 billion or 21 percent of 
1989 revenue the report said massachusetts increase was 116 
billion or 128 percent and floridas was 109 billion or 87 
percent the report said 
states listed as lowering taxes were indiana iowa minnesota 
south carolina utah and hawaii all of the decreases were small

within 24 hours of the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait the house was ready to roar with its condemnation it was 
chestbeating time 
a resolution calling for an embargo against iraq arrived for a 
vote so quickly that few in the chamber had read it rep bob 
walker rpa asked for a few hours delay he was ignored 
as lawmakers streamed in rep bob mrazek dny stood in an 
aisle urging his colleagues to support the measure 
end the war end the war please vote yes he said loudly 
theyre pulling out as we speak because they never expected us 
to do this 
not surprisingly the measure passed with breathtaking speed and 
with no opposition 
mrazeks dry humor reflects something most lawmakers readily 
acknowledge but like to pretend isnt true congress role is very 
limited when it comes to fastmoving world events 
the house bill called for something president bush already was 
doing on his own retaliating economically against iraq with an 
embargo 
to understand why congress acted so quickly the bill must be 
put in context 
congress is a frustratingly slow and complex place to work and 
laced with political traps at the same time lawmakers are 
desperately eager to get involved vent their frustrations and cast 
their votes in a politically popular way 
in foreign affairs as in the domestic arena congress power 
is in the control of the purse but the house and senate foreign 
affairs committees are largely ineffective in this crucial area 
so for the committees and for congress as a whole these foreign 
affairs resolutions provide welcome relief 
as mrazek implied few expected the resolution to have any 
effect on iraq or its president saddam hussein 
it would be very foolish to think that a resolution of 
sanctions by the united states would have deterred an otherwise 
reckless irresponsible illegal and dangerous action said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash i think it is a matter of 
expressing our strong disapproval and concern 
break husseins arm said rep william s broomfield 
rmich senior republican on the house foreign affairs committee 
president bush has a fistful of hardhitting options he should 
choose one and choose one now 
the house beat the senate to the punch in this case but it 
doesnt always in fact the senate quickly passes resolutions on 
most noteworthy international events and according to minority 
leader bob dole rkan sometimes without enough regard for what 
they mean 
its a wellworn cliche that congress consists of 535 
secretaries of state but its more like 535 imitation secretaries 
of state 
few lawmakers have any true expertise in international affairs 
and their votes on matters affecting other nations are filtered 
through the one area in which nearly everyone on capitol hill is 
truly expert getting reelected 
since the direct affect on constituents of any foreign affairs 
resolution is minimal it doesnt take long to decide how to vote 
most of the time it doesnt matter dole said in a recent 
speech on the senate floor but sometimes he said it does 
on a trip to the middle east dole found that a senate 
resolution on jerusalem passed without controversy by lawmakers 
wanting to show support for israel and to maintain their own 
support in the jewish community was causing consternation there 
at a critical juncture in the peace process 
they believe there is still some sense in the senate in what 
we do and say he said and they despair when they see that 
sometimes too often what we really deal in is the nonsense of the 
senate

here are the united states military options 
as outlined by house armed services committee chairman les aspin 
dwis should iraq invade saudi arabia 
aspin discussed the choices on the cbs news program face the 
nation on sunday 
asked if the united states would launch an attack in the event 
of an invasion aspin said 
i think that the question the answer is yes i think thats 
almost inevitable those saudi oil fields are so important to the 
national security of the united states and im assuming that when 
the invasion comes that saudi arabia would say ok i would think 
we would do it 
aspin said the attack could be managed although the iraqi army 
is larger 
well i guess the first question is can you do it with air 
power i mean its a race to the oil fields basically the oil 
fields are the key and the iraqis presumably most intelligence 
think would go right down the gulf coast heading for the saudi 
arabian oil fields and its a race to the oil fields 
now what we have available to stop that first and foremost 
would be some air power not probably as much as we ought to have 
in the region but some air power the question is can you stop the 
invading iraqi force with air power alone 
asked whether the iraqis would be able to use the powerful 
antiaircraft missiles supplied by the soviets aspin said 
no no i think thats not a danger in the area of saudi 
arabia they would be moving down with tanks its a great 
territory to go with tanks its flat its hard they could move 
very quickly with tanks but theyre in the open theres no cover 
theres no concealment its essentially the air power against the 
tanks i would guess maybe a 1in4 chance of stopping those and 
also as you said at the show here today is the logistics problem 
besides trying to stop iraq with air power aspin said there are 
two other things america could do 
none of this is ideal but option number two is to carry the 
war to baghdad in other words to when the war comes use air 
power and go after the iraqi homeland the third option high risk 
high risk and it needs saudi arabia to invite us in early 
enough in other words before the attack is to land some 
american ground forces along that route down to the saudi oil 
fields 
we cant get enough in there to protect the oil fields but 
essentially get enough in there as a trip wire a deterrence and 
the message to mr hussein would be if you attack those american 
troops right along that line i mean that is war right to the end 
now those troops would be vastly outgunned they would have 
to retreat very quickly but it would essentially be the kind of 
thing like the brigade like the brigade we had in berlin through 
all the years of the cold war i mean they were there more as a 
symbol of anything and as a deterrence than as an effective 
military force high risk to put us troops in that kind of 
situation

threatened with dismissal after the 
government sent in troops to end their 41day strike banana 
workers have accepted 254 percent pay hikes and agreed to go back 
to work 
president rafael leonardo callejas announced late sunday that 
the 10000 chiquita brand international workers had accepted his 
offer without any conditions they were to be back on the job 
today 
the army removed 4000 strikers from company installations on 
saturday and a military source said at least two strikers and two 
security policemen were wounded by gunfire in the takeover in la 
lima 180 miles north of tegucigalpa a union spokesman said two 
other strikers were beaten 
under the agreement troops will remain at chiquita until 
banana production is totally normalized 
in a statement the government said the strike movement 
provoked by irresponsible union leaders threatened to destroy 
honduran democracy as well as causing enormous irreparable damage 
to the national economy 
chiquita brand produces and exports 60 percent of honduras 
banana crop the countrys main source of foreign exchange and 
preliminary government estimates said the strike caused 60 million 
in losses 
there are no winners or losers callejas said on nationwide 
radio and television the situation was overcome so that we can 
face the enormous problems that afflict the nation 
free unionism has the same as the companies and institutions 
in which it operates the enormous responsibility of sharing with 
the government social stability as the basic priniciple of peaceful 
coexistence he said 
the increase will raise the average banana workers pay from 
246 a month to 30850 negotiations were to continue today on 
sick leave and other points the strikers walked out on june 25 
demanding an increase of 60 percent 
the wage increase the union accepted was the same one it had 
rejected on friday chiquita had on saturday refused the unions 
counterproposal 
several hundred soldiers and police then ousted the workers and 
occupied la lima a city of 60000 the government announced in 
repeated broadcasts that it was giving chiquita a free hand to 
replace the striking workers but said they still could return to 
their jobs 
karl f koch local manager of chiquita and rene ayestas the 
union president signed the agreement

the air force has spent hundreds of millions 
of dollars on goldplated chandeliers golf course projects and 
other luxuries to boost morale internal pentagon documents show 
back in 1985 the air force decided to refurbish its officers 
club at the mildenhall base in britain at a cost of 75000 the 
services champagne taste however hardly matched the appropriated 
amount 
goldplated chandeliers valued at 145000 were installed solid 
oak paneling lined the walls and fireplaces with marble fixtures 
completed the decor the final tally was more than 2 million with 
us taxpayers picking up the tab 
the internal air force audits conducted in april and may of 
this year reveal widespread waste and abuse in the air force 
management of its morale welfare and recreation activities 
golf course projects at myrtle beach air force base cost nearly 
600000 while parties for a departing officer at ramstein air 
base in germany totaled 26000 
in a letter to defense secretary dick cheney rep barbara 
boxer dcalif called for leadership from the highest levels of 
the pentagon to crack down on these abuses 
the documents reveal a mindset among some senior air force 
officials that the bases they command are their own personal 
fiefdoms with appropriated funds to be used at their discretion 
regardless of law and regulation boxer said in the letter 
according to the documents strict restrictions on excessive 
spending on renovation projects have been either ignored or 
circumvented projects valued at more than 500000 must be 
reported to congress in some instances however major projects 
were split into smaller projects to avoid seeking congressional 
approval 
even the air force auditors expressed dismay at the renovation 
projects 
in the documents air force management at the base in england 
argued that the chandeliers couldnt be standardissue 
low quality chandeliers could not act as the main 
architectural highlight of a room as the existing chandeliers do 
the crystal used would not have the capability to break apart the 
available light in a room into its primary colors prism effect 
the air force said 
in response the auditors said spending an additional 15900 
in appropriated funds to purchase chandeliers that have the correct 
prism effect is not appropriate 
other instances of abuse include relocation of a skeet shooting 
club at tinker air force base in oklahoma the estimated cost of 
the project was 722000 and it was included in the cost of a 
construction project for basing of the b2 stealth bomber

an advisory council to the national endowment 
for the arts is rejecting a proposal to bar support for any project 
that advances a particular point of view 
the proposal offered sunday by dr jacob neusner a professor 
of religious studies at the university of south florida at tampa 
was defeated 102 with one abstention 
john frohnmayer the chairman of the government arts endowment 
said he strongly opposed the restriction because it represented 
the highest degree of insensitivity 
the proposal would have barred support for any project that 
advocates or promotes a particular political ideological 
religious or partisan point of view 
the advisory group the national council on the arts which 
frohnmayer also heads instead adopted a proposal reaffirming the 
endowments commitment to bring quality art to the american 
people by fair procedures careful analysis and an opposition to 
obscenity 
the nea has been under heavy fire from conservatives since it 
funded an exhibit by photographer robert mapplethorpe that included 
works some considered obscene

prices on the tokyo stock exchange rebounded 
slightly monday afternoon from a dramatic morning fall to close 
sharply down on the day while the dollar closed slightly up 
against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 91623 
points or 31 percent on trading of an estimated 330 million 
shares the index closed at 2859953 points 
the mornings drop of 110669 points or 37 percent would 
have been the seventhlargest fall in exchange history if sustained 
the sudden fall followed tokyos announcement sunday night that 
it would impose tough sanctions on iraq as punishment for its 
invasion of oilrich kuwait the index lost 72942 points friday 
the day after the invasion 
meanwhile the dollar finished the day at 14950 up 015 yen 
from fridays close of 14935 yen it ranged between 14940 yen and 
15035 yen during the days trading 
in bond markets the yield of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond was 7960 percent at the close of trading 
up from 7705 percent friday 
the bond price slid to 8360 points from 8472 points 
worries about higher oil prices and a tighter monetary policy to 
combat inflation drove the market fall said yoshiro inoue an 
analyst with nomura securities 
but it is not as bad as during the oil shock of 197374 
japan europe and the united states have reduced their oil imports 
oil prices will probably creep up so inflation wont rise 
suddenly he said 
he said he thought the market might rebound during the week 
another influence on the current economy is the lack of the 
commmodity boom that plagued the early 1970s said ed merner an 
analyst at schroders investment management japan 
with the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
controlling a smaller percentage of the worlds oil output than two 
decades ago not only japan but also the world is in a very good 
position i think people in japan probably overreacted merner 
said 
but the middle east situation and the sanctions announced 
sunday added one more piece of bad news to a market that has been 
heading down since the beginning of the year he said 
japan announced sunday that it was banning all purchases of oil 
from iraq and kuwait as well as all japanese exports to the two 
countries suspending loans and banning all japanese investments 
there 
japanese companies are still trying to collect 33 billion in 
credits from iraq bankers speaking anonymously said they thought 
the debts were not as big a concern as their size might indicate 
because they had been difficult to collect for a long time and 
japanese companies must have accepted that 
japan received 62 percent of its oil needs from iraq in the 
first quarter of 1990 importing 260000 barrels a day and 
obtained 5 percent of its oil from kuwait or 210000 barrels a day 
japans current oil stockpile is estimated at about 142 days 
the stockpile was expanded over the weekend when japanese 
companies bought huge amounts of oil from iraq at a premium of a 
dollar per barrel industry sources said

government officials and consumer advocates are 
demanding investigations into the cause of a blackout that left 
25000 west side customers without power for the second time in 
eight days 
residents and business owners also insisted commonwealth edison 
reimburse them for their losses sunday after an explosion and fire 
destroyed a substation used to reroute power around a switching 
yard that burned july 28 
power was restored to all customers in the mostly poor 
neighborhood about 7 hours later commonwealth edison spokesman 
bob berdelle said 
there was none of the looting that followed the july 28 
blackout which left 40000 residents without power some for three 
days police said 
the cause of sundays explosion was not immediately known 
berdelle said 
the blackout sparked complaints that commonwealth edisons 
backup systems are inadequate 
pat clark spokeswoman for the consumer group citizens utility 
board said outages have become all too common in commonwealth 
edisons service area and she called on the illinois commerce 
commission to expand its probe of julys blackout to include 
sundays outage a move the commission took later in the day 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan renewed his call for an 
investigation into the utilitys emergency plans fire officials 
began an investigation and the city will form a committee to study 
chicagos utilities and recommend safeguards against failures said 
mayor richard m daley 
the people who live in those areas are just pulling their 
lives together from last week now theyre hit by a onetwo punch 
from commonwealth edison the mayor said commonwealth edison 
owes them for all theyve been through 
commonwealth edison will probably not pay claims for damages 
unless the utility is found to have been negligent berdelle said 
we try to have perfect service to everybody all the time and 
thats just impossible said don petkus commonwealth edison vice 
president its a system that relies on technology that 
occasionally fails 
about 13000 homes and businesses in the metropolitan area were 
without power at other periods saturday and sunday because of four 
smaller outages unrelated to the blackout an opossum that knocked 
out a transformer and three other malfunctions caused blackouts of 
between 40 minutes and more than three hours in the five suburbs 
and on chicagos south side the utility said 
police said an additional 200 officers were sent to the west 
side after the second blackout hit no arrests were made said sgt

prices dropped sharply today on the tokyo stock 
exchange reflecting wide uncertainty about the longterm effects 
on oil prices and interest rates of japanese sanctions against iraq 
meanwhile the dollar closed slightly up against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues closed at 
2859953 points down 91623 points or 31 percent on trading of 
an estimated 330 million shares the index lost 72942 points 
friday the day after iraqs invasion 
the index fell 110669 points or 37 percent in morning 
trading in response to the government announcement sunday night 
that tokyo would ban all oil imports from iraq and kuwait and 
japanese exports to the two countries 
analysts said they expected the market to rebound if the middle 
east situation did not further deteriorate they said japans 
economy is still strong has a 142day oil stockpile and is less 
dependent on oil imports than during the arab oil embargo of 
197374 
the market should rebound later in the week said yoshiro 
inoue an analyst with nomura securities 
overall the economy should remain strong unless all falls 
apart in the middle east said ed merner an investment analyst 
and manager for schroders investment management japan 
yutaka yoshino of nikko securities said that rising interest 
rates as well as an increase in the the yield of government bonds 
also influenced the market monday 
industry officials said they would comply with the sanctions 
yasuoki takeuchi chairman of the petroleum association of 
japan said the sanctions against iraq were unavoidable and that 
companies would look for other sources of petroleum 
the government decision is a necessary measure to prompt an 
early withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait our company will 
follow this decision kentaro iwamoto president of nippon oil 
said in a statement 
nippon oil imported 30000 barrels a day from iraq in the first 
half of this year and had planned to import about the same amount 
in the second half a spokesman said 
while companies said they were in no immediate danger of 
dwindling stockpiles industry sources said japanese companies 
bought an additional 4 to 5 million barrels of iranian oil over the 
weekend 
the sanctions also could effect japanese engineering companies 
which have large investments in iraq 
tokyo engineering lost 20 percent of its value in two days 
trading said mahmoud ghaemmaghami manager of research for west lb 
securities pacific ltd im not sure any contracts have been 
cancelled but the market always sees or reads these things in 
advance he said 
japanese companies are still trying to collect about 33 
billion in credits from iraq japan and iraq had agreed to a 
repayment scheme several weeks ago but progress toward repayment 
ended with the invasion a source said 
a spokesman for mitsubishi the top japanese trader with iraq 
said it was too early to tell how the sanctions would effect his 
company he described the situation as very delicate 
japan received 62 percent of its oil needs from iraq in the 
first quarter of 1990 importing 260000 barrels a day and 
obtained 5 percent of its oil from kuwait or 210000 barrels a day

us gasoline prices have jumped 2 to 15 cents a gallon at the 
pump since the iraqi invasion of oilrich kuwait prompting 
complaints of price gouging and demands for an investigation 
price boosts since thursdays invasion stretched from coast to 
coast 
its not a very pretty picture at this time said al elkins 
executive director of the oregon gasoline dealers association 
motorists have accused station owners of jacking up prices 
unnecessarily and using the iraqi invasion as an excuse station 
owners blame the big oil companies for what elkins called good 
oldfashioned greed 
we dont believe the situation warrants any price increase at 
this time he said 
many oil companies sell more gas than they refine during the 
heavydriving summer months so they have to supplement their 
supplies by buying on the volitile spot market said john lord 
spokesman for mobil oil co in new york 
lord on sunday said many oil companies are apparently 
anticipating higher costs from the iraqkuwait war 
when you know future costs are going to go up if you can 
recover some of those costs today youre going to do it if the 
price will hold he said i think thats whats going on in the 
marketplace 
bp oil co told west cost station managers to mark up prices 75 
to 9 cents a gallon said anne straiff spokeswoman at the 
companys cleveland headquarters 
richard kessel executive director of the new york consumer 
protection board said sunday that gas prices have gone up an 
average of 4 or 5 cents a gallon since the invasion 
kessel who is investigating the price hike for new york gov 
mario cuomo said there have been reports of increases up to 15 
cents a gallon in the area 
the governor directed us to begin an investigation of whether 
these increases are justified he said the product that is 
being purchased now at the pump is product that was refined well 
before the invasion 
mark dyen president of fair share energy development corp of 
boston said price hikes were the result of oil companies and 
traders preying on panic 
its all smoke dyen said the price increase hits 
almost as quickly as the news whereas the oil itself might take 
almost 30 to 90 days to get here 
sen joseph lieberman dconn on friday urged a federal 
investigation of the us oil industry 
there is absolutely no reason consumers should already be 
paying more for oil and gas he said its either panic or 
profiteering either way it must be stopped 
massachusetts motorists already paying higher gasoline prices 
because of a recent tax boost of 6 cents a gallon complained of 
increases of up to 6 cents since the iraqi invasion 
i just dont understand how automatically less than 24 hours 
after this thing happened they already have a price increase on 
the board boston motorist jerry whelan said 
motorists elsewhere also were angry 
people think its outrageous said joe hedricks a clerk at 
a harrisonburg va chevron station i tell them i dont have 
anything to do with it 
the price at hedricks station went up 9 cents a gallon on all 
blends since friday prices rose by about 5 cents a gallon by 
friday at many richmond and norfolk stations in virginia and went 
up 4 to 9 cents a gallon in denver

the dollar fell sharply in thin trading in europe 
this morning as investors switched their attention form the persian 
gulf to the weakness of the us economy 
gold prices rose 
traders said the market would continue to monitor the situation 
in the gulf closely although the relative lull in developments had 
shifted attention back to the underlying weakness of the us 
economy 
higher oil prices following iraqs invasion of kuwait were 
regarded as further bad news for us economic prospects 
weak us employment data friday rekindled perceptions that 
further easing in us interest rates is inevitable traders said 
the dollar had gained impulsively on news of iraqs invasion 
of kuwait and now people are seeing where its real support 
really lies one trader said 
foreign exchange traders predicted the dollar would trade 
narrowly during the day since no major economic data was scheduled 
for release 
many market players also were away on summer holidays dealers 
said 
in this kind of market if even one player comes in and 
shortens his position the impact is striking one milan trader 
said 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 015 yen to a closing 14950 yen later in london

three years ago prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
conceded it was only too true to say that japan was getting a 
free ride through the turmoil of warfare in the persian gulf 
now nakasone is out of office and the iraniraq war has been 
supplanted by the iraqi seizure of kuwait 
japan for a change is showing itself willing to take a hit in 
the pocketbook as the price of taking a stand against iraqi 
president saddam husseins aggression in the worlds biggest 
oilproducing region 
the sanctions announced sunday are the toughest this country has 
imposed fallout from them will affect daily life in japan prime 
minister toshiki kaifu said today 
financial markets reacted by selling the yen and driving down 
japanese stocks in anticipation of real economic costs in increased 
oil prices and inflationary pressure 
as a country that imports 99 percent of its oil including 70 
percent from the middle east japan has until now been extremely 
cautious in its middle east policy but the strong sanctions 
announced sunday night show tokyo moving toward the global 
partnership with the united states and western europe that 
washington has encouraged 
japan said it will ban imports of oil from iraq and kuwait and 
all japanese exports to the two nations it also will freeze 
economic aid and loans to iraq and suspend investment financing 
and other capital flows to iraq and kuwait 
for much of the weekend it had appeared japans only reaction 
would be its issuing friday of administrative guidance to banks and 
financial institutions to freeze kuwaiti assets in japan estimated 
at 20 billion 
the hesitance shows how hard it is to break the habit of basing 
foreign policy on domestic economic considerations 
japanese news reports said the foreign ministry had been urging 
the government to join us and european sanctions while the 
ministry of international trade and industry argued that sanctions 
would badly hurt the japanese economy 
sanctions easier said than done said a headline in 
sundays mainichi daily news on an article noting that sanctions 
would stop iaqs repayments on 46 billion worth of japanese loans 
in the end us pressure helped tip the balance president bush 
telephoned kaifu on saturday urging tokyo to join tough sanctions 
and all 100 members of the us senate urged japan to take 
mandatory and comprehensive sanctions against iraq 
growing more than 4 percent annually in recent years the 
japanese economy is less reliant on oil than it was during the 
197374 oil shock when the arab oil embargo knocked japan into 
a recession then oil provided 78 percent of japans energy needs 
as opposed to 57 percent now 
japan received 62 percent of its oil from iraq in the first 
quarter of 1990 importing an average of 260000 barrels a day it 
obtained 5 percent of its oil from kuwait or 210000 barrels a 
day according to the trade ministry 
japanese companies were criticized for buying up iranian oil in 
1979 during the usiran dispute and later when tankers were 
attacked by both sides in the iraniraq war it came under fire for 
not doing more to help freedom of navigation in the persian gulf 
nakasone who tried to lead japan into a more worldoriented 
posture during his 198287 tenure as prime minister said in 1987 
that japan would be isolated if it didnt aid in the international 
effort to let oil flow out of the persian gulf to japan and other 
nations 
japan subsequently paid for a 10 million navigation system to 
monitor ship movements in the gulf and made a generous package of 
loans to jordan and other prowestern countries to try to promote 
stability in the middle east 
those measures and a more evenhanded policy toward israel were 
touted as steps toward a more active japanese policy in the region 
earlier this year japan offered 195 billion in economic aid 
to poland and hungary flexing its wealth in another region where 
like the middle east japan had kept a low profile 
the surprisingly strong sanctions announced against baghdad show 
another area where japan is willing to forge a new policy despite 
economic risk

oil prices jumped more than three dollars a barrel 
today on news europe and japan were joining the embargo of iraqi 
and kuwait oil 
stock prices plummeted in tokyo and london on fears that higher 
oil prices would spur inflation and bring higher interest rates 
the dollar was lower on concerns about the effect of high oil 
prices on the us economy and gold prices moved slightly higher 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was trading at 2659 a barrel in london 
this morning up from fridays closing price of 2348 
traders attributed the rise to the weekend news that the 
european community and japan had joined the united states in its 
embargo of iraqi and kuwaiti crude oil in an effort to put economic 
pressure on baghdad after its invasion of kuwait last week 
traders said volume was thin 
futures prices did not rise as strongly as the spot price 
suggesting that an initial hiccup in world oil supplies could 
gradually be overcome by increased supplies from some opec member 
countries with extra production capacity 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues closed at 
2859953 points down 91623 points or 31 percent 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 478 
points or 21 percent to 22368 by 11 am 
the yen fell because japan imports nearly all its oil and is 
therefore especially vulnerable to disruption to oil supplies

the south african government and 
the african national congress began talks today to try to clear the 
way for fullscale constitutional negotiations on ending 
whiteminority rule 
president fw de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela leading 
fiveman delegations arrived separately at a state mansion on the 
outskirts of pretoria neither leader said anything to waiting 
jouranlists as their convoys swept through the gates 
all leading south african newspapers carried reports sunday that 
the anc was expected to declare a ceasefire if there was progress 
in todays talks an agreement would clear the way for full talks 
probably early next year according to political sources 
the news reports said the two sides expect to reach agreement on 
releasing political prisoners and allowing return of political 
exiles to south africa the government is also expected to meet anc 
demands for a review of security laws that have been used to 
suppress political activity 
the government would like to see immediate progresss on the 
negotiations it would like to see negotiations take off but 
negotiations cannot take place if there is no climate of 
stability the sunday star quoted an unidentified government 
official as saying 
the sunday times reported that as many as 1300 political 
prisoners could be released and some 22000 political exiles could 
be returned to south africa 
a special committee will consider disputed cases of prisoners 
who the anc says are political prisoners but the government claims 
are criminals it said 
the release of political prisoners and return of exiles have 
been major stumbling blocks to clearing the way for fullscale 
talks the anc has said it will not take part in such talks until 
these issues are resolved 
de klerk has countered by demanding the anc end its armed 
struggle 
the ancs armed struggle virtually collapsed because of internal 
problems the drying up of support following the fall of communist 
regimes in eastern europe and the superiority of the south african 
military 
but mandela has refused to formally renounce the armed struggle 
despite intense pressure from the government and many western 
nations anxious for a peaceful settlement in south africa he has 
said the government must make equal concessions before the anc 
declares a ceasefire 
the two sides are also likely to seek a greater effort to end 
the growing wave of violence that has hit south africa in recent 
months mainly between rival black groups 
a special committee was set up after the first round of 
ancgovernment talks in may to consider ways to settle outstanding 
disputes including political prisoners 
an agreement today would open the way for formal talks on ending 
white rule and giving political rights to the black majority the 
government has already begun dismantling apartheid laws although 
substantial restrictions remain 
de klerk legalized the anc and other black opposition groups 
feb 2 he freed mandela feb 11 after 27 years in jail for 
fighting apartheid 
de klerk has promised to end whiteminority rule and find a new 
political dispensation for the country

dodge city kan population 21000 had one 
reported homicide in the last 20 months according to its city 
manager jim witt 
new york city has one homicide every 4 hours 37 minutes 
so its no wonder the folks in dodge city fired back when mayor 
david dinkins invoked their towns name last week to defend his 
city 
this is not dodge city dinkins snapped angrily when 
questioned about his commitment to crime fighting after four child 
homicides 
the kansans are used to the comparison but they wish dinkins 
hadnt shot his mouth off 
it gets a little old said witt our murder rate is 
nowhere near new york washington chicago its not paradise with 
zero crime but we dont have that kind of violence 
between 1876 and 1885 the first years that records were kept 
dodge city had 15 homicides said betty braddock of the kansas 
heritage center 
violence wasnt wanton it was more man to man there was 
always a reason said braddock it could be a fight over 
gambling or a girl but it wasnt somebody just blowing out a 
door 
kansans blame dodge citys undeserved reputation for violence on 
media hype 
the one thing about dodge is that the newspapers blew it all 
up frederic young a dodge city native and historian it was 
fun to write about theyd exaggerate a little they didnt 
worry much about the laws of libel 
much of new yorks violence is attributable to drug dealers with 
uzis back then it was drunken cowboys with colts young said new 
york recorded 1905 homicides last year dodge citys big year was 
six in 1878 
then again dodge city had 4000 residents new york has 75 
million the murder rate was 15 murders per 1000 people in dodge 
to 026 per 1000 in new york but the numbers are misleading the 
historians said 
there really wasnt that much violence here said young 
it was worse in the towns southwest of here in new mexico and 
arizona there were mostly isolated incidents here 
bat masterson and wyatt earp were responsible for law 
enforcement in the town both were more likely to be found sipping 
a drink in the long branch saloon than gunning down criminals on 
front street 
masterson wound up coming to new york once the west was won in 
1916 and he became a sports columist at the new york morning 
telegraph earp was more of a career lawmen but braddock isnt 
sure hed help things in new york now anyway 
if wyatt earp was here wed send him back braddock said 
but we gave you bat masterson and you didnt do much with him

a labor union and the secondlargest parties 
in both german states said today east germany can only be saved by 
dissolving it soon and that german unification may happen this week 
pressure built for east germany to solve its worsening economic 
problems by immediately dissolving itself and turning the shambles 
of its economy over to wealthy west germany 
but at the root of the debate is an intense political feud by 
parties jockeying to use unification to their best political 
advantage in upcoming united german elections 
horst ehmke deputy chairman of the west german social 
democrats said today that east germany could vote this week on a 
clause in the west german constitution that would result in 
immediate unification 
the economic social and financial developments in east 
germany are going downhill at such a speed that i would not be 
astonished if we had a very fast unity he said on west german 
radio 
earlier he said east german lawmakers could vote on unification 
wednesday when the parliament meets 
the east german social democrats planned to meet today to decide 
whether to press this week for a vote on unification and decide on 
tuesday whether to leave de maizieres coalition 
west german chancellor helmut kohls demand last week to move up 
united german elections from dec 2 to oct 14 has prompted his 
chief rivals the social democrats to seek unity even sooner 
the two social democratic parties are closely allied they are 
the leading opposition in west germany and part of prime minister 
lothar de maizieres broad governing coalition in east germany 
the leftleaning social democrats want elections to remain in 
december but unity to take place now kohl and his conservative 
christian democrats want to tie the two together and both to take 
place in midoctober 
the social democrats want to delay the vote for a united german 
government in the hope that the costs of bailing out east germanys 
collapsing economy will hurt the west german chancellor at the 
polls 
kohl for the same reason wants balloting as quickly as 
possible even if it means changing west germanys constitutional 
timetable for eections 
friedrich bohl leader of the christian democrat faction in the 
west german parliament said unity and elections must be tied 
together 
unity and common elections are two sides of the same coin 
he said today on west german radio i cannot see carrying out 
unity without common elections 
the head of the german trade union the largest labor 
association in west germany with more than 8 million members also 
pressed for immediate unity 
labor association chief heinzwerner meyer said the july 1 
economic unification of the german states when east germany made 
a virtual overnight transition from socialism to a free market 
happened too quickly and will have disastrous effects 
he said west germany should take responsibility for advocating 
such a quick economic merger by following through with an immediate 
political consolidation 
the deputy chairman of the east german social democrats 
karlaugust kamilli also called for fast unification today 
it is up to east germany to enact unification that will be done 
when its parliament approves a clause in the west german 
constitution that will allow it to accede to its bigger neighbor 
the social democrats have sought to slow unification since it 
was first proposed by kohl early this year 
by now pressing for quick unity and later elections they can 
appear to embrace the process while still benefitting politically 
from elections in december when the economic woes are expected to 
be much worse 
kohl meanwhile would have to spend more west german money on 
east germany right away and then perhaps pay for it at the polls 
in december 
kohl in an interview on west german television on sunday 
sidestepped questions about whether taxes would have to be raised 
to pay for unification 
right now east german joblessness while climbing is being 
kept artificially low by a west germanfinanced program to keep 
workers on payrolls at shortened hours and lower wages 
without that program unemployment would likely be more than 10 
percent rather than the 27 percent it was estimated at last month 
joblessness is expected to eventually reach perhaps 30 percent 
or 40 percent

firefighters today tried to hold a fire line 
cut around a 3300acre blaze that jumped a river canyon destroyed 
28 homes in hopscotch fashion and forced the evacuation of 2800 
people 
the blaze which broke out saturday and raced from treetop to 
treetop in the dry woods destroyed more buildings than any oregon 
forest fire since 1936 said forestry department spokesman jim 
fisher damage was put at 45 million 
people were evacuated from at least four motels or resorts and 
about 2000 vacation and regular homes the department said 
firefighters cut a line around the fire late sunday and 
department spokesman randall lau said they hoped to contain it 
tuesday and bring it under control thursday the fire was reported 
50 percent contained sunday night 
meanwhile today firefighters in utah and california were 
struggling to contain fires that had consumed about 5700 acres 
at eastern utahs uintah and ouray indian reservation 
firefighters planned a new assault on a fire that has burned more 
than 5400 acres in the florence creek area 
the fire was started by lightning tuesday in rugged terrain 
considered ideal habitat for rocky mountain bighorn sheep elk and 
deer 
in central californias sequoia national forest firefighters 
tried to surround two brush fires sparked by lightning sunday 
afternoon 
by late sunday one fire had blackened about 250 acres northwest 
of kernville and the other had burned about 60 acres 3 miles away 
the fires posed no immediate threat to any buildings firefighters 
said 
about 1100 firefighters battled the oregon blaze using 12 
helicopters and air tankers the cost was put at more than 
890000 lau said 
the fire erupted three miles west of downtown bend a city of 
about 19000 on the eastern slopes of the cascade range and burned 
in near 100degree heat 
it raced through the pines jumping roads and the deschutes 
riverin a canyon where the river is about 75 feet wide 
it burned eight wellappointed homes in the sunset village 
subdivision 
its real odd the way the fire picked one here and one 
there said us forest serice spokeswoman ann carlson when 
you see how hitandmiss the pattern is it would have been real 
scary to have been in here 
the cause of the fire was under investigation but it was being 
called humancaused since no lightning was present when it 
started officials said 
the blaze was about a mile away from central oregon community 
college on the north and the inn at the seventh mountain on the 
south the 325unit resort was evacuated saturday 
the major northsouth highway through central oregon us 97 
was reopened sunday in the fire area after being closed to all but 
evacuation traffic 
norv ritchey whose daughter and soninlaw own the entrada 
lodge figured only a miracle saved the motel when the fire came 
roaring over the hill 
you could have had every fire truck in the state here and you 
wouldnt have saved it he said it just split and went by 
the motel which had been full was evacuated saturday evening 
when fire bore down on it 
it sounded like a freight train coming over that hill 
ritchie said pointing to the hill covered with ash and the black 
skeletal remains of trees we spent the night thinking the 
motel had burned its the entrada miracle

the red cross sometimes worries more about its 
image than about emergency relief sending agency camera crews in 
ahead of aid workers a newspaper concluded after analyzing 200 
disasters over the past five years 
a ninemonth investigation by the pittsburgh press showed that 
in some cases the red cross lived up to its promise to deliver 
help quickly fairly and compassionately 
but in others there were widespread deficiencies 
the problems included delays of up to six days before enough 
trained workers arrived at a disaster site a lack of cooperation 
with local agencies and an emphasis on getting favorable publicity 
to help raise money 
the paper in a series that began in sundays newspaper also 
said the charity does not always spend all money donated for a 
specific disaster on that disaster 
the red cross is by far the nations largest recipient of 
disaster contributions totaling 175 million last year however 
the newspaper concluded that other groups primarily the salvation 
army and other national church groups usually arrive at disaster 
sites first and stay longer 
agency officials said it was unfair to criticize the red cross 
because of highly publicized shortcomings following hurricane hugo 
and the northern california earthquake last year 
its absurd to look at last falls hurricane and earthquake 
and say the red cross cant do the job the red cross may have had 
a few little problems but we were dealing with two unprecedented 
disasters said barbara lohman a national red cross spokeswoman 
in washington dc 
if you want to be fair and get an accurate picture look at 
the hundreds of other disasters that we worked on and youll find 
that the red cross performance was almost flawless she told the 
newspaper 
the red cross unique operating position was created in 1900 
when congress passed a law making it the only volunteer agency 
required to aid victims of disaster it was founded by civil war 
nurse clara barton in 1881 
today funded almost totally by donations from the american 
public the 12 billion operation promises immediate response to a 
disaster with food and shelter medical care clothing temporary 
housing and other basic needs 
to raise money the red cross stresses promoting its image even 
in the early hours of a disaster according to the newspaper report 
two of the four names posted on the nightly callout roster at 
national headquarters in washington dc those people to be 
notified in case of a major disaster are fundraisers 
we had a film crew and a still photographer on the ground on 
the coast before hurricane hugo hit the mainland and with the 
earthquake we had a video crew in san francisco within the first 
24 hours ms lohman said 
most of the national disaster staff did not arrive until several 
days later 
when the fundraising ability of a disaster diminishes so 
does the national red cross said carl bradford west virginias 
director of emergency management the national organization is 
clearly driven by how much money it can raise so when the 
television crews and reporters leave the red cross is in the next 
cars out of town 
george moody chairman of american national red cross conceded 
that problems sometimes occur but he said theyre rare 
when you have 2200 active chapters involved in delivering 
services youre going to have inconsistency once in awhile he 
said 
allegations of diverting funds designated for a specific 
disaster area surfaced after the northern california earthquake 
san francisco mayor art agnos said the charity was leaving town 
with 55 million contributed specifically to help victims of the 
earthquake the red cross announced a month later it would spend 
40 million more for earthquake relief

hundreds of riot police blocked dozens 
of dissidents from traveling to north korea for a meeting and the 
government banned 42 other activists from leaving the country 
the dissidents called off their efforts to cross the heavily 
fortified border to north korea after their bus was stopped by 
almost 500 riot police on a road midway between seoul and the 
border 
two dissident leaders were arrested and about 40 others returned 
to seoul 
the justice ministry meanwhile announced that 42 other south 
korean dissidents and radical students were banned from leaving the 
country presumably to stop them from traveling to north korea 
during a proposed midaugust border opening 
their exit is feared to severely hurt national interests 
said a government spokesman 
the dissidents had been trying to reach the border so 12 
delegates could travel to north koreas capital of pyongyang for a 
planning session for a proposed joint unification rally scheduled 
for aug 15 
both governments have approved the rally in principle which is 
scheduled to call for the unification of the two koreas but 
disagree on the details it remains unclear whether the event will 
be held and a planning committee has never met to work out the 
details 
the seoul government has said the committee members will not be 
allowed to travel to north korea unless dissidents and the north 
koreans also accepted conservative groups as part of the delegation 
the border between the two koreas is the most heavily fortified 
frontier in the world citizens cannot travel across the border 
without approval from both governments which is rarely given 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 and the two sides fought a civil war in 
the early 1950s

mayor david dinkins plans to hire more than 
1000 new police officers in an effort to fight a surge in crime 
two newspapers reported today 
the new york post and daily news each said that the new police 
officers will be trained at the police academy in the october and 
april classes 
dinkins will obtain the 50 to 60 million the plan will cost by 
cutting other city services the papers said 
what were doing is flooding the streets with cops a senior 
mayoral aide who spoke on condition of anonymity told the daily 
news but the ambition here is to reduce the level of violent 
crime not just put more cops on the street 
police commissioner lee brown recently said he would need 5000 
more police to cope with the citys crime crisis 
the plan stemmed from a weekend anticrime meeting of the citys 
top law enforcement and prosecution officials at gracie mansion 
both papers said 
under dinkins new plan money would also be freed to pay for 
more prosecutors jails court officers and probation and 
correction officers 
details of the budget cuts needed to pay for the new police 
officers were to be announced at a city hall news conference today 
the news said 
dinkins has been under pressure lately to respond to a wave of 
highprofile random violence 
among those incidents the slayings of four children by stray 
bullets and the killings of two cab drivers a 14yearold boy and 
a greenwich village executive 
on sunday a man was shot in the head as he spoke on a pay 
telephone in front of a token booth at a brooklyn subway station 
police said john myers 26 was killed by a single shotgun blast 
to the back of his head 
no arrests were made myers brother who was with him at the 
subway stop ran to a nearby grocery store and called police 
and in another incident two men were shot one fatally when a 
gunman stepped from a car in the bronx and fired five or six shots 
police said 
louis shevalir 44 was shot in the chest and hip and was 
pronounced dead on arrival at a bronx hospital late sunday night 
the other man was in stable condition early today 
no arrests were made and no motive was known police spokeswoman 
mary wrensen said

jurors resumed their deliberations today in 
mayor marion barrys cocaine and perjury trial after a sunday 
respite from the work they started last week 
the federal panel kept sequestered during the sixweek trial 
finally got the case late thursday the jurors deliberated all day 
friday and four hours saturday 
shortly before being given the rest of the weekend off the jury 
asked district judge thomas penfield jackson for another look at 
more than 150 prosecution and defense exhibits 
barry whose lawyer has acknowledged he was an occasional 
user of cocaine faces a maximum of 26 years in prison if convicted 
of all charges 10 cocaine possession charges three felony 
perjury counts and one conspiracy charge 
while not attempting to persuade the jury that barry never used 
drugs defense lawyer r kenneth mundy has worked overtime at 
casting doubt on whether he did so on the occasions the prosecution 
says he did 
the 5000 pages of trial testimony include the statements of 10 
witnesses who have said they saw barry use drugs more than 200 
times since 1984 
among those 10 are four who added an important additional 
element that barry saw convicted drug dealer charles lewis using 
narcotics 
one of the perjury charges stems from a january 1989 grand jury 
appearance in which barry said he was unaware of lewis drug 
involvement and did not believe his friend was a drug dealer 
but four of lewis female companions testified that barry was 
present when lewis used drugs during a trip the mayor made to the 
virgin islands in 1986 
mr lewis lit a marijuana cigarette in the front of the boat 
and he passed it to the young lady and the young lady passed it to 
the mayor one witness jonetta vincent recalled about a june 
1986 boat trip she took with lewis barry and others the mayor 
passed it back to mr lewis and then there was another one 
in addition the captain on that cruise testified that he the 
mayor lewis and others shared a marijuana cigarette 
was there anything obstructing mr barrys view when lewis 
lit and smoked from the joint terry lee brenay was asked 
nothing whatsoever he responded 
mundy also has complained that witnesses have provided only 
vague dates and hazier recollections of their drug use with the 
mayor he also tried to expose flaws in the memory of witnesses not 
openly hostile to the mayor 
most of mundys effort went to undermining the governments two 
star witnesses lewis and former model rasheeda moore 
lewis was willing to sing any tune the government wanted 
to hear as long as his own fat was in the fire mundy said 
barrys chief attorney also elicited testimony from other witnesses 
that pointed out minor inconsistencies in lewis description of his 
drug use with barry in the virgin islands 
lewis testimony was used to back up all three felony perjury 
charges and four of the misdemeanor cocaine possession charges 
moore who participated in the jan 18 fbi sting operation that 
produced barrys arrest was portrayed by mundy as the most 
hypocritical weapon in the governments arsenal 
although she testified that she used drugs with barry over 100 
times during the couples twoyear sexual relationship mundy 
hammered away at the fact that she could provide few specific dates 
he portrayed her as an opportunistic traitor who down on her 
luck was ripe for recruitment when the fbi approached her about 
participating in the sting operation

oil industry sources said today that 
saudi arabia was reinforcing its troops near the kuwaiti border 
and witnesses reported intense air activity near the airport in the 
saudi capital 
local residents reached by telephone said saudi military 
aircraft were sighted during the night landing and taking off at 
airfields on the fringes of the capital 
us secretary of defense richard cheney arrived in jiddah today 
for talks with saudi officials cheney was accompanied by lt gen 
h norman schwarzkopf head of the us middle east force known as 
the central command richard gates deputy national security 
adviser and paul wolfowitz deputy defense secretary were also 
with him 
oil executives at khafji reached by telephone from bahrain 
said more saudi troops but no heavy vehicles were entering the 
region khafji is a city in northeastern saudi arabia on the 
persian gulf near the kuwaiti border its port has oil loading and 
berthing facilities for small tankers and freighters 
iraqi president saddam husseins troops invaded kuwait on 
thursday and advanced toward the saudi border raising fears they 
also planned to invade the oil giant the invasion force set up a 
checkpoint about a halfmile from the saudi border checkpoint at 
khafji 
security officials at the khafji post said the iraqis made 
minor apparently accidental incursions into saudi territory friday 
and saturday then retreated with apologies 
the oil executives said the saudi force deployments were merely 
a precaution to defend oil fields run by the arabian oil co a 
consortium of saudi kuwait and japanese companies 
its calm down here said one japanese oil executive who 
spoke on condition of anonymity there is no shooting anywhere 
neither in khafji city nor at the port area but the saudis are 
reinforcing their defenses it is a slight increase in the number 
of soldiers here 
however travelers from the area said saudi tanks were sighted 
moving northward saturday possibly to areas near khafji 
gulfbased diplomatic sources said saudi forces went on alert 
with the start of the iraqi invasion of kuwait on thursday they 
were trying to determine the extent of mobilization in the saudi 
armed forces 
the saudi borders were closed the situation inside the kingdom 
was described by diplomats and residents reached by telephone as 
tense but calm 
an indication of the military preparedness was the continuous 
whirring of awacs over dhahran the oil capital and the area with 
the highest concentration of american interests in saudi arabia 
awacs are airborne warning and control aircraft 
in riyadh the saudi capital long lines of people were at the 
banks long lines also formed elsewhere in the region some 
american companies were reported to have begun pulling out their 
staff from the united arab emirates 
a us embassy spokesman in riyadh insisted however that for the 
estimated 2600028000 americans and their dependents life was 
going about as usual saudi arabia is the worlds largest oil 
exporter and most of the americans work in the oil industry 
the spokesman estimated the number of americans in saudi arabia 
may be presently substantially fewer because of the summer 
holidays 
the borders of kuwait with saudi arabia run halfway through the 
socalled divided zone a new name for what used to be called the 
neutral zone 
under a 1988 agreement saudi arabia and kuwait agreed to divide 
the neutral zone drawing their border through it khafji is in the 
zone

a quarter of the 40000 infant deaths that occur 
in the united states each year could be easily prevented with 
existing medical knowledge according to a highlevel bush 
administration study 
the new york times reported today that the study calls for 
spending about 500 million a year more to reduce the countrys 
infant mortality rate ninteen other countries have lower rates 
the report was begun in july 1989 by a group headed by assistant 
secretary of health and human services james o mason but appears 
to have been put on hold the times said 
the report found that common techniques including improved 
prenatal care could also prevent vision and hearing loss mental 
retardation and other handicaps that afflict 100000 newborns each 
year 
the united states has not achieved its national goals for 
reducing infant mortality the study said unacceptable racial 
disparities and significant geographic inequities are still 
evident and progress in reducing the rate of infant mortality has 
slowed significantly especially among blacks 
the times said it obtained a copy of the report from an official 
involved in the study who felt its recommendations were being 
ignored others involved in the study said it had been shelved 
because it was an inconvenient reminder of bush campaign promises 
that would be difficult to keep the times said 
a white house spokesman alixe glen told the times that work on 
the report was continuing and should be completed by early next 
month 
in 1987 the last year for which data is available the overall 
infant mortality rate for the united states was 101 deaths in the 
first year of life for every 1000 births the rate was 179 for 
blacks and 86 for whites 
in the 1970s the public health service set a goal of reducing 
the rate to nine by 1990 and said no racial group should have a 
rate exceeding 12

iraq told turkey that embargos against 
iraqi oil today forced it to close one of two pipelines used to 
pump iraqi crude oil through turkey the anatolia news agency 
reported 
anatolia said iraq also notified turkey that it would use only 
70 percent of the capacity of the second pipeline 
the united states japan and the european community announced in 
the past week that they no longer will import iraqi oil to protest 
iraqs invasion of kuwait those countries bought more than half of 
the oil exported from iraq 
with the widespread boycott iraq would have trouble selling all 
the oil flowing through turkey said a turkish government official 
quoted by anatolia 
turkey was reportedly under us pressure to close the pipelines 
following the iraqi invasion of kuwait on thursday the turkish 
official said the iraqi decision was a great relief to turkey 
government officials said the action would not affect turkish 
purchases of iraqi oil turkey is expected to rely on iraq for 
about 40 percent of its oil needs this year 
the pipelines take iraqi crude oil from the kirkuk fields to a 
terminal on turkeys mediterranean coast where it is loaded for 
export to other countries the pipelines have a capacity of 16 
million barrels of oil a day more than half iraqs estimated daily 
output of 27 million barrels 
they had been pumping about 15 million barrels daily according 
to the middle east economic survey 
the turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
iraqs state organization of marketing oil told turkeys 
stateowned botac company which operates the pipeline of the 
closure it said the move took effect this afternoon no further 
details were given 
there was no immediate word from iraq 
turkey earns 250 million from iraq annually for operating the 
pipeline

federal officials promised to evict 
environmentalists who blocked logging roads and ignored orders to 
leave a southern illinois national forest slated for a timber 
harvest 
we may hand out tickets or we may bring a paddy wagon up 
there and haul them away norbert boe acting forest supervisor 
of the shawnee national forest said sunday 
forest officials posted an eviction notice friday ordering the 
environmentalists out by saturday morning but no one had attempted 
to evict the protesters by early today jackson county sheriffs 
deputies said 
environmentalists emulating west coast demonstrators moved into 
the forest june 20 anticipating that a judge would allow a timber 
company to cut trees within a 144acre area of the forest on june 
26 us district judge james foreman ruled the timber harvest 
could proceed 
since then environmentalists have maintained a roundtheclock 
vigil physically blocking access to the area scheduled for 
logging loggers have already removed too many trees threatening 
the forests fragile ecosystem protesters said 
the east perry lumber co of missouri paid about 50000 for the

us marines who rushed to the defense of 
americans caught in the midst of liberias bloody civil war have 
evacuated 74 people from the capital the pentagon said today 
more than 200 marines are dug in at the embassy to defend the 
skeleton size diplomatic staff remaining there and to ferry 
those people who want to escape the west african nations civil 
strife officials said 
of the 62 us citizens evacuated in the helicopter rescue 
mission that began sunday 35 have been flown to neighboring sierra 
leone and on to london where travel arrangements are being made 
for them to return to the united states the pentagon said in a 
statement today 
most of the americans are us government employees 
twelve citizens from other nations also have been helped to 
leave monrovia the capital the statement identified them as eight 
liberians who are dependents or escorts for americans two 
italians one canadian and one french catholic priest 
marine corps helicopters will continue to ferry back and forth 
from the us embassy to the uss saipan if further evacuations 
are necessary the statement said 
the marines are there to protect lives they are authorized to 
use whatever means are necessary and they are there in a battle 
situation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said sunday 
in a precision helicopter rescue mission about 225 marines 
plucked the americans from the embassy grounds and airlifted them 
to safety aboard us warships off the coast the pentagon said 
no hostile action was taken against the operation which was 
conducted smoothly and without incident the pentagon said 
president bush ordered the marines to go ashore after one of the 
rebel leaders trying to oust president samuel doe ordered the 
arrest of all foreigners in an attempt to provoke outside 
intervention in the civil war fitzwater said 
the united states has steadfastly refused to intervene in the 
increasingly violent dispute 
the maneuver codenamed sharp edge was launched from four 
warships that have been stationed in international waters off 
liberia since early june the goal was to secure the seaside us 
embassy compound and to retrieve 21 americans posted at two 
transmitter sites just outside the capital 
the embassy was trying to get word out to any other us 
citizens remaining in liberia a us official said but theyll 
have to reach the embassy compound for the marines to pick them up 
and that may be hard for most of them because of the fighting he 
added 
ambassador peter de vos was remaining behind in charge of a 
skeleton size staff fitzwater said 
about 70 us officials and 300 other americans were in liberia 
when the operation started fitzwater said 
well take out as many as want to get out he said the 
pentagon said the marines would airlift other foreigners if they 
asked 
fitzwater stressed that the marine presence does not indicate 
or constitute any intention on the part of the us government to 
intervene militarily in the liberian conflict 
the purpose of this operation is to safeguard lives to draw 
down the number of americans at the embassy to minimum staff and to 
provide additional security for those who remain fitzwater said 
pentagon sources said about 237 marines traditionally the 
protectors of diplomatic sites would defend the compound as 
long as necessary 
fitzwater said doe was told of the operation in advance the 
united states has a standing offer to evacuate doe who has holed 
up in the presidential mansion fitzwater said attempts were made 
to contact rebel leaders as well but he could not confirm that 
contact had been made 
us officials notified americans on saturday that the 
evacuation could take place and military officials expected that 
many of the 300 americans would decline to leave 
many of those 300 us citizens also hold liberian citizenship 
they have been living in liberia for years and have extensive 
families that they dont want to leave behind 
most of the other americans are missionaries posted in various 
parts of the country all american employees of the voice of 
america station near monrovia were evacuated in may

kuwaits oil export facilities are shut 
down and will remain so for some time and there is considerable 
doubt saudi arabia will be willing to make up the potential world 
oil shortage the middle east economic survey said today 
the weekly newsletter published in nicosia said the total loss 
of supply to world oil markets because of the kuwaiti shutdown and 
embargoes on iraqi oil could exceed 4 million barrels a day 
there will be a potential restriction of oil supply in the 
near future that could range in intensity from significant to 
highly severe depending on how circumstances unfold it wrote 
the respected newletter said kuwaiti oil production and exports 
cut after iraqi president saddam husseins powerful army invaded 
on thursday would be shut down for some time both for 
physicaltechnical reasons and as a consequence of impending 
international efforts to interdict purchases of kuwaiti oil 
the newsletter said the impact of the kuwaiti shutdown could be 
compounded by restrictions on iraqi oil supplies 
since friday when the article was written numerous sanctions 
have been announced including japanese and european embargoes on 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil the united states announced an on thursday 
just hours after iraq invaded its oilrich neighbor 
as a result of the embargos iraq today closed one of two major 
pipelines that was pumping its oil through turkey to a terminal on 
the mediterranean it said the second pipeline would be used at 
just 70 percent capacity 
the pipelines were carrying about 15 million barrels of oil a 
day more than half iraqs daily output 
if anything like the full iraqikuwaiti shortfall of 4 million 
barrels a day manifests itself the world will not be able to get 
by for very long without some additional supply from other sources 
above and beyond the current opec quota levels the newsletter 
said 
it said current spare capacity by members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries amounted to not much more than 35 
million barrels of oil a day 
this spare capacity is concentrated in a few countries saudi 
arabia with a spare 2 million barrels a day the united arab 
emirates with 600000 venezuela with 500000 and libya with 
300000 the newsletter said 
here the key obviously lies with saudi arabia and there must 
be considerable doubt as to how far the kingdom would be prepared 
to go on antagonizing iraq by cooperating with measures to restrict 
iraqi oil exports and increase its own production in deference to 
the wishes of the united states and the world community it said 
iraq and kuwait have accounted for 20 percent of opecs output 
the newsletter noted that iraqs preinvasion oil exports 
amounted to 27 to 28 million barrels a day divided between three 
outlets pipelines across saudi arabia and turkey and the gulf sea 
lanes 
it said 15 million barrels a day were exported using the 
pipeline through turkey to the mediterranean 900000 via the saudi 
arabian pipeline to the red sea and 300000 to 400000 loaded onto 
tankers at iraqs mina albakr terminal in the northern persian 
gulf 
the pipelines across turkey and saudi arabia would clearly be 
prime targets for international oil sanctions against iraq the 
middle east economic survey wrote 
but it should be remembered on the one hand that turkey gets a 
substantial part of its own oil supply through the iraqi pipeline 
and on the other that any action by saudi arabia to interfere with 
the terminals by means of us naval power could also be a tricky 
exercise the newsletter wrote 
the upshot of all this is that although effective global oil 
sanctions would undoubtedly cripple iraq they would be difficult 
to implement and administer in practice it said 
turkish officials however said the decision to close the 
pipeline through their country would not affect turkish purchases 
of iraqi oil expected to account for about 40 percent of turkeys 
oil needs this year 
the newsletter noted the agreement last month by opec ministers 
under pressure from saddam to restrict production in order to 
push up oil prices 
now the normal pattern of oil supply and trade have been 
radically distorted and crisis buying has already lifted prices to 
somewhere around the 21abarrel opec basket range it wrote 
it said unless conditions return to normal pretty soon the 
damage to the agreement and perhaps opec itself may prove 
beyond repair 
the middle east economic survey said this brought to mind the 
two previous occasions in the past 20 years when the oil market was 
convulsed by political upheavals in 197374 when the arabs imposed 
an oil embargo during the arabisraeli war and the 197981 price 
explosion 
those oil shocks especially the second one drove the world 
into economic recession

the food and drug administration today 
approved a drug that could help save thousands of premature infants 
born with immature lungs 
the drug a powder mixed with sterile water substitutes for a 
naturally occurring foam that coats the inside of the lungs and 
keeps them from collapsing when the infant exhales 
the infants receive the drug through a tube into their 
windpipes they must be on a mechanical ventilator to receive it 
about 250000 infants are born prematurely each year in the 
united states onefifth of them have respiratory distress 
syndrome or breathing difficulties due to immature lungs the 
problem is fatal in some 5000 cases a year 
that makes respiratory distress syndrome the leading cause of 
death and disability among premature infants the fda said in 
1963 a baby born to president kennedy and his wife died of the 
condition 
the newly approved drug called exosurf neonatal can be used 
immediately after birth to prevent death in highrisk infants under 
three pounds and also to treat infants who have developed the 
disease 
the fda said the drug represents such an important advance that 
it has been widely available since july 1989 when it was still 
experimental 
the drug was invented by dr john clements of the university of 
california at san francisco burroughs wellcome co of research 
triangle park nc applied to market it in february the fda said 
its approval came in a nearrecord five months 
the fda also said it has designated exosurf an orphan drug under 
a program that provides incentives for the development and 
production of drugs and medical products to treat conditions 
affecting small numbers of people

legislation to create a department of the 
environment to give new focus to environmental issues brought 
nothing but cheers six months ago but now the proposal is mired in 
turf wars and its future is in doubt 
the administration cooled toward the idea after the house passed 
a bill it didnt like legislation has languished for months in the 
senate with no indication when it might be scheduled for a floor 
vote 
i think at the moment its sort of stalled said sen 
william roth rdel one of the key sponsors of the bill 
introduced in january to elevate the environmental protection 
agency to cabinet level 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate governmental 
affairs committee who has pushed the epa cabinet issue said he 
hasnt given up hope 
glenn said in an interview that some progress is being made to 
get differences resolved but he added im not predicting a 
date for getting the bill to the senate floor much less working 
out differences from the house bill 
a number of complex issues from the budget deficit to child 
care and clean air face congress when it returns next month from 
its august recess with only a few weeks remaining before the 
october campaign season 
despite all the talk of smooth sailing earlier this year the 
epa cabinet bill could easily become a casualty to the calendar 
some environmentalists fear 
with considerable fanfare in january president bush announced 
his support for the legislation which would create the 
governments 15th cabinetlevel agency 
the environmental challenges are so important that they must 
be addressed at the highest level he declared at a white house 
news conference 
nothing has been heard publicly from bush on the issue since 
the president made no secret that he had wanted the legislation to 
sign on earth day on april 22 there was no bill and he went 
fishing in florida instead 
meanwhile what had been seen as a simple piece of legislation 
with widespread bipartisan support began taking on political 
baggage 
in march only four days before earth day the house voted 
37155 to create a department of the environment but added 
requirements seen by the white house as an attempt to 
micromanage the executive branch 
the president made known he likely would veto a bill that 
contains the house restrictions the administration especially 
doesnt like provisions to create an independent bureau of 
statistics and bar its director from being replaced short of 
malfeasance and limit the number of political appointees in the 
new department 
in the senate a succession of turf battles involving senate 
committees and parts of the executive branch have kept the 
legislation in limbo since it cleared glenns government affairs 
committee months ago 
committees with jurisdiction over the commerce and energy 
departments as well as the senate environment and public works 
committee have voiced objections to parts of the bill they fear 
might affect them 
the senate disputes have not centered on the heart of the 
legislation but on the fringes how will it affect the presidents 
council on environmental quality who will chair an interagency 
group on environmental issues within the white house will the new 
department usurp powers now in the commerce or energy departments 
some leading environmental groups including the national 
wildlife federation sierra club and natural resources defense 
council urged senate leaders in a letter to end the stalemate and 
move the bill 
the environmental community is pushing for it the issues in 
the 1990s are going to be more global in nature and to give the epa 
equal footing with other environmental ministers is vitally 
necessary said bill klinefelder legislative director for the 
wildlife federation 
but not all environmentalists are as enthusiastic 
environmental action a washingtonbased environmental group 
has not kept close tabs on the bill its president ruth caplan 
said creating a department of the environment would be nice but 
perhaps not so significant 
it could give the impression of doing something for the 
environment without having to spend any real political chips ms 
caplan said

salvage crews today cleaned the tanks 
of a crippled oil barge so it could be cut up and the houston ship 
channel reopened to unrestricted traffic for the first time in more 
than a week 
the barges tanks must be cleaned of oil so that a spark from a 
welding torch wont cause an explosion officials said they did 
not know how long it would take to clean and cut up the barge 
crippled in a collision that left 700000 gallons of heavy oil in 
busy galveston bay 
after an early morning flyover coast guard officials reported 
that little oil remained along the shoreline at houston point on 
the north end of the bay 
only a few patches of heavy oil were spotted along the 
shoreline but a rainbow sheen stretched about two miles into the 
bay said chief warrant officer rick meidt 
i think thats good because the heavy stuff is right at the 
shoreline where it can be collected by the vacuum trucks the sheen 
is more susceptible to natural breakdown meidt said 
crews also sprayed oileating bacteria on marshes sunday and 
vacuumed up heavy sludge from the spill caused when a greek tanker 
collided with two oil barges july 28 the tanker lost none of its 
cargo both barges were damaged 
vessels became bottled up in the channel while the coast guard 
worked to free the barge that sank in the accident 
ships were allowed to leave the harbor sunday night with help 
from tugs for the first time since the accident inbound towboat 
traffic resumed friday 
as of late sunday about 40 vessels were waiting to get in and 
fewer than 10 were waiting to leave the coast guard said 
traffic is moving just not freely said scott inbody chief 
warrant officer of the coast guards vessel traffic service in 
houston were making sure no vessels meet or overtake each other 
in the waters near the accident 
the delays were estimated to cost 10000 to 20000 per day for 
each vessel 
coast guardsmen and salvage crews using skimmers hundreds of 
yards of booms and 18 vacuum trucks worked into the night to 
contain and suck up the estimated 100000 gallons of brown sludge 
believed remaining in galveston bay 
cleanup crews collected about 315000 gallons of the medium to 
heavy crude and little remained visible in galveston bay said 
coast guard capt thomas greene he said he expected the cleanup to 
cost about 5 million 
the sunken barge is believed to have lost most of its 716000 
gallons of oil the second barge lost nearly 50000 gallons 
officials said 
a ban on shrimping imposed in galveston bay on thursday remained 
in effect the ban on fin fishing was lifted saturday 
cleanup crews sprayed some 150 pounds of oileating bacteria on 
marshlands that cannot be safely reached with skimming vessels 
in the process begun last week the naturally occurring microbes 
reduce the oil to a fatty substance that sinks and is eaten by fish 
this is different from oil on rocks or oil in open waters 
said texas water commission chairman bj buck wynne this is 
on a living organic system and its absolutely the most sensitive 
place it can be 
greene said strong winds had pushed some oil from marshlands 
back out into the bay some of the oil washed ashore while 
streamers up to 100 yards long moved toward trinity bay a 
sensitive marine area 
but larry mckinney director of the resource protection division 
of the texas parks and wildlife department said such a drift could 
be beneficial because the oil would be in open waters where 
skimmers and booms could more easily contain and suck up the sludge 
mckinney said crews had found dead crabs mussels small fish 
and other small animals along the shore he said crews searched the 
marshlands for oilsoiled wildlife but had been unable to catch any 
of the animals 
really weve been lucky mckinney said the oils not up 
here like we thought it would be in the marshes 
an inquiry board of officials from the coast guard and the 
national transportation safety board concluded five days of 
hearings on the cause of the accident sunday an official report is 
not expected for several weeks

seton house a place where aids victims may find a 
home and be treated with dignity has been completed and dedicated 
by missionaries of charity the order of mother teresa 
all of us are witnesses today to what most of us hope to see 
once in a lifetime a miracle archbishop j francis stafford 
told a crowd that filled the small chapel sunday 
seton house a former church building that had been closed for 
eight years was reopened by five sisters sent to denver by the 
order it will provide a home for up to 20 men and women with aids 
when it begins accepting residents in a few weeks 
gov roy romer who attended the dedication said to the nuns 
i am absolutely in awe of the service you have given yos a 
tomato reddening on the vine embodies the spirit of summer 
moreover its easy to grow you dont even need a garden just 
a pot and a sunny place 
amid such poplularity breeders have developed hundreds of 
varieties and more keep coming every year the oldies are still 
around too and available from seedhouses specializing in heirloom 
varieties 
living in the country with plenty of space for experiment i 
grow the new and the old the large and the small the red and the 
gold this year ive grown the smallest tomato in creation the 
currant no larger then a marble and found the taste intense 
but attractive the skin was tough however 
taste of course is highly personal and fickle too but the 
small ones are getting high marks for flavor nowadays and many of 
us would say theyre the best for salads 
my own favorite smallie is an old cultivar named yellow 
pear producing a tantilizing blend of tart and sweet some 
people however think yellow pear too bland and prefer 
something sweeter like one called sweet million 
gardeners naturally like earliness in tomatoes and watch the 
catalogs for cultivars with that feature 
the best one to come along for my climate chilly spring nights 
50 miles north of new york city is another smallie called 
subarctic plenty which sets fruit in the 40s and even high 30s 
fahrenheit this gives me salad tomatoes in midjuly three and 
four weeks ahead of my other tomatoes 
by the middle of august however subarctic has done its 
thing and im eating other tomatoes with later and longer maturing 
times a new one called ida gold small and yellow has 
excellent flavor but the harvest is short yellow pear on the 
other hand keeps bearing until fall and ive seen it survive a few 
degrees of frost 
a new gardener interested in longbearing tomatoes should look 
for varieties labeled intermediate those called 
determinate are usually bush types with allatonce yields 
some bush types like red robin grow no taller than a foot 
or so and have little spread ideal for the small garden or for 
patio or container growing 
while using smallies for salads i still grow mediumsized fruit 
for cooking such dishes as stuffed tomatoes 
among the besttasting medium tomatoes marketed in recent years 
is a red one called carmello which ive seen described as both 
california and french i also raise beefsteak tomatoes for slicing 
on sandwiches 
this may sound like a lot of tomatoes but all told i limit 
myself to about a dozen plants which is plenty for me and my wife 
actually much of my harvest goes into making spaghetti sauce for 
the freezer 
when i first started gardening some 40 years ago staking and 
pruning tomato plants made for a lot of work but as i got older 
and lazier and maybe wiser i stopped this now i just lay down a 
bed of hay around my plants and let them sprawl 
the hay gives pretty good protection to the fruit sure i get a 
blemish and a hole here and there but im not growing for show and 
the taste is just as good 
a historical curiosity about the tomato is that despite its 
american indian origins it was practically unknown as a vegetable 
to whites in north america until long after the europeans with 
some misgivings ate it 
the poison fear persisted probably because the tomato belongs 
to the nightshade family but with todays popularity of small 
toamtoes we are returning to the plants ancient origins the wild 
cherry tomato from the andes is indeed believed to be the 
granddaddy of them all

hiroshima on monday mourned the 140000 
victims of the 1945 atomic bomb attack with a solemn look back and 
a note of optimism for the future as tensions ease between the 
soviet union and the united states 
for an eery moment the city fell silent taxis and street cars 
stopped and people throughout this industrial center of 1 million 
joined in a moment of prayer for the souls of those killed in the 
bombing 
dignitaries hiroshima residents and foreign guests bowed their 
heads at 815 am the exact moment the bomb exploded in a 
blinding flash of light 
i pay my deep respects to the citizens of hiroshima who have 
built this city of international peace from the ashes prime 
minister toshiki kaifu said at a ceremony attended by 55000 people 
as the only country in the world to have experienced an atom 
bomb attack japan has resolved not to let it be repeated kaifu 
said he reiterated japans appeals for total nuclear disarmament 
kaifu told a news conference that his government was working to 
increase medical and financial support for those exposed to the 
bombs radiation 
hiroshima mayor takeshi araki in his annual peace declaration 
praised the growing promises for disarmament in the united states 
and the soviet union 
hiroshima has the highest regard for this tide of disarmament 
changing the fate of mankind from one of annihilation to one of 
survival araki said 
the united states in an effort to avoid a bloody invasion of 
japan to end world war ii dropped an atomic bomb on hiroshima on 
aug 6 1945 it wiped out nearly half the citys population 
killing most immediately many others died within a few months 
mostly from radiation or burns 
hiroshima a major military center during the war has been 
honoring the dead at a solemn peace ceremony annually for 43 years 
but not all hiroshima residents can face the memories retired 
school teacher minako tanabe said her husband has never attended 
the ceremony although he has lived in hiroshima all his life 
my husband wont come here because its too sad so many of 
his friends died that day ms tanabe said 
monday thousands of visitors streamed through the citys peace 
memorial park leaving flowers messages and garlands of folded 
paper cranes symbols of peace draped around the parks 29 
monuments 
at a ceremony officials added 5551 names of people exposed to 
the bomb who died over the past year to the names enshrined in a 
granite cenotaph raising the total of claimed victims to 167243 
but it is difficult to determine which deaths were directly 
related to the bomb and 140000 victims is the more accepted 
figure many researchers believe the risk of death from leukemia 
lung bone and breast cancer is greater for those exposed to the 
bomb 
three days after the attack on hiroshima the united states 
dropped a second atom bomb on the city of nagasaki killing 70000 
civilians japan surrendered six days later ending world war ii

republican gov mike hayden has never lost 
since he first won election to the kansas house of representatives 
in 1972 but he faces a strong challenge from a political newcomer 
in tuesdays primary election 
recent polls have had wichita real estate executive nestor 
weigand jr gaining rapidly on hayden in a sixway battle for the 
gop governor nomination 
one poll last week put weigand ahead but by such a small margin 
that the race was considered too close to call hayden claimed his 
own polling had him solidly ahead 
on the democratic side former gov john carlin who served in 
197987 and was ineligible under the state constitution to run for 
a third fouryear term in 1986 was expected to have less trouble 
than hayden in winning his partys nomination 
carlins chief rival for the democratic nomination is joan 
finney who has been state treasurer for 15 years 
the problems for hayden 46 stem from a lack of popularity in 
urban areas and the political backlash from property taxes that 
soared after the state reappraised all property and implemented a 
classification system that assessed property at different rates 
the changes hit some medium and small businesses especially hard 
and taxpayer protest groups came to the capitol last winter 
demanding changes when the legislature adjourned in early may 
without doing anything hayden bore the brunt of the blame 
weigand 51 wealthy president of a family real estate business 
the largest in wichita has tried to capitalize on the discontent 
billing himself as a candidate who can solve the property tax 
problem 
however weigand has been criticized for lacking governmental 
knowledge and for proposing impractical solutions such as 
restoring business inventories to the tax rolls which industry 
strongly opposes and probably can block in the legislature 
also at stake on tuesdays ballot were nominations for one us 
senate seat and five seats in the house 
us sen nancy kassebaum faced token opposition in the 
republican senatorial primary from littleknown gregory walstrom of 
lawrence 
in the democratic primary for kassebaums seat former us rep 
bill roy filed for nomination in june than a week later announced 
he would not campaign for it roy represented northeast kansas in 
congress in 197175 and lost senatorial races to bob dole in 1974 
and to kassebaum in 1978 
roy could not get his name off the ballot after the filing 
deadline and could beat political neophyte dick williams on name 
recognition alone if so roy will have to decide if he wants to 
campaign against kassebaum in the fall 
on the house side us rep bob whittaker who has represented 
southeast kansas in washington for 12 years did not seek 
reelection this year and 10 candidates sought the two party 
nominations to succeed him there was no clearcut favorite in 
either party 
incumbent republican reps pat roberts and jan meyers and 
democrat dan glickman had no primary opposition while democrat jim 
slattery faced token opposition in mark creamer a crusader for the 
legalization of marijuana who sat in jail on a possession 
conviction during the primary campaign 
secretary of state bill graves forecast a turnout of 415000 
voters 275000 in the republican primary and 140000 in the 
democratic primary kansas has 1166 million registered voters but 
346000 of them are not registered with either party

an earthquake sharply jolted a northern 
iranian town on monday more than month after a quake killed 40000 
people in the region there was no immediate report of damage or 
injuries 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said the 
temblor struck rudbar in northern gilan province at 1255 pm it 
measured 45 on the richter scale of ground motion 
it said more than 2000 quakes have shaken the region since the 
devastating june 21 earthquake which registered 73 on the richter 
scale that quake also left 60000 injured and rendered half 
million homeless irovinces of gilan and zanjan 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one on the northern pf 65 
an earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause moderate 
damage in the local area 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 
7 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy 
damage

the world health organization on monday urged a 
smoking ban on all passenger aircraft 
we are now calling for all airlines to be smokefree we think 
its sensible we think its possible and we think the airlines 
would support it john roberts whos tobacco and health program 
manager told reporters 
martin jarvis senior scientist of the imperial cancer research 
fund said separately simply having nonsmoking seats on 
aircraft is not an answer to the problem nonsmokers are still 
exposed to smoke 
air canada last month became the first airline to ban smoking on 
all its transatlantic flights smoking is banned on most domestic 
flights in the united states 
a survey conducted by the world health organization and the 
british medical association found that some airlines would welcome 
a smoking ban if it was introduced by a third party such as a 
government or aviation industry body 
the survey showed the main reason airlines changed their smoking 
policy was pressure from consumers 
you cant step off an aircraft if you dont like the smoke 
you are trapped roberts said 
a prosmoking group forest attacked the survey saying yet 
again the bma forget that the role of doctors is to serve their 
patients not to dictate to them by force of law how they should 
live their lives

ruling party members said today that the 
government fearing a us air attack was distributing automatic 
weapons to tens of thousands of supporters and preparing to 
evacuate the iraqi capital 
a boycott of iraqi oil forced baghdad today to close one of two 
pipelines in turkey that were pumping the bulk of iraqs exported 
oil turkish officials said 
a british official said iraqi troops rounded up american and 
british visitors in kuwait and taking them to iraq the foreign 
office spokesman said most were passengers from a british airways 
flight stranded in kuwait since the iraqi invasion thursday 
there is no evidence that they are in any way in trouble the 
official said 
saudi arabia was reported reinforcing its troops along the 
kuwaiti border following concerns iraq may try to invade it 
pentagon sources said the uss independence and its carrier 
battle group are now on station in the arabian sea a position that 
would allow it to launch fighter planes into the persian gulf 
region 
gulfbased diplomats said soldiers from the american rapid 
deployment force formed to react to crises in the middle east had 
been dispatched to the area 
in other developments 
the new kuwait government installed by iraq hinted it might 
take hostages or seize property of nations that take punitive 
measures against iraq 
iraqi president saddam hussein said the 100000 soldiers who 
invaded kuwait began to pull back sunday president bush said iraq 
was lying 
oil prices jumped more than 3 a barrel on news europe and 
japan were joining the embargo of iraqi oil stocks slumped 
worldwide 
hospital officials said at least 300 kuwaiti and iraqi soldiers 
were killed during the invasion in london kuwaitis arriving on a 
special plane said 700 kuwaitis died 
the embargo of iraqi oil grew over the weekend to include japan 
and the european community along with the united states they 
bought more than half iraqs exported oil with most of it pumped 
through turkey 
an official of the staterun turkish pipeline company botas said 
pumping stopped at one of the two turkish pipelines at 5 pm iraq 
reduced flow in the second wider pipeline to 70 percent of 
capacity they said 
there was no comment from iraq 
the two pipelines pump iraqi crude from kirkuk oil fields in 
northern iraq to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the 
mediterranean they carry 70 million tons of crude annually 
providing the outlet for the major share of iraqi exports 
the botas official said all the countries participating in the 
embargo purchase their iraqi crude from the turkish outlet 
iraq also exports oil through a saudi arabian pipeline and via 
tankers in the northern persian gulf 
a foreign office spokesman said today as saying a total of 366 
people had been assembled by iraqi troops in kuwait mostly 
passengers from a stranded british airways flight they were being 
transported by bus to the iraqi border 
baghdad did not give any reason for its action 
immediately after the invasion thursday 11 americans were 
rounded up by iraqi troops they turned up safe in baghdad 
the new iraqiinstalled foreign minister of kuwait lt col 
walid saoud mohammed abdullah warned against further sanctions in 
a statement broadcast sunday by iraqi radio 
countries that resort to punitive measures against the 
provisional free kuwait government and fraternal iraq should 
remember that they have interests and nationals in kuwait he 
said 
iraqi soldiers invaded kuwait after complaining that its 
violation of opec production quotas was driving down world crude 
prices lowering iraqi oil revenues saddam also accused kuwait of 
stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim 
the respected middle east economic survey reported today that 
kuwaits oil export facilities had been shut down 
it also said there was considerable doubt saudi arabia with the 
worlds largest oil reserves would be willing to make up the 
potential world oil shortage kuwait and iraq together account for 
onefifth of the 235 million barrels produced daily by the 13 opec 
nations 
tensions remained high in the region a us official said in 
washington that iraqi troops massed on the kuwaitisaudi border 
were apparently digging in an american technician at a secret 
saudi arabian base said the kingdom had sent 200 to 300 tanks 
toward its border with kuwait 
oil industry sources in saudi arabia reached by telephone from 
bahrain said saudi troops were entering the region of khafji near 
the border residents reached by telephone reported intense air 
activity near the saudi airport overnight 
the washington post reported today that egypt was mobilizing 
some elements of its armed forces to assist saudi arabia in the 
event of an invasion 
us officials said there was no indication iraqi troops were 
preparing to invade saudi arabia but bush sent defense secretary 
dick cheney to the kingdom to confer with its leaders and the 
white house said secretary of state james a baker would go this 
week to turkey 
saadi mehdi saleh the iraqi army commander was quoted by the 
aliraq newspaper as saying tens of thousands of volunteers had 
joined the army to defend what he called iraq and the revolution 
in kuwait 
americans he was quoted as saying should understand that the 
people of the great leader saddam hussein cannot be frightened 
local members of the ruling baath party said preparations were 
under way to evacuate all of baghdads 4 million people to camps 
outside the city they were being told that the us air force 
might attack or that israel might attack with chemical or nuclear 
weapons 
the party members also said the party had distributed guns 
mainly ak47 automatic rifles to tens of thousands of people 
around the country 
state radio said saddam had ordered the formation of 11 new 
iraqi army divisions expected to generate 100000 troops the arab 
worlds most formidible military force is already estimated at 1 
million men 
at a border checkpoint 30 miles south of the iraqi port city of 
basra dozens of tanks armored personnel carriers and trucks 
carrying hundreds of soldiers crossed back into iraq on sunday 
but thousands of iraqi soldiers remained behind in kuwait 
controlling major government buildings commerical centers and 
ports 
diplomats in the region said a new kuwaiti army fanned out 
through kuwait the force comprises about 80000 troops mostly 
iraqis 
the ninemember kuwaiti military government announced by iraq 
on saturday remained a mystery no photographs of the named 
leaders have been shown and 12 reporters brought to kuwait by the 
ministry of information could not locate any of them 
kuwaiti diplomats said they were all iraqis including a 
soninlaw of saddam a charge official iraqi media denied

the productivity of american workers improved 
for the first time in 18 months climbing at an annual rate of 16 
percent the government said monday 
analysts said they were encouraged by the gain in nonfarm 
productivity defined as output per hour of work especially in 
light of recent data showing rising unemployment and stagnant 
economic growth 
its one tiny bright spot in the midst of a lot of 
negatives said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston 
amp co a government securities dealer in new york 
however economists said the 16 percent gain was still below 
the level needed to dramatically boost americans standard of 
living and improve the nations ability to compete internationally 
they also were disturbed at the reports findings on hourly 
labor costs a major inflation measure for businesses those costs 
rose at an annual rate of 56 percent the second quarter of 1990 
well above the 3 percent rise for all of 1989 
the inflation numbers for the rest of the year look horrible 
especially with the shock of the middle east oil crisis said 
michael k evans who heads a washington economic forecasting firm 
the rise in productivity in the second three months of the year 
was the first increase since productivity climbed 05 percent in 
the final quarter of 1988 the labor department said 
though the report offered good news on american workers 
performance in the apriljune period the agency said revised 
figures on last year showed productivity actually fell 03 percent 
rather than increasing 09 percent as first reported 
the poor 1989 showing was the worst since nonfarm productivity 
dropped 09 percent during the 198182 recession the government 
said 
the report showed that from april to june the number of hours 
americans worked fell 01 percent a likely sign that workers were 
being laid off in the face of slower economic growth and businesses 
just werent hiring as many new workers analysts said 
its a good newsbad news thing evans said the good news 
is that producers are starting to cut costs and lay off 
inefficient workers and the bad news is that when they lay off 
too many workers we have a recession 
in revising numbers for the first quarter of 1990 the agency 
offered slightly better figures saying productivity fell 19 
percent rather than the 27 percent plunge first reported 
mondays report showed that unit labor costs a key gauge of 
future price inflation rose 39 percent for the apriljune period 
compared with a 33 percent increase during all of 1989 
in the manufacturing sector productivity increased 37 percent 
a big improvement over the 2 percent increase during all of 1989 
unit labor costs in that sector rose 26 percent compared with the 
22 percent increase during all of last year 
total business productivity including farming rose 19 percent 
for the first quarter compared with a 02 percent drop for all of 
1989 
since 1982 productivity growth has averaged 14 percent a year 
increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living 
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their 
output rises without risking higher inflation

the white house said today it is clearly in 
the national interest to end iraqs aggression sources said the 
uss independence moved close enough to the tense persian gulf 
region to launch fighter planes 
the white house said secretary of state james a baker iii will 
travel to turkey midweek as defense secretary dick cheney arrived 
in saudi arabia to open talks on appropriate ways to defend their 
country oil pipelines critical to iraqs oil distribution run 
through turkey and saudi arabia 
bush also stepped up discussions with western allies 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president would meet 
over dinner tonight with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
following meetings with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
and nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
the white house continued its tough line on iraqs military 
invasion of kuwait 
it is true that iraqs invasion of kuwait threatens regional 
and world stability threatens opec and could force severe economic 
consequences on the united states fitzwater said 
from the moment the first iraqi soldier entered kuwait it has 
been clearly in the national interest to stop saddam hussein this 
is an overt situation his tanks are real and moving our response 
is real and moving on all fronts diplomatic economic political 
and military he said 
meanwhile pentagon sources said the uss independence and its 
carrier battle group are now on station in the arabian sea a 
position that would allow it to launch fighter planes into the 
persian gulf region 
officially the pentagon would only say that the huge warship 
was operating in the indian ocean and that it is being escorted by 
eight smaller warships and four support ships 
asked the purpose of bakers mission to turkey later this week 
fitzwater said every country in the region faces a degree of 
threat from iraq which last thursday launched a lightning 
invasion of kuwait 
we dont know what saddam husseins intentions are and 
certainly every country suffers a more indirect threat of opec 
takeover by iraq he said 
he said the situation in the gulf remains extremely serious 
there is no information suggesting that iraqi military units are 
departing kuwait to the contrary the iraqi military presence 
throughout kuwait including along the saudi border remains 
extremely large and threatening 
asked if the cheney was offering the saudis assurances that the 
united states would defend the desert kingdom fitzwater said we 
have discussed military possibilities and our abilities with all 
the countries in the gulf 
the defense of saudi arabia is of paramount concern he said 
fitzwater declined comment on reports that turkey a member of 
nato had agreed to cut off the pipelines that carry much of iraqs 
oil to market he also said the white house could not confirm a 
report that iraq itself had reduced the flow of its oil through 
turkey 
iraqs invasion of kuwait threatens regional and world 
stability threatens opec and could force severe economic 
consequences on the united states he said 
fitzwater said jordans king hussein who has defended saddam 
called bush sunday night he did not offer details 
he also expressed concern about possible price gouging by oil 
companies that sharply raised gasoline prices within hours of the 
iraqi invasion 
we are concerned about the price increases there have been 
some immediate increases in the spot price of crude oil it is not 
clear that all of the increases that have been reported at the 
consumer level are necessary said fitzwater 
it would be most unfortunate if there were any gouging or 
anyone was trying to take advantage of this situation he said 
currently he added the disruption is fairly moderate in 
us oil supplies 
an irate bush on sunday vowed that iraqs brutal naked 
aggression will not stand 
the cheney delegation to saudi arabia included bushs deputy 
national security adviser robert gates gen h norman schwarzkopf 
commander in chief of the central command which includes the 
persian gulf and paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for 
policy 
they undertook the mission as the united states intensified 
efforts to build worldwide support for a boycott of oil from iraqi 
and kuwait and to press for united nations sanctions that could 
include a ban on trade with iraq 
bush met with top military and civilian advisers sunday evening 
at the white house after issuing a stern denunciation of the iraqi 
invasion that has inflamed the middle east 
the president said sunday there was a strong feeling among 
the nato allies including turkey which controls a pipeline vital 
to iraqs oil exports that we must have concerted action to 
isolate iraq economically 
to baghdads claim accompanied by government television 
footage that it had begun pulling out its 80000 troops bush 
snapped that the iraqis lied once again 
bush said he knew of no country willing to recognize the 
puppet regime of military officers that iraq has installed in 
kuwait to replace the ruling royal family the emir fled to saudi 
arabia as the iraqi tanks rolled down on kuwait city 
i want to see the arab states join the rest of the world in 
condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get saddam 
hussein out said bush 
asked about jordan king husseins defense of the iraqi ruler 
bush said i am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that 
apologizes or appears to condone whats taken place 
jordans monarch said saturday that other arab states were 
premature in condemning the iraqi invasion he called iraqs 
ruler a patriotic man 
but jordans foreign minister mudar badran said his country 
would not recognize the new kuwaiti government 
bush lauded japan which has joined the us and european 
boycott of oil from iraq and kuwait despite japans heavy reliance 
on persian gulf oil iraq and kuwait have supplied more than 11 
percent of japans oil 
bush refused to discuss any military moves but told reporters 
his options were wide open 
the united states imposed an economic boycott on iraq hours 
after its lightning invasion of kuwait last thursday bush has 
spent much of his time since then urging other nations to use 
economic pressure to bring baghdad to heel 
asked how he and other world leaders could thwart the iraqis 
puppet regime a clearly agitated bush said just wait watch and 
learn 
tens of thousands of iraqi troops were reported massed in kuwait 
near the saudi border

a 29yearold unemployed oil equipment salesman 
said today that his father was one of three men who fired the shots 
that killed president john f kennedy on cia orders 
during a press conference ricky white said his late father 
roscoe white joined the dallas police department two months before 
the nov 22 1963 assassination so he could carry out the 
assassination 
white who said his father went by the code name mandarin 
was stationed at the grassy knoll 
two other cia operatives with code names lebanon and 
saul were stationed in the texas school book depository and the 
county records building overlooking dealey plaza the assassination 
site he said 
he was told by the government to do something white told 
dozens of reporters you dont question the government 
white said that lee harvey oswald was a part of the plot but 
did not fire shots he described oswald and police officer jd 
tippit as patsies 
the warren commission concluded that oswald acting alone fired 
the shots that killed kennedy and wounded john connally then the 
texas governor despite the commissions findings conspiracy 
theories have abounded since the assassination 
woody specht an fbi agent in dallas who spent nine years 
assigned to the kennedy assassination case refused to comment on 
the claims other than to say you really need to evaluate the 
source on these types of things 
theres been so many claims like this in the last 27 years 
specht said you have to use good judgment here especially from 
somebody who was what 2 years old at the time 
white said today that his father and tippit picked up oswald 
following the assassination although tippit apparently had no 
knowledge of the assassination or the plot 
white said the plan was to drive oswald to red bird airport but 
somewhere along the way oswald panicked and got out of the car at 
that point tippit apparently became suspicious and told roscoe 
white that they would have to go to police headquarters for 
questioning 
at that point white shot tippit ricky white said 
i know he had to live with this the rest of his life because 
jd tippit was a close friend of the family white said 
roscoe whites pastor at the time of the assassination the rev 
jack shaw was also at todays press conference held in the jfk 
assassination information center which has examined various 
conspiracy theories over the years 
shaw said roscoe white discussed the assassination with him on 
several agonizing occasions including a last conversation on his 
deathbed 
shaw said he believes roscoe white who died in a 1971 fire was 
killed by a witness elimination team activated after kennedys 
death white had resigned from the dallas police department in 1965 
to go into private business his son said 
roscoe whites wife geneva told shaw of overhearing her 
husband and jack ruby discuss the assassination plot shaw said 
she also overheard them discuss how white would kill tippit and 
ruby would kill oswald at police headquarters 
ruby fatally shot oswald two days after kennedy was assassinated 
shaw said mrs white overheard ruby say i will take care of 
oswald white responded i will take care of the president and 
i will take care of tippit 
ricky white and several others today characterized roscoe white 
as a cia operative who had committed several other killings at the 
governments behest 
white said he learned of his fathers involvement in the plot 12 
years ago and struggled to come to terms with that knowledge white 
said he read part of a diary that discussed the assassination plot 
but he said the diary was taken from the family by the fbi in the 
last couple of years 
white showed reporters documents monday that he said buttress 
his claims that his father killed kennedy among the items were 
embarcation slips showing that both white and oswald left on the 
same ship for marine duty in japan on aug 22 1957 
he also gave reporters copies of three faded messages he 
believes were sent by us intelligence officials ordering 
kennedys assassination 
bobby inman the former deputy cia director viewed the messages 
and said they were not genuine

former president jimmy carter said monday it 
would be a mistake to send us troops to the middle east in 
retaliation for the iraqi invasion of kuwait unless iraq also 
invades saudi arabia 
carter said in an impromptu news conference in his hometown that 
he believes president bush and other us leaders have taken the 
right economic and political steps to address last weeks invasion 
i dont have any criticism to make of what president bush and 
our leaders have done carter said i think they have taken 
very strong economic and political action the condemnations of 
iraq in the united nations the martialling of economic punishments 
for deprivation of iraq in japan and europe have been a pleasant 
surprise for me 
it would be a mistake at this point obviously to deploy any 
american troops halfway around the world in an area thats almost 
totally inaccessible to us he said 
during his administration carter sent a secret military force 
to the region in an effort to rescue american hostages in iran the 
attempt failed when several of the rescue aircraft crashed and 
burned 
but carter said if iraq crosses the border of saudi arabia it 
is inevitable that our nation would respond militarily 
he cautioned that trade embargoes will not be a successful 
longterm sanction if iraq refuses to withdraw from kuwait noting 
that nations will resume buying oil in order to avoid hurting their 
own economies 
if japan does maintain their present decision not to purchase 
oil from kuwait or iraq that would be a notable achievement and a 
pleasant surprise he said 
carter told reporters that americans must realize many arab 
leaders out of fear or other considerations support what iraqi 
leader saddam hussein has done 
my guess is he hopes to consolidate his position in kuwait to 
let time pass to let the economic punishments fade away and then 
to hold what hes got he said 
carters comments came as he and his wife rosalynn toured the 
plains high school which they attended the school is being 
restored as part of the jimmy carter national historic site

the president dismissed prime 
minister benazir bhutto and her government monday alleging rampant 
corruption and the army took over staterun television and the 
telephones 
opposition leader mustafa jatoi was immediately sworn in as 
acting prime minister president ghulam ishaq khan said elections 
for a new national assembly would be held oct 24 
ms bhutto called the presidents action illegal and 
unconstitutional and said the corruption allegations were part of 
a slander campaign against her government 
ms bhutto the daughter of a former prime minister took office 
in december 1988 and became the first woman to head a modern moslem 
nation she was hailed as a heroine for restoring democracy to 
pakistan after 11 years of military rule however the image 
steadily eroded amid allegations of corruption among senior members 
of her government and even members of her family 
ms bhutto also has been accused of inaction for failing to 
control ethnic violence in her home province sindh 
the government has willfully undermined and impaired the 
working of the constitution resulting in discord confrontation 
and deadlock adversely affecting the integrity solidarity and 
wellbeing of pakistan ishaq khan told a hastily called news 
conference 
corruption and nepotism in the federal government has reached 
such proportions that the orderly functioning of the government 
does no longer carry public faith and credibility and despite being 
subject to wide public condemnation the government has failed to 
take approriate action he said 
pakistans constitution gives the president the authority to 
dissolve the national assembly if he believes the government is 
unable to carry out its duties 
but many diplomats and observers said the presidents decision 
appeared to have been based largely on hearsay and could not have 
been done without the consent of the powerful army generals 
the military ruled pakistan for 25 years of its 43year history 
soldiers were deployed throughout the capital monday but the army 
chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg insisted the military had no 
intention of seizing power 
we are not involved in politics we have never been involved 
in politics we are not going to get involved in politics beg 
said 
ms bhutto told a news conference that soldiers had surrounded 
her house monday and sealed government offices including the 
intelligence bureau she said her pakistan peoples party would 
decide later whether to challenge the president in supreme court 
i dont feel betrayed by the president i believe there were 
other elements that wanted me out she said asked if she planned 
to run in the october elections she replied most certainly i 
intend to win 
the president said his decision was motivated by his commitment 
to democracy and the integrity and stability of pakistan he 
accused the government of flouting the constitution disrepect of 
the judiciary misuse of the official machinery 
the move caught members of ms bhuttos cabinet by surprise 
this is total highhandedness unconstitutional and illegal 
said tariq rahim minister for parliamentary affairs it is a 
conspiracy against all democratically elected people 
rumors had been circulating for weeks that ishaq khan planned to 
dissolve the 237member national assembly 
the assembly which ms bhuttos party narrowly controls had 
been expected to convene wednesday but by monday the president 
still had not formally called the session giving credence to the 
rumors 
on sunday political opponents announced they intended to 
introduce a noconfidence motion against ms bhuttos government 
the second in nine months ms bhutto narrowly survived a 
noconfidence vote in november 
a month after ms bhutto took office polls placed her 
popularity at 54 percent the latest gallup pakistan poll showed 
that in june her popularity had tumbled to 34 percent 
many pakistanis from the tea vendors in the local bazaars to 
the countrys most powerful industrialists began to see their 
young and inexperienced prime minister as arrogant unwilling to 
compromise and even vindictive 
members of her own party privately expressed disillusionment 
with ms bhuttos government complaining that daily life was worse 
than under the dictatorship of gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
zia died in a mysterious plane crash in august 1988 leading to 
ms bhuttos election in pakistans first free vote in more than a 
decade zia had seized power in a 1977 coup that toppled ms 
bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto who was hanged two years 
later 
many of ms bhuttos party members in parliament have expressed 
fears of an early election saying they have nothing to show 
voters during 20 months in power the government has passed no 
legislation except the federal budget 
ms bhuttos relationship also has deteriorated with the army 
which has become increasingly critical of the governments 
inability or unwillingness to deal with the violence in sindh 
province gang warfare between rival ethnic groups claimed more 
than 400 lives since late may

iraqi troops in kuwait rounded up american and 
british visitors from two hotels in kuwait for transport to iraq 
but the foreigners did not appear to be in danger the british 
foreign office said today 
thirtyeight americans were among those rounded up the state 
department said in washington 
a foreign office spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the government believed 366 people had been assembled mostly 
passengers from a british airways flight stranded in kuwait since 
the invasion by iraqi troops thursday 
we are trying to establish the precise details now said the 
spokesman there is no evidence that they are in any way in 
trouble 
word of the roundup was received from the british embassy in 
kuwait 
the official added that baghdad had not given any reason for its 
action and britain was trying to organize a team of diplomats to 
meet the buses carrying the foreigners at the iraqkuwait border 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we hold iraq responsible for the safety of the 28 
americans 
assistant secretary of state john kelly summoned iraqi 
ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat to demand information about the 
whereabouts of the 28 she said 
its premature to call them hostages she said we dont 
know their destination 
the british foreign office said the tourists apparently were 
being taken to baghdad 
we hope the idea is that they will be able to continue their 
flight from there a foreign office spokesman told britains 
domestic news agency press association 
the british and us visitors were staying at a transit hotel at 
kuwait airport and at the sas hotel in kuwait city 
the spokesman said the iraqi move did not appear to involve 
foreigners who live in kuwait 
shortly after the iraqi invasion of kuwait iraqi troops took 34 
british military advisers to baghdad they are still being held 
there 
the government said it did not consider the soldiers to be 
hostages but rather in temporary custody 
the foreign office said today it was holding negotiations both 
with the iraqi embassy in london and through officials in baghdad 
for their release 
the foreign office summoned iraqi ambassador azmi shafiq 
alsalihi who was told in robust language about britains 
anger over the invasion of kuwait 
the ambassador was also warned of iraqs international 
obligations toward british citizens in kuwait and the servicemen 
who were taken to baghdad 
eleven american oil workers were also seized by iraqi troops 
after the invasion but they turned up unharmed in baghdad 
in bonn a west german foreign ministry spokesman said it heard 
reports from its embassies in kuwait and baghdad that over the 
weekend a number of germans also were taken from hotels in kuwait 
we dont have precise information about how the action 
occurred we have information that at least some of them were 
brought to baghdad said the spokesman who asked not to be 
further identified

five west african leaders agreed today to 
send troops and a naval task force to liberia to help end a tribal 
war one leader said has turned the nation into a slaughterhouse 
salim ahmed salim secretarygeneral of the organization of 
african unity told the associated press the summit had agreed in 
principle to intervene militarily and were discussing modalities 
and logistics 
conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
leaders were considering sending in troops by land from neighboring 
sierra leone and guinea as well as a naval force to impose a 
ceasefire and install an interim government the government would 
organize free and fair elections in the west african nation 
devastated by seven months of civil war according to the plan 
it comes a day after the united states sent marines into 
monrovia to evacuate americans 
in liberia the rebel national patriotic front said it was 
organizing demonstrations in four liberian towns against the 
african intervention 
nigeria the most powerful nation in the region already hasese companies 
are usually given two 
options the traditional mommy track or the same professional 
track taken by male employees fearing the overtime and transfers 
that men endure for a business career about 95 percent choose the 
traditional track 
when those women return to work after having children they find 
only parttime jobs positions that are really fulltime work 
without the benefits of lifetime employment 
many firms rely on nonpermanent female employees who earn 
onehalf to twothirds what their male colleagues earn for similar 
work to cut personnel costs 
eiko shinotsuka a labor economist at ochanomizu womens 
university in tokyo says the system is efficient but it means 
that most women work as clerks or in other deadend jobs 
and remaining single or childless is no guarantee of career 
opportunity shinotsuka says 
surveys show that just over 1 percent of all managers in major 
japanese corporations are women mostly at lower levels of 
management only 38 percent of all japanese companies in most 
cases tiny entrepreneurships or family businesses are headed by 
women according to tokyo shoko research a private research 
institute 
sexual equality is guaranteed by the japanese constitution 
since 1986 an equal employment opportunity law has required 
companies to let women apply for positions previously open only to 
men 
unlike the united states the law does not specify penalties or 
require that women be hired or receive equal training or promotion 
opportunities 
in july a japanese court made the first ruling in favor of 
women who complained they had been denied promotions on the basis 
of their sex but the court did not order any mechanism for 
promoting the complainants the 18 women however were awarded 
640000 in compensation 
women cant go to the courts with a law that only says firms 
should try to provide equal treatment the law has helped but 
its still no good it needs penalties for enforcement mrs 
shinotsuka says it would be better to eliminate discrimination 
altogether 
the absence of a popular womens movement and customs prevailing 
outside the office have inevitably slowed progress in overcoming 
discrimination 
most japanese men still expect their mothers and sisters their 
wives and even their female colleagues to wait on them after 
working hours many men entertain clients in bars where beautifully 
clad women light their cigarettes flatter and serve them 
attitudes are beginning to change slowly 
some women also have begun to protest against japans immense 
sex industry against violence and pornography in comics read 
openly by japanese men on subways and elsewhere and other images 
that they say dehumanize women 
the nations first sexual harassment case ever was filed last 
year and since then complaints of such problems have ballooned 
some analysts credit the rising awareness of womens problems to 
takako doi a sharpwitted former law professor who has led japans 
top opposition party since 1986

the president today dissolved prime 
minister benazir bhuttos government and declared a state of 
emergency the army took over the national television station and 
telephone exchanges 
ms bhutto called the presidents charges of corruption and 
ineptness during her 20month administration a slander 
campaign she hinted the military might have been involved in the 
dismissal 
army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg said the military moves 
were taken to assure an orderly transition to other civilian 
authorities and were not an attempt by the military to seize power 
we are not involved in politics aslam beg said of the 
military which has controlled the country for 25 of its 43year 
history we are not going to get involved 
president ghulam ishaq khans dismissed the government called 
for new elections appointed an interim prime minister and declared 
a state of emergency 
the president is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in 
which the security of pakistan is threatened by external aggression 
and by internal disturbance beyond the power of the provincial 
governments to control said the proclamation issued by ishaq 
khan on monday night 
in dissolving the national assembly the lawmaking lower house 
of parliament ishaq khan said ms bhuttos government was corrupt 
and politically inept 
ishaq khan who as head of state has the constitutional power to 
dissolve the government set new elections for oct 24 opposition 
leader mustafa jatoi was immediately sworn in as acting prime 
minister to head a fourmember caretaker government 
ms bhutto 37 and the first woman to lead a modern moslem 
nation called the presidents action illegal and 
unconstitutional and said corruption charges were part of a 
slander campaign 
he has established an undemocratic interim government by 
disbanding a democratic government said a subdued ms bhutto 
adding her pakistan peoples party would decide later whether to 
challenge the president in the supreme court 
i dont feel betrayed by the president i believe there were 
other elements that wanted me out she said 
asked if she planned to run in the elections she replied 
most certainly i intend to win 
i have told members of the people party to stay peaceful we 
will not ask them to take to the streets she said the 
situation should be tackled politically we must not give any 
pretext to the present regime to get away from the promise to hold 
elections on oct 24 
ms bhutto has been criticized widely for inaction 
unwillingness to compromise failure to control resurging ethnic 
violence in her home province and mounting charges of corruption 
within her government 
but many diplomats and observers said the presidents decision 
would not have been done without the consent of the powerful army 
generals who still cast a long shadow on pakistans infant 
democracy 
ms bhutto said the army this afternoon had surrounded her 
house sealed the offices of the prime ministers secretariat as 
well as the offices of the intelligence bureau 
this is very strange if this is a civilian process she said 
rumors have been circulating for weeks around pakistans capital 
that ishaq khan planned to dissolve the 237member national 
assembly and call new elections 
the army has become increasingly critical at the governments 
handling of ethnic strife that has claimed more than 400 lives 
since late may the army blames members of ms bhuttos party for 
much of the violence which is centered on ms bhuttos home 
province of sindh 
ishaq khan cited the violence as another reason for dismissing 
the government 
ms bhutto took office on dec 2 1988 and at age 35 became the 
first woman to lead a modern moslem nation she was hailed as a 
heroine for restoring democracy to pakistan after 11 years of 
military rule 
but that image has steadily been eroded largely because of 
increasing charges of corruption among senior members of her 
government and even members of her family 
even members of her own party privately express disillusionment 
with ms bhuttos government complaining that life was worse under 
her than under the dictatorship of gen mohammad zia ulhaq who 
seized power in a 1977 coup that toppled ms bhuttos father 
zulfikar ali bhutto 
bhutto was hanged two years later for his alleged complicity in 
a murder plot

disruption of oil supplies from iraq and kuwait 
poses no immediate danger of shortages experts said monday 
but the worlds oil reserves could be called upon quickly 
putting upward pressure on prices they said 
all eyes will be on saudi arabia which has the greatest 
capacity to make up for the disruption but would fear retaliation 
from neighboring iraq the experts said 
in the shortterm i dont think people are panicking too 
much said lucy mullins an oil analyst at the london investment 
firm of barclays de zoete wedd ltd the world could last six 
months or so almost quite happily 
the iraqi supply is being disrupted by a joint embargo by the 
united states the european community and japan iraq on monday 
reduced the flow of oil through turkish pipelines which can carry 
up to half of iraqs oil production 
kuwaiti production has come to a halt since iraqs thursday 
morning invasion 
although iraq and kuwait are among the worlds biggest 
producers their combined production of 47 million barrels a day 
represents just 9 percent of the worlds output 
the oil market has been experiencing an excess of supply and oil 
importers stocks are high experts say the oil shocks of the 
1970s also have made industrial nations used to cutting demand 
oil prices still jumped about 3 a barrel monday as oil buyers 
scurried to secure supplies the spot price of north sea brent 
blend the most widely traded international crude oil was trading 
at 2629 a barrel in london late monday afternoon 
the 24nation international energy agencys governing board 
planned to meet at its paris headquarters on thursday to assess the 
situations impact on its members spokeswoman joyce heard said 
but the meeting was unlikely to result in the imposition of the 
agencys emergency oil sharing program she said 
one or more member countries must be deprived of at least 7 
percent of its normal oil supply before the countries start sharing 
their oil she said 
but the board was expected to discuss demand restraint measures 
which can include taxes fuel switching and the use of oil stocks 
she said 
iraq produced 31 million barrels a day in july and kuwait 16 
million the iea said 
total world production came to 542 million barrels a day in the 
second quarter the agency said 
consumption in the traditionally weak threemonth summer period 
came to 514 million barrels a day 
as of july the 24nation organization for economic cooperation 
and development had 99 days worth of oil stocks the iea said 
the middle east economic survey a weekly newsletter reported 
monday that current excess capacity by members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries amounted to 35 million barrels of 
oil a day 
this extra capacity is concentrated in saudi arabia with a spare 
2 million barrels a day the united arab emirates with 600000 
venezuela with 500000 and libya with 300000 the newsletter said 
venezuela far from iraq is most likely to increase its output 
experts said norway which doesnt belong to opec might be able 
to kick in an extra 200000 barrels a day ms mullins said 
but supplies from the north sea have been constrained by summer 
maintenance and industrial action by oil workers 
it is still unknown if opec members will observe their output 
quotas and back the oil shortage 
some members would welcome the higher prices prompted by iraqs 
actions but pricing moderates in the cartel might increase output 
to ease prices and reduce the crises 
said ian graham an oil analyst with county natwest woodmac 
its a matter of whether saudi arabia feels confident enough to 
bump up its production in the face of a belligerent neighbor

the un security council today 
overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions 
against iraq including a ban on oil purchases to punish baghdad 
for invading kuwait 
the vote was 130 with two abstentions by cuba and yemen on the 
15member council which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed 
by the united states it said iraq had launched an armed attack 
against kuwait and usurped the authority of kuwaits legitimate 
government 
the sanctions were intended to force iraq to withdraw its troops 
from kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their 
territories of all commodities and products originating in iraq or 
kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution 
president bush praised the decision and called for full and 
total implementation of these sanctions ruling out nothing at 
all 
he told reporters at the white house the will of nations 
around the world will be to enforce these sanctions 
it was the third time in its 45year existence that the world 
body had voted sanctions against a member state the last time was 
1967 when the security council voted similar comprehensive 
sanctions against the white minority government of rhodesia 
an arms embargo against south africa still is in effect 
the sanctions are legally binding for all member nations 
although past council resolutions have often been ignored or 
flouted the united nations has no enforcement mechanism but later 
could call on members to take military action against iraq or 
impose a blockade 
the vote followed similar sanctions imposed on iraq by much of 
the west including the united states japan and the european 
community the soviet union and china said they would halt arms 
shipments to iraq 
in a statement carried by the iraqi news agency on sunday the 
iraqiinstalled military government of kuwait warned other nations 
not to take punishing measures against it or iraq the 
provisional government said countries have to remember they have 
interests and citizens in kuwait 
the un role in the iraqkuwait crisis assumed increasing 
importance after divided arab nations canceled a weekend emergency 
summit on the invasion 
in an emergency session just hours after thursdays invasion 
the security council condemned iraqs invasion demanded immediate 
and unconditional troop withdrawal and called for negotiations 
between iraq and kuwait 
the council threatened to impose sanctions if iraq did not 
comply 
the council includes the five permanent members with veto power 
the united states britain china france and the soviet union 
the 10 nonpermanent members are canada colombia cuba ethiopia 
finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and zaire

the us food and drug administration said 
monday it has approved a drug that cuts the death rate in half in 
premature infants suffering from a severe lung disease 
the disease called respiratory distress syndrome is the most 
common cause of death in infants under 30 days old the american 
lung association said the ailment afflicts 50000 infants each 
year and kills about 3000 of them the lung association said 
the drug called exosurf is a mixture of synthetic chemicals 
that mimic the action of lung surfactant a liquid found in the 
lungs that helps keep them inflated premature infants are unable 
to make surfactant and their lungs can collapse if not treated 
the drug was invented by dr john clements of the university of 
california san francisco and is made by burroughs wellcome co of 
research triangle park nc 
the approval of the drug is a very important development 
said dr mary ellen avery professor of pediatrics at harvard 
medical school in boston there has been a significant reduction 
in deaths among those who were treated 
exosurf and another experimental surfactant made from cows 
lungs have both been available since last year when the fda 
allowed distribution under what is called a treatment ind that 
is intended to make lifesaving experimental drugs available before 
approval 
the bovine surfactant called survanta is made by abbott 
laboratories in abbott park ill 
both have been widely used and although they have not been 
directly compared both work pretty well said avery who has 
used them i dont think anyone is in a position to say which is 
better 
a spokesman for abbott said approval of survanta was expected 
soon 
dr anthony corbet a neonatologist at the baylor college of 
medicine in houston who has participated in experimental studies of 
exosurf said this drug will have its greatest place in treating 
very small premature infants perhaps those under 3 pounds but 
those babies under 3 pounds make a very large contribution to 
infant mortality 
the infant mortality rate in the united states is 10 deaths per 
1000 live births corbet said about three infant deaths per 1000 
are due to respiratory distress syndrome he said cutting the 
number of those deaths in half with exosurf could significantly 
lower the us infant mortality rate he said 
in studies with 1600 infants with respiratory distress 
syndrome exosurf cut the death rate by 66 percent the company 
said when given to 1800 infants who were at risk of developing 
the disease but had not yet contracted it the drug reduced the 
death rate by 50 percent company officials said 
corbet said he is giving exosurf routinely to premature newborn 
infants weighing 3 pounds or less whether they have the disease 
yet or not they have about a 70 percent chance of developing the 
disease he said 
in less premature infants corbet said he generally administers 
the drug when the disease appears 
dr richard kent of burroughs wellcome explained that in the 
absence of surfactant the little air sacs in the lung called 
alveoli collapse like inflated balloons if air pressure is not 
maintained when surfactant is added the alveoli become more like 
bubblegum bubbles and maintain their shape when air pressure 
falls he said 
about 10000 infants have been treated with the drug so far 
kent said infants getting the drug in the clinical trials showed 
few side effects with the exception of apnea a treatable disorder 
in which infants intermittently stop breathing for short periods 
the company said there was also a slight increase in bleeding in 
the lungs the company said 
corbet said the drug reduces the need for oxygen and ventilators 
with premature infants and thus can reduce lung injury 
both oxygen and the pressure from the ventilator damage the 
lungs he said and you get lung injury which doesnt go away 
very quickly that causes a great lengthening of hospitalization

a federal judge monday dismissed peggy 
mcmartin buckeys 1 million civil suit alleging malicious 
prosecution in the marathon mcmartin preschool molestation trial 
that ended with her acquittal 
us district judge richard a gadbois jr said he could 
understand how mrs buckey could feel about her sevenyear ordeal 
but being very very upset does not state a cause of action he 
said 
because mrs buckey was ultimately acquitted the civil action 
just isnt going to fly he said 
mrs buckey filed the civil suit in january after she and her 
son raymond won acquittal on 52 felony charges of child 
molestation at the nowdefunct preschool in manhattan beach ray 
buckey was not named as a plaintiff 
a second trial with ray buckey as the sole defendant ended in 
a mistrial last month when jurors deadlocked on eight counts los 
angeles county district attorney ira reiner said he would not retry 
buckey 
an attorney for mrs buckey said he would appeal gadbois ruling 
the only way we have been able to stay in court anywhere is to 
take it to the appellate level said attorney james h davis 
nobody wants to hear this case everybody has had enough of this 
case 
mrs buckeys civil suit contended she was the victim of a 
conspiracy by los angeles county the city of manhattan beach 
former district attorney robert philibosian childrens institute 
international and therapist kee macfarlane capital citiesabc inc 
and its former reporter wayne satz 
the defendants were accused of defamation malicious 
prosecution conspiracy and violation of mrs buckeys civil 
rights the suit sought general damages of 1 million and 
unspecified punitive damages 
although the judge tossed out the federal suit mrs buckey may 
still file claims in state court 
after the second trial raymond buckey filed a civil suit in 
state court against the same defendants

the widening income gap between the rich and 
the poor in the united states has hit hispanics especially hard a 
research group said monday 
hispanics have traditionally earned less than nonhispanics but 
a study by the center on budget and policy priorities said the 
difference grew in the 1980s because hispanic income stagnated 
wage levels declined and there were fewer government assistance 
programs to aid the poor the center said 
in 1979 the group said the income of the typical hispanic 
family was 71 percent that of the average nonhispanic family that 
figure had fallen to 66 percent by 1988 
the center found 28 percent of hispanics had incomes placing 
them in the poorest onefifth of households in 1987 eleven percent 
of hispanic households had incomes that put them in the wealthiest 
onefifth that year 
the report came two weeks after the center reported a postworld 
war ii high in the earnings gap between poor and rich americans 
the top 20 percent of households will receive as much aftertax 
income this year as the other 80 percent combined the center said 
the center on budget and policy priorities is a nonprofit 
research organization financed by foundations that studies 
government spending programs and policies affecting low and 
moderateincome americans

mayor david dinkins on monday ordered the hiring 
of 1058 new police officers for expanded street patrols to combat 
what he called a surge in violence citywide 
among the recent incidents that have put dinkins under pressure 
have been the slayings of four children by stray bullets and the 
killings of a 14yearold boy and a greenwich village executive in 
addition 19 cab drivers have been killed this year 
on monday a sleeping baby was wounded when a bullet went 
through the wall of his apartment the bullet cracked his skull but 
didnt penetrate his brain said judy murphy a spokeswoman for st 
lukes hospital police had no suspects 
the mayor said he scraped scratched and squeezed to find 
24 million in the justpassed 278 billion fiscal 1991 city 
budget to pay for the new officers the police force now numbers 
26000 
among the cuts are 46 million from reserves and overhead at 
city schools 41 million from city hospitals 28 million from 
cityowned residential buildings and 15 million from the 
transportation department 
the first group of new recruits will enter the police academy in 
october and should graduate by april when the second class of 
recruits enters the program 
speaking in brooklyns east new york section which had the most 
homicides in the city last year dinkins said his goal is not 
simply a larger police force 
we want to reduce the rate of violent crime he said to 
accomplish that we must do more than simply arrest the criminals 
we must also keep them off the streets 
toward that end dinkins also authorized 43 million more for 
the district attorneys probation offices and other criminal 
justice agencies 
most of the 1058 new officers will be assigned to walk beats 
dinkins said last month more than 1100 officers were shifted 
from specialized units into seven highcrime precincts an 
additional 200 senior officers were assigned to overtime duty in

while the united states was moving on diplomatic 
economic political and military fronts against iraq the soviet 
union was working its own diplomatic channels on monday and keeping 
its options open 
the official news agency tass said deputy foreign minister 
alexander belonogov met for a second day with iraqs ambassador 
here ghafil jassim hussein it said they discussed iraqs invasion 
of kuwait but gave no details 
belonogov also met monday with kuwaits ambassador in moscow 
abdulmokhsin yusef alduadj 
the soviets were also pursuing an end to the crisis in diplomacy 
at the united nations where belonogov previously served as soviet 
representative 
no sign emerged that the soviets were working militarily with 
the united states against iraq 
however stanislav kondrashov a soviet commentator on foreign 
policy said no options were ruled out 
in a frontpage article in the government daily izvestia 
kondrashov wrote by no means is the soviet union automatically 
giving its consent to everything that could be done in washington 
but so far it has not hindered the freedom of us actions by 
not defining beforehand the line beyond which the coincidence of 
our positions could end 
that appeared to keep soviet options open further than indicated 
by foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on friday 
as for military intervention the soviet union has no plans 
no operations shevardnadze said when asked if the kremlin 
planned any military action in connection with iraqs invasion he 
spoke in moscow after making a joint call with us secretary of 
state james a baker iii for a world arms embargo against iraq 
the soviet union iraqs biggest arms supplier stopped weapons 
deliveries last week 
soviet security interests are not threatened as much as those of 
the united states and other western countries but there are 
humanitarian concerns shevardnadze said 900 soviets are in kuwait 
and 7000 to 8000 are in iraq and that very very severe 
consequences would result if they are harmed 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president francois 
mitterrand of france spoke about the crisis by phone saturday 
soviet media reported 
kondrashov kept up the soviet medias harsh criticism of 
onetime ally iraq he said a 1972 friendship and cooperation 
treaty between baghdad and moscow which involved military aid was 
a holdover from the epoch of global eastwest confrontation

here is a transcript of remarks monday at the 
white house by president bush british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner on the 
situation in kuwait 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
president bush this was basically a chance to have a photo to 
show that we were having this very these very important 
consultations 
i might say that we are very encouraged all of us by the 
action taken in the united nations a strong resolution up there 
that shows i think that the world is united against the kind of 
aggression that weve witnessed 
but id like to ask our guest the prime minister to say a 
word and then the secretary general who has just arrived and we 
were going to do this differently but now were out here go 
ahead please margaret 
prime minister thatcher may i support the president of the 
united states in saying that the news from the united nations and 
the strength of the vote 13 votes in favor of mandatory 
comprehensive sanctions and no votes against is very good that 
means that it becomes law in all the countries of the world that 
is extremely good 
it also follows the strong support that has been given by the 
european countries in their condemnation of the action of saddam 
hussein in invading kuwait japan also condemned strongly and so 
did the soviet union so really the world is condemning the action 
and the united nations resolution will become mandatory and mean 
that those sanctions must be enforceable 
i cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly 
together against an action as now and i hope that those sanctions 
will be properly and effectively enforced as a positive action 
against what we all totally and utterly condemn 
president bush manfred are you prepared to say a word 
secretary general woerner well i just arrived just a few 
thoughts which we have exchanged my impression is that this is the 
moment for the west to show cohesion determination and to make it 
clear what cannot be accepted in this world and to safeguard its 
own security interests 
q mr president have you received 
president bush thank you all 
q mr president did you hear from saddam today 
q any assurances from saddam hussein that he wont invade 
saudi arabia 
president bush ive had no such assurances directly to me 
and what was the last question we really have to get in you 
all are getting 
q did you get a message a personal message from saddam 
president bush no ive not had a personal 
q do you hope that these sanctions do you in light of these 
sanctions that you can forego a blockade 
president bush these sanctions we need to discuss full and 
total implementation of these sanctions ruling out nothing at all 
these sanctions must be enforced i think the will of the nations 
around the world not just the nato countries not just the ec 
european community not just one area or another the will of 
the nations around the world will be to enforce these sanctions 
and so well leave the details of how we implement it to the 
future but well begin working on that immediately working one 
of the consultations thats going on right now in the oval office 
is just exactly how we go about encouraging others to do that and 
what we ourselves should be doing 
q mr president the oil pipeline the pipeline through saudi 
arabia 
q what did saddam tell the us counselor charge 
president bush off mike these sanctions will be enforced

five west african leaders agreed monday to 
send troops into liberia to impose a ceasefire in that countrys 
civil war 
salim ahmed salim secretarygeneral of the organization of 
african unity told the associated press the leaders were working 
out logistics but he gave no details 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said rebels seized 14 or 15 foreigners in the liberian capital of 
monrovia on monday including one american and moved them to an 
insurgent headquarters outside the city she said the us embassy 
reported that forces of prince johnson the leader of one of two 
rebel factions have seized hostages 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the leaders at 
banjul were considering sending in troops by land from neighboring 
sierra leone and guinea as well as a naval force the troops would 
impose a ceasefire and install an interim government to organize 
free elections according to the sources 
they said the interim government would not include any warring 
party 
the task force would comprise troops from nigeria ghana 
guinea sierra leone and gambia nigeria already has three ships 
one armed with missiles and heavy guns off sierra leone which 
neighbors liberia 
thousands of rebels and sympathizers of liberian rebel leader 
charles taylor rallied in opposition to the plan they gathered in 
monrovia and waved banners reading liberia will be the graveyard 
of foreign aggressors 
taylor told them his forces will resist any foreign 
intervention to the last man the british broadcasting corp 
reported 
the intervention plan was agreed at a summit of the west african 
economic community gambian president sir dawda jawara said in his 
opening address that the world was looking to west african leaders 
to end the liberian war 
we can no longer afford to let the situation deteriorate 
further he said 
most of the 5000 people killed in the war have been civilians 
from the gio or mano tribes which form the backbone of the 
rebellion or from president samuel does krahn tribe and the 
mandingo tribe which also supports doe 
the only liberian at the meeting monday was the rev regis carr 
of the liberian council of churches which with the west african 
economic community had tried to mediate peace talks between the 
rebels and the government 
those talks broke down after doe refused to surrender to rebel 
demands that he step down 
other representatives at the meeting monday were from sierra 
leone nigeria ghana guinea togo and mali 
the heads of state and cabinet members refused to comment on 
their three hours of talks they planned to meet again tuesday 
the african initiative would follow us intervention by 
hundreds of marines who flew into monrovia on sunday from warships 
off liberia to begin evacuating americans and some other foreign 
nationals the operation continued monday without resistance 
a joint african military intervention is unprecedented though 
individual nations have sent in troops to help friendly leaders 
senegal for example sent 3000 troops into gambia in 1981 to put 
down a coup attempt against dir dawda jawara 
both doe and johnson who split from taylors mainstream rebel 
army have appealed for the united states to intervene militarily 
they also have said they would welcome african peacekeepers 
johnson precipitated the us evacuation by threatening to start 
kidnapping foreign nationals monday targeting americans britons 
indians and lebanese he made it clear he wanted to provoke 
military intervention 
taylors opposition to intervention stems from distrust of 
nigeria whose president ibrahim babangida has been a close ally 
of doe 
ms tutwiler said mondays hostages were sent to johnson 
headquarters in caldwell no indication emerged that any hostage 
was harmed nationalities of the nonamerican hostages were not 
disclosed 
cuba warned that the use of us marines in the evacuation is a 
gross interference which could bring grave consequences 
cubas news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico said 
monday that president fidel castro wrote to yoweri museveni acting 
head of the organization of african unity 
the message said cuba condemned the marine action done with 
the wellknown pretext of protecting the lives and property of 
american citizens in monrovia cynically declaring that they would 
stay in the african country as long as necessary

adding yet another theory to the bulging file on 
the assassination of john f kennedy an unemployed texas salesman 
on monday claimed his father was one of three people who killed the 
president 
ricky don white contends his father joined the dallas police 
department in september 1963 to carry out the assassination he 
said his father roscoe white was one of three cia operatives who 
fired the shots 
the cia issued an unusually strong rebuttal to whites claims 
these allegations that this was done on cia orders that 
this guy worked for us and that cia had any role in the 
assassination of president kennedy are ludicrous cia spokesman 
mark mansfield said in washington 
roscoe white never worked for the cia mansfield said 
normally we never confirm nor deny employment but these 
allegations are so outrageous that we felt it necessary and 
appropriate to respond he said 
the fbi said in a brief statement that it had received the same 
information in 1988 but determined that this information is not 
credible 
the warren commission concluded that lee harvey oswald acting 
alone fired the shots that killed kennedy and wounded john 
connally then the texas governor on nov 22 1963 in dallas 
despite the commissions findings conspiracy theories have 
abounded since the assassination 
ricky white said at a news conference that his father also 
killed dallas police officer jd tippit about an hour after the 
assassination tippits killing has been blamed on oswald 
white said his father served in the marines with oswald who he 
said also was part of the conspiracy but fired no shots 
roscoe white died in 1971 from burns suffered in a fire 
ricky white 29 is a former oil equipment salesman from 
midland he made his claims during a news conference at the jfk 
assassination information center a privately run group that 
researches various assassination theories white acknowledged he 
has tried to sell a book or movie on his theory 
white said he drew his conclusions from what he read in his 
fathers diary and from his parents discussion with a minister 
white said he got the diary after his fathers death and never 
showed it to anyone he said the diary disappeared after he talked 
to the fbi about his theory in 1988 
white said his father referred to himself in the diary by a cia 
code name of mandarin and to two other cia operatives 
lebanon and saul white claimed his father was on a grassy 
knoll in front of the presidential caravan and fired two shots that 
struck kennedy according to the diary

the un security council on monday 
imposed broad sanctions against iraq for invading kuwait including 
a ban on trade aimed at cutting off the middle eastern nations oil 
trade and arms supplies 
the 15member council voted 130 to adopt a uscrafted 
resolution calling for the measures in an effort to force iraq to 
unconditionally withdraw its troops from kuwait yemen the 
councils only arab member and cuba abstained 
the resolution which was sponsored by 10 council members said 
the security council is determined to bring the invasion and 
occupation of kuwait by iraq to an end and to restore the 
sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of kuwait 
the measure which takes effect immediately bans all imports 
from iraq and kuwait it also prohibits any activities including 
the transfer of funds that would help iraq and kuwait export their 
goods and forbids loans to the two countries 
if successfully enforced the sanctions could cripple the 
oildependent iraqi economy its sweeping provisions would in 
effect bar un members from importing iraqi oil and oblige turkey 
and saudi arabia to shut down iraqi oil pipelines running through 
their territory 
the iraqis fast losing customers for their oil stopped pumping 
petroleum on monday through one of their two pipelines that run 
through turkey to the mediterranean they reduced the flow in a 
second pipeline there 
turkish president turgut ozal in an interview with abc news 
had indicated that turkey would close down the pipeline completely 
once the security council adopted the sanctions resolution we 
will obey the un embargo ozal said 
the resolution also bans the sale or supply of any commodities 
or products to iraq and kuwait which would include weapons and 
military supplies 
the only exceptions to the trade embargo under the resolution 
were for such items as food and medical supplies in special 
humanitarian circumstances 
president bush praised the councils decision and called for 
full and total implementation of these sanctions ruling out 
nothing at all 
he told reporters at the white house these sanctions must be 
enforced 
it was only the third time in its 45year existence that the 
world body had voted sanctions against a member state in 1967 the 
security council voted similar comprehensive sanctions against the 
white minority government of rhodesia a mandatory un arms 
embargo against south africa approved in 1977 is still in effect 
the sanctions are legally binding on all un members although 
past council resolutions have often been ignored or flouted the 
united nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on 
members to take military action against iraq or impose a blockade 
british prime minister margaret thatcher speaking to reporters 
at andrews air force base outside washington said britain and its 
allies will consider a naval blockade of iraq if the un sanctions 
prove ineffective 
the vote followed similar sanctions imposed on iraq by much of 
the west including the united states japan and the european 
community the soviet union and china said they would halt arms 
shipments to iraq 
at mondays council session us ambassador thomas pickering 
accused iraqi president saddam hussein of plunging into crisis 
the strategically critical area of the persian gulf 
iraq must learn that its disregard for international law will 
have crippling political and economic costs including but not 
limited to arms cutoffs pickering said 
iraqi ambassador abdul alanbari denounced the sanctions and 
accused the united states of pressuring other countries to take 
action against iraq 
one superpower is trying to use the un and the security 
council to realize its objectives as if the security council was 
simply its foreign ministry he said 
the iraqi ambassador said the sanctions resolution would only 
exacerbate the crisis and impede iraqi troop withdrawals from 
kuwait which baghdad says have already begun the united states 
has disputed iraqs claims about the troop withdrawal 
before the vote kuwaits ambassador mohammad abulhasan called 
the invasion a threat to international security and said strong 
un action was needed to protect small nations against aggression 
you are representing the conscience of the world he told 
the council now it is your responsibility by proving to the 
whole world that the security of nations be it big ones or small 
is not a commodity for sale or for terrorism or for threats 
security council members had been discussing possible sanctions 
for days after passing a resolution condemning iraq on thursday 
just hours after iraqi troops moved into kuwait 
the council includes the five permanent members with veto power 
the united states soviet union china britain and france the 10 
nonpermanent members are canada colombia cuba ethiopia 
finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and zaire

british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
monday that britain and its allies will have to consider mounting a 
naval blockade of the persian gulf if united nations sanctions 
against iraq prove ineffective 
britain she said had ordered two frigates to join its twoship 
persian gulf patrol 
mrs thatcher said she was heartened by the overwhelming vote by 
which the un security council adopted a comprehensive ban on 
trade with iraq and kuwait and expressed confidence that the 
sanctions will work 
mrs thatcher spoke after meeting with president bush on her way 
home from a colorado vacation she said the un sanctions follow 
one of the most complete condemnations we have seen for a very 
long time 
she said other past sanctions including one against rhodesia 
now the african nation of zimbabwe could not be effective because 
they did not have comprehensive backing by the world community 
but she said the world clearly agrees that iraqi president 
saddam husseins military seizure of kuwait is the act of an 
aggressor that must be stopped 
speaking of the un sanctions she said i see great 
determination and great perseverance that that resolution will 
work 
asked about the possibility of a naval blockade to reinforce 
un sanctions the prime minister said the first priority is to 
ensure that the sanctions are effective by themselves 
but if britain the united states and the world community 
concluded that a blockade was a vital next step you would have 
to consider such action she said 
she said britain has one warship and an associated supply ship 
already in the persian gulf and that two additional frigates one 
in mombassa kenya and the other in malaysia will reach the gulf 
by sunday 
if it comes to considering blockades then of course we would 
have to consider those she said if not we will have to 
consider joint action such as a blockade

conversations between a psychologist 
and two brothers after their parents were slain can be allowed as 
evidence in the brothers murder case a judge ruled monday 
superior court judge james albracht said the psychologist l 
jerome oziel had believed erik and lyle menendez made threats 
during their psychotherapy sessions with him and it was necessary 
to disclose their conversations to prevent danger 
albracht said that such a threat constitutes an exception to the 
psychologistpatient privilege and the exception applies to all 
taped conversations between the brothers and their therapist 
the tapes of counseling sessions concern the brothers 
emotional and psychological state after the murder of their 
parents albracht said 
the brothers are charged with shooting to death their parents 
jose and kitty menendez in the familys beverly hills mansion last 
aug 20 
prosecutors say the gruesome shotgun slayings were prompted by 
the brothers greedy hurry to collect their parents 14 million 
fortune jose menendez was president of live entertainment a video 
production company 
erik 19 and lyle 22 who have pleaded innocent remain in 
jail without bail they could face the death penalty if convicted 
the murders in the heart of plush beverly hills remained a 
mystery for six months until police arrested the brothers at one 
point there were rumors menendez and his wife were victims of a 
mafia execution 
there was a stunned gasp in the courtroom from the menendez 
family as the judge announced his ruling 
the grandmother aunts and uncles of the defendants have 
attended all of the hearings erik and lyle menendez clad in blue 
jail uniforms exchanged glances with their relatives as they were 
led in and out of court 
if the judges ruling is upheld it brings a virtual end to the 
psychotherapistpatient privilege said defense attorney leslie 
abramson 
albracht did not give the legal basis for his ruling and said he 
would seal his written opinion until aug 15 he said defense 
attorneys could seek an appeals court order before that to have the 
decision sealed permanently 
defense lawyers claiming the conversations are privileged said 
they would appeal to prevent the tapes from being used in the 
brothers prosecution 
he said the law required that the tapes be kept confidential and 
that even the prosecutors could not hear them or know what was in 
them until the matter was resolved 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney elliott alhadeff said 
he felt the tapes contained very important evidence but it is 
not crucial to the case the judge said months of hearings on the 
issue were exceptionally complex 
ms abramson said albracht based his ruling on a recent court 
decision that held that if a psychotherapist discusses a patients 
statements with someone else the privilege disappears 
but other courts have held that the privilege belongs to the 
patient not the therapist she said 
the therapist cannot simply be a gossip or a liar which we 
claim in this case to make the privilege disappear she said 
in my opinion dr oziel was less than credible with this court

the tanks of a barge that spewed oil into the 
houston ship channel were cleaned monday so the vessel can be cut 
up and moved out of the way of ship traffic and crews scooped up 
oil patches that washed ashore 
twoway traffic cant resume in the houston ship channel until 
the barge is removed 
an estimated 700000 gallons of oil spilled into the vital 
galveston bay on july 28 when a tanker collided with two barges in 
the ship channel 
cleanup crews scoured the barges emptied tanks monday 
we want to get whatever oil is on it off of it we dont want 
to cut it open and have a minioil spill added to what weve 
already got coast guard chief warrant officer rick meidt said 
the tanks also must be cleaned of oil because a spark from 
cutting torches could set off an explosion the coast guard said 
the channel was open monday to twoway barge traffic but 
deepdraft ships could only travel one way because the coast guard 
is concerned their wakes could disrupt the salvage operations 
a few heavy patches of oil remained to be cleaned up along the 
shoreline and a light sheen floated about two miles into the bay 
theres not much oil out there right now meidt said the 
heavier concentrations are just splotches here and there along the 
shore 
i think thats good because the heavy stuff is right at the 
shoreline where it can be collected by the vacuum trucks the sheen 
is more susceptible to natural breakdown meidt said most of 
the oil that was in the water that was visible is gone its been 
picked up by vacuum trucks 
the oil stained several beaches oil also seeped into some 
marshes and collected around several residential docks but 
officials said it had not washed into additional marshes breeding 
grounds for much sea life 
crews used vacuum trucks again monday to clean up the remaining 
oil that has washed ashore 
more than 316000 gallons of an oilandwater mixture has been 
picked up so far meidt said 
crews also sprayed oilgobbling microbes on an oiltainted marsh 
area south of cedar bayou said petty officer scott campbell the 
microbes were sprayed on another marsh area sunday and a beach last 
week 
the microbes used in a process call bioremediation reduce the 
oil to a fatty emulsion that is eaten by marine life when the oil 
is gone the microbes die 
the cleanup is expected to last about a week and the total cost 
is estimated at 5 million coast guard capt thomas greene said

the party would seek a vote in the east german parliament on 
wednesday that would set sept 15 as the deadline for unification 
the coalition question is not the decisive one said 
thierse the decisive question is what can be done for the people 
of the ddr east germany 
the conflict had threatened to break up de maizieres broad 
coalition government and further fuel the political economic and 
social upheaval in the young democratic nation 
oskar lafontaine the west german social democrats candidate 
for chancellor said a catastrophic situation has developed in 
east germany 
he told reporters the best way to rescue east germans is forging 
unity as quickly as possible 
lafontaine said quickly joining east germany to west germany 
would make kohls government responsible for the ddr and for 
what the social democrats say are mistakes by kohl that have led up 
to east germanys problems 
the federal chancellor has nothing else on his mind but 
becoming chancellor of all germany but that is not the question 
said lafontaine adding the important task is to worry about the 
welfare of all germans 
at the heart of the debate is an intense political struggle by 
parties jockeying to use unification to their political advantage 
in united german elections 
it is up to east germany to enact unification that will be done 
when its parliament approves a clause in the west german 
constitution allowing it to join its bigger neighbor 
the social democrats began pressing for quick unification last 
week after kohl and de maiziere called for united german elections 
to be moved up from dec 2 to oct 14 
the social democrats believe voters will start turning against 
kohl as conditions in east germany worsen and therefore see a 
later election date but early unification as their best chance 
to defeat him 
the two german social democratic parties are closely allied 
they are the leading opposition in west germany and the 
secondlargest faction in de maizieres striferidden coalition 
kohls christian democrats and the social democrats seemed to be 
moving toward a compromise on an election date 
social democrats said holding allgerman elections on nov 18 is 
one possibility kohl is to meet with leaders of the west german 
social democrats on tuesday in bonn to discuss their disagreements 
but a spokesman for kohl dieter vogel said the chancellor was 
not ready to accept any compromise on the election date the 
chancellor assumes the date will be oct 14 said vogel 
the head of the german trade union the largest labor 
association in west germany with more than 8 million members also 
pressed for immediate unity 
labor association chief heinzwerner meyer said the july 1 
economic unification of the germanys when east germany made a 
virtual overnight transition from socialism to a free market 
happened too quickly and will have disastrous effects 
ig metall a west german metal workers union and west germanys 
largest individual labor union also called for immediate unity

justify an attack on iraq iraqi troops invaded kuwait on thursday 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the defense of saudi arabia is of paramount concern he said 
cheney was in jiddah to discuss the possible iraqi threat and 
appropriate ways to defend saudi arabia 
one us military official requesting anonymity said cheneys 
talks with the saudis are crucial to us hopes of halting further 
iraqi aggression the official said it would be impossible to carry 
out a major air strike in the persian gulf without overflight or 
landing rights from friendly nations in the region 
cheneys talks with the saudis centered on direct us 
assistance in the event of a fullscale iraqi invasion as well as 
options for possible ussaudi military cooperation 
cheney was also to confer with prince sultan saudi defense 
minister and other senior officials with cheny were lt gen h 
norman schwarzkopf chief of the us middle east force known as 
the central command richard gates deputy national security

foreign ministers of the small arab states around the persian gulf 
were to meet tuesday in jiddah but it was not confirmed they would 
meet with cheney 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization also came to jiddah on monday following his talks 
with saddam in baghdad and with president hosni mubarak of egypt in 
alexandria 
the plo and libya said they were pursuing a joint peace plan but 
released no details 
cairo papers briefly referred to that plan as having four 
points iraq would withdraw iraq would receive economic aid the 
kuwaiti people alone must choose their government and egypt saudi 
arabia the united arab emirates jordan iraq and yemen would 
create an arab force to protect persian gulf waterways and 
coordinate passage through them 
the united nations voted on monday to impose sweeping sanctions 
on iraq which invaded kuwait early thursday 
the official saudi press agency denied reports that the kingdom 
called a general mobilization and was reinforcing its military 
along the borders 
but witnesses reported intense air activity overnight near the 
airport area in riyadh the saudi capital oil executives at 
khafji reached by telephone from bahrain said the saudis were 
bolstering their forces near the kuwait border 
residents speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
deployments were a precaution to defend oilfields run by the 
arabian oil co a consortium of saudi kuwait and japanese 
companies 
its calm down here said one japanese oil executive 
there is no shooting anywhere but the saudis are reinforcing 
their defenses 
khafji is a small city in northeastern saudi arabia on the gulf 
its port has oil loading and berthing facilities for small tankers 
and freighters 
travelers from the area said saudi tanks were sighted moving 
northward on saturday possibly to areas near khafji

second night of the invasion about half a mile from the saudi 
border checkpoint at khafji 
the border was closed 
gulfbased diplomatic sources also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said no indications surfaced of any significant crossing

invasion of kuwait 
security officials at the khafji post in the divided zone said 
iraqi troops were making minor incursions into saudi territory and 
then politely retreating with apologies 
kuwaits borders with saudi arabia run halfway through the 
socalled divided zone a new name for what used to be called the 
neutral zone 
under a 1988 agreement saudi arabia and kuwait agreed to draw 
their border through the neutral zone but to share the revenues of 
the oil field that straddles it

the justice department said monday it would 
prosecute any antitrust violations it finds in the oil and 
gasoline price runup and its looking for them 
the energy department meanwhile noted that consumers could 
reduce pressure on prices by conservation 
a joint statement by the justice energy and transportation 
departments expressed concern over sharp increases in petroleum 
prices that saw average gasoline pump prices rise by about 10 
percent since thursday according to an american automobile 
association survey 
we will look closely for any indication that these increases 
may be the reult of anticompetitive activity said james f 
rill assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust 
division according to the statement 
such activity will be met with vigorous antitrust 
prosecution he said 
w henson moore deputy energy secretary said his departments 
energy information administration is monitoring the commerical oil 
market hourly to track any sharp fluctuations in the marketplace 
and would share its findings with the justice department 
the domestic and international markets are reacting as one 
would expect to uncertainty about future petroleum supplies 
moore said while this reaction is normal the fact remains that 
oil stocks at home and abroad are at record high elevls we 
believe that the oil industry should not be carried away by 
speculation about future events 
moore also said consumer efforts to conserve can contribute 
to reducing immediate demand pressures 
we just do not understand the basis for the price increases 
seen in the last several days transportation secretary samual 
skinner told the american bar associations annual convention in 
chicago 
the statement quoted him as urging transportation companies 
not to overreact 
several airlines have raised ticket prices on their grounds 
their fuel costs suddenly were rising out of control 
the early evening threedepartment statement followed a day of 
congressional outcry and hasty scheduling of hearings for tuesday 
sen richard bryan dnev said oil companies have gone on a 
feeding frenzy despite nearrecord oil stocks the oil 
companies are playing the old game heads they win tails you 
lose he said 
bryan scheduled a hearing before the senate commerce consumer 
subcommittee rep philip sharp dind called a similar session 
before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on energy and 
power he chairs 
sharp also called on bush in cooperation with allies to dampen 
price increases by releasing crude oil from the 90day emergency 
supply stored by the government in louisiana and texas 
the strategic petroleum reserve has to be used to make sure 
shortages dont show up to short the market and protect the 
consumer said sharp 
moore last week ruled out such a course saying the reserve was 
not meant to dampen price fluctuations 
seventeen senators signed a letter circulated by sen joseph 
lieberman dconn asking bush to establish an emergency oil price 
task force to focus public scrutiny on the industry

iraq stopped pumping oil on monday to one 
of two pipelines running through turkey and reduced crude running 
through the other as a world embargo shrank the iraqi market 
the united nations voted to clamp an embargo on iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil as part of broad sanctions to punish iraq for its 
invasion of kuwait president turgut ozal in an interview with abc 
news had indicated earlier that turkey would stop transporting 
iranian oil if the security council adopted the sanctions 
we will obey the un embargo ozal said to abc news 
one turkish government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said iraqs decision to curtail oil on its own came as 
a great relief 
even before the un sanctioons the united states had been 
pressuring turkey to cut off the pipeline flow 
the white house announced that us secretary of state james a 
baker iii will travel to turkey a member of nato this week for 
consultations on the crisis set off by iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
thursday 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran also was sending a special 
emissary to ankara for similar talks ozals office said 
vural oktay director of the staterun turkish pipeline company 
botas said pumping stopped at one pipeline at 6 pm iraq reduced 
flow in the second larger pipeline to 70 percent of capacity he 
told reporters 
the united states the 12nation european community and japan 
were among countries that had earlier imposed an embargo on iraqi 
oil purchases 
they said that before iraqs decision was announced a norwegian 
tanker waiting at the terminal to load crude for britain sailed 
away empty 
iraq acted a day after a highlevel envoy of president saddam 
hussein visited turkey and talked with ozal and prime minister 
yildirim akbulut 
asked if the official mentioned the plan for oil reduction 
akbulut told reporters monday he said they had some measures 
they were planning to take and it appears this was one of them 
akbulut did not elaborate 
in the talks sunday turkey demanded iraqs unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait and reinstatement of kuwaits deposed rulers 
on monday foreign minister ali bozer again asked iraq to heed 
world reaction and restore kuwaits sovereignty and territorial 
integrity 
the two pipelines run parallel for 620 miles from oilfields in 
northern iraq to a terminal in yumurtalik on the mediterranean 
iraqs daily output is reportedly 27 million barrels of which 
15 million barrels would flow through turkey now only about half 
that amount will be pumped through the turkish connection a botas 
official reported speaking on condition of anonymity 
the shutdown of kuwaits oil export facilities followed by the 
reduction in iraqi output is expected to cause a shortfall in the 
world market of at least 4 million barrels daily oil experts have 
said 
turkey will have no problems the botas chief said monday 
because it had completed most of its purchases from iraq this year 
and has another part in storage tanks at the terminal 
turkey purchased 60 percent of its oil imports from iraq last 
year this year turks diversifying their oil sources reduced the 
iraqi share to 40 percent

the growing antiiraq economic embargo produced its first 
results monday when turkish officials reported that the iraqis 
fast losing customers for their oil stopped pumping petroleum 
through one of two pipelines that cross turkey and reduced the 
flow in the second 
a total cutoff of iraqi oil flow through turkey and saudi arabia 
is key to squeezing saddams government economically the 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said in london 
he said he believed the saudis and turks would take that step 
once the un security council ordered a total embargo 
in an interview with abc news before the embargo vote turkish 
president turgut ozal indicated turkey would close down the 
pipeline completely if the un sanctions were ordered we will 
obey the un embargo ozal said 
a flurry of diplomatic contacts continued among middle eastern 
governments trying to defuse the explosive situation

trying to mediate a peaceful end to the crisis arrived in damascus

a mausoleum wall in one of the citys old 
cemeteries collapsed under the battering of a violent storm 
scattering bricks and the contents of dozens of tombs across a 
garden district sidewalk 
the storm sunday night knocked out a 30foot stretch of the 
plastered wall in lafayette cemetery no 1 across the street from 
commanders palace one of new orleans premier restaurants 
a clutter of bricks skulls bones and coffins pieces cascaded 
10 to 15 feet into the street said bret clesi of save our 
cemeteries a volunteer group that gives tours to raise money to 
restore new orlean cemeteries 
fortunately the wall vaults really havent been used in years 
and years and years clesi said monday 
i would be surprised if theres been a burial in those wall 
vaults in 50 years he said the size is different than modern 
caskets and many were not owned to begin with the cemetery was 
almost deserted by the 1950s 
the cemetery a cityowned owned national historic landmark was 
opened in the early 1850s only three standing graveyards are 
older and all are owned by the archdiocese of new orleans clesi 
said 
the wall contains a honeycomb of about 1000 vaults roughly big 
enough to slide a coffin into about 50 of the tombs were exposed 
by the collapse new orleans which is below sea level buries its 
dead above ground 
most of the vaults in the wall were used in the 19th century as 
temporary rental space until a family tomb could be built or 
opened clesi said 
there was a sort of rule that tombs could not be opened within 
a year and a day after the last burial he said so if someone 
in a family died six months after a funeral the family could rent 
one of these vaults and use it as a receiving vehicle until the 
tomb could be opened 
city officials attributed the damage to lightning but clesi 
said he believed the wall was buckling before the storm pounded new 
orleans with rain and hail knocked down tree branches around the 
city and battered the air with nonstop thunder and lightning 
i suspect they were watersoaked from the downpour vibration 
from the thunder may have done it i sort of doubt it was in 
fine form and a bolt of terrific lightning sheared it away in one 
stroke he said 
the marble headstones inside the cemetery were undamaged and 
there appeared little damage to the concrete and brick vaults 
themselves 
only seven of the tombs were marked the rest had been closed in 
with plain marble tombstones in the 1960s and 70s because the 
original stones were broken past repair 
the most recent burial date was 1914 the others were all in the 
middle to late 19th century including five family members who died 
from 1848 to 1888 
save our cemeteries has been trying for five years to persuade 
the city to turn over maintenance of the cemetery to the volunteer 
group

panic over the persian gulf plunged the stock market in its 
worst oneday dip in almost a year monday and gasoline station 
owners officials and consumer groups accused the major oil 
companies of exploiting the crisis by jacking up prices 
oil prices soared to a fiveyear high and stock markets were 
shaken by panicky selling sparked by fears the consequences of the 
crisis could topple the teetering us economy into recession 
the dow jones average fell 9332 points to 271634 its 
steepest decline since oct 13 1989 when the widely watched 
market barometer fell 19058 points the tokyo market fell sharply 
for the third straight day upon opening tuesday 
companies and some anlaysts attributed the soaring gasoline 
price increases over the weekend to higher costs fluctuations on 
the frenetic oil markets and added demand during the summer driving 
season 
this whole damn thing stinks to high heaven said rocco 
gentilella a gulf service station operator in freeport ny why 
are they able to get away with it by raising the price of gas the 
way they have 
theres no shortage of crude oil theres no shortage of 
gasoline said lee lauer who heads a group of service station 
dealers in kansas and missouri its just a thing the refiners 
are doing to make extra profits 
random checks of gas stations around the country showed gasoline 
prices at the pump rising as much as 14 cents per gallon since iraq 
seized kuwait on thursday prices for home heating oil also have 
risen sharply 
the american automobile association said the average cost of 
selfservice unleaded gasoline increased 111 cents from last 
thursday to 1186 per gallon including a 71cent jump over the 
weekend 
the interstate commerce commission said the average price of 
diesel fuel based on a check of 16 stations nationwide rose 86 
cents to 1186 per gallon monday from last tuesday 
the american trucking associations representing 4000 motor 
carriers and trucking organizations asked the icc for authority to 
raise freight rates on one days notice because of higher diesel 
fuel prices increases normally are allowed only on seven days 
notice 
pan american world airways announced a 10 percent fare increase 
on all its flights to offset rising jet fuel costs northwest 
airlines announced an 8 per ticket fuel surcharge on friday 
state officials in massachusetts new hampshire new york 
texas north carolina new jersey and pennsylvania said they would 
investigate allegations of price gouging by oil companies in 
washington a house panel set a hearing tuesday on the price jumps 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said his department 
would gather information in the coming days about the rapid hikes 
we just do not understand the basis for the price increases 
seen in the last several days skinner told the american bar 
associations annual convention in chicago 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it is not clear 
that all of the increases that have been reported at the consumer 
level are necessary 
gas station owners say they have little influence over prices 
set by gasoline distributors and refineries owned by the major oil 
companies 
they contend the oil companies shouldnt be increasing their 
prices immediately because the higherpriced crude from the middle 
east can take up to 90 days to reach the refineries and 
theoretically the costs shouldnt be passed to consumers until then 
oil companies note that crude oil prices have shot up 
drastically since last month and the iraq invasion of kuwait is 
only the latest reason prices for the benchmark grade of crude 
exceeded 28 a barrel monday vs 16 a barrel in early july 
it was the highest level for the west texas intermediate crude 
grade since august 1985 when the price reached 2808 per barrel 
 
but retail prices have gone up much less texaco inc 
spokeswoman anita larsen said refiners are not yet recovering in 
the marketplace a significant portion of crude oil cost increases 
that theyve already incurred 
an embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil by the united states and 
europe has reduced world oil supplies and increased demand raising 
more pressure on prices in addition us oil companies now 
purchase large amounts of gasoline on spot markets for 
immediate delivery where prices can move rapidly 
the marketplace is reacting to uncertainties in the nearterm 
supply situation resulting from the iraqi invasion and the 
sanctions exxon corp said in a statement 
industry officials said companies also are increasing the price 
at the pump now to cover for higher cost of replacing crude oil in 
the future if crude prices fall 
this is not a major oil company phenomenon at all said 
energy industry analyst trilby lundberg it is a general refining 
capacity crunch in the summertime that ordinarily wouldnt hit 
us this hard except for the invasion of kuwait 
citizen action a washington consumer group claiming more than 1 
million members called the pump price increases blatant acts of 
economic aggression by large companies profiteering at a time 
of international tension

a radioactive waste storage tank that 
officials at the hanford nuclear reservation fear might explode 
belched hydrogen gas and the level of waste inside dropped 
officials said monday 
workers had been preparing to take a sample of the tanks 
contents but were waiting for the complex chemical reactions inside 
to create a burp to vent off hydrogen said westinghouse 
hanford co spokesman mike berriochoa 
tank 101sy which is one of 177 tanks at hanford containing 
waste from the production of plutonium for hydrogen bombs vented 
at 530 am sunday according to a company statement 
no environmental contamination occurred the company said the 
gas is released through filters that trap any radioactivity 
company officials have said 
the venting caused waste in the 1 milliongallon tank to drop 
from a depth of 416 inches to about 411 inches by sunday evening 
and a slower decline continued said berriochoa 
thats why we waited until after the burping so we didnt 
risk running into a hydrogen bubble berriochoa said 
the tanks at the reservation in southcentral washington are 
managed by westinghouse for the department of energy 
earlier this year hanford officials said a buildup of hydrogen 
ammonia and nitrous oxide in 20 of the 177 tanks had the potential 
to cause a fire or explosion 
efforts to reduce the danger have been stymied by a lack of 
knowledge about the chemical reactions occurring inside the tanks 
last week ron bliss westinghouse vice president for waste 
management said the company planned to insert a probe into tank 
101sy soon to gather waste samples that will take months to 
analyze 
venting has been occurring about every eight weeks and dates 
from 1979 westinghouse said the last venting occurred in april 
tank 101sy is believed to contain the greatest hydrogen buildup 
because it has the greatest fluctations in waste depth bliss has 
suggested that might be the result of experiments in which large 
amounts of liquid were removed from the tank in the late 1970s in 
an effort to increase its storage capacity 
department officials have said the hydrogen buildup comes from 
organic matter in the tanks decaying leaving the gas trapped 
beneath a hard crust on the surface of the waste 
the doublewalled tank has been under continuous scrutiny since 
the hydrogen buildup problem was announced in march 
the risk of ignition of the hydrogen is considered to be 
low westinghouse repeated in its latest statement 
a critical report last week by the energy departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety raised questions of whether 
the risk of an explosion was as low as officials have contended 
in a letter to energy secretary james watkins panel chairman 
john ahearne declined to characterize the risk of an explosion 
because of the lack of information ahearne said no one knows what 
chemical combinations are in the tanks and that unreliable 
temperature sensors may be misleading

the discovery of the bodies of two slain 
israeli teenagers prompted hundreds of jews to take to the streets 
monday hurling rocks and yelling threats during antiarab riots 
at least 22 people were reported injured 
earlier in the day search teams discovered the stabbed and 
bound bodies of the two israeli teenage hitchhikers in a dry river 
bed in jerusalem police said they suspect the two were killed by 
arab nationalists 
the riots that followed were the worst antiarab unrest since 
spring 1989 when two israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed by 
arabs 
israel army radio estimated that 10000 jews were involved in 
rioting around jerusalem most of the antiarab attacks were 
carried out by groups of dozens or hundreds including many 
teenagers and women 
hundreds of angry israelis some chanting death to the 
arabs blocked main highways in several jerusalem 
neighborhoods hurling rocks and cinderblocks at arabowned cars 
the rioting continued into the night with scattered 
stonethrowing incidents and fist fights police bolstered forces 
in the city and canceled all vacations saying they viewed the 
situation as an emergency 
police said 20 to 30 arabs were injured and a jew was also 
hurt they said a police officer was injured in an attack by an 
angry mob seven israeli rioters were detained 
security forces clamped a curfew on one palestinian village and 
searched other villages near where the bodies of the teenagers 
were found but there were no reports of arrests in the slayings 
prime minister yitzhak shamir vowed that our hand will reach 
these mean killers 
this cruel and evil murder is an expression of the deepest 
hate and despair of criminals who wanted revenge because they 
cannot kill all the people of israel shamir added 
teenage volunteers discovered the bodies of ronen karamani 18 
and lior tubul 17 in a dry river bed near the jewish neighborhood 
of ramot in arab east jerusalem 
ramot is just inside the jerusalem city limits and surrounded by 
the west bank villages of beit hanina and beit iksa 
both bodies had multiple stab wounds national police 
commissioner yaacov turner said 
tubul who had a pink towel tied around his mouth ran for about 
70 yards after being stabbed then collapsed and died turner said 
karamani who had his hands tied behind his back was pushed 
after being stabbed he fell and died 
the way they were tied down the way they were stabbed points 
definitely to a political murder turner said there was no 
reason to think that these two normal good teenagers were 
murdered for any criminal reason 
tubul and karamani were last seen saturday evening on the 
outskirts of ramot they had told friends they were headed to the 
west bank settlement givat zeev to visit girlfriends 
turner said this was the second time within a month that 
hitchhiking jewish teenagers had been attacked late last month 
two israeli youths said a palestinian picked them up and tried to 
kidnap them the youths jumped out of the moving car 
the slayings of tubul and karamani brought to 47 the number of 
israelis killed in the 31month palestinian uprising

defense secretary dick cheney held sensitive 
talks with saudi arabian officials monday about us military 
options for defending the oilrich desert kingdom against a 
possible blitzkrieg by iraqi forces massed along its border with 
kuwait 
the us aircraft carrier independence and its escort of a dozen 
warships and supply vessels reached the arabian sea putting the 
naval battle group close enough to launch air strikes against iraq 
and other targets in the persian gulf 
the independence joined the carrier eisenhower cruising in the 
eastern mediterranean in the middle east to guard against the 
possibility of expanded hostilities by iraq which seized kuwait 
last thursday a third us carrier the uss saratoga will leave 
mayport fla on tuesday for the mediterranean 
the defense of saudi arabia is of paramount concern said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater as cheney began 
conferring with saudi officials after an overnight flight from 
washington to jidda 
quite obviously we are discussing a possible threat by iraqi 
forces directly to that country fitzwater said its quite 
clear that would involve appropriate ways to defend their country 
added the white house spokesman we have discussed military 
possibilities and our abilities with all the countries in the 
gulf 
both prime minister margaret thatcher of britain and prime 
minister brian mulroney of canada said after talks with president 
bush that a blockade might prove necessary to halt iraqs oil trade 
the washington post said in tuesday editions that the pentagon 
had sent the white house a proposal for an international naval 
force including vessels from the soviet union to be activated if 
desired to enforce trade sanctions a pentagon spokesman air force 
capt sam grizzle said he had no information on such a proposal 
one us military official who spoke only on condition that he 
not be identified said cheneys talks with the saudis are crucial 
to us hopes of halting further aggression by iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the official said it would be difficult to carry out a major air 
strike in the persian gulf without overflight or landing rights 
from friendly nations in the region 
some assistance is available from bahrain and oman he said but 
those gulf states are loathe to acknowledge cooperation with 
americans such cooperation enabled the reflagging of kuwaiti 
tankers and escorts by us naval vessels during the height of the 
eightyear war between iraq and iran 
both cbs and nbc said in their evening news broadcasts that 
fb111 bombers from us bases in england were seen in turkey at 
incirlik air base some 425 miles from the iraqi border it was 
these planes that bombed libya in 1986 
a pentagon spokesman who was not identified told nbc it was 
coincidence the planes were in turkey asked about the reports 
capt grizzle told the associated press we do not discuss 
operational movements or the alert status of forces particularly 
at a time like this 
other pentagon sources however said the strategic air command 
was conducting a worldwide exercise giant warrior announced 
on july 15 and reports of us bombers in unfamiliar places could 
be expected 
cheneys talks with the saudis centered on direct us 
assistance in the event of a fullscale iraqi invasion as well as 
options for possible ussaudi military cooperation 
cheney accompanied by us army gen h norman schwarzkopf who 
commands us forces in the mideast deputy national security 
adviser robert gates and paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense 
for policy 
fitzwater described the situation in the gulf as extremely 
serious and there was no evidence iraq had fulfilled its promise 
to begin withdrawing its military forces from kuwait on sunday 
officially the pentagon would say only that the independence 
was operating in the indian ocean and was being escorted by eight 
smaller warships and four support ships three additional support 
craft loaded with fuel and food are shifting to the region to boost 
us supply lines officials said 
carriers are outfitted with a range of fa18 hornet jet 
fighters f14 tomcat attack aircraft a6e intruder bombers and 
specially outfitted ka6d jet planes assigned to carry out airborne 
refueling of fighters and bombers 
meanwhile five navy amphibious vessels headed for camp lejeune 
nc to pick up 2100 marines for a rendezvous with the saratoga 
in the mediterranean 
the battleship wisconsin was scheduled to leave norfolk va on 
tuesday to join the saratoga which is expected to take at least a 
week to reach its new duty station 
three other vessels will leave norfolk on tuesday for what an 
atlantic fleet spokesman called previously scheduled 
deployments with the battle group four air squadrons from 
virginia beach will join the saratoga 
altogether the departing naval vessels will be carrying more 
than 15000 sailors and marines 
the eisenhower and its 12 escort ships are steaming in the 
eastern mediterranean pentagon sources said while the eightship 
middle east task force led by the command ship lasalle remains in 
the persian gulf

health maintenance organizations are 
risking patients lives by cutting costs on prescription drugs 
according to a national survey of doctors commissioned by the 
oregon medical association 
cost is affecting quality quality is being sacrificed said 
dr michael graham president of the oregon medical association 
the telephone survey of 700 physicians including 200 in oregon 
was conducted by the gallup organization in january and the results 
were released friday 
graham said monday the survey of cardiologists internists and 
general practitioners showed they were concerned about limits on 
the way they prescribe drugs 
what it amounts to is the hmos and other managedcare 
organizations are restricting the choice of medications graham 
said it restricts the ability of the physician to prescribe 
whats necessary 
graham said nine doctors in the survey reported that a patient 
had died because of costcutting practices by hmos 
i cant give you the details on those nine deaths graham 
said but the physicians felt that the restrictions or lack of 
availability of a drug led to the death of the patient 
he also blamed those practices for slowing the recovery of 
millions of americans suffering from various health problems 
larry freshnock vice president of health care research for 
gallup estimated drug prescription restrictions already may have 
affected 27 million people based on the survey 
however a spokesman for one of the largest hmos in oregon said 
the medical associations claims were exaggerated 
this could scare a lot of people said ron morgan spokesman 
for blue cross of oregon which operates health maintenance of 
oregon 
from our experience with these practices we havent seen any 
problem with the quality of care morgan said you have to 
balance cost containment with finding a way to make drugs available 
to everyone but you just dont sacrifice quality of care 
health maintenance organizations attempt to hold down medical 
costs by paying doctors a fixed amount no matter how many services 
they provide rather than a fee for every service managers of hmos 
also try to hold down costs on medical equipment supplies and 
drugs by seeking the least expensive source 
among the restrictions opposed by doctors and cited in the study 
were 
therapeutic drug interchange a policy that requires 
pharmacists to substitute less expensive drugs when possible 
despite differences in chemical ingredients 
prior authorization which requires physicians affiliated with 
hmos or other managedcare plans to obtain approval before 
prescribing certain drugs 
stepcare protocols a practice that forces doctors to 
prescribe drugs in a fixed order using lowerpriced drugs first 
and more expensive or advanced drugs later 
mandatory generic substitution which requires pharmacies to 
substitute chemically identical generic drugs for brandname drugs 
morgan said that therapeutic drug interchange is illegal for 
outpatients in oregon and health maintenance of oregon does not 
use stepcare protocols 
morgan also said the blue cross hmo does not have a mandatory 
generic substitution policy and its formulary is only a recommended 
list 
representatives of other state and national hmos said they could 
not comment on the survey because they had not seen it 
the most common problem resulting from drug policies according 
to the study was slower recovery from illness followed by failure 
of the drug to work other problems cited by doctors in the survey 
were allergic reactions heart problems pain nausea and 
convulsions 
i dont think theyre trying to implicate any particular drug 
or a particular class of drugs graham said the main point of 
the study is that we think that employers and companies should be 
cautious about signing contracts with restrictive policies

scientists in oregon and washington have 
discovered two cases 600 miles apart in which a rare northern 
spotted owl has bred with the more common and aggressive barred 
owl producing a new hybrid 
biologists dont know whether the crossbreeding is an isolated 
quirk of nature or the first sign of evolution into a new owl 
species 
but the barred owl is a much hardier owl and there have been 
concerns that the growth in its range could threaten the survival 
of the spotted owl listed as a threatened species in june 
the first sparred owl was confirmed about two weeks ago near 
mount baker in the northern cascade range in washington said eric 
forsman who leads a us forest service spotted owl research team 
the second was confirmed wednesday east of medford in 
southwestern oregon 
i dont know where its going to lead us forsman said 
nobody does 
the us fish and wildlife services designation of the spotted 
owl as threatened cast doubt on the future of logging in old growth 
forests the birds sole habitat 
the barred owl appears similar to the spotted owl except that 
it is somewhat larger has vertical bars on its chest instead of 
brown and white spots and is paler the more aggressive barred owl 
can live in a variety of forest types 
there are only about 2000 known pairs of spotted owls the 
barred owl is common in the united states and canada 
only in the past 15 or 20 years however has the barred owl 
expanded its range south from british columbia into washington 
oregon and northern california where the spotted owl lives 
the barred owls ability to thrive in logged areas of the 
pacific northwest probably explains its invasion of the region 
biologists say 
that ability its aggressive behavior and similar prey make the 
barred owl a competitor with the potential for cutting the spotted 
owl population a fish and wildlife service review team said in its 
recommendation to designate the spotted owl as threatened 
forsman alerted biologists two weeks ago to the first confirmed 
hybrid a male adult found by washington state biologist tom hamer 
a very strange looking bird forsman wrote he said it 
looked like a pale spotted owl but weighed a little more than 1 
pounds more than a male spotted owl 
his call is intermediate between a barred and spotted owl it 
goes hoo hoohoo hoooawww 
the last note is characteristic of the barred owl forsman wrote

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
july 30aug 6

newspapers should hire minority journalists 
to reflect the countrys racial composition the vice president of 
the national association of black journalists said 
america is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be 
in the future said denise johnson at the associations annual 
convention aug 2 
hiring rates for minorities have increased little in recent 
years according to a report by the american society of newspaper 
editors released at the convention 
the report said that 4 percent of newsroom employees including 
reporters editors artists and photographers were minorities in 
1978 compared with 786 percent this year blacks now account for 
4 percent of the newsroom population the highest percentage among 
all minority groups 
if you look at the percentages and how slowly the industry has 
moved to respond to a very rapidly changing population the 
progress isnt nearly as impressive said johnson an editorial 
writer and columnist for the saint paul minn pioneer press 
the report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the 
united states employ no minorities 
most institutions in this country are still pretty much 
dominated by white middleage males and i think the tendency on 
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and 
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves 
johnson said 
editors surveyed by the asne said the most frequent reasons for 
not hiring more minorities include the lack of qualified journalism 
graduates poor starting salaries and a lack of commitment to 
affirmativeaction hiring 
the study queried more than 300 newspaper editors said 
cornelius foote jr minority affairs director of the asne 
on another front virginia gov l douglas wilder said negative 
media focus on the private lives of black politicians does not mean 
there is a white conspiracy against leading blacks 
recent stories including those on the drug trial of washington 
dc mayor marion barry only leave that impression wilder said 
wilder himself has been the focus of stories saying he has used a 
state helicopter to spend weekends with socialite patricia kluge 
if i thought that there was a conspiracy i couldnt exist 
wilder said i couldnt have existed in the courtroom where 
being an africanamerican lawyer i was asking for justice from a 
jury that was all white and judges who were all white but i found 
justice 
wilder called for journalists to go beyond problems of the black 
community and focus on problems that blacks and whites have in 
common 
we do the public a disservice we limit our perspective if 
we think of ourselves as black officials or as black 
journalists he said

the new york daily news filed suit aug 1 to 
stop the state from intervening in contract negotiations between 
the newspaper and its 10 unions 
the lawsuit in manhattans federal court seeks to dissolve a 
factfinding panel appointed by state labor commissioner thomas 
hartnett to help the two sides reach agreement 
it also asks for a court order stopping the panel from taking 
any immediate action in the labor negotiations 
the unions under the umbrella of the allied printing trades 
council requested the state board of inquiry because they said 
they werent getting a fair shake in the negotiations over 
contracts that expired march 30 
the daily news said actions by the board of inquiry which has 
the power to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence would cause 
substantial and irreparable harm to the newspaper 
this action will exert governmental and public pressure on the 
daily news and the unions in an undue and unwarranted attempt to 
coerce or otherwise improperly influence a resolution of the labor 
dispute and negotiations the lawsuit said

the only black federal judge in the city 
accused the pittsburgh press of being racist by trying to force him 
from the bench 
senior us district judge paul simmons made the accusation 
during a hearing july 26 in which he was asked by john bingler 
attorney for the press to remove himself from a lawsuit against 
the paper the pittsburgh press obtained a copy of the transcript 
of the 35minute hearing 
i think its a case of pure racism thats what i think 
simmons said during the hearing the way ive been treated is 
just scandalous by the pittsburgh press 
he criticized the newspaper and bingler before agreeing to 
remove himself from the case 
alan frank an attorney convicted of tax evasion and fleeing 
pittsburgh to avoid prosecution filed the lawsuit in september 
against the newspaper allegheny county police and a mckeesport 
attorney the lawsuit will be assigned to another judge 
frank charged in his suit that the newspaper libeled and defamed 
him by conspiring with two county detectives to damage his 
reputation by printing a false story that he stole money from his 
son 
in a motion attorneys for the press said the newspaper alleges 
simmons has a personal bias or prejudice against it due to 
articles and editorials which it has published in the past 
the motion cited articles and editorials about the judge 
including an article in april in which he was quoted as accusing a 
woman of being greedy and vengeful for suing her exhusband in a 
childcustody case 
the local bar association filed a complaint in connection with 
the comments the press published an editorial criticizing simmons

some editors are taking a close look at 
a doonesbury comic strip in which a character clad in nothing 
but rope utters provocative language 
frankly it didnt offend me but im thinking of all the 
people out there jim hughes executive editor of the baton rouge 
morning advocatestate times said aug 1 
the strip by gary trudeau features the character jj giving her 
rendition of performance art with a bucket over her head and 
nothing but rope covering her privates 
she speaks in fragmented sentences laced with words with sexual 
connotations such as ooze lubricate and hot juices 
but makes no direct reference to sex acts the strip is scheduled 
for release from aug 6 to aug 11 
the way i read it its an attempt to show the lengths that 
the art community will go to thumb their noses at government 
grants said jack morrissey an associate editor at universal 
press syndicate which distributes the strip to about 1000 
newspapers 
morrissey said trudeau appeared to be referring to controversy 
over national endowment of the arts funding some conservative 
politicians have tried to block government money going to artwork 
they consider obscene 
morrissey said several editors had called with questions about 
taste and the reason behind releasing the strip but no paper 
indicated that it would pull the comic he said

foreign stations accepted money from the ministry in exchange for 
stories favorable to israel packaged as independent news reports

when politicians face a problem issue with no 
easy way out their instincts often create an urge to investigate 
or at least to demand an investigation 
that way they are advocating action even if it isnt a solution 
thats happening now in the savings and loan mess 
the bailout price is going up the voters are getting angry and 
the only solution is to keep spending money congress doesnt want 
to appropriate and taxpayers dont want spent 
but that is the unavoidable bill for decisions made a decade 
ago coming due in a congressional election year so campaigning 
incumbents are being forced into an unpopular position and that 
puts a premium on votes that seem to do something about it 
something like investigating and supporting legislation to 
impose stiff sentences on people convicted of savings and loan 
crimes with life terms for kingpins laws that can apply only to 
future wrongdoing 
as with punishments so with payments the past is not subject 
to reform and the costs estimated as high as 500 billion 
stretch on for years 
the administration has alerted congress that it will need more 
money probably about 100 billion to pay for the savings and loan 
bailout during the budget year that begins oct 1 that is 
particularly uncomfortable timing five weeks before congressional 
elections so it may be handled with a stopgap appropriation until 
early 1991 
that prospect produced a chorus of congressional complaints 
about blank check spending to which robert r glauber the 
treasury official dealing with the sampl crisis replied that the 
blank check was written long ago when deposit insurance was 
boosted to 100000 an account 
that was done by act of congress in 1980 during the carter 
administration then and in another measure enacted in 1982 and 
signed by ronald reagan the rules were changed to let savings and 
loans make investments far more speculative than the home mortgages 
that had been their business 
with more insurance on deposits and less regulation of a 
savings and loan industry that already was having problems the 
meter started running up the costs the taxpayers face now 
when insured institutions fold depositors have to be paid we 
dont really have a choice said l william seidman the man in 
charge of the bailout 
but what cant be changed can be investigated 
so the national governors association adopted a resolution 
urging an investigation of this unprecedented disaster by an 
independent commission 
a measure seeking a commission investigation has been proposed 
in the senate the house approved creation of a milliondollar 
bipartisan commission to investigate the sampl mess as part of a 
bill to speed prosecution and stiffen punishments for sampl crimes 
there were only four votes against it 
the administration didnt like the idea with a white house 
spokesman saying there was no need for a new bureaucratic entity to 
investigate but after the overwhelming house vote the 
administration decided it would not oppose an investigation 
that makes a commission investigation a virtual certainty 
satisfying the political urge to be seen doing something about the 
sampl mess before election time 
a skeptical senator says the findings of an investigating 
commission are predictable and he wonders about its value to the 
taxpayers but hell vote for it anyhow but sen bob kerrey 
dneb said that is less important than knowing what is going on 
today right now in a bailout he contends is being mismanaged 
investigations some by commissions some by congress can and 
have served vital purposes 
the warren commission did so after the assassination of john f 
kennedy even though conspiracy theorists still dispute its finding 
that a lone gunman murdered the president in 1963 
the senate watergate committee discovered the existence of the 
white house tapes that sealed the case against richard m nixon and 
ultimately led him to resign the presidency in 1974 
after the challenger disaster of 1986 the rogers commission 
conducted an inquiry that otherwise would have drawn contentions 
competing investigations in congress 
in the savings and loan debacle said gov james r thompson of 
illinois we already know the answer thompson opposed the 
investigation the governors sought 
he is not running for another term

nostalgic for checkpoint charlie 
miss those snarling east german border guards cold war junkies 
despair not the old days live on in manchester 
the real berlin wall may be vanishing but its english replica 
complete with mocknasty guards stands firm for the tourists at 
granada tv studios in the northwest city 
when it went up two years ago to honor granadas spy series 
game set and match based on the len deighton trilogy its 
architects never dreamed it soon would be old hat 
were keeping it as a piece of history said marina 
efstathiou public relations officer for the 90minute tour of 
granadas sets 
the tour similar to those which have been conducted for nearly 
two decades at universal studios in los angeles has attracted one 
million visitors since it opened for business july 20 1988 
granadas graffitismeared berlin wall hoves into view between 
sherlock holmes baker street and coronation street of british soap 
opera fame the edwardian tram carrying 40 tourists stops and the 
atmosphere becomes bleak 
two men in berlin border guard uniforms board the upper level of 
the tram one of them tall and blond demands my briefcase and 
admonishes me for smiling 
dont laugh he barks in germanaccented english while his 
companion short and dark glowers at his side it will give you 
wrinkles in later life 
returning my briefcase the two move on and the tour resumes on 
foot 
granada which charges 695 pounds about 12 for the tour has 
adapted the wall experience to keep pace with history when the 
cold war was for real there were guard dogs and tourists got 
frisked now such niceties are reserved for corporate clients who 
specially request them 
we used to pick up dad and take him off the tram and children 
would say dont take my daddy away we would threaten to lock 
people up recalled roy stonehouse the yorkshireman who designed 
the tour 
after the wall opened we toned it down obviously he said 
stonehouse said he tried to acknowledge the geopolitical change 
by carving a hole in his wall after the real one opened last 
november 
it wasnt very successful he said it looked as if the 
mice had been at it 
game set and match starring ian holm was a 13hour series 
filmed partly at the real berlin wall and partly on a studio set 
it was the first time permission was given to film on location at 
checkpoint charlie 
the wall serves a practical purpose as well screening off the 
adjacent science and industry museum whose visitors otherwise would 
be able to gaze down at the granada tour for free 
that unpleasant border guard turned out in an interview in the 
replica checkpoint charlie hut to be gareth williams 20 an 
amiable college student 
weve had one or two comments like it doesnt exist 
anymore but theres nothing you can say to that williams 
remarked during a break between tramloads of tourists 
theres a lot of patriotism that comes out people still get a 
buzz out of it said terry holm 26 a drama student at the 
manchester polytechnic theater school 
it seems to me the public are here to be entertained 
basically arent they said williams whose mother is a berliner 
visitors seemed to take this bit of history in stride 
i can handle it said paul russell from basingstoke near 
london 
i enjoyed it said irene macphee a canadian tourist from 
calgary adding i bet theyve had to change their dialogue in 
the last year 
and besides imitation east german guards are nothing compared 
with granadas own security excuse me what paper do you 
represent who have you okd it with snapped a granada official 
who emerged out of nowhere to challenge a reporter taking notes 
after explanations her tone softened we have to be very 
careful because of press leaks she said with a smile and 
vanished

ryoko ishida is dead because she was a few seconds 
late in slipping through the school gate 
television programs provide constant reminders of the tragedy by 
showing the closing of the quarterton gate of the kobe takatsuka 
high school which crushed the 15yearolds skull 
her death caused an outcry by critics who feel japans acclaimed 
secondary education system is far too rigid parents and educators 
generally defend the rules 
miss ishida was killed july 6 by the school gate in kobe a port 
city 270 miles west of tokyo a teacher toshihiko hosoi 39 
pushed the gate shut promptly at 830 am to teach the children a 
lesson about promptness 
hosoi has been fired and charged with professional negligence 
resulting in death other school and education officials have been 
disciplined 
commentators and human rights groups blame the death on 
overzealous application of strict rules 
at a minimum schools require students to wear uniforms these 
often are sailortype dresses for girls and black prussianstyle 
outfits for boys 
some prescribe white socks and even white underwear crewcuts 
for boys and pageboy haircuts for girls with black hair bands 
students at many schools are not allowed to patronize coffee 
shops or obtain drivers licenses rules even describe exactly what 
a student may bring to school and list what is banned such as 
playing cards and hair dryers 
in some schools if you go from your neighborhood to a 
neighborhood where there is another high school you have to bring 
your high school identification card said seiji fujii a writer 
whose frequently criticizes the rules 
enforcement usually is strict teachers patrol neighborhoods 
inspect students at the school gate as they arrive and search book 
bags and luggage 
punishment often ranges from humiliating to violent students 
were buried in sand up to their necks in one recent case and 
corporal punishment is widely practiced although it has been 
illegal since world war ii ended 
teachers often slap punch kick said morikatsu imahashi 
an opponent of corporal punishment who teaches at ibaraki 
university in mito 60 miles northeast of tokyo 
imahashi demonstrated with his hands how teachers sometimes clap 
their hands suddenly over students ears fujii the writer said 
the practice broke the eardrum of a friend 
five deaths from corporal punishment were reported in 19851987 
after a students death in 1988 the education ministry advised 
schools to ease their rules 
a few students have filed lawsuits including a tokyo senior 
expelled from a private high school for waving her hair said 
yasuhiro yoshimine a lawyer active in childrens rights issues 
in kobe where about 30 percent of junior high and high school 
boys are required to wear crewcuts more than 3000 names of 
individuals and groups appeared in a march newspaper advertisment 
against the rule 
rebellion can be costly adverse comments on obedience might 
show up in the secret record that follows a student from grade 
school and helps determine whether he or she will get into high 
school or win a job recommendation 
in japan if the parents insist on their rights they will be 
called strange a problem said yoshimine the lawyer in japans 
homogeneous society being seen as different or a problem is a 
major stigma 
it can be tough said kurumi tanabe a 40yearold mother 
from the mito area i got many letters criticizing me saying the 
idea is bad that i should have my son cut his hair 
kentaro tanabe 14 is one of four in a 1000student middle 
school who refuses to wear a crewcut 
some students crack under the strain newspapers occasionally 
carry reports of students beating their teachers and many who 
refuse to attend school blame strict rules 
strong regulations are popular with teachers and school 
authorities in a 1988 survey 95 percent of middleschool teachers 
responding agreed with the statement that disorderly attire is a 
sign of mental disorder 
atsuo nomura principal of kobe takatsuka told students after 
miss ishida was killed if all of you had woken up 10 minutes 
earlier the teacher would never have had to raise his voice i 
dont mean to put the responsibility on your side but now i still 
want all of you to improve your life habits 
nomura later resigned 
parents generally believe stricter rules mean better 
education said tetsuo tsujimura who directs the education 
ministrys middleschool division and feels some rules are too 
strict 
critics say tough school regulations and rigid curriculums 
suffocate individual differences and hurt japanese education 
strict rules were adopted by schools in the 19th century 
enforcement eased in the 1960s but tightened again in the early 
1980s in response to unruliness among teenagers 
yoshimine and others say the strict regulations reflect 
authoritarian attitudes left over from prewar militarism 
since april the education ministry has required schools to 
display the national flag and play the unofficial national anthem 
both symbols of the prewar years at entrance and graduation 
ceremonies 
news reports have linked rigid education with grisly crimes 
such as the case of four boys who kidnapped raped and beat a high 
school girl then encased her body in a drum of concrete at the 
sentencing last month their lawyer blamed an ailing society 
for the boys actions

imagine john paul and george making music 
without ringo ben little joe and adam running the ponderosa 
without hoss the cowardly lion the tin man and the scarecrow off 
to see the wizard without dorothy 
unthinkable 
would we have loved the beatles the cartwrights and the oz gang 
as trios perhaps but author harold schechter an expert on myths 
in popular culture thinks its likely some of their magic would 
have been lost 
quaternity the mythic union of four characters into a single 
cohesive unit often results in an invincible psychic totality 
says schechter a professor of english at queens college in new 
york 
swiss psychiatrist carl gustav jung defined the special power of 
four in terms of four functions of consciousness working in balance 
and harmony sensation thinking feeling and intuition 
the beatles spoke of themselves as being four parts of a 
single personality schechter says mythically speaking they 
were right 
the literate sardonic lennon stood for thinking harrison 
deeply immersed in eastern mysticism for intuition the romantic 
androgynously pretty paul mccartney for feeling and the clownish 
ringo with his puppydog charm for sensation 
together these four musicians constituted an astonishingly 
creative and dynamic entity separated from one another however 
they seem to have lost most of their artistic power 
other famous foursomes break down as follows schechter says 
sensation was a function shared by hoss the cowardly lion and 
scotty chief engineer of the starship enterprise 
thinking was the role of ben cartwright the scarecrow and the 
logical mr spock 
feeling fell to little joe the tin man and enterprise physician 
bones mccoy 
and intuition was the realm of adam dorothy and captain james

as chairwoman of the japan socialist party ms doi 61 helped 
draw many women into politics last year after veteran politicians 
came under fire for money and sex scandals including the alleged 
keeping of paid mistresses 
the new female politicians made some inroads in their campaign 
against money politics and against a sales tax that squeezed the 
purses of japans traditional family spenders the housewives 
a record 22 women won seats in parliaments upper house in the 
july 1989 elections and 12 were elected to the lower house in 
february before the two elections about half that number were in 
parliament 
seeking to placate angry female voters prime minister toshiki 
kaifu who succeeded two scandaltainted leaders named two women 
to his first cabinet last august 
but kaifus second cabinet named after the february election 
was all male 
females still account for less than 5 percent of parliaments 
764 members and most women legislators belong to the opposition 
which has little chance of passing laws on womens issues in the 
face of the big majority held by the liberal democratic party the 
conservative governing party did not run a single woman candidate 
in last februarys election for the more powerful lower house of 
parliament 
economic trends have done more to create opportunities for women 
than politics 
enterprising female entrepreneurs are finding niches in new 
businesses ranging from computer software engineering to household 
and catering services that have emerged to meet the demands of 
working mothers 
the growing influence of women as consumers both professionals 
and traditional holders of the purse strings is leading companies 
to listen more to women employees and generating new opportunities 
for careeroriented women 
a growing labor shortage also is opening doors especially in 
computerrelated industries says tomoko shibata executive 
director of the japan institute of womens employment 
even if companies dont really want to employ women in 
mainstream jobs they simply have no choice mrs shibata says 
theyre so desperate for good people they feel its worthwhile to 
hire women even if theyre likely to quit when they have families 
japans major electronics companies are energetically recruiting 
female college graduates for specialized technical jobs and some 
are developing child care programs so that those women can return 
to work as soon as possible 
in a groundbreaking decision the managements of those companies 
agreed this spring to labor unions demands for a oneyear unpaid 
leave for childbearing up from the current eight weeks leave 
required by law 
ms higuchi a frequent participant in committees on womens 
issues says she believes such a policy will spread throughout 
japan in the next few years 
but merely providing lengthier maternity leaves will not solve 
the real problems facing the japanese family she says 
japanese companies treat men as if they were bachelors 
without any family responsibilities other than a paycheck they 
might as well be bachelors given their lack of real involvement in 
their families ms higuchi says 
most japanese men spend their waking hours outside the home 
working overtime socializing with business associates and 
commuting two to four hours a day they leave decisions on 
education child rearing and household spending to their wives 
its unnatural for a society to leave no room for families we 
have to make it possible for men to share the responsibility for 
bringing up children ms higuchi says the way things are now 
many married women are virtually running singleparent households

editors note an american missionary family makes its home in 
thailand as protectors of the mlabri one of the worlds smallest 
and most primitive tribes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the spirits of the yellow leaves 
some of the worlds most primitive and timid tribal people have 
found protection from an unlikely source an american missionary 
family 
eugene long his wife mary and their three children have lived 
among the mlabri for nine years 
while their goal is to christianize the longs have yet to bring 
up god or the bible their more immediate task is to ensure the 
tiny tribes survival and bridge a vast gap between these 
huntergatherers and the 20th century 
there are fewer than 200 mlabri in thailand a small number is 
also believed living deep in the forests of neighboring laos the 
thai population has decreased over the past decade and long says 
further shrinkage would probably mean the tribes extinction 
not long ago all yellow leaves roamed the jungles in small 
family groups eating wild fruits roots and any animals they could 
snare or spear in laos they may still live this way 
myths spread about these furtive people who were said to move 
their homes each time the leaves of their flimsy shelters turned 
yellow 
they wore little more than loincloths and used crude implements 
of a prehistoric age their language which has no written form 
identifies just three colors green red and blue does not 
distinguish between a month and a year and provides for a counting 
system that includes only the words for one two and 
many 
the first known outsider to meet and study the group was 
austrian anthropologist hugo bernatzik who made contact in 1937 
danish scholar jesper trier described them as technologically among 
the most primitive people on earth ancient remnants of australoid 
tribes overwhelmed by the great mongoloid migrations into southeast 
asia from the north 
when long first encountered the yellow leaves he had images of 
cannibals feasting on missionaries while some of its members later 
confided they thought he had come to eat them 
his trail to the tribe had been circuitous at 14 long was a 
selfdescribed hood with a police record the turning point 
came after a close brush with death from alcohol abuse 
after graduating from high school near orlando fla he joined 
the new tribes mission which works with remote littleknown 
tribal groups around the world at its school he met his wife who 
is from muscatine iowa and the couple were sent abroad 
the family moved to the hills of phrae province in northern 
thailand their rough wooden home is located in a lovely valley a 
threemile trek from the nearest village 
the house has no refrigerator or window panes and no television 
to distract allen 14 jared 11 and 7yearold crystal from their 
studies done by correspondence staying healthy is a problem long 
has suffered two bouts with malaria 
initially the mlabri which translates as people of the 
jungle came and went their faces would be expressionless the 
women and children would run away when long approached they lied 
or refused to talk about themselves and their culture even after 
the longs became the first known outsiders to speak their language 
the lives of the yellow leaves are ruled by fear fear of 
human enemies tigers disease the spirits of their animist 
world long said they themselves are passive resolution of 
conflict is flight 
but the widespread disappearance of thailands once great 
forests has shut off their escape hatch and most of their 
traditional sources of livelihood waiting for them as they came 
out of the jungles were the hmong a large more aggressive and 
technologically sophisticated tribe 
long says the hmong treat the yellow leaves like slaves 
luring them with pigs their great dietary obsession and then 
forcing them to work off their pork debt under appalling 
conditions and for abysmally low wages 
now 25 of the tribespeople are living in simple leafroofed 
huts on hillsides around the long home and much of their suspicion 
and fear seems to have subsided 
the family provides meals medicine and basic first aid the 
yellow leaves are given wages for work that ultimately benefits 
them 
long paid the equivalent of 750 to acquire squatters rights 
over several hundred acres of land on which the yellow leaves have 
planted fruit trees sunk fish ponds and reforested denuded strips 
of hillside with teak trees pigs are raised 
long is aware of criticism leveled by some anthropologists that 
his kind of involvement leads to detribalization of people like 
the mlabri 
i want to preserve aspects of their culture ideally i would 
want them to live in undisturbed forests and have them come out to 
see us when they needed help he counters 
but that doesnt seem possible now so we want to give them a 
fair chance in todays world in order to be yellow leaves do they 
have to be slaves of the hmong and die of malaria do they have to 
be extinct if so then yes i am ruining them 
unlike some foreign missionaries in thailand the boyish 
35yearold long and his family all of whom have informally taken 
thai names get favorable coverage from the thai press 
long says the support he has received from phrae provincial 
authorities and the thai military has been good although the thai 
government does not have a formal program to help the yellow 
leaves but serious problems remain he says in neighboring nan 
province where the majority of the mlabri live and where 
exploitation by the hmong continues

editors note eagles fly again above the great lakes but they 
are dying faster than they can reproduce the majestic birds are 
victims of high levels of the same poisons that wiped them out of 
the area 20 years ago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
more than two decades after the oily 
cuyahoga river caught fire after lake erie was declared dead and 
ddt was banned eagles again soar above the great lakes 
they are not doing well 
yearly they return to try to colonize the contaminated 
shoreline and yearly scientist bill bowerman climbs to their 
nests to remove the unhatched eggs 
in the dead embryos and in the blood of surviving eaglets the 
michigan state university researcher sees high levels of the same 
poisons that wiped eagles out of the great lakes 20 years ago 
the birds are dying faster than they can reproduce bowerman 
says for them and more than a dozen other animals that feed on 
great lakes fish the shore is a zone of death and deformity 
its a red flag warning bowerman says a sign of whats 
happening to everything in the food chain 
the bald eagle is a perfect example said conservation 
foundation researcher dr theodore colborn in washington dc 
up and down the inland sea from cold deep lake superior to the 
roiling st lawrence river wildlife scientists tell of shore birds 
born with twisted beaks clubfeet and stomachs outside their 
bodies they tell of whales wracked with cancers and diseases of 
expanses of beach where mink have vanished and of eagles that can 
barely reproduce 
in a report to the uscanadian international joint commission 
last year colborn listed 16 predator species whose shoreline 
populations have dropped in association with high toxin levels 
the killer is silent pesticides such as ddt mirex and dieldrin 
and toxins such as pcbs and dioxin persist in the mucky lake 
sediments despite 20 years of cleanup efforts 
the toxins are picked up by worms and leeches and travel up the 
food chain from smelt to trout to gulls to eagles the 
concentrations of poisons increase 10 times at each level 
contamination levels vary from lake to lake but there are 
basinwide warnings for humans to limit the sizes and kinds of 
great lakes fish they eat 
fish contamination in some areas has dropped because of controls 
and bans on toxins pumped into the lakes by industry researchers 
say it will be a century or two before the vast lakes shed the 
poisons they have absorbed 
meanwhile the eagles try to return 
bowermans research shows michigan eagles on lakes michigan and 
huron are reproducing at less than half the rate of those who nest 
inland 
a pair must raise one chick a year to keep the population 
stable lake huron eagles have one chick for every three nests 
after five years of eating great lakes fish the time when inland 
birds reach their reproductive peak shore bird reproduction in 
michigan falls to one chick for every seven nests 
wisconsins only lake michigan eagle nest near green bay has 
not produced a chick in four years another pair on the straits of 
mackinac near st ignace has not produced a chick in eight years 
in the hiawatha national forest in michigans untamed upper 
peninsula prime eagle territory seven shoreline eagle pairs went 
three years before one of them produced a chick this year 
the eagle has made a remarkable comeback inland michigan with 
150 inland nesting pairs has surpassed its federally set goal of 
140 pairs minnesota reports 390 inland pairs and wisconsin has 
336 according to the us fish and wildlife service in the three 
states the eagle is classified as threatened not endangered 
bowerman believes that as those healthy eagles fly to the shore 
their stunted efforts to reproduce are sapping the entire 
population 
there are no nests on lake ontario the most contaminated of the 
great lakes the canadian side of lake huron is barren five of the 
eight us great lakes states illinois indiana pennsylvania 
new york and minnesota have no eagles on their shores 
theres some beautiful land there bowerman said i dont 
know why i dont know what the flow is from the pulp mills in 
canada i dont know where its all coming from 
he lost nine nests on lake superior this year the parent birds 
have vanished 
tim kubiak of the fish and wildlife service in lansing said the 
eagles problems are a sign of the poor health of the entire great 
lakes basin the worlds largest freshwater system 
growth problems retardation smaller head sizes lower birth 
rates we see it in mink the birds kubiak said they are 
clues to the health of shoredwelling humans 
the toxic problems show no signs of abating 
this spring a research team found 22 deformities in cormorant 
chicks in wisconsins green bay colony a deformity rate of 1 in 
72 where 1 in 10000 would be the norm 
last year bowerman tested a saginaw bay eaglet with 225 parts 
per million of pcbs in its blood the 5weekold lake huron chick 
carried contamination 100 times higher than inland eaglets 
like other great lakes researchers of terns and whales and mink 
bowerman is unable to say what the toxins actually do inside the 
bodies of their subjects 
were seeing messages from the environment indications that 
there are problems new york biologist robert foley said his 
work shows elevated pcb concentrations in lake ontario mink when 
he can find them he thinks the toxins and the population problems 
are related but he has yet to prove it 
eight years of analyzing the blubber of dead beluga whales 
beached in the st lawrence river have given canadian researcher 
pierre beland a chemical catalog of the lakes 
the dead whales ailments run an odd list of cancers and 
diseases previously unseen in belugas yet beland cannot explain 
what is happening to the living whales why do some of them have 
bent spines why are st lawrence belugas failing to recover 
despite a ban on commercial hunting 
were simply hoping the population will hold out until things 
get cleaner he said

after 20 years as an actor michael moriarty 
says he thought it was time to settle down and get a steady job 
moriarty a jazz pianist and composer who moonlights on the 
stage television and movies or maybe its the other way around 
stars in his first television series this fall 
he won a tony award for his role in find your way home and 
emmys for the glass menagerie and holocaust one of his 
most memorable parts was in the 1974 movie bang the drum 
slowly as the ballplayer whose friend played by robert de niro 
is dying hes also starred in such movies as pale rider and 
hanoi hilton 
moriarty is well known to those who frequent clubs in new york 
for his jazz work on the piano five years ago he turned to 
composing 
moriarty plays a new york prosecutor in nbcs law and order 
a onehour drama that follows a case in a quasidocumentary style 
from investigation to trial 
i thought i was mature enough to finally do a series he 
says with a slight smile i thought a steady job would suit me 
fine im as happy as a clam at high tide 
moriarty portrays an assistant district attorney george dzundza 
and christopher noth are the detectives and richard brooks is 
moriartys fellow prosecutor the show also stars dann florek and 
steven hill 
this reminds me of naked city says moriarty whos 
completed 13 episodes like naked city in the 1950s law and 
order is filmed on location all over new york city 
we tell stories the six of us take you through the lives of 
other people played by new york actors it captures the very rich 
fabric of the city i play ben stone whos in a state of evolution 
the more i play him the more he gets like me the only 
difference between us in the beginning was that he had a steady 
job now i have a steady job 
moriarty says law and order doesnt show personal 
relationships 
so its hard to show a man in his profession when he has no 
personal life he adds you have to find a hook i tried to 
flirt and they got all upset i want ben to take his job 
seriously but not himself sometimes he does and i have to pull 
him back we have to open up the show and bring in a woman 
character 
moriarty nevertheless is lavish in his praise of the series 
and those people connected with it 
i liked this show and i liked the fact that joe stern was the 
coexecutive producer moriarty says i felt good about that 
joes been an actor in the theater wed never worked together but 
we were professional friends when you sign on a series for five 
months let alone five years you need to feel at home i feel very 
comfortable joe knows every actor in new york and were getting 
those wonderful faces 
he says the show looks at many issues including vigilantes 
alcoholic doctors abortion euthanasia aids and racism 
moriarty lives with his wife and son in new york he grew up in 
detroit attended dartmouth and went to the london academy of music 
and dramatic arts on a fulbright scholarship he began his acting 
career in offbroadway shows and in regional theater including 
four years at the guthrie theater in minneapolis he made his movie 
debut in glory boy in 1972 
his portrayal of a hockey player charged with manslaughter in 
the cbs movie the deadliest season led to his emmywinning role 
as a nazi ss officer in holocaust 
although law and order is his first series he has done 
guest roles before hes been on hotel and cagney amp lacey 
and a role on the equalizer brought him an emmy nomination 
moriarty has played piano in new yorks jazz clubs for many 
years in 1985 he began composing for chamber orchestras string 
quartets and piano and violin solos his first album reaching 
out was released earlier this year he also did the score for a 
television movie 
i think ben stone might play the piano or conduct a chamber 
orchestra in a future episode says moriarty but if he does 
it wont be my own music mca demands all rights to the music 
the series is made in association with mcas universal 
television

the two jakes 
the mood of jack nicholsons the two jakes is established 
before the titles the paramount pictures logo appears but not as 
the usual bright and shining pinnacle the mountain peak is 
shrouded in gloom like mount st helens poised to blow its top 
chinatown the earlier saga in the violent life of detective 
jake gittes dealt with los angeles in the 1930s director roman 
polanski and writer robert towne told a grim but fascinating tale 
of corruption betrayal and incest against the background of the 
power plays in securing water for the booming metropolis 
the two jakes takes place 11 years later the war is over 
and the new power battles concern the housing developers and the 
oil interests private detective gittes has returned from the war 
and is back at his old stand sneaking evidence for divorce cases 
builder harvey keitel brings nicholson what seems to be a simple 
case of adultery but when the setup is made at a motel keitel 
shoots his wifes lover who turns out to be his business partner 
thats just the first of many discoveries in the labyrinthine 
script also written by robert towne who won an academy award for 
chinatown 
the two jakes ranks with the maltese falcon and other 
privateeye classics in the richness of characters and prevalence 
of mood since nicholson also directed you could expect strong 
perfomances and the gallery is rich keitel an enigmatic 
villainhero meg tilly his mysterious wife madeline stowe the 
explosive widow ruben blades a vicious mobster eli wallach a 
sympathetic lawyer joe mantell gittes dutiful aide perry lopez 
a friendly cop james hong a chinese mystic the latter three 
appeared in chinatown 
the postwar los angeles is brilliantly captured in jeremy 
railtons production design and by zilmos zsigmonds photography 
van dyke parks score makes excellent use of 1940s music played 
lowkey 
the problem with the two jakes is the same with others in 
the genre understanding the plot a knowledge of chinatown is 
utterly essential the nuances of the new film are lost without it 
nicholsons narration added postproduction helps untangle the 
plot but many of the early scenes are abruptly cut 
nicholsons gittes is another of his masterpieces a rare 
complex man battered by police mobsters and lying women but ever 
in pursuit of the truth nicholson remains todays premiere film 
actor 
the producers robert evans and harold schneider the rating is 
r for language violence and sexual content

metropolitan 
the time is christmas vacation not so long ago the setting is 
a manhattan as white as frosted glass a city of opera and hotel 
ballrooms where erudite youths stroll in top hats and purple gowns 
and the parents who pay for it all conveniently disappear each 
evening 
it is also perhaps the last deb season as we know it 
i think we are in a sense doomed the whole preppie 
class laments one young park avenue socialite in 
metropolitan a witty sweetlypaced film by writerdirector 
whit stillman 
stillman cites f scott fitzgeralds 1920 novel this side of 
paradise as inspiration and the illfated sally fowler rat pack 
is a worthy update of the authors celebrated chronicle of egotists 
and debutantes 
here is the breakfast club with a sense of humor a world of 
young people terminally bored but never boring led by the mocking 
selfsatisfied nick smith christopher eigeman the sfrp as they 
sometimes call themselves drifts from party to party 
contemplating morality class conflict and the imminent 
obsolescence of the urban haute bourgeoisie 
it all begins with a recital at carnegie hall attended by the 
sfrp and tom townsend edward clements a redheaded loner 
brooding inside a rented tux when each happens to hail the same 
cab tom is offered a free ride not only for the taxi but as a new 
member of the rat pack which suffers from a shortage of good 
escorts 
considering himself a principled socialist and one who eats 
cornflakes for breakfast tom wants no part of it it wouldnt 
be any great tragedy if these people lost their social 
perogatives he says huffily knowing well that karl marx would 
never succumb to an evening of duplicate bridge 
but nick sees right through him why spend all your time with 
the more fortunate he observes when one can be at home worrying 
about the less fortunate promised a life of music drink 
entertainment and hot nutritious meals tom stays buying the 
tux instead and welcoming the chance to get away from his unfeeling 
stepmother 
nick appreciates him and so does audrey rouget carolyn farina 
a shy jane austen devotee who develops a crush on tom despite 
literary disagreements and his lingering infatuation with the 
beautiful serena slocum 
the story is about tom and audrey but nick carries the film 
right from the moment he derides tom as a public transportation 
snob for preferring buses to cabs 
eigeman his head cocked his lip curled offers running 
commentary on the rat packs vapid lifestyle and his own 
inability to resist it 
whitman makes the film in nicks spirit never missing an 
opportunity to make fun of these people but helpless to do anything 
except wish them well 
metropolitan moves along so effortlessly youd never guess 
whitman and all the actors are making their film debuts in fact 
farina still works as a sales clerk at macys 
but not for long 
the new line cinema release is rated pg13 running time 98 
minutes

lohengrin cbs masterworks woldemar nelsson conducts the 
bayreuth festival orchestra with karan armstrong peter hofmann 
leif roar siegfreid vogel bernd wiekl and elizabeth connell 
 
wagners lohengrin doesnt make superhuman demands of its 
singers the way some of his later works do but assembling an ideal 
cast isnt easy either 
the lineup for the 1982 bayreuth performance that was recorded 
live by cbs masterworks and has now been transferred to compact 
disc was unfortunately far from ideal 
lohengrin is a romantic fairy tale with nationalistic and 
religious undercurrents elsa the heroine is a maid in distress 
who calls on the man of her dreams for help when she is falsely 
accused of murder 
he arrives in a boat drawn by the famous swan saves her 
reputation and marries her but all their happiness is on one 
condition that she never ask him his name elsa cant bear the 
mystery and soon ruins everything 
the title role is sung here by peter hofmann whose pleasant 
sound and handsome physique made him the most soughtafter of 
wagnerian tenors for a few years in the late 1970s and early 80s 
it wasnt long before his voice grew coarse and strained under the 
pressure of singing roles too strenuous for him 
in this recording he still sounds pretty good but there are 
some forced high notes that in hindsight show he was pushing his 
voice to do things it wasnt meant to do 
elsa is karan armstrong whose thin basically unattractive 
soprano copes adequately with the music but fails to convey the 
warmth and passion that make her one of wagners most treasurable 
heroines 
elizabeth connell as ortrud the sorceress who plants fatal 
seeds of doubt in elsa also has a thin voice but its more 
appealing to the ear than armstrongs 
her husband telramund is sung with little impact by baritone 
leif roar siegfreid vogel is king henry and bernd wiekl who 
would go on to sing more substantial roles at the metropolitan 
opera and elsewhere is heard in the small part of the herald 
woldemar nelsson conducts the bayreuth festival orchestra in a 
fastpaced reading of the score the sound is naturally not as 
wellfocused as with a studio recording but some of the excitement 
of a live performance comes through

hell to pay arista the jeff healey band 
 
since paul shaffer plays keyboards on the jeff healey bands 
hell to pay here are 10 reasons the album doesnt deserve a 
plug from david letterman 
10 it will be controversial with the title likely to draw 
objections from those that applauded the 2 live crew album ban 
heck to pay wouldve been better 
9 george harrison and jeff lynne both sing harmony on 
harrisons while my guitar gently weeps since their voices 
sound alike this is a redundant use of traveling wilburys 
8 guitaristsinger healey and bandmates joe rockman bass and 
tom stephen drums are poor songwriters the six songs written by 
one or more of them are built on recycled riffs and it seems every 
chord change is telegraphed 
7 of the four covers only the bluesy i think i love you too 
much by mark knopfler supplies much sizzle highlighted by some 
nifty guitar interplay from knopfler and healey the song makes the 
rest of the record just that much more disappointing 
6 other sparks ignited by healeys guitar are quickly doused 
when he sings his voice is dead on arrival 
5 the opening cut full circle sounds as though it came 
from the foreigner songbook 
4 even worse the title cut sounds as though it came from the 
bachmanturner overdrive songbook 
3 healey sounds tired on only the second album of a promising 
career there are few surprises few fresh ideas producer ed 
stasium must share the blame 
2 paul shaffer plays keyboards 
1 with better singing and better songs the 23yearold healey 
has the talent as a guitarist to make a great album letterman 
should save his plug for it

mariah carey columbia mariah carey 
 
not whitney houston the commercial voiceover could say but an 
incredible simulation 
thats 20yearold mariah carey whos making a big splash with 
her debut album shes a formidable talent at risk of being a 
victim of corporate gamesmanship 
trade papers tell of how columbia records concerned about a 
competing labels plan to release a new whitney houston record this 
fall tried to steal some thunder with careys new record 
consider it stolen carey mimics houstons stylish mixture of 
light dance pop and synthesized ballads so adeptly one half expects 
her to break into a chorus of how will i know 
this is not to belittle young careys talent the daughter of a 
new york city opera singer shes got an amazing sevenoctave 
singing range and is responsible for some otherworldly sounds not 
since the late minnie riperton has a paneshattering voice such as 
this come around hide your dogs for the end of all in your 
mind 
however while carey has the ability shes yet to match it with 
a vision the songs and instrumentation are like something youd 
find in the generic aisle of a grocery store if she ever matches 
her voice to the right songs watch out

imagine being a foreigner and learning 
english from marlon brando 
that happened to maximilian schell 28 years ago but he still 
has managed to win an academy award and a host of other honors 
the english lessons happened when schell made the young 
lions the austrian actor had to learn his lines by phonetics 
and brando the notorious mumbler proved a big help 
it was my first experience in a hollywood movie schell 
recalls i didnt speak much english at that time and marlon was 
extremely kind to help me with the part 
whenever people say that marlon was difficult i just say with 
me hes the easiest guy in the world 
the two actors have met on occasion over the years but they 
lost touch because says schell i dont like to bother famous 
people 
they staged a reunion for the freshman in which brando 
parodies his classic don corleone portrayal in the godfather 
schell plays an expert chef who joins the mob boss in an outrageous 
scheme 
we embraced each other reports schell and we sat in the 
trailer and talked not about old times but about philosophy that 
was our favorite theme on the young lions he has become more 
of a philosopher than he was at that time 
while he has lost some of that young drive that he had he 
still is a great screen personality when hes on the screen you 
always have to find a way to stand up against him that was the 
same problem on the young lions 
i come from the classical stage hamlet and everyman and 
so forth so i was a very eloquent actor especially in my native 
tongue and marlon of course was famous for this mumble 
mumble it was fascinating because you had to listen and figure 
out what he was saying he changed the style of acting 
obviously there is a chemistry between us schell said 
even while we were shooting the freshman we talked about a 
sequel we thought it was a good idea of two guys both retired 
one in switzerland and the other in sicily they call each other 
and say are you bored 
yes 
lets do something together 
schell 59 hadnt heard of matthew broderick the college 
freshman who stumbles into the mafia but found him to be fresh 
and innovative he stands up very well 
acting was inevitable for maximilian schell whose father was a 
swiss writer and poet and mother a viennese actress four of their 
children became actors including maria who starred in the 
brothers karamazov and cimarron after the nazi invasion of 
austria in 1938 the family moved to switzerland and thats where 
max grew up attending universities at zurich and basel 
schell appeared in the classical theater and in german films 
and in 1957 he was cast as a german officer in the young lions 
along with brando montgomery clift and dean martin he managed to 
hold his own in that highpowered company and stanley kramer chose 
him to play the enigmatic defense attorney in judgment at 
nuremberg 
both schell and spencer tracy were nominated for the bestactor 
oscar for their roles in the drama of the nazi warcriminal trials 
and schell was the surprise winner he has also been nominated for 
best actor in the man in the glass booth and supporting actor 
in julia he has continued to act and direct on the stage and 
he has directed such films as marlene academy nomination for 
documentary first love and end of the game 
long one of europes most eligible bachelors he surprised his 
friends three years ago by taking a bride natalia andreichenko a 
russian actress he met while filming peter the great they have 
a daughter 18 months as well as a 7yearold son by her previous 
marriage the schells now live in los angeles 
it all goes together i think explains the philosophical 
schell you see the moment i left switzerland and went to 
germany austria london and new york i became an immigrant or 
emigrant i once said to a sculptor you know what i miss is a 
home base like a tree needs ground instead of putting a palm tree 
in the mountains or a pine in the desert 
he said no max youre a part of the future we all live on 
one planet and you represent that artist who is home everywhere 
that is a consolation for me 
marriage was also a new experience it was unavoidable when i 
was in russia playing peter the great natasha played my first 
wife she said im very angry with you because youre putting me 
into a monastery that was a line from the tv miniseries because 
she couldnt speak english 
that was a good way to introduce herself instead of sending 
her to a monastery i took her with me to hollywood when we came 
in january she said i will never leave here 
i like it too when i was a bachelor i was always going 
home you know hollywood it can be very cruel a bachelor can be 
lonely even with all the friends you have so i went back to 
europe 
now with my wife and the babies you come home you may be 
sad but she throws her arms around your neck and its all good

cynthia gregory whose exquisite 
turns and elegant phrasing helped make american ballet theatre an 
international treat in the dance world is wellsuited to the roles 
of odette and odile in swan lake 
dancing odile in the black swan pas de deux requires 32 
consecutive spins but odette the white swan is her favorite 
role while other ballerinas dance the role with melancholy and 
pathos gregory depicts strength with vulnerability and triumph 
instead of gloom 
i think im more of a woman falling in love said the 
american ballet theatre prima ballerina shes saying to her 
sisters the other maidens maybe well be saved because i fell in 
love and so its almost a joyous solo rather than a tragic one 
she was referring to the touching solo after the act ii pas de 
deux 
when gregory talks about swan lake set to music by 
tchaikowsky she makes the swans sound like old friends rather than 
feathered characters from a fairy tale 
odette is a maiden turned into a swan by a magicians spell 
odile an evil twin who tries to destroy the love of odette and the 
prince 
the role makes even seasoned ballerinas nervous but not 
gregory who has been dancing it since 1967 
i feel i was born to dance that role she said in an 
interview before a recent performance at the teatro colon i love 
being the swan and i love being two characters in the same ballet 
and the music is glorious it moves me no matter what 
her role in swan lake is her signature work 
even though some ballerinas say its the most difficult role 
for me it isnt she said technically its my kind of steps 
its not a lot of jumping which i dont like to do 
gregory 44 is nearing the end of a career that has lasted 
almost three decades before she retires in another two or three 
years shed like to make a video of swan lake 
the dancer once described by rudolf nureyev as americas prima 
ballerina assoluta talks about life after ballet with 
characteristic candor humor and realism 
it takes a lot more willpower and a lot more getting past the 
pain now she said if i take a day off i really feel it 
i also want to dance my best leave it at that point and have 
people say why did she stop she was so wonderful rather than 
go its time this woman stopped dancing 
class and rehearsals will become things of the past she said 
but unfortunately so too will cherished moments when i am 
completely in my element and god is moving me around on a string 
she said 
sometimes that happens when i come out of myself and things 
happen on the stage that seem impossible to me and yet theyre 
happening to me i guess its from a lot of hard work but i think 
i was just meant to dance and god is holding me up 
her partners have included some of the most celebrated male 
dancers of the latter part of the 20th century nureyev fernando 
bujones and ivan nagy 
and though she might miss the world of ballet there is one 
role she will be happy to bid farewell to myrtha the queen of the 
vengeful wraiths in the second act of giselle 
it was all jumping and once youre finished with your part 
then you just stand there for the rest of the time and order people 
around she said 
and musically it never seemed to work for me shes supposed 
to be this cold cold woman full of hate and her music is this 
tinkly music that has nothing to do with hate 
gregory speaks often of music a californian of greek and french 
canadian descent she is from a musical family her grandfather 
arranged the national anthem of canada 
i think a lot of dancers dont use the music the way they 
could she noted they dont pay that much attention to it 
except for the beat and the rhythm but i think theres the essence 
of what the music is trying to tell you and thats what they 
should be on stage the essence of the music 
gregory is putting those and other thoughts in an autobiography 
she hopes to finish by the time she retires 
retirement will give her more time to spend with husband new 
york banker hilary miller and son lloyd gregory miller 2 
i think im more of a complete person being a mother she 
said and maybe that has brought something else to my dancing i 
do have a new joy in me that probably shows people say that 
anyway 
gregory was in south america on a 16day tour last month her 
son often travels with her but did not accompany her on this trip 
sometimes now i resent going to dance she said hell 
say good luck mom and i say i dont want to leave you 
gregorys last pirouette may not mean the end of her love affair 
with the audience because the ballerina wants to go to hollywood 
i guess im a ham at heart she said with a laugh id 
even do a television sitcom

where has success taken anita baker 
to dreamland sometimes to hell and back in a limo at other 
times 
she has been described as having one of pop musics most 
gorgeously appointed voices she has won three grammy awards as 
best rhythm n blues female vocalist plus one for best soul gospel 
singing and two songwriting grammys for sweet love and giving 
you the best that i got 
but she has insecurities and worries about maintaining her 
individuality 
record companies have come to see what i do is profitable 
she said theyre churning out female artists who sing ballads 
with jazz overtones 
how do i maintain my identity when theres an assembly line of 
me coming out 
baker has a new elektra records album compositions on 
which she wrote or cowrote seven of the nine songs she also 
recorded seven live with a rhythm section 
they were out with eric clapton we had 11 days to cut we cut 
10 songs in 11 days the fastest cutting ive even done 
it was great i never knew you could have fun in the studio 
id hated it doing it live everything at the same time im not 
thinking about myself if you hear something great being played it 
spurs you to do something cool 
i tried to get my manager to get a film crew in once we got 
the bugs out he said you could have got selfconscious you 
never would have finished i said thanks for second guessing 
me he called to see if we could recreate it the guys were out 
with clapton 
in the late 1970s baker became vocalist for a detroit group 
chapter 8 we did an album in 1980 and ariola didnt pick up the 
option they said you dont have what it takes to make it i 
figured they knew what they were talking about i went and got a 
day job 
so she went to work at her aunts beauty shop as a gofer and 
later as a shampooer 
with chapter 8 i was singing ballads baker said there 
was nothing on the radio except dance music now the trend is 
toward what i do fireside love songs with jazz blues and gospel 
overtones the good thing is that a lot of young singers are 
discovering their predecessors i listened to sarah vaughan and 
nancy wilson if there is going to be a fad let it be for love 
songs with jazz overtones because thats what i do 
bakers in the middle of a huge summer tour and quips that her 
songs are not fireside love songs seaside love songs from the

the road when im traveling lighting crew stage managers 
carpenters bus drivers limo drivers security i dont know how i 
got a reputation for being that witch with a b on the front of 
it she said 
it comes from people talking to people that have been fired 
the only way you can get fired is that you complicate very simple 
things by not listening or not having any pride about your job or 
having to be told something 50000 times who has got time for 
that 
gradually she says the best people have kind of found their 
way to us weve got the same band i had the last tour and a great 
crew which makes life as easy as it can be on the road 
audiences have been great baker said the kind of confidence 
that fosters in me is not the kind of confidence record companies 
want their artists to have what happened at wembley in england 
and copenhagen and here has given me a confidence that i needed 
they play on the insecurity of an artist saying audiences were 
there the last time but we dont know if theyre going to be there 
the first leg of this tour has given me confidence in knowing 
my audience is there for me 
baker carries an exercise tape on tour she also carries a book 
about chord structures and progressions which she studies on 
airplanes 
when she was growing up her aunt suggested piano lessons she 
youngest of five girls was a rebel without a cause and 
refused shes sorry now i do play im not a pianist 
in 1988 baker married walter bridgeforth who has a small 
investing company and operates a restaurant when their opinions 
dont coincide she says he doesnt debate or argue he says 
youre entitled to an opinion im going to the golf course i 
like it though 
he travels with me when he can i wouldnt want him with me 
all the time somebody is going to read something into that i like 
the fact he has a life independent of mine and it makes for 
sweeter rendezvous 
they live on lake st clair in grosse pointe mich and have 
recently bought a house nearby that they will tear down well 
build something that will fit the community were not ones to try 
to outdo everybody im in a very iffy business if im milk toast

wed be quite all right 
no matter what i do and no matter how much property we acquire 
or investments we make theres this little person in here thats 
the innercity kid saying anita somebody is going to come and 
take your credit card 
when we walked into the new house i had to go into another 
room and sit down i lost it when i was a kid and walter too 
the thing to do at christmastime was parents would pack their 
children into the car and drive along the lake shore and look at

on his 200yearold farm in the mountains of 
western maine author michael rothschild likes to pick apples from 
the orchard grind them up and press them into cider 
the cider is difficult to drink no water or sugar is added it 
catches in your throat the first time and makes you shake your head 
and squeeze your eyes shut as if you had dipped your tongue in a 
spoonful of vinegar 
rothschilds writing goes down just as hard the stories from 
his second collection wondermonger 1795 viking need to 
be read a few pages at a time with long pauses in between unless 
you have an intricate knowledge of maine folklore theyre 
difficult to understand at first and you may not bother trying 
again 
but its like drinking pure cider read the toad two or 
three times grab hold of the words as if each one hangs from the 
tip of a branch and you get caught up in simple miracles such as 
how wide a snakes mouth can open as well as the authors pleasure 
in telling the story 
youre putting a terrible pressure on the person and i think 
youd better have something where if the person does read you 
again youd better deliver rothschild explained between deep 
puffs of cigarettes at his publishers offices i think readers 
will be taken to a place where theyre not taken in fiction anymore 
there are people who talk to a kid and say this kids smart 
ill talk to him on the level of 7 and this kids dumb ill 
talk to him with a 3 
but i dont change my vocabulary or my expressions when i 
write im not writing for this person or for that person maybe it 
would be better if i was writing to appeal to an audience in a 
certain way 
so imagine being dropped in a forest of pine in the dead of 
winter with snow falling as if sifted through the clouds and the 
north wind pulling at the trees there are no maps or tour guides 
just a copy of wondermonger to safely get you home 
winter fostered neighborliness among the dennedup settlers of 
tantrattle he writes in the title story just as deer to 
survive the depth of snow and boreal winds yard beneath a 
sheltering stand of cedar and paw after browse within the 
steepwalled confines of their maze so the scattered families 
tunneled out from storm upon december storm to call upon friends 
or with new fervor and frequency congregated sunday morning and 
wednesday evenings at the reverend cawkins meeting house 
now rothschild admits he has a hard time explaining what that 
means even his mother complains she doesnt understand but 
compare it to looking at a landscape painting steepwalled 
confines and a sheltering stand of cedar are the story 
rothschilds fiction isnt about characters getting from one place 
to another its about the places themselves 
when theres a terrible blizzard the master blizzard of the 
winter there are people that stay by their stoves and i suppose 
there are some people that like to go out and bundle up and go out 
because they like to see whats going on rothschild said 
for better or worse im one of those people when there are 
rivers breaking up and ice floes large as cars i ruffle up my hair 
and my eyes roll back in my head and i feel great 
the nine stories of wondermonger can be divided between 
tales of the awful and the aweinspiring between shotguns and 
bleeding dogs and pregnant women and mystical children 
they run chronologically starting in colonial times with the 
title story and leading up the present and beyond with a land 
without fossils the toad lasts just three pages 
wondermonger runs over 60 and only a land without fossils 
in which a father contemplates the maps drawn by his 5yearold 
son resembles the authors own life 
rothschild was born in maine in 1947 hes a rugged looking man 
ernest borgnine with a ponytail and between tending to the 
farm raising four children sculpting and making trips to china 
he hasnt had much time to write his first set of stories 
rhapsody of a hermit was published in 1973 and the back of the 
book promises a novel that has yet to be completed 
his friends include woodsmen who remove their hats in front of 
his sculptures of naked women and an elderly neighbor who responds 
to the word art by asking art who 
so rather than attend writers conferences or philosophize at 
cocktail parties rothschild can be found setting snares or 
reading nathanial hawthorne to children on july 4 or helping a pig 
give birth in the middle of the night 
he dismisses suggestions that staying on the farm means writing 
in the wilderness just looking at the moon is inspiration for 
rothschild a man who has no interest in living in a big city who 
sees chatting up authors as unnecessary as going to town to buy a 
carton of apple juice 
people ask me why i write in a void and it always seems 
peculiar when i think about it rothschild said because im 
surrounded with people who are living their lives farmers and 
millworkers people living in the hills trying to hang onto their 
farms people of all ages kids and animals 
it seems like an absolute plenitude the opposite of the void 
now a group of artists talking about writing or talking about 
painting that seems to me almost dead center void

more than a million copies sold for her greatest hits shes 
won a grammy appeared on three bob hope tv specials and branched 
out into acting 
whats left 
everything she said we want to sell more tickets and 
more albums do movies and television produce records have a 
bigger publishing company have more acts for my company 
weve got lots to do 
mcentire 35 who took off five months to have her first baby in 
february has had six straight gold albums and was voted best 
female country vocalist from 198487 
shes in the midst of a 115city concert tour that began may 3 
her 17th album rumor has it has just been released 
she recently acted in her first movie tremors appearing as 
a survivalist with star kevin bacon 
i like to act and i want to pursue it more she said in an 
interview in her office a few days after singing at the goodwill 
games in seattle of course music and touring is no 1 
her single walk on reached no 2 on the country music 
charts in july it was about persevering during hard times and 
joined other topical issues she previously has tackled the 
stairs was about wife abuse and am i the only one who cares 
dealt with teenage suicide and alienation 
fancy in her new album is about a mother pushing a girl 
into prostitution to get ahead in life 
i chose it because i liked it mcentire said ive wanted 
to record it for five years 
her 1987 grammy was for whoevers in new england her other 
hit records include cathys clown new fool at an old game 
little rock love will find its way to you one promise 
too late and what am i gonna do about you 
mcentire recently was cohost of abcs good morning america 
filling in for joan lunden who was on vacation she appeared on the 
hope specials on nbc during the past few years 
he liked me and he likes to work with people he gets along 
with and are easy to work with mcentire said we were told to 
be there at a certain time and we were there usually early 
mcentire was the third of four children who grew up in chockie 
okla where she mixed ranching rodeoing and singing she is a 
former rodeo barrel racer and spent several years on a ranch in 
stringtown okla 
she first appeared on country music charts in 1976 one year 
after she gained notice by singing the national anthem at the 
national rodeo finals in oklahoma city 
but mcentire wasnt always on top ive been booed off stage 
at times i havent drawn flies ive sat in a store to sign 
autographs and someone asked me where the bathroom is 
nevertheless her string of four straight honors as country 
musics top female singer likely will never be matched looking 
back on it today shes actually relieved kt oslin finally 
displaced her as the winner 
it would have been sudden death for me if i had won it 
again mcentire said you dont want to ride a good horse to 
death 
she dismissed a story in a supermarket tabloid that she and 
oslin best known for her hit record 80s ladies are feuding 
it was good that kt won she is spunky and she brought 
something to country music that we all needed something totally 
different i really appreciate kt 
having a child has made her career even more meaningful to her 
i have something to work for now that i have shelby to 
accumulate more allow him to be secure if something happens to 
me

there is nothing new under the sun goes an old 
proverb but skin specialists say they are learning more all the 
time about the suns damaging effects and how people can protect 
themselves 
a popular belief that ultraviolet a rays are benign compared 
with ultraviolet b rays is giving way to evidence over the past 
few years that both types wreak similar havoc on the skin doctors 
say 
uvb is the most damaging but uva is also damaging says dr 
vincent a de leo assistant professor of dermatology at columbia 
university medical school in new york 
uva can do all the things to skin uvb does promote skin 
cancer and premature aging its just not quite as efficient he 
says the important thing is theres a lot more uva out there 
than uvb at least 10 times as much in sunshine some quotes say 
100 times as much 
almost all tanning parlor equipment now uses uva radiation de 
leo says it is only onethousandth as powerful in causing burns as 
uvb but it has been found to cause almost all the adverse 
reactions occurring in people who take medications that make them 
sensitive to light he said 
adverse reactions to such medications which include common 
antibiotics bloodpressure drugs and pain relievers can include 
blistering and bruising when the skin is touched severe sunburn 
reactions and rashes he says 
dr fred castrow of houston an officer of the american academy 
of dermatology and a leader in the effort to get tanning parlors 
regulated says his advice is the same regardless of whether people 
take medication stay away from tanning parlors 
we cant get out of the sunlight we can try to protect 
ourselves from as much damage as possible but tanning parlors are 
one of those nonnecessities that are damaging 
joyce burdette executive director of the suntanning education 
association a tanningsalon industry group in frederick md 
disagrees and says the public is going to continue to want to 
tan and get some color 
the theory behind indoor tanning is that you are receiving a 
controlled measured dose she says moderation is the key 
like anything else 
the american medical association last year issued guidelines for 
people who insist on tanning cosmetically or who underestimate the 
risks of being in the sun 
minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation by staying out of 
the sun between 10 am and 2 pm and wearing a hat and protective 
clothing while outdoors 
beware of surfaces that reflect sunlight such as sand snow 
ice and concrete that can intensify the effects of the suns rays 
by 10 to 50 percent 
use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 15 
for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually or higher at 
greater altitudes or for other intensive exposures a person 
wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the 
same amount of exposure after 15 hours as he would in one hour if 
he were wearing no sunscreen 
avoid tanning machines but if tanning equipment is used 
people who tan moderately well should limit exposures to 30 to 50 
halfhour sessions per year use a properly calibrated device with 
a timer keep a record of exposures wear protective goggles and 
make sure an attendant is nearby in case of an emergency 
de leo says most sunscreens currently protect only against uvb 
and manufacturers have begun to add chemical agents to protect 
against uva 
one type is the benzophenones already present in most 
sunscreens with sun protection factors higher than 15 and another 
is dibenzoylmethane found only in a lotion called photoplex made 
by herbert laboratories of irvine calif he said 
no scientific consensus has been reached on how to rate uva 
sunscreen protectiveness and it is believed that present lotions 
carry a protection factor no higher than 5 he said 
doctors currently are trying hard to get adults to have their 
children wear sunscreens since at least 50 percent of lifetime sun 
exposure usually occurs before age 18 and cumulative exposure is 
blamed for at least one type of cancer as well as for premature 
aging 
but de leo says children under 6 months old should not have 
sunscreens applied to their skin since no one knows how much of 
the agents are absorbed 
for people who already have premature aging associated with sun 
exposure a variety of products are being tested but the only one 
so far proven to smooth wrinkles and fade spots is tretinoin a 
cousin of vitamin a marketed under the trade name retina says dr 
barbara gilchrest chairman of dermatology at boston university 
school of medicine 
the sun does quite a job on peoples skin she says i 
dont think well ever have a product that will allow people to go 
out and bake themselves in the sun and then go to the corner store 
and buy something that will fix that

you woke up late and now you have to rush to catch the bus 
twisting and hopping from one foot to the other youll save time 
by pulling on your pantyhose standing up ping ouch whats that 
sharp feeling in your back 
or you decided to rearrange the furniture in your office to 
make way for a new computer moving a small file cabinet or two 
shouldnt have been any trouble for a strong fellow like you but 
you must have overdone it because now you feel like youve been 
hit in the back by a truck 
back trouble is the great leveler hitting perhaps as many as 70 
percent of the population sooner or later the athletically 
inclined and couch potato alike economic costs of back pain have 
been estimated at about 16 billion annually says the american 
academy of orthopaedic surgeons low back pain is the most common 
disability among those under 45 according to a national health and 
nutrition examination survey 
youre a candidate for low back pain if youre out of shape if 
youve overexerted doing something youre not used to or if you 
didnt warm up muscles and joints before plunging into activity 
says dr jerold lancourt a dallas orthopedist who specializes in 
back problems a sudden twisting or turning motion can add up to 
weeks or months of misery 
what to do most back pain will get better by itself 
lancourt says i like to use common sense about these things 
he recommends lying down for a day or two aspirin ice and warm 
baths avoid too much activity for a while 
if the pain is still around a week later if its bad enough to 
keep you from resuming your normal activities or if you have pain 
running down your leg call the doctor an orthopedist who 
specializes in bones and joints probably is your best bet though 
your general practitioner usually can help too lancourt observes 
that theres enough back pain to go around for all doctors 
the doctor will analyze the source of your pain it could be a 
disk problem such as disk material protruding and pressing against 
a nerve or more seriously a ruptured disk it could be from muscle 
spasms arthritis osteoporosis stress overweight overload and 
other lifestylerelated conditions are possible contributors 
whatever the cause the probability that youll need drastic 
treatment such as surgery is slight about 90 to 95 percent of my 
patients go to physical therapy lancourt says physical 
therapists will work out an exercise program designed to increase 
flexibility and strength in your back 
youll also learn something about the mechanics of your back and 
what to do or not do to keep back pain at bay 
the best way to avoid problems is to understand how your body 
works lancourt says he characterizes the back as a complex 
piece of engineering with the jellylike disks between the 
vertebra functioning as a hydraulic system that distributes load 
stress the natural s curve of the spine is the architecture 
that supports and balances the weight of the head the five lower 
vertebra of the lumbar spine act as foundation for carrying the 70 
percent of your body weight located in the upper body 
what usually goes wrong is that because of your habits and 
lifestyle your back isnt as strong and flexible as it should be 
or you misjudge your capacities you can expect pain if youre 
not accustomed to say moving furniture or if you spend 20 hours 
on the road or in an airplane says lancourt 
you can minimize your chances of back pain by being aware of 
proper positions for sitting standing lifting and resting he 
says when seated pull your knees up so theyre higher than your 
hips when standing find something to rest one foot higher like a 
rail or step to distribute the pressure the socalled 
barrail position when lifting squat down to pick up the 
load then hold it close to your torso which is your center of 
gravity at rest lie on your back with your knees propped up 
lancourt advises to always avoid twisting and bending and 
always warm up for any kind of physical activity 
the best recreational sport for strengthening the back in his 
opinion is swimming biking and walking also are good but he 
cautions that golf may involve too much twisting of the spine

statistics from the surgeongeneral show 
that women once hooked have a tough time kicking the cigarette 
habit sue delaney an exsmoker says it hasnt helped that most 
smoking cessation programs are designed for men who smoke for 
different reasons than women 
most approaches to quitting are based on the experience of 
male smokers whose needs sharply diverge from those of women 
smokers on several key points says delaney whose book women 
smokers can quit a different approach womens healthcare 
press is used in hospitals and nosmoking programs 
she points to research that shows men usually smoke for pleasure 
and quit for the positive benefits while women may smoke to 
suppress depression and other negative feelings and quit primarily 
to please others cultural expectations reinforce men as 
independent problem solvers women are expected to share their 
feelings and bond with others to solve problems and women are more 
likely to fear weight gain because thinness is such an ingrained 
cultural value for them 
we have to help women feel less guilt help them feel that 
quitting smoking is a positive thing a matter of taking control of 
their own lives says delaney 
she says most women start smoking in their teens and one of the 
most powerful reasons is that they respond to glamorous images 
shown in cigarette advertising she thinks that publications who 
rely on revenues from the ads may pull their punches when it comes 
to editorial matter about smoking and health the amount of 
tobacco advertising directly correlates with the percentage of 
articles she says were not going to get straight information 
from magazines 
some of that information is in her book which offers practical 
tips to the woman smoker who wants to quit much of the advice is 
based on her own experience in breaking a 40year cigarette habit 
nearly two years ago as well as research and interviews with other 
women smokers 
she recommends making a list of reasons to quit but she 
emphasizes that it should be an imemy list if youre 
tempted to write my husband wants me to quit write instead i 
love my husband and want to spend many more years with him if you 
want to write my friends are worried about me write instead 
im worried about my blood pressure my cough my fatigue if you 
start to write my children dont like it write instead i want 
to get the kids off my case 
delaney quit cold turkey but she says preparing to quit is 
better for most women preparation helps them analyze why they 
smoke and to recognize people places and routines that trigger the 
urge to smoke they learn new habits and alternative ways to relax 
and to deal with problems then they find that smoking is just 
incompatible with this new lifestyle 
many nosmoking programs recognize the connection of smoking and 
depression among women by an acronym halt hungry angry lonely 
tired but delaney says its not known whether depression triggers 
smoking or if it works the other way around we dont know the 
answer to that but i know that when i want a cigarette its an 
emotional barometer to me i ask myself whats going on with me 
whats causing this 
nearly all nosmoking legislation is negative she points out 
and it just drives smokers outside into nonrestricted places to 
smoke while nonsmokers need to defend their rights they should 
appeal to sensible behavior in dealing with and helping the 
smoker delaney says be firm but understanding if a smoker is 
riding with you in your car stop and ask her to get out of the car 
to smoke 
at what point does a woman smoker become an exsmoker i think 
that if you can make it through two years without smoking then you 
can consider yourself an exsmoker then of course youll want to 
try to lengthen your record 
women smokers can quit a different approach is distributed 
primarily through hospital and nosmoking programs but it can be 
ordered by mail for 695 including postage call 1 800 
5433854 or write womens healthcare press 500 davis street

get ready get set stop 
here are some tips to help you get off cigarettes for good the 
list is based on women smokers can quit a different approach 
womens healthcare press by sue delaney 
start by analyzing where when why and how much you smoke 
make a list of the reasons you want to quit carry it with you 
and look at it for inspiration when you have the urge to smoke 
get your doctors help he may be able to prescribe a nicotine 
substitute to help you control your smoking 
if youre afraid of gaining weight try to modify your eating 
before you stop smoking but dont wait until you lose weight to 
begin your nosmoking campaign 
develop a support network of friends and family who can 
provide a sympathetic ear or active help over the long term women 
with supportive husbands partners or families have a better chance 
to quit than those who dont 
if you enroll in a program find one that uses multiple 
techniques including behavior modification longterm support and 
followup 
set a date for quitting and announce it to your support 
network you might even draw up and sign a contract with a friend 
partner or doctor 
the day before quitting smoke heavily make yourself really 
sick of smoking says delaney spill the ashes look at the 
mess smell the stink plan a reward to yourself for your first 
smokefree 24 hours get rid of your cigarette supply and smoking 
apparatus make a ceremony of smoking your last cigarette 
on quitting day change your routine every way you can plan 
different activities that occupy your hands or mouth knitting 
working a crossword puzzle or chewing gum to substitute for 
smoking 
cope with cravings by waiting them out or finding something 
else to put in your mouth a toothpick sugarless gum carrot 
sticks or celery 
practice assertive direct communications to help head off or 
deal with unpleasant emotions that may turn up at this time if 
thats not possible turn to your support network to vent your 
feelings 
recognize people places or events that may trigger a relapse 
then anticipate alter or avoid them 
remember that slips or lapses are common and can be followed 
by periods of successful abstinence look at successive attempts to 
stop smoking not as failure but as positive rehearsals for finally 
quitting

fat is like a secret agent it slips in 
where you dont expect to find it and you may not recognize it at 
all 
there are many surprises salted peanuts for example are 
higher in fat than potato chips says kay stanfill adjunct 
professor of clinical dietetics at the university of oklahoma 
health sciences center croissants have more fat than sweet 
rolls most margarine contains the same amount of fat as butter 
and avocados which are technically vegetables are in the same 
category as butter on the fat chart 
she says you also may be fooled by grape jelly colas and honey 
fattening guess again they contain no fat at all people tend 
to confuse sweetness with fat content while believing that health 
foods such as sunflower seeds and wheat germ must be low in fat 
when they are not 
oat bran muffins popular among many healthconscious consumers 
are foolers too people will force themselves to eat oat bran 
muffins to lower their cholesterol and in reality most muffin 
recipes are very high in fat adds rachel barkley an assistant 
professor clinical dietetics at the university 
more surprises 
chicken and fish while perhaps healthful choices change their 
profiles according to preparation if the chicken and fish are 
fried or if the chicken is cooked with the skin on fatwise you 
are much better off with a hamburger or a lean cut of beef and 
lean pork has even less saturated fat than lean beef says 
barkley 
then there are salads a salad with cheese croutons and 
dressing can contain more fat than a quarterpound hamburger 
stanfill says if you want a truly lean salad make it with chopped 
egg instead of bacon bits or sunflower seeds which have twice as 
much fat 
they point out that the american heart association and the 
american cancer society both recommend you limit fat intake to 
about 30 percent of your calories to hold the line they recommend 
eating a variety of foods from the four major food groups also 
watch both fat and sugar intake through some beverages sandwich 
spreads some meats cheeses chips and desserts which may add 
calories but little nutrition if you must have butter margarine 
mayonnaise salad dressings cheeses and meats eat them in small 
quantities include foods with dietary fiber fruits vegetables 
and whole grain breads and choose lowsodium foods such as fresh 
fruits vegetables lean meat and poultry

if it seems to you that restaurants 
are engaged in a conspiracy to undermine your diet resolve it may 
be because you arent speaking up says a nutritionist whose 
students surveyed restaurants in this area 
the survey showed that restaurants were ready willing and able 
to make healthful substitutes says letitia mitchell a purdue 
university nutrition instructor they have to be aware of what 
their customers want if they want to compete in the business 
most restaurants already have diet beverages on the menu 
offer sugar substitutes and decaffeinated coffee things like 
that but mitchell says that customers need to make their desires 
known 
she cites some tips from the american dietetic association and 
the national center for nutrition and dietetics 
never assume how food is prepared ask 
if the serving is too big leave the excess on your plate or 
ask for a doggie bag or split an entree with someone else 
request dressings on the side dipping a bite of food into the 
dressing can let you control the calories 
ask to have the bread basket served with the meals rather than 
before so you wont overeat while waiting for your order 
ask for vegetables without butter skinless chicken and 
substitutions of fruit or small green salads for french fries 
most restaurants offer sherbet as a substitute for ice cream 
or offer lowcal gelatin and fresh fruit she adds or ask for 
a half portion of a more fattening item

you dont have to be a kid to straighten out 
that smile or your bite the number of adults wearing braces has 
more than doubled in the last ten years according to the american 
association of orthodontists 
orthodontics go well beyond cosmetic effects though those are 
important psychologically the organization says treatment can 
help patients avoid tooth decay gum disease and tooth loss and 
that usually means less cost in the long run 
the aao says that one of the most prevalent problems in adult 
teeth is overcrowding which makes them difficult to clean and 
prone to decay conversely open spaces can cause healthy teeth to 
tip with deterioration of supporting bone and consequent looseness 
of teeth another problem is protruding front teeth which dont 
meet properly while chewing causing abnormal wear of tooth 
surfaces and stress on supporting bone and gum tissue and then 
there are related problems outside the mouth like disorders of the 
temporamandibular joints tmd connecting the lower jaw to the 
skull which can cause chronic headaches earaches and facial pain 
orthodontics and sometimes surgery can alleviate these conditions 
for treatment the traditional tingrin braces have been 
improved on especially from the adult point of view most 
orthodontists now are using the more aesthetically pleasing 
brackets bonded directly to teeth and attached to the main arch 
wire that moves them there also are nearly invisible lingual 
braces which are applied to the inside surfaces of the teeth 
though these are more expensive due to longer wearing time and 
also not applicable to all orthodontic problems many people 
choose them if they feel appearance is important professionally 
other types include clear or toothcolored brackets which are less 
noticeable than regular braces 
new technology has brought spaceage wires that are more 
flexible and hold a preformed shape often resulting in less 
discomfort and shorter treatment time also new are tiny magnets 
attached to upper or lower molars which help move teeth by 
magnetic force these may eliminate the need for orthodontic 
headgear worn outside the mouth 
technology also will help you visualize what youll look like 
after treatment the aao is offering a complimentary 
computerimaged likeness that will show a what a rearranged smile 
can do for your appearance the organization has created a smile 
bank of hundreds of smile photogaphs programming them into a 
computer that will combine an appropriate one with your current 
photo or video image send a clear color photograph a closeup 
frontal shot with a wide toothy grin along with your name 
address and phone number to the american association of

biking may be one of americas favorite pastimes 
but without precautions it can result in head injuries nerve 
damage or impotence 
more than 500000 people are injured each year in bicycle 
accidents with about 1000 dying of their injuries says dr 
michael chapman chairman of the american academy of orthopaedic 
surgeons committee on trauma 
bicylists have an even higher incidence of severe head injuries 
than motorcyclists and three out of four such injuries result in 
death he notes 
accidents cause the most serious bike injuries but regular 
biking also can cause neuropathy a malfunction of the nerves 
says chapman 
for example pressure from the cyclists grip on the handlebars 
can result in neuropathy affecting the hands with numbness 
weakness pain and lack of coordination while nerve damage in the 
groin area from a poorly adjusted or improperly sized seat can lead 
to impotence in men 
pressure from the bicycle seat also can cause blood in the 
urine inflammation of the urethra and irritation of the buttocks 
bikers can protect themselves from injury with some basics 
recommended by chapman 
always wear a helmet with a hard shell 
wear proper clothing bright reflective clothing makes a 
rider more visible at night padded gloves and handlebars help 
protect the hands from chronic pressure injuries 
wear shoes and socks children especially like to ride 
barefoot but many sustain broken or crushed bones and bruises when 
their feet get caught in the spokes whether pedalling or riding on 
the back of a bike 
fit the size of the bike to the rider when the rider 
straddles the bike standing there should be one or two inches of 
space between the groin and the bike frame when the rider sits on 
the bike and the right pedal is at its lowest position the right 
knee should be flexed about 10 or 15 degrees 
drink plenty of water constant air movement around the 
cyclist evaporates sweat and that can contribute to dehydration

overenthusiastic exercisers who do aerobics 
in tune with music from their personal headphones may be doing 
themselves more harm than good says a miami university researcher 
dr helaine alessio a miami assistant professor of physical 
education says oxygen stress from this kind of exercise regime can 
damage cells of vulnerable people in a worstcase scenario this 
could lead to cancer she says 
added to that is the possibility that the diversion of blood and 
thus oxygen from the ears can make them more sensitive to noise 
alessio and dr kathleen hutchinson miami assistant professor of 
communications have discovered significant temporary hearing 
losses among exercisers they tested after 10 minutes of exercise 
while listening to headphones while normal hearing returns after 
24 hours repeated episodes can lead to permanent hearing loss 
they say 
appropriate exercise is the key says alessio who is 
working on a blood serum test to be used to determine peoples 
tolerance to oxygen stress our cells can handle certain stress 
levels and still repair themselves but perhaps the stress 
associated with vigorous exercise is too much for some people 
im not talking about athletes who go through pain when they 
are training hard to excel im talking about the average person 
who exercises to reduce weight or stay fit

when it comes to fitness no pain no gain may be not true 
not true 
pain is a warning signal and if ignored might mean injury or 
other negative medical condition say the editors of weight 
watchers magazine 
they note some other fitness theories they consider fallacies 
muscle turns to fat when you stop exercising a fit 
individual who stops exercising may lose muscle mass and put on fat 
if food intake is not adjusted accordingly but this is new fat 
not converted fat 
you can sweat off excess weight through exercise what 
you sweat off is water you burn off excess weight by 
exercising and cutting calories 
stretching before a workout is unnecessary on the 
contrary its one of the most important parts of the workout it 
helps prevent injuries and increases circulation 
never drink while exercising by all means drink its 
important to avoid dehydration and overheating during exercise 
water is preferred since it is absorbed quicker wont upset your 
stomach and helps the internal cooldown process

americans spent an estimated 5 billion last year on physical 
fitness equipment to fight the paunchandwheeze war but about 90 
percent of it went into the closet after a short time equipment 
marketers estimate 
people in the 35to50 age bracket with yearly incomes of 
50000 and more want to live to enjoy the money theyre making 
and so they invest in equipment and programs says michael 
simmons president of californiabased protec sports 
international a manufacturer and distributor of recumbent exercise 
cycles 
but most of them stop using the equipment regularly because 
they bought the wrong device for the wrong purpose by far most of 
the people who buy sophisticated exercise equipment for home use 
should buy health equipment he explains 
simmons says industry studies show the majority of such 
purchasers are past 40 in essentially sedentary occupations 
they need aerobic exercise for heart and lungs and muscle tone 
rather than bulging biceps but they mistakenly buy 15000 home 
gyms designed for anaerobic loweroxygenuse workouts says 
simmons 
they infrequently use the equipment and it doesnt deliver 
the vascular conditioning they need so they stop the program and 
store the equipment 
the high dropout rate also can be attributed to perceived lack 
of time and convenience soreness and boredom according to jim 
warren a corporate fitness and conditioning consultant 
what most people who say im not an athlete dont realize is 
that it takes what we call foundational fitness for the average 
man and woman to maintain the energy overall muscle tone and 
freedom from back and other chronic pain to get through 365 days of 
work family life and recreation says warren who heads 
californiabased fitamerica inc 
warren agrees with simmons that changes both in fitness concepts 
and equipment are good news 
physicians who specialize in aerobic exercise dynamics have 
scaled down by as much as 70 percent the requirements for effective 
workouts simmons notes 
he cites an american medical association study showing that 
individuals as old as 90 can exercise in moderation maintaining 
body and muscle tone through milder isometric resistance exercises 
performed for a few minutes every day

adolescent women could be the next major 
victims of aids unless they change behaviors that predispose them 
to risk say two researchers who have been conducting a study of 
health risks among innercity youths between 18 and 23 
weve got to find a way to get to them because so far theyre 
not paying attention says arlene rubin stiffman a social work 
professor at washington university no matter how much young 
people know about aids they are not doing what they need to do to 
prevent it 
stiffman and felton earls a behavioral science professor at 
harvard university discovered that while their study group was 
mostly black and mostly female the highrisk portion of it was 
almost evenly divided between whites and blacks and males and 
females that means that a disproportionate percentage of white 
youths and women engaged in highestrisk behaviors 
the professors note that their study concentrating on 
innercity youths who are demographically at higher risk in the 
first place does not reflect the population at large but it 
tips us off that the aids epidemic is at a point that it can invade 
this age group by the fact that it is showing up even in those who 
havent been considered high risks says earls 
stiffman and earls found that despite the availability of 
brochures and classes about aids prevention the young people 
covered in the study didnt seek it out or change their behaviors 
until confronted with a pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease 
they think this may be due to the tendency of people in that age 
group to feel invulnerable and to the limited possibilities they 
perceive in innercity life the limited life options of many 
poor or minority segments of our youthful populations prevent them 
from valuing their lives enough to engage in short or longterm 
preventive behaviors says stiffman 
risky times how to be aidssmart and stay healthy 
workman by jeanne blake is aimed at making teenagers more aware 
of the risks and prevention of aids the author a television 
medical reporter in boston includes firstperson vignettes from 
celebrities from people whose lives are affected by the disease 
along with information about its risks prevention and consequences

americans who suffer from seasonal allergies face a tough season 
of wheezing and sneezing this fall according to a nationwide 
survey of aeroallergen specialists 
extreme weather patterns including milder winters in the north 
and sporadic frosts in the south have created fertile growing 
ground for tree grass and ragweed allergens the study indicates 
midwesterners face the worst ragweed year yet and sufferers 
in the northeast should brace themselves for an intense weed 
season members of the chlortrimeton allergy index panel report 
the southwest is expected to have flareups of grass pollens in 
the early fall in the southeast frosts last winter destroyed and 
delayed tree growth resulting in an overlap of tree and grass 
seasons which the panel describes as a devastating combination 
in the far west the study predicts a long severe grass season 
extending through october will cause sufferers a good deal of 
discomfort 
an estimated 40 million americans suffer from allergies spend 
more than 1 billion annually treating their hay fever symptoms 
and lose about 35 million sick days and 800 million in wages the 
panelists note 
some suggestions for controlling allergens include 
keep windows closed at night and use air conditioning which 
cleans cools and dries the air 
limit early morning outdoor activity when pollen levels are 
highest and exercise later in the day when pollen levels taper off 
after exercising wash your hair and hands to clear clinging 
allergens 
take an antihistamine tablet 30 minutes before going outdoors

dont send your cat packing if youre pregnant says dr warren 
m crosby of the university of oklahoma health sciences center who 
says concerns about picking up a toxoplasmosis infection from your 
pet may be overrated 
toxoplasmosis is transmitted through two avenues raw meat 
and cat feces cats get the disease from eating infected animals 
usually rodents he says 
once a person has been infected he or she becomes immune and a 
pregnant woman will pass this immunity on to her unborn child 
however if a nonimmune pregnant woman comes into contact with the 
disease there is a 10 percent chance her child will pick it up and 
suffer from birth defects such as deafness mental retardation 
impeded brain development but not limb deformity according to 
crosby 
he advises pregnant women who own cats to let someone else 
change the cat litter box otherwise there is little risk of 
contact through the cat since this fastidious animal washes itself 
frequently indoor cats are generally safer than outdoor cats 
because they have had less exposure to infected animals however 
with an outdoor cat the odds are greater that the woman already 
has been exposed to the organism and has built up an immunity he 
recommends that women planning to become pregnant have blood tests 
for the disease for herself and her pet 
homes where cats have never lived and public places where cats 
are not welcome can nevertheless be irritating to the more than 8 
million americans who are allergic to them says an allergy 
specialist 
this is because cat allergen which triggers the asthmatic and 
allergic misery remains potent long after it has left the cat 
says dr jeffrey miller whose study was recently reported to the 
american academy of allergy and immunology 
in the past the classic prescription for those suffering from 
cat allergies was get rid of the cat miller says but now 
that we know that cat allergen clings to carpets and mattresses for 
months even years after the cat has departed the emphasis has to 
be on reducing or eliminating the allergen 
one way is to wash the cat regularly he says he adds that 
experiments have shown that allergen levels can be dramatically 
reduced if carpets are sprayed with a 3 percent tannic acid 
solution

some graduates at bowling green state 
university will have one extra selling point as they enter the job 
market a certificate that says they are physically fit have 
healthy lifestyles and therefore will cost a company less money in 
health care costs 
to get a fit for hire certificate students must pass tests for 
cholesterol levels blood pressure body composition aerobic 
fitness and lifestyle analysis preparation includes a meeting with 
dr richard bowers fitness director of the universitys student 
recreation center where a senior student may start an 
individualized fitness program which might include exercise a 
diet or help in breaking a cigarette habit 
students who pass all fitness tests receive a gold certificate 
they can show to prospective employers others who dont meet all 
standards get a silver certificate which states they understand 
the significance of fitness in the workplace those who do not pass 
have the option of continuing their fitness programs and trying 
again 
the university points to studies that show that a physically fit 
employee can save a company as much as 1000 a year reflecting 
lower health care costs and less absenteeism these employees are 
also less likely to smoke abuse drugs or alcohol and are more 
likely to use seat belts when driving all factors in reducing the 
chances of illness and injury 
joann kroll director of the universitys placement service 
says that she knows many recruiters from large corporations take 
fitness seriously since health care is one of the fastest rising 
costs in business they are very wellness and fitness oriented 
and we believe that they look more favorably upon students whom 
they believe are better health risks they seem to be genuinely 
impressed with fit for hire program 
bowers observes that while the certificate may give students an 
edge in the job hunt it also gets them thinking about the need for 
physical activity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle

napoleon bonaparte and thomas edison were short sleepers 
albert einstein was a long sleeper 
not everyone needs the same amount of sleep says a university 
of rochester sleep disorders specialist and not everyone needs 
eight hours of sleep a night 
yet says dr donald greenblatt the great majority of adults 
sleep between seven and nine hours and there is evidence that 
people who fall within this range live longer than those who sleep 
fewer or more hours 
napoleon and edison greenblatt says needed only four to six 
hours of sleep einstein often slept 14 to 16 hours 
the sleepiest creatures on earth says the sleep doctor are 
sloths bats and armadillos which doze as much as 20 hours of the 
day horses function well on five hours and giraffes and elephants 
sleep only four hours he says 
his advice for the most restful sleep 
keep a regular schedule getting up and retiring at about the 
same time each day 
exercise in the late afternoon exercising too close to 
bedtime may keep you awake 
sleep in a cool quiet room 
dont take sedatives or alcohol before bed though they may 
cause you to fall asleep sooner in the short run they can cause 
rebound insomnia when their effect wears off 
sleep only until refreshed

the elderly are finding insurance for 
longterm health care becoming easier to buy but not necessarily 
easier to collect says a university of michigan health insurance 
specialist 
a study conducted in several states in 198889 showed that 
very few of the longterm care policies offered were likely to 
produce a better than 5050 chance of a benefit payout reports 
william weissert professor of health care management and policy at 
the universitys school of public health 
given these odds savvy consumers should look long and hard 
before they settle on a policy 
more than a million longterm care policies have been sold by 
more than 100 companies since the mid1980s weissert notes 
he says that market is likely to increase because the dependent 
elderly population which needs help with daily tasks like bathing 
dressing and eating is expected to double in the next 12 years 
weissert points out that medicare and traditional medical 
insurance cover virtually no longterm nursing home costs which 
average about 25000 a year for basic care 
more than 50 percent of the nations elderly are likely to enter 
a nursing home he says and if they stay for more than three 
months they are unlikely ever to leave 
only 20 percent of nursing home residents staying more than 90 
days survive the stay he says 
he advises people considering buying a longterm care policy to 
shop around since policies offering the same kinds of coverage 
range from 550 to 1200 annually 
the real reason people buy longterm care policies he says is 
to protect their estates so their children and grandchildren can 
inherit them 
so i think the children should pay the premium he adds 
not everyone will agree with that of course 
since some policies have benefit periods that last only three or 
four years weissert says buyers should select a policy with the 
maximum number of benefit years they can find 
consideration also should be given to buying a policy that does 
not require a patient to have been hospitalized before entering a 
nursing home he says 
of those policies that do require prior hospitalization he 
cautions many require that patients enter the nursing home between 
14 and 30 days after they are released from the hospital 
some even require direct transfer from hospital to nursing 
home weissert says consumers should look for the longest 
grace period between hospital and nursing home they can find 
because it will give the family more time to look for the right 
nursing home

the complexities of filing claims for health care coverage can 
be bewildering for many and they may not collect what theyre 
entitled to says the owner of a service to help patients or their 
relatives sort out claims paperwork 
when a claimant is ill paperwork is the last thing on his 
mind says serena kalker who started medical claims assistance 
co in brooklyn ny when she discovered that many clients of her 
husbands accounting firm were overwhelmed by the claims process 
many claimants just give up so they pay huge medical bills 
meanwhile the funds which are intended to reimburse them 
coverage they have paid for and to which they are entitled go 
uncollected 
she says her service with fees based on a percentage of 
recoveries helps consumers avoid unexpected traps that can 
cost them money through lost or unqualified claims we try to 
make sure that the individual doesnt cheat himself by filing 
overlapping claims that allow insurors to sidestep their 
responsibilities she says

important reasons patients chose implant surgery the study found 
other reasons included mouth irritation from dentures 
inadequate support from existing teeth for bridgework and 
difficulty in speaking 
most of the maxillofacial surgeons surveyed said they have 
performed implant surgery on patients as young as the mid20s 
these findings show that missing teeth are not unique to the 
older population says dr gerald laboda the association 
president 
in appearance form and stability oral implants are the 
closest thing modern science has to natural teeth oral implants 
bond to the existing bone structure of the mouth thus eliminating 
the instability chewing difficulty and irritation many denture 
wearers endure 
barnyard chores such as feeding chickens and playing with pygmy 
goats are being used in therapy programs for headinjured patients 
animal therapy offers a unique method ot treatment because it 
uses a living responsive stimulus in treating the physically and 
mentally impaired says dr james wasco medical director of the 
new medico head injury system a nationwide network of 
rehabilitation facilities 
techniques used for the elderly and neglected children are now 
being expanded for headinjured individuals 
the barnyard program is used at the organizations lindale 
texas facility while equestrian therapy programs help 
headinjured patients at facilities in center ossipee nh and 
canonsburg pa riding horses and petting and caring for them are 
both offered in the therapy 
for both children and adults caring for an animal increases

why do some people live to be 100 
i have nothing to do with this getting old protested mary 
wallace 106 a child of slaves in georgia who raised white 
children as well as her own family of nine 
heres the secret from palmina canovi 101 were so old 
because we havent died yet 
author jim heynen and photographer paul boyer spent 1987 through 
1989 traveling the united states and canada to talk with 
centenarians about their lives 
the result is one hundred over 100 a book of interviews 
with 100 north americans in their second century of life 
heynen 49 got the idea for the book while jogging and thinking 
about aging boyer 45 joined later to take the blackandwhite 
portraits that accompany each brief interview 
i think most people do not respond well to old people 
most people equate growing old with growing sickly heynen said 
in a joint interview with boyer recently 
may this book diminish your fear of aging he wrote in the 
introduction 
the 100 subjects are not a representative sample of the 54000 
americans that the us census bureau estimates will be at least 
100 years old in 1990 
heynen sent news releases to about 100 newspapers seeking 
nominees for the book he also sought out minority centenarians 
the interviewees include 10 blacks two hispanics three 
american indians and three japaneseamericans some of the 
remaining whites were immigrants women outnumber men by 3to2 
still there is something of all of us in each of them the 
authors found 
some had survived cancer bad hearts and lifethreatening 
diseases many married several times and divorced some smoked and 
drank some broke all family records for longevity some were 
worrywarts some loved salt 
the authors also found that many of the men were masons two 
bald men began growing their hair back after age 100 
the longestlived group were single women without children but 
common traits appeared to be no children or one child a careful 
diet all their lives and a lot of caring for others both 
relatives and strangers heynen said 
many of these people have lived altruistic lives heynen 
said 
many attributed their long lives to hard work but that didnt 
always mean physical labor heynen and boyer often took it as i 
was seldom bored 
david kane a 102yearold painter whose portrait of henry clay 
folger founder of standard oil hangs in the folger library in 
washington dc is the greater miami american heart associations 
leading doortodoor fundraiser kane has died since the book was 
published 
rosa mae wolfe who never married was involved all her life in 
church work in idaho and helped found boise bible college 
kisa iseri 102 a japanese immigrant in ontario ore is a 
busy gardener she grew marijuana 20 years ago without knowing what 
it was and her daughter used it to improve the flavor of sukiyaki 
about 40 of the interviewees were in nursing homes others lived 
with relatives but some were still on their own 
meeting the centenarians caused heynen to stop smoking and 
drinking and boyer to give up coffee they also learned to savor 
life more 
knowing you could die any moment gives the sense of living for 
the moment boyer said of the centenarians we didnt start 
imitating their lifestyles where we did change was in being at 
peace with the moment

suppose youre an elderly man living alone and 
using an electric wheelchair financial difficulties force you to 
pawn the chair but you cant move without it what do you do 
imagine youre an elderly woman living alone and a salesman 
knocks on your door saying one of your friends referred him he 
comes in describes the product and you say youre not interested 
but instead of leaving he stays for hours until you sign a 
contract and buy the product now what 
in arizona you can call the elder abuse project these 
situations happened and project staff members or volunteers found 
remedies 
of 37 million arizona residents nearly 468000 are 65 or 
older the arizona center on population statistics estimates the 
center says that total grows by an estimated 250000 during winters 
about four years ago attorney general bob corbin and his chief 
assistants noticed the number of cases involving financial 
exploitation of the elderly was growing says project director 
anita oriordan the project was developed to help attorneys and 
investigators prosecute such cases and to help the victims it has 
evolved into a broader community service 
in the wheelchair case the man tried to retrieve his chair from 
the pawn shop but learned it had been sold the project persuaded 
the pawn shop to locate another electric wheelchair for him 
in the other case the woman told the abuse project that a 
carpet cleaning salesman had come to her home and stayed seven 
hours during that time he sold her an expensive vacuum system 
she couldnt use 
the woman suffered from a heart condition and was so upset by 
the salesmans visit that she spent the night in a hospital 
emergency room when she returned home she was told by the carpet 
cleaning company that she was too late to cancel the contract that 
contract included a lien on her home if she failed to make payments 
on the system 
ms oriordan contacted the companys headquarters in another 
state the company refunded nearly 2000 to the woman and released 
her from the contract 
situations like these happen all the time and not only to older 
people ms oriordan said 
but older people are more likely to become victims because they 
are more trusting she said many grew up in small towns where 
everybody knew everybody else and a handshake was enough 
even after theyve been taken theyll say something like 
i cant believe he would do that he looked so nice said jack 
confer of the project staff 
among other cases were 
alleged fraudulent sales of fiberglass burial containers 
totaling about 550000 a man was charged in april with violating 
the arizona consumer fraud act 
a phoenix man pleaded guilty in may in connection with 
fraudulent sales of energysaving products under the plea 
agreement he will be liable for restitution to victims the 
investigation was triggered by a complaint to the project 
the office also sometimes prosecutes physical abuse cases those 
cases are referred first to either the department of health 
services or adult protective services but the agencies may refer a 
case back to the elder abuse project 
a case usually starts with project and ends with the project 
which can prosecute physical abuse as either a criminal or civil 
case confer said 
the project has three fulltime paid staff members plus an 
average of 35 volunteers a year the 82000 in salaries and other 
costs are covered within the attorney generals budget 
some people bring their complaints to the project others use 
its fraudline phone number additionally volunteers travel to 
senior centers throughout the state 
after someone contacts the project a volunteer assists in 
preparing a complaint for the projects files if the matter 
involves an individual or company licensed by a state agency the 
elder is assisted in filing a complaint with that agency 
project staff members and volunteers work to clarify issues in 
the case verify facts and obtain documentation they may consult 
experts 
the staff then may try to resolve the complaint through 
mediation or it may be referred to the appropriate division of the 
attorney generals office 
volunteers also speak at crime prevention meetings arranged in 
response to community or group requests 
under the projects beep system for beware of elderly 
exploitation program volunteers are trained to speak to community 
groups about health quackery financial exploitation and how not 
to be a victim the project also offers a brochure consumer 
protection kit an older persons guide

louisiana barely able to balance its 
budget each year may be the only state that does not finance a 
program to curb abuse of the elderly 
an estimated 15 million older americans or 5 percent of all 
elderly are abused each year up from 1 million in 1980 according 
to a congressional report only one in eight cases is reported 
according to estimates 
information was not available from 10 states in the 1989 survey 
for the us house select committee on aging of the other 40 only 
louisiana provided no money for adult protective services 
a program still exists under state law but the money ran out in 
1988 and has not been included in the state budget since 
its not that nobody wants to provide money for adult 
protection gov buddy roemer included 14 million for the program 
in his proposed budget for the fiscal year that started july 1 
however the legislature couldnt reach a consensus on numerous 
roemer tax proposals and lawmakers found themselves having to trim 
hundreds of millions of dollars in programs in the sessions final 
hours 
they salvaged an 85 million teacher pay raise part of a 
threeyear commitment that was among roemers highest priorities 
but they couldnt save numerous other programs including adult 
protective services 
an aps office would check out complaints of abuse or reports of 
adults unable because of age or other reasons to take care of 
themselves said brenda kelly of the state department of social 
services 
if the reports were valid the office could then refer the 
victim or the victims loved ones to the proper government or 
private agency 
police and local councils on aging the offices that run 
federal and statefinanced programs for old people do what they 
can kelly said 
but when you look at law enforcement and councils on aging 
theyre pretty stretched she said 
mike edwards administrative director of the jefferson parish 
council on aging agrees 
there is a need out there for it we have the legislation on 
the books the authority to investigate lies with adult protective 
services workers he said theres nothing we can do were 
strapped 
reestablishing an adult protective services system would give 
the public a single place to call to report abuse and neglect 
problems kelly said 
relying on information from local councils on aging i think 
whats missing is that frontend piece some central place that 
the public can call and have someone look into it she said 
when the money ran out in 1988 12 people were working adult 
protective services cases statewide kelly said often those people 
also were working on programs protecting children too 
the total monthly case load for adult protective services staff 
members from june 1985 through june 1988 averaged more than 800 
kelly said 
the 14 million kelly had hoped would be available this year 
would have paid for a staff of 44 that would have concentrated 
efforts in 12 of the states more populous parishes which are 
louisians equivalent of counties

for many people summer is the time for 
swimming sailing picnics and outdoor recreation however summer 
heat and sun can be treacherous 
older people should be wary of food poisoning and heat strokes 
two potentially fatal illnesses associated with summer 
these days most people do not give much thought to food 
posoning modern methods to preserve food and retard bacteria 
should make the food we eat safe bacteria such as salmonella 
botulism staphylococcus and campylobacter are presumed to be fears 
of a former generation 
in fact most people would be surprised to learn that about 2 
million cases of food poisoning occur each year in this country due 
to improper handling of food in the home 
food poisoning can become epidemic at picnics or other events 
where food is left unrefrigerated for a long time when power 
outages cause refrigerators to shut down and from canning 
procedures that fail to kill bacteria 
older people are especially vulnerable to foodborne illness 
because they are more likely to have medical problems that lower 
their resistance 
further many people experience sensory losses that affect food 
handling older people with impaired vision for example may have 
problems recognizing spoiled food or dirty utensils 
diminished taste and smell also may be significant in 
determining if food is spoiled older people who live on a fixed 
income may be wary of throwing food away and in order to hold 
utility bills down refrigerators often are kept above the 
recommended 40 degrees 
the following precautions can eliminate most sources of bacteria 
and prevent food poisoning 
refrigerate food at 40 degrees freeze it at 0 degrees 
fahrenheit 
freeze raw meat and poultry that will not be used within two 
days 
to thaw food place it in the refrigerator not on the 
counter where bacteria can grow quickly 
make sure food and utensils are clean 
wash hands with soap and water before preparing food 
cook food thoroughly including food prepared in a microwave 
avoid recipes that call for raw eggs or raw fish 
freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly 
never leave a perishable food out of the refrigerator for more 
than two hours 
symptoms of food poisoning include diarrhea abdominal pain and 
nausea sometimes it is accompanied by fever and general discomfort 
the us department of agriculture has established a tollfree 
number to respond to consumer questions about safe handling of meat 
and poultry call 18005354555 from 10 am to 4 pm weekdays 
for information on proper food handling 
heat exhaustion and heat stroke are other potentially dangerous 
conditions associated with hot weather many people become 
needlessly ill each year because they do not take simple 
preventive steps 
heat exhaustion is a warning that the body is getting too hot 
symptoms include thirst giddiness weakness nausea and profuse 
sweating if not attended to heat exhaustion can develop into a 
more serious condition known as heat stroke 
older people are especially vulnerable to heatrelated 
illnesses changes that can effect a persons ability to cope with 
heat include inefficient sweat glands poor circulation and changes 
in the skin 
frail older people who cannot move easily to a cooler place or 
who are not aware of the heat also are in jeopardy 
some medications such as diuretics sedatives and tranquilizers 
and certain heart and blood pressure drugs may affect the way an 
individual copes with heat dont discontinue medication but 
discuss potential problems with a doctor 
diseases that require special diets also may make a person more 
vulnerable to heat stroke people with high blood pressure for 
example generally reduce the amount of salt in their diet making 
temperature regulation more difficult however a person should not 
take salt tablets without consent of a doctor 
avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke by following some simple 
steps 
drink plenty of water and juices 
wear lightweight lightcolored and loosefitting clothing 
avoid activity during the hottest part of the day 
keep meals simple and light keep oven use to a minimum 
use airconditioners liberally or if none is available plan 
trips to cool places such as shopping malls theaters and libraries 
anyone suspected of suffering heat stroke should receive 
immediate attention victims of heat stroke have a body temperature 
of 104 degrees or higher the pulse may be rapid 
other symptoms may include flushed skin a faint feeling 
confused and bizarre behavior and combativeness if symptoms are 
mild get into a cool place drink nonalcoholic noncaffeinated 
fluids and sponge off with cool water or take a cool bath or 
shower 
if symptoms are severe get emergency medical assistance 
immediately without quick attention heat stroke is frequently 
deadly especially for older people

new help for the poorest elderly and 
improvements for those who buy private insurance to supplement 
medicare coverage are being urged by the us bipartisan commission 
on comprehensive health care 
known as the pepper commission in honor of the late rep claude 
pepper a champion of the elderly the panel said implementation of 
the recommendations would close gaps in medicare that expose the 
elderly to considerable financial risk and may result in their 
receiving less health care 
the recommendations are intended to complete the commissions 
set of proposals for a comprehensive national policy designed to 
provide adequate health care and longterm care for all americans 
the newest proposals would 
help the poorest elderly pay premiums deductibles and 
copayments required under medicare the commission said this would 
require 26 billion in additional federal spending if implemented 
this year 
expand medicare to cover certain preventative services 
including tests for cancer and prostate screening estimated yearly 
cost 200 million 
end or reduce abuses in private insurance coverage by creating 
federal standards for medigap insurance 
the standards would include requiring insurers to pay out a 
higher proportion of their premium revenue as benefits bar 
insurers from refusing to sell insurance to anyone based on health 
standards and develop simpler and easier to understand premium 
language to be standard for each company 
establish registries of medigap policies to minimize 
duplication of coverage

the official us government poverty line 
understates the number of americans who live in poverty a report 
by the families usa foundation says 
the report estimated that 45 million people live in real life 
poverty in the united states significantly higher than the 32 
million counted by the government 
the report also said that by its standards the poor are more 
likely to be white older and bettereducated than government 
figures would indicate 
the report is based on an analysis of 3511 responses to four 
gallup polls conducted between july and october 1989 
people were asked what income they would use as a poverty line 
for a family of four in their communities the average response was 
15017 a year compared to the governments official poverty line 
of 12092 
ron pollack the foundations president contended the 
government poverty line is based on an arbitrary and outdated 
formula 
the real life poverty line is rooted in the experience of 
americas consumers who know the real costs they have to pay to 
purchase the essential necessities of life pollack said

as a child tom flatley was separated from his 
parents and placed with his brother in a missouri home for the 
retarded mentally ill and criminally insane even though both 
children were normal in all respects 
flatley now 79 who suffered environmental retardation 
because of his surroundings has returned to the same institution 
as a volunteer working with children who need help 
flatley is a part of foster grandparents a lowkey relatively 
inexpensive government program that pairs lowincome elderly people 
with children in need 
foster grandparents is celebrating its 25th anniversary this 
summer and flatley and 27 of his colleagues from programs around 
the country were welcomed to the white house by president bush and 
his wife barbara to mark the occasion 
over the last quartercentury since president johnson signed 
enabling legislation on aug 28 1965 400000 foster grandparents 
have offered cheer and a ready ear to millions of children 
today there are 27000 foster grandparents ages 60 to 100 
each is paid a stipend of 220 an hour for 20 hours of work 
each week some get assistance with transportation and meals and 
each is eligible for a free yearly physical checkup sixty is the 
minimum eligible age an income near the poverty line also is a 
requirement 
the volunteers serve some 79000 children with special needs in 
275 programs in every state the district of columbia and puerto 
rico the programs budget last year was 58 million 
foster grandparents are found in halfway houses schools head 
start facilities drug abuse rehabilitation centers foster homes 
juvenile detention centers and homes for unwed mothers 
the children they help may be blind deaf or retarded they may 
be emotionally disturbed or suffer from drug or alcohol abuse 
parental neglect or abuse learning disorders or any combination of 
conditions 
some are boarder babies abandoned at birth and cared for at 
hospitals 
many were born to addicted parents and suffer the inherited 
effects of alcohol or drug abuse many are aids babies born to a 
parent who has the disease 
some of these situations are not in any way easy says nancy 
yde public affairs director for action the federal domestic 
volunteer agency that directs the foster grandparents program 
she said one foster grandparent is working with an emotionally 
disturbed child who killed her father saying she did so because he 
had killed her mother 
at the white house ceremony mrs bush said the need is growing 
for older people with precious gifts to exchange with the 
children of this world 
mrs bush said william bennett head of the us governments 
war against drugs told her that more foster grandeparents are 
needed than ever before because unfortunately the boarder babies 
and the other babies that need you are multiplying 
tom flatley says he talks to the mentally retarded children with 
whom he works and reads them stories 
they can do for themselves a little bit but i help them 
along he says one little boy can walk a little with help 
the other child i have doesnt respond at all but he still 
needs someone to love him flatley told action for a profile 
written about his work children all over the country need 
someone to love them and i am going to do my part

oil prices rose more than 3 a barrel today after 
japan and the european community joined other nations in halting 
imports of iraqi oil to protest the invasion of kuwait china 
halted weapons sales to iraq 
australias government today banned oil imports from iraq and 
kuwait and defense sales to iraq revoking an export license for 
the sale of 680000 worth of engine components to the iraqi air 
force 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was 2659 a barrel in london this 
morning up from fridays closing price of 2348 
in early trading today on the new york mercantile exchange the 
september contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude was trading at 2675 a 42gallon barrel up 
226 from fridays close 
the rising prices led to fears of inflation and stock prices 
fell in tokyo london and the united states 
japan which imports 99 percent of its oil announced sunday it 
would stop importing iraqi oil it also imposed an embargo on oil 
from kuwait which iraq seized thursday 
japans prime minister toshiki kaifu said today that 142 days 
worth of oil reserves should cushion the impact for japan 
nevertheless the tokyo stock exchange took a sharp tumble the 
nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues closed at 2859953 
points down 91623 points or 31 percent 
in london at midday the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index was down 604 points or 26 percent at 22242 
on wall street the closely watched dow jones industrial 
averaged plunged around 93 points to the 2716 level in the first 
half hour of trading 
in beijing premier li peng reiterated chinas opposition to 
iraqs invasion of kuwait and said beijing supports the un 
security council resolution condemning the invasion and demanding 
an immediate pullout 
under such circumstances it is only natural that china will 
not sell arms to iraq he said 
western intelligence reports indicate china has sold billions of 
dollars worth of arms to iraq including silkworm missiles but 
beijing has denied supplying weapons 
the soviet union and france iraqs main arms suppliers halted 
weapons sales to baghdad last week 
the governments of france italy and spain declared sunday they 
would follow ec guidelines and impose sanctions voted by that group 
saturday sanctions include oil embargoes freezing of kuwaiti and 
iraqi assets and ending preferential trade agreements with baghdad 
this significantly broadened the campaign to punish baghdad 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington that 
president bush welcomed tokyos decision 
such measures will help intensify international pressures 
aimed at achieving the immediate complete and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraq from kuwait fitzwater said 
just hours after thursdays invasion washington imposed an 
embargo on oil and other imports from iraq and froze iraqi and 
kuwaiti assets in the united states 
japans action was seen as especially tough because tokyo has 
taken a low profile in the middle east with an eye to guaranteeing 
oil imports 
kaifu said the iraqi invasion was not a permissible act 
the sanctions he said will press iraq to consider its action 
and we have to consider how this will affect our people 
japan relied on iraq and kuwait for 112 percent of its oil 
supplies in the first quarter of the year the trade ministry says 
this is a problem that will have an effect on our lives to 
some extent kaifu conceded we will come up with necesssary 
measures to cope with the problem but japan after the past oil 
crises has 142 days of reserves 
iraq and kuwait supplied about 11 percent of the european 
communitys oil needs those countries will face difficulties 
roughly equal to japans in maintaining oil supplies if the crisis 
drags on for a long time 
kaifu called on japanese to conserve energy a recurrent theme 
this summer as a long hot spell had the tokyo areas electricity 
generators working at full capacity 
the dollar was lower on concerns about the effect of high oil 
prices on the us economy it closed at 14950 up 015 yen from 
fridays close of 14935 yen 
oil traders in asia say japanese companies made large purchases 
of iranian oil over the weekend to bolster their positions ahead of 
the announcement of the oil embargo 
japans sanctions also include a freeze on iraqi assets in 
japan suspending loans to iraq and banning investment and 
financing in both iraq and kuwait 
the sanctions will hurt japanese companies hoping to recover 
debts from iraq which owes 46 billion to japan much of that 
held by the private sector repayments were coming through sales of 
iraqi oil to japan

economic reprisals against iraq are piling up 
as europe and japan join the us boycott of iraqi oil but for 
international pressure to defeat the invasion of kuwait two middle 
eastern neighbors may have to take an even tougher step 
turkey and saudi arabia would have to choke off the oil 
pipelines literally 
more than half of iraqs daily export of 314 million barrels 
pours through two pipelines one through saudi arabia and the other 
through turkey the rest is shipped in tankers through the straits 
of hormuz which have become difficult to traverse because of 
wreckage and mines left over from the iraniraq war 
despite subtle pressure from president bush neither saudi 
arabia nor turkey has been willing so far to incur the wrath of 
iraqi president saddam hussein by taking such a dramatic step with 
iraqi forces massed menacingly along its border saudi arabia seems 
particularly vulnerable 
in an apparent attempt to forestall such a blockade iraq today 
notified turkey it would stop pumping through one of the two 
pipelines and would use only 70 percent of the capacity of the 
second turkeys semiofficial anatolia news agency reported 
many experts believe the current embargo will be difficult to 
sustain without oil from iraq and kuwait prices will rise and 
economic growth will drop distasteful scenarios in any of the 
western democracies 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
predicted the oil boycott could collapse some people lie some 
people dont get on board he said on cbstv sunday aspin said 
a blockade cutting off iraqi oil deliveries might stand a better 
chance of forcing saddam to blink 
saddam hussein did not make his decision lightly said james 
schlesinger a former defense and energy secretary and onetime cia 
director because he has decided to accept the diplomatic flak 
it will be hard to bluff him out of his booty 
international navies especially the americans french and 
british which maintain ships in the indian ocean could mount a 
sea blockade at the southern tip of the straits of hormuz but to 
be fully effective such a move would have to be carried out jointly 
with a disruption of the land pipelines 
incensed at saddams flagrant invasion of his tiny neighbor last 
thursday the united states succeeded in gaining unprecedented 
international support for a campaign to strangle iraqs limping 
economy 
the administration followed by the 12nation european economic 
community wealthy japan and canada banned oil purchases from 
iraq the soviets french and chinese iraqs main arms suppliers 
promised not to send saddam any weapons 
the united states britain and japan froze kuwaits considerable 
assets so that iraq couldnt loot them and banned food shipments 
to baghdad japan one of iraqs main bankers also suspended 
lending to cashhungry saddam 
saddam his economy in tatters from a ravaging eightyear war 
with iran is vulnerable he launched the invasion of kuwait after 
failing to pressure that country into reducing oil production so 
world oil prices would rise and fill iraqs coffers 
saddam faces 45 percent inflation food shortages and a lack of 
ready cash for badly needed reconstruction despite massive oil 
reserves iraq is second only in proven reserves to saudi arabia 
debtridden iraq has had trouble getting loans 
but saddam by all accounts a clever man probably figured the 
potential gain from taking over kuwaits bountiful oil fields and 
rich treasury was worth the risk he knows a successful oil embargo 
against iraq could backfire by punishing western motorists with 
higher gasoline prices schlesinger wrote in the washington post 
barely a day into the us sanctions prices at many gas 
stations went up several cents despite the fact that little us 
oil comes from iraq and that oil storage facilities here are full 
to overflowing 
price hikes are unlikely to sit well with americans 
were back to driving big cars again said sen john glenn 
dohio will the american public make a longterm commitment to 
seeing that those oil lanes remain open from the mideast thats 
something weve never done 
european leaders too might have a problem getting support for 
a longterm oil boycott europe imports 11 percent of its oil from 
iraq and kuwait 
finally there are many who believe saddam a military man 
only understands one language sanctions said kuwaiti ambassador 
saud nassir alsabah take months and months to have any 
effective return to deal with this man and with his regimes he 
can only understand force

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states plunged again this week dropping by 30 to 966 
baker hughes inc reported 
last week the count dropped by 26 to 996 a year ago this week 
the count was 874 
ike kerridge a vice president at baker hughes who keeps track 
of the count attributed the decline to weak gasoline prices in the 
past few months he said the effects of the higher gas prices that 
followed iraqs invasion of kuwait probably will not be felt in the 
drilling industry for several weeks 
gas prices have been very disappointing for several months i 
think there is a time lag so you havent had the effect of higher 
oil prices id expect increased drilling before too many 
weeks kerridge said monday 
baker hughes rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs 
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the 
number of producing wells 
the houstonbased oil toolmaker company has kept track of the 
rig count the widely watched index of drilling activity since 
1940 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states texas count was down by 16 
oklahoma lost 10 and new mexico was down by seven pennsylvania 
lost four michigan was down six and california and colorado lost 
two rigs each 
wyoming gained nine rigs louisianas count increased by seven 
and north dakota was up two

the crisis in the persian gulf sent more shock 
waves through the financial markets today with stocks bonds and 
the dollar plunging because of anxiety about the economic impact of 
rising oil prices 
the panicky selling on wall street meanwhile heightened the 
demand for treasury bills considered among the most secure 
investments anywhere shortterm interest rates declined as a 
result 
the situation is sort of confused and chaotic said robert 
a brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities co 
international investors are adrift they dont know what to do 
the dow jones industrial average the bestknown barometer of 
the stock market declined about 85 points to the 2724 level by 
1230 pm edt today after slipping as much as 105 points earlier 
in the trading session 
in the broader market declining issues far outpaced advances 
among stocks listed on the new york stock exchange 
overseas stocks also fell sharply 
the early plunge tripped socalled circuit breakers designed 
by the nations financial markets to cushion market declines in 
stocks and stock index futures 
the nyse said a sidecar computer arrangement had assumed the 
role of handling computerdriven program trades which sometimes 
can inject volatility into prices nyse spokesman richard 
torrenzano said the nations biggest stock exchange was weathering 
the session with no problems 
traders said speculation that sharply higher oil prices stemming 
from iraqs invasion of neighboring kuwait last week could trigger 
a recession accompanied by rising inflation were responsible for 
todays selloff 
the outlook for stocks had been decidedly bad for quite 
awhile said brusca the problems in the middle east have made 
things worse 
a key issue now is what action the federal reserve might take in 
directing interest rates economists said inflationary pressures 
are high as oil prices continue to soar but recent economic data 
have shown the economy is weakening and could fall into a 
recession they said 
those concerns contributed to the drop in the bond market 
investors unwilling to lock their money into anything long 
range dumped longterm treasury bonds the governments bellwether 
30year issue for instance plunged about 1 points or 1250 per 
1000 face amount by midday today the drop was far less 
dramatic however in shorterterm bonds and notes 
in foreign exchange trading the dollar also weakend against 
most major currencies although it was showing some signs of 
recovery

foreign currencies in dealings in europe where traders appeared to 
focus on recent evidence of weakness in the us economy 
gold prices were higher 
market participants said the dollar slipped mostly in the 
absence of fresh news from the middle east where last weeks iraqi 
invasion of kuwait has raised grave doubts about the stability of 
the region and drove the dollar higher as investors sought safety 
in the currency 
todays decline reflected speculation that weakness in the us 
economy will prompt the federal reserve to encourage lower interest 
rates traders said 
it if hadnt been for iraqkuwait the dollar would have 
dropped to these levels days ago said a senior trader at a large 
frankfurt bank

maintenance records 
us district judge i leo glasser in brooklyn released all 
eight without bail and continued proceedings to sept 12 
prosecutors allege the violations took place from july 1985 to 
october 1989 and were meant to avoid expensive flight delays and 
cancellations 
phony records allegedly were kept at kennedy international and 
la guardia airports in new york hartsfield international airport 
in atlanta and eastern headquarters in miami 
eastern and the managers were indicted july 25 on charges of 
conspiracy to defraud the government wire fraud falsification of 
documents and obstruction of justice it was the first time an 
airline has faced a criminal indictment 
attorney jane parver entered the innocent plea on behalf of 
eastern the eight managers appeared in court but made no 
statements other than to enter their pleas

higher airline ticket prices almost certainly 
await us travelers with jet fuel costs rising due to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait industry analysts said monday 
northwest airlines announced an 8 fuel surcharge on friday 
other airlines said they were considering whether to follow suit 
but several said such increases were still premature 
we have not decided to put such a surcharge on yet said 
delta air lines spokeswoman glenda johnson i cant say that we 
wont but we dont want to pass these costs on to the consumer 
she said the airline considered it premature to increase 
ticket costs but didnt rule out an eventual price hike she said 
delta calculated that each pennypergallon increase in jet fuel 
prices costs the airline about 20 million a year the average 
domestic price of jet fuel is 61 cents a gallon 
spokesmen for continental airlines pan american and eastern 
airlines each said their companies were considering increases to 
offset fuel costs but hadnt reached a decision yet 
united air lines said it had decided not to comment on the issue 
robert j joedicke an airline analyst at shearson lehman 
brothers inc called northwests price increase a little 
premature because most fuel contracts arent negotiated until the 
end of the month 
but he added its safe to say there will be an eventual 
increase by other airlines im certain that depending on the 
magnitude of oil price increases that there will have to a pass 
through 
david swierenga assistant vice president of airline industry 
data for the air transport association a washingtonbased industry 
group pointed out that a 5abarrel rise in world crude oil costs 
raises jet fuel prices by about 15 cents a gallon 
the industry consumes about 15 billion gallons of jet fuel a 
year he said every penny increase in the price translates 
into an added 150 million in costs if in fact the industry is 
faced with a 15centagallon increase that translates into 225 
billion in added costs 
such an increase could well lead to higher ticket prices he 
said 
but he said that with air travel approaching the postlabor day 
lull airlines try to hold back or temper any price hikes to avoid 
cutting too deeply into consumer demand

shorthaul aircraft will be delivered next month the rest will be 
shipped by the end of the year 
shafti added that a number of iranian pilots and engineers were 
being trained in the netherlands at fokkers expense irna said 
iran with one of the fastest growing populations in the world 
has faced surging demand for air travel 
aviation experts say the fokker100s are too small for iran 
airs needs the fokkers are normally equipped with 120 passenger 
seats 
iran air ideally would have liked to buy the newer boeing 757s 
767s or airbuses but it has been unable to add to its fleet of 
usmanufactured boeing aircraft and europeanmade airbus planes 
due to american embargoes banning the export of american technology 
to irans antiamerican government 
airbus aircraft manufacted by aerospatiale a european 
consortium are powered by americanmade jet engines

the federal reserve board will lower 
shortterm interest rates soon to stimulate a tottering economy 
that faces a damaging new blow from higher oil prices resulting 
from iraqs invasion of kuwait analysts predicted monday 
an economy that already had slowed to barely perceptible growth 
during the first half of the year is threatened further by 
embargoes imposed by the united states and many other western 
nations on imports of iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
as a result many analsysts said the federal reserve probably 
will nudge its federal funds rate down from 8 percent to 7 percent 
to stimulate growth 
the federal funds rate the interest charged by the fed for 
overnight loans to banks has remained high for more than a year as 
the central bank sought to slow the economy and reduce inflationary 
pressures 
historically the fed has actively fought inflation only as 
long as the economy was not threatened by recession economist 
samuel d kahan wrote in the current issue of perspectives the 
fuji securities inc weekly commentary 
when it appears that the us economy is about to fall into a 
recession the fed must shift its policy efforts he said 
recent economic releases suggest that we have entered this zone 
and we look for the fed to shift its policy directive and emphasize 
economic growth 
we expect the fed to ease the federal funds rate to 7 percent 
any day soon said mark m zandi an economist with regional 
financial associates in west chester pa 
if the united states manages to escape a recession induced by 
middle east developments some analysts said higher energy costs 
combined with rising unemployment would produce something similar 
to the stagflation of the late 1970s 
its wont be as severe but its an unpleasant 
combination said donald straszheim chief economist with merrill 
lynch capital markets in new york 
charles schultze former chairman of the white house council of 
economic advisers in the carter administration suggested during a 
weekend tv interview that the iraqi invasion could produce a mild 
recession if nothing else happens 
many private economists believe the stagnant economy is as close 
to nogrowth as possible without actually being negative right 
now were skirting the edge of a recession says robert g 
dederick chief economist of northern trust co of chicago the 
economy is just creeping ahead 
the gross national product the nations total output of goods 
and services rose just 12 percent in the second quarter some 
economists said the economy had worsened in july even before the 
iraqi invasion 
however zandi and some other analysts noted that business 
inventories one of the classic portents of a recession had 
declined since the first of the year 
in other major recessions businesses accumulated big 
inventories zandi said resulting in production declines and job 
layoffs to correct the situation 
zandi predicted that unemployment will reach about 6 percent by 
years end the jobless rate rose to 56 percent in july the 
highest level in two years it exceeded 10 percent during the last 
recession in 198182

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
monday on the chicago board of trade paced by sharp gains in corn 
and soybeans as the surging crude oil and gold markets stoked 
inflation fears 
the jump of more than 3 per barrel in crude oil futures also 
sparked speculation that the soviet union which exports oil to 
european countries might soon have more money to spend on grain 
imports said joel karlin a grain market analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
there are ideas that the higher crude prices will give them a 
few more dollars to play with and putting two and two together 
theyll have more to spend on food karlin said 
crudeoil traders bid prices up dramatically monday in reaction 
to the iraqi occupation of kuwait and the potential for further 
armed conflict in the middle east 
karlin said unseasonably cool overnight temperatures in the 
midwest revived concerns about the possibility of early frost 
damage to soybeans which added further support 
but karlin said market fundamentals remained bearish for 
example the agriculture departments weekly grain 
exportinspections report indicated export demand for us grains 
and soybeans is relatively sluggish 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 283 a bushel corn 
was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 254 a bushel 
oats were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with september at 117 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 13 cents higher with august at

former wall street trader salim b sandy 
lewis agreed monday to pay 475000 to settle a securities and 
exchange commission lawsuit arising from his guilty plea to 
criminal stock manipulation charges 
the sec suit filed monday in federal court alleged lewis 
violated securities laws by helping to manipulate the price of 
firemans fund corp stock in 1986 the same accusations to which 
he pleaded guilty in a criminal proceeding 
sec attorney bruce hiler said the 475000 would be placed in a 
fund and an administrator would return the money to victims of the 
scheme 
lewis 51 of short hills nj also consented to an order that 
bars him from any future securities violations 
although we believe no one was hurt by the trades in question 
and there were no financial losses by investors in the marketplace 
the settlement was made to avoid lengthy and costly litigation with 
the government lewis attorney theodore wells jr said 
during his guilty plea last august lewis admitted that he 
manipulated the stock price of the firemans fund in may 1986 on 
the same day american express co planned to sell to the public a 
large part of its stock in firemans fund 
lewis was implicated by west coast trader boyd l jefferies who 
said he helped in the firemans fund stock manipulation 
lewis was sentenced to three years probation and a 250000 
fine his former firm sb lewis amp co also pleaded guilty in the 
criminal case 
jefferies was sentenced to five years probation and a 250000 
fine

gold futures prices climbed strongly monday on new yorks 
commodity exchange reflecting growing fears that the soaring price 
of crude oil will lead to higher inflation 
crude oil futures rose to their highest levels in more than 4 
years as iraq and the united states appeared to be headed for a 
showdown over iraqi aggression in the middle east 
on other commodity markets grain and soybean futures rose and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 730 to 780 higher in new york with the 
contract for delivery in august at 38470 a troy ounce silver 
ended 5 cents to 57 cents higher with september at 492 a troy 
ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil finished 1 to 356 higher with september at 2805 a 
barrel the highest settlement for a nearmonth crude oil contract 
since the latter half of 1985 heating oil futures settled 3 cents 
to 897 cents higher with september at 7555 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 3 cents to 934 cents higher with september 
at 8152 cents a gallon 
strength in petroleum and precious metals as well as weakness 
in the stock market was attributed almost entirely to investor 
fears that iraqs occupation of kuwait could draw the united states 
into a middle east war 
especially disturbing analysts said were reports that 28 
americans were in iraqi hands that american naval forces were in 
position to launch an aerial attack on baghdad and that iraq 
appeared to be increasing the size of its force near the border 
between kuwait and saudi arabia 
you have iraqs leader and you have president bush and theyre 
looking at saudi arabia staring each other down seeing who will 
be the first to flinch said bernard savaiko senior metals 
analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
analysts said the gold market was thinly traded and seemed to 
have encountered strong resistance near a bid of 385 an ounce 
they said the markets next move probably would depend on overnight 
developments in the middle east 
grain and soybean futures rose on the chicago board of trade 
paced by sharp gains in corn and soybeans as the surging crude oil 
and gold markets stoked inflation fears 
crudes gains also sparked speculation that the soviet union 
which exports oil to european countries might soon have more money 
to spend on grain imports said joel karlin a grainmarket analyst 
with research department inc in chicago 
karlin said unseasonably cool overnight temperatures in the 
midwest revived concerns about the possibility of early frost 
damage to lateplanted soybeans which added further support 
after the close the agriculture department released weekly 
cropprogress statistics showing slight deterioration in the 
condition of the soybean crop and slight improvemet in the corn 
crops condition although both crops remained in mostly good to 
excellent shape 
crop development continued to lag far behind the normal pace a 
function of the heavy spring rains that delayed planting in some 
areas 
a national weather service forecast for cooler and dryer than 
normal weather in the midwest during the first half of next week 
could add to worries about the crops analysts said 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with 
september at 282 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents higher 
with september at 254 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 2 cents 
higher with september at 116 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 
13 cents higher with august at 595 a bushel 
slack demand and lower cash prices weighed on cattle futures on 
the chicago mercantile exchange most pork futures advanced paced 
by powerful gains in pork bellies reflecting strengthening demand 
live cattle futures settled unchanged to 35 cent lower with 
august at 7695 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent to 40 
cent lower with august at 8855 cents a pound live hogs were 03 
cent lower to 82 cent higher with august at 5872 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with 
august at 5055 cents a pound

the dollar lost more ground monday against all 
major foreign currencies except the japanese yen amid speculation 
that recent signs of economic weakness will lead to lower us 
interest rates 
but the decline was tempered by uncertainties about iraqs 
occupation of persian gulf neighbor kuwait those worries made 
traders reluctant to push the dollar lower because of the 
possibility that a military outbreak could send investors in search 
of the perceived safety of the currency 
gold prices climbed benefiting from its status as a haven 
against international turmoil and a hedge against inflation 
the dollar moved sharply lower as trading resumed in the united 
states pushing the dollar toward its lowest level in 2 years 
against the german mark but the dollar later recovered somewhat as 
rumors swirled about what may happen overnight in the persian gulf 
this is all emotional trading said liliana nealon first 
vice president at the new york office of the union bank of 
switzerland 
she said traders expect interest rates to fall in the united 
states in the wake of last weeks unemployment report that 
indicated the economy may be headed toward a recession increasing 
chances that the federal reserve would encourage lower interest 
rates 
but she said they are fearful that an eruption of new military 
action in the persian gulf would drive the dollar higher because 
investors view it as the safest to hold during international 
turmoil 
president bush said monday he was ruling out nothing at all 
including a military blockade to choke off iraqi trade in response 
to iraqs invasion of kuwait last week 
the invasion has led to sharply higher oil prices around the 
world and triggered a big drop monday in world stock prices 
the dollar gained against the japanese yen largely because the 
japanese economy is seen as vulnerable to oil price hikes since 
japan depends almost entirely on imported oil 
by the end of trading in new york the dollar had risen to 
15035 yen up from 149925 yen late friday earlier the dollar 
rose to a closing 14950 yen in tokyo from 14935 yen on friday in 
london it rose to 14955 yen 
but the dollar lost ground against the british pound in new 
york the pound rose to 18725 from 185375 late friday in 
london the pound rose to 18725 from 18570 late friday 
it also dropped against the german mark falling to 157875 
marks from 15935 marks late friday that approached the lowest 
level for the dollar since it hit an intraday low of 15615 marks 
jan 4 1988 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late rates 
friday included 13310 swiss francs down from 13505 52890 
french francs down from 53415 115450 italian lire down from 
116600 and 114955 canadian dollars down from 115125 
selected late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
friday included 15762 german marks down from 15920 13315 
swiss francs down from 13505 52863 french francs down from 
53345 17760 dutch guilders down from 17945 115400 italian 
lire down from 116490 and 11490 canadian dollars down from 
11510 
selected midday dollar rates in new york included 15770 german 
marks 13255 swiss francs 115000 italian lire and 115125 
canadian dollars 
gold prices moved higher in what analysts said reflected the 
uncertain international state gold is often seen as a haven in 
troubled times and is also seen as offering a hedge against 
inflation 
on new york commodity exchange gold for current delivery rose 
730 an ounce to 38470 at republic national bank in new york 
an ounce of gold was quoted at 384 an ounce as of 4 pm edt up 
675 from late friday

a massachusetts official filed a complaint monday 
against a shearson lehman hutton inc agent accusing him of 
squandering the life savings of a 90yearold widow 
a complaint filed by secretary of state michael j connollys 
office alleges that george prebola a shearson vice president and 
registered agent based in boston conducted unsuitable and highly 
speculative trading with money invested by mary dillon of walpole 
mass who was on a fixed income 
connollys office is seeking to have prebolas license revoked 
and to have prebola and shearson return the money they made from 
her investments 
steven kaigen a shearson spokesman in new york said the matter 
had been settled privately in may between shearson and lawyers for 
dillons granddaughter bernadette carty he said the firm had had 
no previous problems with prebola 
we will work with the commonwealth of massachusetts to resolve 
the matter kaigen said 
the complaint alleged that prebola engaged in dishonest and 
unethical conduct that resulted in dillon losing almost all of her 
initial investment of 150000 
from the initial investment prebola earned commissions of about 
87000 and shearson earned interest charged on margin debts of 
about 36000 the complaint alleges 
dillon who has since died sold her house when her husband died 
and sought to invest the proceeds said marty meehan a deputy 
secretary of state 
according to the complaint carty sought an investor in april 
1985 to invest her grandmothers money and provide her with a 
secure income 
prebola assured carty that dillons funds would be safely and 
profitably invested the complaint alleges 
but in 1986 and 1987 prebola changed dillons investment 
objective from a conservative investment strategy of appreciation 
with safety to speculative the complaint alleged 
the complaint also alleges that on several occasions prebola 
altered dillons personal account information to make her look like 
a younger more experienced investor 
the pattern of trading conducted in the dillon accounts by 
prebola was clearly unsuitable for a 90yearold woman on a fixed 
income connolly said in a statement 
meehan said that by october 1987 dillons money was gone 
the complaint also alleges that shearson failed to properly 
supervise prebola allowing him to conduct improper trading in 
dillons accounts failing to recognize the excessive 
disproportionate commissions and margin interest generated in her 
accounts and not enforcing its own compliance procedures and 
guidelines

the chairman of a house energy subcommittee 
called monday on the bush administration in coordination with 
japan and europe to start pumping oil from emergency government 
reserves to halt the price spiral brought on by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
the strategic petroleum reserve has to be used to make sure 
shortages dont show up to short the market and protect the 
consumer said rep philip r sharp chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committees subcommittee on energy and power 
just before it adjourned saturday congress extended bushs 
authority to begin drawing upon the 587millionbarrel us reserve 
stored in salt caverns along the louisianatexas coast while it is 
on vacation for the rest of august 
sharp dind said a flooding of market with government 
reserves from emergency stockpiles in the united states europe and 
japan could stem rapidly escalating oil prices on the world market 
since thursday the price the west texas intermediate crude has 
jumped to more than 28 a barrel as of the close of trading monday 
the highest level in five years 
an embargo or blockade of oil from kuwait and iraq by cutting 
off pipelines in turkey and saudi arabia as advocated by the bush 
administration would put further upward pressure on prices 
currently between 35 million to 45 million barrels of oil per 
day about 15 percent of the worlds supply move through those 
pipelines and via tankers passing through the straits of hormuz 
the energy department has the capacity to pump a maximum 3 
million barrels a day from its emergency reserve a roughly 
200day supply 
a more likely scenario according to government and private 
experts would be to pump between 1 million and 2 million barrels 
per day from the us reserve in coordination with similar draws 
from allies government reserves 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said last week the bush 
administration has no intention to use the reserve only to stop an 
increase in oil prices 
the strategic petroleum reserve is not designed as a pricing 
mechanism he told reporters last thursday it was designed as 
a reserve of needed oil in this country not to set prices 
the administration of bushs predecessor ronald reagan had 
reached agreements with energy ministers in japan and the european 
community in the middle 1980s to coordinate early draws of their

oil prices leaped to their highest levels in 
nearly five years and the dow jones industrial average took its 
biggest dive since last october as the financial markets continued 
to wrestle monday with the persian gulf crisis 
the dollar also fell sharply against most currencies in foreign 
exchange shedding its historical role as a safe haven during times 
of political turmoil 
money flowed instead into treasury bills among the most secure 
shortterm investments available 
we have a selling panic going on in the stock and bond markets 
and a flight to quality to t bills said edward yardeni chief 
economist for prudentialbache securities inc when investors are 
nervous they tend to pull back 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average the 
bestknown barometer of the stock market slid 9331 points to 
close at 271634 after slipping as much as 105 points earlier in 
the day 
the plunge the biggest since last octobers minicrash 
tripped socalled circuit breakers designed by the nations 
financial markets to cushion market declines in stocks and stock 
index futures 
declining issues far outpaced advances among stocks listed on 
the new york stock exchange 
mondays drop extended a weeklong slide in the market that has 
erased just just over 200 points from the dow average 
in oildependent japan the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues closed at 2859953 points down 91623 points or 31 
percent in britain the financial timesstock exchange 100share 
index dropped 644 points or 29 percent to 22202 
in early trading tuesday the nikkei was down another 45728 
points or 16 percent at 2814225 
in the united states traders blamed the rout on continued 
worries that sharply higher oil prices stemming from iraqs 
invasion of neighboring kuwait last week could trigger higher 
inflation and push the nation into a recession the economy is in 
pretty bad shape now this could make things worse yardeni said 
oil prices continued their upward trend monday with no end in 
sight on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract 
for west texas intermediate soared 356 to settle at 2805 a 
42gallon barrel 
it was the highest level for the the benchmark grade of us 
crude since august 1985 when the price reached 2808 per barrel 
among refined petroleum products wholesale unleaded gasoline 
jumped 934 cents to 8152 cents a gallon wholesale home heating 
oil was up 897 cents to 7555 cents 
market observers said that if the united states and its allies 
move aggressively to end the conflict in the middle east the 
economic impact may be minimal but if allowed to linger for weeks 
the crisis could erode business confidence resulting in job 
layoffs or lower production the ingredients for a recession 
were in the hands of a very very unpredictable ruthless 
madman running iraq so most peoples investment portfolios are 
being held hostage to what iraqi president saddam hussein does 
next yardeni said 
part of the nations economic future also hinges on the federal 
reserves credit policies economists said 
the policy options were not good even without thinking about 
what hostilities lie on the horizon said robert a brusca chief 
financial economist for nikko securities co international the 
fed has these conflicting signals 
a move by the fed to lower interest rates could stimulate the 
economy but it could also further aggravate the inflation outlook 
speculation that the fed will cut rates helped push the dollar 
lower against all major currencies except the japanes yen among 
the dollars biggest drop was against the german mark where it 
slipped to 2year lows 
interest rate concerns coupled with worries about oil prices 
contributed to mondays drop in the bond market 
investors unwilling to lock their money into anything long 
range sold longterm treasury bonds the governments bellwether 
30year issue for instance plunged about 2 points or 25 per 
1000 face amount the drop was far less dramatic in shorterterm 
bonds and notes 
also hurting bonds were concerns about the budget deficit and 
how it might be affected by the mideast turmoil 
with higher oil prices you wont have an energy tax as 
lawmakers have discussed and you wont see cuts in defense 
spending said maury harris chief economist for painewebber inc
