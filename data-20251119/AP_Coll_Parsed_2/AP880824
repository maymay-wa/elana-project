of the week a veterinarian says 
its really a lucky dog said veterinarian earl johnson who 
treated the tan and black dog named missy i didnt think she was 
going to make it to tell you the truth its a definite 
miracle 
doctors said monday the dog had an 85 percent to 90 percent 
chance of total recovery 
missy fell friday from the penthouse balcony of the sea mark 
tower condominium 
her owners roy and ann gipson said strong winds created a 
vacuum that sucked the small dog through a 5inchwide opening in a 
guard rail 
missy landed in a sandy area just missing a brick walkway and 
an air conditioner a tree limb apparently helped break her fall 
missy was in shock with a broken leg when taken to an animal

the same charges aug 2 and was held in jail until monday night 
the us embassy issued a brief statement tuesday expressing 
approval that she was released 
but her departure entered a tense hour at limas international 
airport when the embassy sent word that peru was refusing to allow 
her to travel anywhere but to the united states her lawyers said 
attorney jose burneo said the embassy and former lima mayor 
alfonso barrantes made phone calls to peruvian officials at the 
highest levels to gain final approval for her departure 
about 20 friends and journalists witnessed her departure at 515 
pm aboard a soviet aeroflot flight for shannon

the assailants other witnesses said she was in puquio 90 miles 
south of vilcashuaman when the attack occurred 
lima superior court upheld the ruling on july 13 and ms 
mcnamara began making arrangements to leave peru

to prevent her transfer to cangallo the province in ayacucho state 
where vilcashuaman is located

could not be tried twice for the same crime burneo said 
ms mcnamara said she plans to go to london and meet friends 
before seeking a job teaching english somewhere in europe 
she reiterated her innocence to reporters tuesday she has

richard r green head of new york citys 
troubleplagued schools for six months faces the start of his 
first full school year and has no glib instant answers for 
problems decades in the making 
asked in a lengthy interview what his chief accomplishments have 
been so far the former superintendent of minneapoliss schools 
answered without apology none 
i didnt rush to judgment because i thought who are you to 
come in to be invited into somebodys home and decide whats 
wrong with the home but i do believe im responsible starting this 
school year he said 
for green whose quiet methodical speech belies a steely core 
its the little things the symbols that will lead to big changes 
this month for example he conducted the firstever count of 
people working for the central board a bureaucracy almost 
legendary for its inscrutability the answer 6447 
next green wanted to show teachers he really cares about their 
professional status he chose a symbol giving each of the citys 
974 schools until december to rid themselves of the time clocks 
that teachers have had to punch 
as for the biggest issues the dropout rate the racial 
polarization the sorry state of education for the handicapped the 
taming of custodians who had grown allpowerful in many schools 
green pleads with new yorkers not to expect real solutions for 
years 
here are highlights of the interview 
q now that six months have passed do you ever wonder what 
youve gotten yourself into are you surprised or shocked at what 
youve found here 
a no i think its a very unusual and special opportunity to 
affect the lives of nearly one million students the common theme 
throughout new york city despite the dropout rate despite the 
fact that we have had students with weapons in school is an 
underlying feeling that weve got to make the schools work by 
working together and thats a very motivating thing for me 
q what would you list as your key accomplishments so far 
a none i havent accomplished anything ive come to set the 
stage for making education work im working toward making this 
the most successful school year that new york city has had 
q lets talk about some of the toughest problems youll face 
the city has handled education for the handicapped so badly that 
its been under federal court monitoring for a decade when do you 
think things will improve enough for that to end 
a maybe five years anybody looking for an instant response to 
that will be disappointed there are too many complicating factors 
particularly the numbers of children who are nonenglish speaking 
the reason litigation builds up over time is that there was a 
loss of communication and trust its going to take time with those 
advocacy groups and parent groups to restore the trust that was or 
create what never was 
q the citys school minority population stands at over 80 
percent only a handful of high schools have white enrollments 
above 50 percent is racial integration now an impossible dream for 
most of our schoolchildren 
a it seems to me were a country very dependent on diversity a 
society that stands for access not exception the goals of 
integration ought to be widely clung to 
the majority of students in this city unless they are selected 
by special schools will very unlikely have the opportunity for an 
integrated experience students cannot travel the long distances 
required in this large and complex city in order to have large 
scale racial integration you need largescale racial balance in 
new york city you dont have it 
q lets talk about the status of school reform here in new 
york one idea you became famous for in minneapolis was your 
program of testing kindergarten children and holding back those who 
flunk youve raised the possibility of starting that in new york 
city despite warnings by many educators that such testing is 
inappropriate for children that age are you still pushing for this 
a what i have observed in american education in my nearly 30 
years is that those systems relying on social promotion missed the 
mark 
i dont care if students are retained or not what i care about 
is that we know how well they are performing so that they dont 
become victims of the system if you dont have some process by 
which a teacher you can look a parent in the eye and say 
youre child is really ready youre almost rendering some children 
to academic failure the rest of their life the gap seems to be 
particularly damaging for minority students and minority males to 
be specific 
im prepared to continue our discussion it really does not 
matter to me that new york adopt the minneapolis model about 
retention but teachers do have to be accountable for what they are 
willing to recommend to the next level of teacher otherwise its 
not going to work 
q you said in your inaugural address last march that schools 
should stop making teachers punch time clocks will they still be 
doing so in september 
a i said in my inaugural comments that i thought it was 
unprofessional some people have replied you cant trust anybody 
people see others not doing what they should the guy next door who 
went off to watch the knicks or the yankees but i still say 
theyre professionals 
so i am putting out a memo asking principals to work with their 
staffs to determine how they can account for attendance in the 
absence of time clocks or whether they want to sustain them they 
will make the decision buildingbybuilding and no one will ever 
be able to say they didnt have a chance to participate in a work 
related issue that i think is symbolic 
q your style seems to be lowkey methodical deliberate in a 
town thats brash and brassy do you worry that your lower profile 
makes people wonder whats this guy doing is that a problem in 
this town 
a i have no idea my mission it may sound altruistic is to 
serve children i hope to represent the school community in the 
best possible way 
my eye is on that prize for those who want a daily performance 
report theyre not going to find me a very willing participant i 
dont think it has anything with education i dont think it has 
anything to do with children

the state assembly tuesday night gave final 
legislative approval to a measure that would stiffen penalties for 
those caught illegally dumping infectious medical wastes 
the bill which passed 1420 without debate also provides more 
money for enforcement and needs only the signature of gov mario 
cuomo to become law 
its designed to stem the flow of medical debris that washed 
ashore on several new york city and long island beaches closing 
them to bathers on some of the hottest days of the year 
the bill would provide penalties of up to 10 years in jail and 
fines of 100000 for people convicted of disposing of red bag 
wastes so named because the waste is required to be thrown out in 
specially marked containers 
new york state will also provide 2 million to add new illegal 
dumping patrols 
state environmental conservation commissioner thomas jorling 
concluded last month that there was no single source for the waste 
washing up on new york beaches he said the waste may have come 
through the new york city sanitation system through illegal 
dumping casual dumping from boats or some combination of all of 
these

after years of exile and scorn 
for the ballot box el salvadors leftist political parties allied 
with marxistled guerrillas are preparing to compete in next years 
presidential election 
elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan 
designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army part 
of a counterinsurgency project said hector oqueli organization 
secretary of the national revolutionary movement 
it could therefore be argued that we are now lending our 
support for that same project and that were contradicting 
ourselves he said 
however oqueli added more political space has opened up 
since the presidents of el salvador and four other central american 
countries signed a peace plan aug 7 1987 
we want to take maximum advantage of that political opening 
even though we are certain that doing political work in those 
spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles he said in 
an interview in his partys san salvador headquarters 
the regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in el 
salvador nicaragua and guatemala but it has contributed to 
broadening the range of political expression in el salvador and 
nicaragua 
the national revolutionary movement as part of the democratic 
revolutionary front has been allied since 1981 with the farabundo 
marti national liberation front the guerrilla organization known 
as the fmln that has been fighting the usbacked salvadoran 
government for eight years 
leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s 
because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to el 
salvador in november and are still coming 
among them are guillermo ungo oqueli and ruben zamora general 
secretary of the popular social christian movement 
zamoras party is a leftleaning offshoot of the centrist 
christian democratic party of president jose napoleon duarte who 
sat on militarycivilian juntas in 198082 and has governed since 
1984 duarte has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal 
the oquelis revolutionay movement the social christians and 
the social democratic party have formed the democratic convergence 
oquelis group announced in july its participation via the 
convergence in the presidential election set for march although 
the electoral front has yet to announce its participation 
officially it is already hard at work launching a campaign 
zamora in an interview with the associated press said the 
convergences activity is generating a political alternative 
capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have 
been left without alternative 
were also contributing little by little to overcoming 
peoples fear because of past repression of participating in 
politics he said 
the leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory 
we are not taking part strictly for the votes rather were 
mounting a historical project that transcends election day said 
oqueli 
the main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to 
the war the government has rejected two such proposals by the 
insurgents so far this year 
the countrys principal problem is the war oqueli said 
if the armed conflict is not resolved we will not be able to 
resolve the economic social and political problems health 
housing nutrition employment so were telling the salvadoran 
people that a solution to the war is necessary and for us that 
solution is a negotiated political one 
duartes position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms 
before talks can begin but the rebels say that would be tantamount 
to surrender 
the guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during 
legislative and municipal elections in march to underscore their 
characterization of them as a farce the prospect of watching 
their political allies take part in similar elections next year is 
thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow 
the fmln doesnt have to either approve or disapprove of our 
participation said oqueli they simply must respect it as we 
respect their principal means of struggle 
he said political and military revolutionary leaders met in 
managua nicaragua in midjuly to discuss electoral participation 
our position and our objectives were fully understood by the 
guerrillas he said 
the convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered 
by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during 
years of crisis duartes promises of peace and increased 
wellbeing have gone unfulfilled 
the republican nationalist alliance the main rightist 
opposition is running on the full head of steam produced by its 
victories in march the party known as arena gained control of 
the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide 
the leftist political front could face its most difficult 
dilemma if no candidate in march receives more than 50 percent of 
the vote that would require a second round with the top two 
finishers in the running 
most observers doubt either the christian democrats or arena 
will receive a majority in the first round 
if the convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote which 
is considered feasible it could decide the outcome by casting its 
lot with one of the two major parties 
oqueli said he believes abstention would be advisable in a 
second round 
if we tie ourselves to the christian democrats and they 
continue as they have been we dirty our future he said and 
arena represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to 
where it is now

more than a month of demonstrations by an 
antiabortion group trying to close local clinics have worn out the 
citys welcome mat and southern hospitality is being withdrawn 
during and just after the democratic national convention police 
carried antiabortion protesters to waiting jail buses now more 
than 700 arrests and a dozen demonstrations later they drag them 
were giving them the opportunity to walk the 10 feet to the 
bus said police sgt melvin denson 
we are no longer extending certain courtesies says sgt 
carl pydrum jr 
the jails are getting crowded although corrections officials 
say they can manage even if some demonstrators have to bunk on 
cell floors and the cost of protecting the clinics and of 
arresting and holding the protesters has shot past 250000 
operation rescue a new yorkbased antiabortion group kicked 
off the protests july 19 the second day of the convention when 
scores of activists who were not carrying identification tried to 
block access to a clinic where abortions and other procedures are 
performed 
those arrested refused to give their names identifying 
themselves as baby jane doe or baby john doe to show solidarity 
with the fetuses some remain jailed others have been identified 
or have won their release by giving their names comrades keep 
coming 
authorities wont release those who refuse to give their names 
saying they could not be sure the protesters would return for court 
dates 
mayor andrew young rejected a request last week by 44 
congressmen including the entire louisiana delegation to release 
the prisoners he said the protesters could go when they give their 
names and noted that atlanta pays 10000 a week in police 
overtime because of the protests it costs about 50 a day to keep 
a person in jail 
the citys tactics in dealing with the activists have changed as 
the protests have dragged on 
the convention expedient of releasing arrested protesters on 
recognizance bonds is history authorities now require cash or a 
surety bond ranging from 300 to 2000 
about 300 demonstrators remain in city and fulton county jails 
now mixed in with the general jail population instead of being kept 
apart some demonstrators are being charged with felony obstruction 
counts instead of misdemeanor trespassing 
vans taking protesters to the clinics have started getting 
traffic tickets 
but leaders of operation rescue continue urging people to come 
block entrances to clinics and get arrested 
our objective is to close the clinics said lowell 
patterson an operation rescue spokesman who added that the group 
is opening a permanent office in atlanta the effect is a heavy 
arrest load but were not listing overloading jails as a main 
goal 
he said about 50 of the 134 arrested in the first demonstration 
remain in jail and some have vowed to stay 100 days the most 
recent demonstration was friday when 40 were arrested 
the seven clinics in the metropolitan area remain open guarded 
by police but patterson contends that does not mean defeat 
our objective is to save lives preventing people from going 
in to the clinics is the same thing whether it is open or not is 
a matter of words he said 
lawsuits are pending against operation rescue in new york and 
pennsylvania attorney margie pitts hames who represents some 
atlantaarea clinics said such a lawsuit is being considered in 
atlanta but it is not a priority the clinics have not decided 
what to do the focus has been on maintaining service 
patterson said operation rescue has no plans to stop the 
demonstrations as long as volunteers are willing to come to atlanta 
and go to jail 
he told of a businessman from austin texas due in this week 
with a busload of 25 employees and bail money for them of people 
calling promising to arrive weeks hence saying they are planning 
vacation time and arranging for discount air fares 
people from 39 states have been through the jail here he 
said now im calling people in states were missing i just 
talked to a woman in north dakota who said they were sending down a 
vanload that will be the 40th state

neither public protest nor us 
pressure has budged gen manuel antonio noriega and the panamanian 
movement to oust the nations de facto ruler appears mired in 
uncertainty and despair 
noriegas political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from 
a huge antigovernment demonstration that accompanied the funeral 
aug 15 of a revered former president whom the military threw out 
of office three times 
tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the 
funeral procession for arnulfo arias madrid but roberto aleman a 
leader of the opposition alliance discounted its significance 
in the short and medium term i doubt that it will mean 
much he said in the longer term we may see some life put 
back into the movement or we may see it fractionalized the thing 
is arnulfo is gone but noriegas still here 
behind alemans assessment was his concern shared by other 
opposition leaders that the death could split the authentic 
panamanian party which arias founded and built into the countrys 
largest opposition force 
theres no one of arias madrids stature in the wings but if 
his followers can unite around someone it would certainly 
strengthen the entire opposition movement a western diplomat 
said privately if they dont the party is likely to be split 
into a number of competing factions and that would just muddy 
things up 
noriega has weathered a 14monthold opposition campaign to 
force him out as commander of the 15000member panama defense 
forces which include the armed forces and police 
us economic sanctions against panama and federal indictments 
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering have had little 
visible impact on noriegas standing 
eric arturo delvalle the president noriega put into office 
rebelled and tried to fire the general a few days after the us 
indictments were handed up in february noriega arranged for the 
national assembly which he controls to dismiss delvalle instead 
in speeches interviews and billboard advertisements noriega 
says the government will hold a presidential election as planned in 
may 1989 
the main questions are whether noriega will seek the presidency 
and whether the opposition can unite long enough to defeat either 
the general or the candidate he chooses some opposition leaders 
speak of boycotting the election but most do not see that as an 
option 
another diplomat said the us sanctions havent driven 
noriega out it is doubtful they washington will try a military 
solution and theres no one in panama who can singlehandedly carry 
the opposition banner the people are being driven to despair 
there are a lot of people out there who are against noriega 
very easily the majority id say but they feel abandoned by the 
united states and theres not one single opposition leader with 
whom they feel comfortable 
morton abramowitz us assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs visited panama two weeks ago opposition 
leaders who met him said he offered nothing new 
one said on condition his name not be used i got the 
impression that nothing will happen until after the us 
election and then who knows what some observers had expected 
noriega to announce his presidential candidacy aug 12 his fifth 
anniversary as commander of the defense forces 
noriega dropped no hints at the celebration however instead 
he delivered another diatribe against the united states accusing 
it of creating a crisis in panama to negate the 1977 treaties that 
turn the panama canal over to panama on dec 31 1999 
many panamanians wrongly thought that with the new treaties of 
1977 panama and the united states were beginning a permanent 
honeymoon forgetting that for the united states a treaty is no 
more than a useful but ephemeral act noriega declared 
on sunday the panama defense forces rejected charges that its 
troops are harassing us military personnel and called the 
accusations part of an effort to undermine the government 
its statement injected a note of sarcasm by saying us 
officials who make such accusations must have the iq of a 
3yearold cromagnon

the republican national convention would have 
been the top four shows in the ac nielsen co ratings last week 
if only one network had been covering it 
with nbc abc and cbs casting about for news in new orleans 
however the convention made only one appearance in the top 30 
while millions of viewers deserted network television 
cbs which had the lowestrated convention coverage nearly won 
the week with a big surge on sunday night its 60 minutes and 
murder she wrote tied for first and cbs sunday night movie 
outrage came in fifth 
nbc however held on to first place with an average 83 rating 
for the week that ended sunday followed by cbs 82 and abcs 78

scientists finished a series of dives 
in the nations deepest lake tuesday without fulfilling their hope 
of finding hydrothermal vents 
peter thompson the chief ranger at crater lake national park 
said the dives which began aug 5 nevertheless yielded a wealth 
of information 
a variety of hydrothermal information clues as it were were 
seen bacterial mats temperature anomalies manganese deposits 
which are all in association with hydrothermal activity thompson 
said 
a great deal of biological and geological information is going 
to be derived from the samples taken he added 
oregon state university scientists jack dymond and robert 
collier took turns making dives in the oneman submersible deep 
rover they are in the second year of a threeyear study funded 
by the national park service on the possible effect of hot springs 
on the lake 
the work is part of a larger 10year study launched when the 
1932footdeep lake began to lose some of its famous clarity 
the work also could produce information for use in the debate 
over whether california energy co should be allowed to develop 
hydrothermal energy close outside the park 
dymond and collier are scheduled to return next summer for the 
last series of dives

political associates of george bush and 
michael dukakis sat next to each other in a meeting room for a 
serious nonpartisan discussion of making the jump from candidate 
to president of the united states 
many of the participants in a day of quiet talk sponsored by 
boston universitys school of public communication had taken part 
in presidential transitions in the past many of them by their own 
admission seriously flawed 
frank fahrenkopf chairman of the republican national committee 
told the group of senior campaign officials political appointees 
and career civil servants that the next presidentelect will have 
just 73 days from election to inaugural the shortest possible 
period 
the presidentelect of 1988 will under the terms of a new law 
have 35 million in federal fuding to pay for the staff office 
space and office equipment needed to mount his transition in an 
orderly way fahrenkopf said pointing out that none of the money 
will be available until after the election 
madeleine albright senior foreign policy adviser to the dukakis 
campaign said during tuesdays meeting that efforts to put 
together a transition staff are at a very embryonic stage 
because he will be devoting all of his efforts to win 
but she said that from a subject to which little attention was 
ever paid transition planning has now become a whole cottage 
industry with its own set of specialists producing studies and 
reports and issuing critiques 
mrs albright was on the national security council staff in the 
carter administration when the transition to ronald reagans 
presidency began 
i think there was a pretty good commitment to hand it over in 
good shape to the people coming in she said we had political 
differences with them but there was also a sense of 
responsibility 
in a sense she said dukakis already has laid the groundwork 
for a transition should he win by reaching out to congress and 
establishing a relationship with the institution and its leaders 
people actually do learn from mistakes she said noting 
there is a sense among many democrats that president carter came 
to town in 1976 not knowing very many of the locals something 
that worked against him when he tried to get his program through 
congress 
david ifshin who served as general counsel for the mondale for 
president campaign four years ago said the transition is important 
because it can have three results get the new president off to a 
fast start establish the momentum that will prevent a primary 
challenge when he seeks reelection and help him get to a second 
term 
darrell trent a reagan deputy campaign manager in 1976 and 1980 
and director of policy coordination in the reagan 1980 transition 
spoke at length of his experience in richard nixons transition in 
1968 
beginning the day after the election we realized little had 
been done to prepare us to take over the government he said 
describing how the transition office took over the 14th floor of 
the pierre hotel and was faced with the task of moving out the 
beds 
no plans had been made for logistical support trent said 
and nothing had been done on policy planning nixon had thought 
it was necessary to concentrate totally on getting elected 
by contrast he said the incoming reagan team was a model 
both campaigns should look at 
he said its personnel operation was well organized and a team 
was in place immediately after the election to go into every 
department and agency 
a plus he said was that the carter administration was 
absolutely firstrate to deal with the president ordered that 
every kind of cooperation would be given 
edward j fuelner jr president of the heritage foundation 
described that conservative think tanks support work for the 
reagan transition 
speaking of the transitions efforts to get a grip on state 
department policy fuelner said one of the great difficulties 
was coming up with specific questions the problem was they never 
volunteered the answers to a question if you didnt know enough to 
ask 
we had to keep reminding ourselves that we were not the 
government fuelner said until that magic moment someone else 
was in charge 
and when that magic moment does occur you have a sudden loss 
of institutional memory as the old office holders leave town to 
pursue other careers 
fuelner had advice he said would work well no matter who wins in 
november 
work hard on your transition team but keep your transition 
efforts very low key so all of your efforts really are focused on

attorney general richard l thornburgh says he 
is concerned that a special prosecutor plan aimed at congress by 
his predecessor edwin meese iii is a cure where there is no 
disease 
thornburgh said in an interview tuesday that he is taking a 
second look at an order meese signed on his last day as 
attorney general that requires special investigations of members of 
congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing 
i want to find out what the underlying premise was in the 
issuance of the order said thornburgh 
the former pennsylvania governor who was sworn in aug 12 
arrived in the waning days of the reagan administration to head a 
department that had been buffeted by meeses tenure 
meese was the subject of a lengthy investigation by independent 
counsel james c mckay who declined to seek indictments but said 
in his final report that meese probably had broken ethics laws 
meeses finalday order for special prosecutors to investigate 
members of congress was widely viewed on capitol hill as a parting 
shot by meese at his critics there 
thornburgh 56 a former head of the justice departments 
criminal division in the ford administration said tuesday that it 
is pretty well known that i see a very limited role for special 
prosecutorsindependent counsels in the process of investigating 
and prosecuting criminal cases 
he said us attorneys and the departments office of public 
integrity which investigates corruption of public officials do a 
fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct and prosecuting 
if necessary 
thornburgh established the public integrity office in the 
mid1970s 
i guess what i am curious about is what is being proposed 
a cure where there is no disease he said i am taking what 
could be called fairly a second look at that order 
while meese was attorney general a number of highranking 
officials resigned and a number expressed unhappiness with the 
attention meese was forced to give to mckays investigation 
asked how he planned to restore morale thornburgh said you 
lead by example and i want to make it clear that my view of the 
department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to high 
standards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations 
the values and principles of any organization are transmitted 
from the top 
thornburgh said he will talk to an advisory group of us 
attorneys to see what they think of meeses lastminute order on 
investigations of members of congress 
the order requires that attorneys general appoint an independent 
counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made against a 
senator or congressman 
although the justice department already could conduct such 
investigations on its own meese said his order was designed to 
ensure that legislators and top executive officials are treated 
equitably 
the 1978 ethics in government act allows executivebranch 
employees to be investigated by special prosecutors a provision 
that was designed to eliminate possible conflicts of interest in 
which an administration would be responsible for investigating 
itself 
no comparable conflicts exist when the justice department part 
of the executive branch investigates members of congress who are 
part of the legislative branch 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of a governmental affairs 
subcommittee already had asked thornburgh to rescind meeses order 
because it contained a drafting error and the public never got a 
chance to comment on it 
during the next five months thornburgh said he will take 
stock and make sure everything is shipshape in the department he 
said the department will aggressively pursue the war on drugs and 
other criminal activity 
although he is a strong supporter of gop presidential nominee 
george bush thornburgh said he will not campaign for bush and has 
no commitment that he will keep his job if bush wins in november 
he refused to talk about partisan politics because of the 
sensitivity of his position 
and he said he had no idea when the departments office of 
professional responsibility which looks into the conduct of 
justice employees will complete its own review of meeses conduct 
to see if it met ethical standards 
the ethics review began after mckay issued his report last 
month mckay concluded in his final report that meese probably 
broke conflictofinterest and tax laws but meese said the report 
vindicated him

national convention still havent left town 
neither dukakis nor bentsen has been claimed i think jesse 
jacksons still there and i think grits and fritz are still there 
too said k thweatt public relations manager for georgias stone 
mountain park 
dukakis bentsen jackson grits and fritz are among the 11 
donkeys the state park acquired for publicity purposes during the 
democratic national convention they have yet to find a new home 
the park plans to keep two of the donkeys but the others are 
available for 150 each 
thweatt said the animals got around quite a bit during the 
convention 
they probably went to more prestigious parties and events than 
any of us so we feel like theyre very welltraveled donkeys 
she said they know all the right people im not saying how many 
parties they could get their owners into now but they did all 
right during the convention 
thweatt said shes happy the gop chose new orleans for its 
convention 
i shudder to think what wouldve happened to the park if we 
had had the republican convention she said i cant imagine 
all those elephants

as police chief roy osborne explains it 
there just wasnt enough crime in this west texas town of 25000 to 
justify keeping a patrol officer who worked like a dog 
there was no sense wasting his talent the chief said of 
lazer a 3yearold belgian shepherd he needed to be moved 
someplace where he can be used 
lazer recently was shipped to an el paso security firm 
our burglaries have been down to the point that we hadnt had 
much call to use an animal in building searches wed like to have 
used him more but were glad we didnt have to said osborne 
who added that he missed lazer 
osbornes decision also was prompted by the request of lazers 
regular handler that he be transferred from his 8 pm to 4 am 
shift the chief couldnt find anyone in the 29person department 
to replace lazers keeper 
but osborne said that while the canine unit has been disbanded 
his force still has another employee with a nose for sniffing out 
crime sonny a golden retriever will continue to live with one of 
the departments detectives and work on drug investigations

television programs fail to show teenage 
girls taking the steps necessary to achieve productive lives 
focusing instead on obsessions with shopping grooming and dating 
says a womens advocacy group 
these images create the impression that one can magically jump 
from an adolescence of dating and shopping to a wellpaid 
professional career said sally steenland author of a report 
growing up in prime time 
the study of more than 200 episodes of 19 network television 
programs featuring adolescent characters was sponsored by the 
national commission on working women of wider opportunities for 
women the nonprofit group seeks to improve womens status in the 
labor market 
week after week viewers see teenage girls with no visible 
skills no favorite subjects in school no discussion about college 
majors or vocational plans ms steenland said in prepared 
comments as the study was released tuesday 
tvs teenage girls are portrayed as poised for professional 
careers and productive adulthoods without clues to the steps 
necessary to achieve those goals the report said 
the report found 
girls looks are shown to count more than their brains some 
episodes portray intelligent teenage girls as social misfits 
adolescent girls who outnumber their male counterparts on 
television are more passive than male characters 
weekly plots are lacking in serious conversations with parents 
teachers or peers about school matters academic interests career 
goals or future plans 
ninetyfour percent of teenage girls on television are 
middleclass or wealthy in reality more than onethird of 
adolescent girls live in families with annual incomes of under 
20000 
the study said some episodes featured wellliked intelligent 
girls and teenagers who linked their interests to career goals 
but the report singled out an installment of abcs mr 
belvedere for criticism the episode involved a college 
fraternitys bowser ball to which pledges must invite the 
ugliest girls on campus 
throughout the mr belvedere episode the smart girl is 
portrayed as clumsy homely unpopular unsure of herself and 
desperate for a date the report said according to the 
show the drunken advances of a boy who thinks they are ugly and 
dates them as a joke are preferable to being alone

the sons of george bush and lloyd bentsen say 
no strings were pulled to ensure their entrance into the national 
guard during the vietnam war 
george w bush son of the gop presidential candidate and lloyd 
m bentsen iii the son of the democratic vice presidential 
candidate discussed their military service tuesday in response to 
the flap over whether family influence helped republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle join the guard and avoid being 
drafted for combat in vietnam 
the younger bush and bentsen were guardsmen together at 
ellington air force base in houston both said they applied to 
enter the texas air national guard in 1968 when it was inevitable 
they would be called to serve in the military 
but the two who had known one another in houston before joining 
the same guard unit said they enlisted on their own without use of 
their fathers influence their fathers have affirmed that position 
both men said in interviews that they signed up after personally 
contacting the commander of the fighter group they wanted to join 
at ellington 
circumstances of joining the national guard have become an issue 
in the case of quayle a youthful advocate of the vietnam war who 
is now a hardliner on defense in the senate 
during the vietnam era entrance into the national guard was 
viewed by some as a way to avoid being drafted and sent to vietnam 
quayle has denied any such motivation 
quayles student deferment from the draft was about to expire in 
1969 and he had been called for his preinduction physical an 
indication he was about to be drafted most of those drafted during 
the period were sent to vietnam 
a retired indiana guard official acknowledged tuesday that he 
told the guard personnel office to hold open a space for quayle 
after receiving a call from a quayle family employee in 1969 
both bushs son and bentsens son acknowledged it was inevitable 
they would have to serve in the military after they graduated from 
college so they chose national guard service 
the younger bentsen 43 railed at a claim by new hampshire gov 
john sununu that bentsens father had rushed to get his son a spot 
in the national guard when he learned of an opening 
he was absolutely categorically wrong the son said 
shortly after i graduated i went to a party with some of my 
friends and one of the people introduced me to brig gen walter 
staudt who was the commander of the 147th fighter group in the 
texas air guard bentsen said staudt told him at a later meeting 
that because of his masters business degree he could use someone 
like me for an accounting and finance officer 
bentsen said he went home and discussed the matter with his 
father a businessman at the time and decided to enlist he became 
a finance officer as luck would have it serving past my 
sixyear requirement and achieving the rank of captain he said 
in the younger bushs case the circumstances also involved 
talking to staudt 
it was obvious that somewhere i would have to serve and i was 
fully prepared to do so said bush whose father was a decorated 
fighter pilot in world war ii the 42yearold son said he too 
wanted to be a pilot 
i heard the national guard was looking for pilots he said 
he called staudt who confirmed the unit did need new pilots bush 
said he could not remember how he learned of the need for pilots or 
knew to call staudt but that ultimately he became the third of six 
new pilots who were selected in that texas unit 
he said he passed the pilot training exam then served 18 months 
on active duty six months in houston and another 12 months of 
pilot training in georgia where he flew f102 fighters then flew on 
a regular basis until 1973 
bush said he supported the vietnam cause and he jumped at the 
opportunity to be a pilot joining the guard because he could not 
be assured a pilot job in the other military branches 
i was going into the service one way or the other he said 
some senior pilots from his unit did fly in vietnam on a 
voluntary basis he said 
bentsens son said he was motivated to join the guard partly 
because he had just finished graduate school 
i felt as i think all of us did in 1968 that it was 
inevitable that we would be drafted within six to nine months i 
didnt worry about going to vietnam in general i supported the war 
effort my concern was that the military had a history of 
mismatching a persons experience with the job that they got and i 
was afraid they were going to make me a clerk typist somewhere

a vietnam veterans group is criticizing 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle for voting 
against what the group says are the interests of former vietnam 
servicemen 
on a number of different occasions the indiana senator has 
had a chance to show just how deep his fondness for vietnam 
veterans goes and in each case hes dropped the ball said mary 
stout president of the vietnam veterans of america 
quayles military record is under fire amid reports he used the 
influence of his powerful newspaper publishing family to join the 
indiana national guard in 1969 shortly before he would have been 
eligible for the draft at the height of the vietnam war 
quayles office released his military records tuesday the 47 
pages of military records show that quayle scored below average on 
journalism tests he took after working more than four years as a 
national guard public affairs official 
but the records dont have any information about whether quayle 
used connections to join the guard 
the vietnam veterans of america on tuesday criticized quayles 
votes in the past two years on veteransrelated issues including 
his opposition to a bill making the veterans administration a 
cabinetlevel department 
during an appearance monday night before the veterans of foreign 
wars quayle also was criticized by some veterans for that same 
vote 
when he introduced quayle larry w rivers the vfws senior 
vice commanderinchief was applauded when he said dan we 
applaud your stance on defense and foreign policy issues but you 
and i still have some talking to do in the area of veterans 
legislation 
quayle did a quick aboutface on the issue saying moments 
later im sure that as i grow older that i will learn my 
youthful indiscretions of failing to vote for the veterans 
administration i will recognize my mistake and it will turn out to 
be the greatest cabinet we have in our government no doubt about 
that 
the senate voted 8411 passage on july 12 of the bill making the 
va a cabinetlevel agency quayle was one of the 11 opposition 
votes sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the democratic vice 
presidential nominee voted for the bill 
a day earlier both quayle and bentsen voted against legislation 
which would permit veterans to go to federal courts to challenge va 
decisions a right that veterans dont now have veterans 
organizations have pushed for that right of judicial review 
on oct 16 1987 quayle voted with the minority in an 
unsuccessful attempt to close the 188 storefront counseling centers 
scattered around the nation for vietnam veterans the senate 
rejected the closure on a 5733 vote quayle was one of the 33 
minority votes while bentsen voted to keep the centers open 
quayle and bentsen joined a unanimous 890 vote on may 8 1987 
when the senate approved a bill to continue indefinitely the gi 
bill a sweeping measure which provides education benefits for 
veterans 
last dec 4 quayle and bentsen both again joined a unanimous 
880 vote approving an increase in the disability rate for veterans 
and improved veterans benefits 
generally the military records released tuesday are routine 
papers detailing immunizations and copies of orders mentioning 
quayles name quayle entered the guard may 19 1969 six days 
before he was to graduate from depauw university and become 
eligible for the draft 
he had been called for his preinduction physical april 9 1969 
an indication he was likely to be drafted 
quayle spent almost all his guard career in the 120th public 
information detachment most of his time was as a clerktypist 
although he also was rated as a senior information specialist 
he also was trained as a welder but he did not perform that 
task in the service 
when quayle was evaluated as public information specialist in 
july 1975 two months after he left the service he scored 56 
points on a written test 19 points below the average score of 75 
the records show 
the written test included questions on seven military journalism 
categories quayle scored low in five of the seven and 
average in the other two there were five possible scores 
ranging from very low and low through average 
high and very high 
the written test was one of three parts of the evaluation the 
records do not detail the scores on the other two sections but 
they indicate quayles overall rating was an 82 there was no 
explanation for the missing scores nor was there an indication of 
how the 82 figure compared with scores for other guard members

us rep mike synar defeated a primary challenger tuesday who 
labeled the fiveterm democrat too liberal for his oklahoma 
district while anchorage alaska voters decided whether to keep 
the city in the running for the 1994 winter olympics 
one congressional primary contest was on the ballot in alaska 
and seven in oklahoma including a fiveperson fight for the 
democratic nomination in the district that is comprised largely of 
tulsa 
in that race kurt glassco 32 a former prosecutor and onetime 
aide to former gov george nigh won without a runoff over four 
other democrats seeking the right to challenge rep james inhofe 
who was unopposed in the gop primary 
glassco said he was ecstatic with his success in his first 
run for public office 
it means those of us who are mainstream conservative 
democrats are the majority party here he said he said he was 
confident that the ronald reagan democrats will be with us on 
nov 8 
synar who describes himself as a moderate not a liberal said 
of his victory it should put these labels to bed once and for 
all oklahomans are tired of it 
with 348 of 467 precincts reporting in synars largely rural 
northeastern oklahoma distrcit the incumbent had 48314 votes or 
69 percent and state sen frank shurden had 21730 or 31 percent 
in the republican race to challenge synar ira philips 50 
director of business development for the cherokee indian nation 
led with 4895 votes or 53 percent to 4258 or 47 percent for 
marshall farrier 60 a rancher 
as expected incumbent democratic reps dave mccurdy and glenn 
english won renomination overwhelmingly as did republican rep 
mickey edwards 
in alaska voters selected candidates for the states lone 
congressional seat rep don young a republican seeking his ninth 
term and democrat peter gruenstein a former state prosecutor 
making his first try for statewide office were both expected to 
win their respective primaries handily 
voters in anchorage decided a ballot issue crucial to the citys 
bid for the 1994 olympic games whether the city government would 
agree to cover losses if the local olympic organizing committee 
does not raise enough money to stage the games 
passage of the olympics measure would not assure selection of 
anchorage for the games but defeat would effectively eliminate the 
city from the list of finalists when the international olympic 
committee chooses the host city next month the other finalists are 
in norway bulgaria and sweden 
in 1985 anchorage voters endorsed the olympics bid by a 2to1 
margin but were not told that the city would have to sign a 
financial agreement in july a poll sanctioned by the anchorage 
organizing committee which is seeking to stage the games showed 
voters evenly divided on financial guarantees

committees and has sought legislation banning advertising of 
cigarettes

for winning passage of a bill calling for the castration of 
convicted sex offenders the measure died in a senate committee 
in the 3rd district democratic rep wes watkins was unopposed 
for reelection in the democratic primary and there was no one 
running in the republican primary oklahomas four other incumbent

new guidelines that set up a range of 
sentences for federal crimes were declared unconstitutional tuesday 
by a federal appeals court the highest court to rule on the issue 
because of the role of judges on the commission that drafted the 
standards 
by requiring judicial service on the commission as well as by 
placing the commission in the judicial branch the 1984 
sentencing act breaches the wall of separation betweeen the 
judiciary and the two political branches said the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals in a 21 decision 
it thereby threatens to squander the precious aura of judicial 
impartiality to the ultimate detriment of the judiciary and the 
society it serves 
the required placement of three federal judges on the 
sevenmember sentencing commission violated the constitutional 
separation of powers and also interfered with the appearance of 
judicial impartiality by allowing the president to appoint and 
remove members said the opinion by judge alex kozinski 
the guidelines which took effect last november recommend 
minimum and maximum sentences for each crime and require the judge 
to state unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the 
range 
federal judges throughout the nation have issued scores of 
conflicting rulings on constitutional challenges to the guidelines 
mostly based on the same separationofpowers issue 
the 9th circuit which covers nine western states guam and the 
northern marianas is the first appeals court to rule on the 
validity of the guidelines while the ruling has effect only in the 
region it can influence other circuit courts but the issue is 
likely to be decided ultimately by the us supreme court 
the chairman of sentencing commission judge william wilkins of 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond va said 
tuesday night in washington on the larry king radio talk show that 
he was disappointed with the ruling 
but wilkins added well be having a definitive and final 
answer from the united states supreme court real soon he noted 
that the court has scheduled arguments on the issue oct 5 on a 
case that originated in missouri 
the guidelines were challenged by public defenders who were 
unhappy with provisions that lengthened sentences for many crimes 
and restricted judges authority 
were very happy with the guidelines being thrown out said 
geoff hansen an assistant federal public defender in san 
francisco were just ecstatic that we dont have to deal with 
this nightmare any more 
but he said lawyers will be in some state of uncertainty in 
dealing with a number of recent cases including some in which the 
guidelines helped individual defendants and others involving plea 
bargains based on the guidelines 
the challenges in two consolidated cases from san diego wound 
up before an appellate panel that consisted of three appointees of 
president reagan kozinskis opinion was joined by judge melvin 
brunetti judge charles wiggins dissented 
kozinski said the commission violated the constitutional limit 
on the role of the judiciary because its function is political 
and not judicial in nature 
he said the commissions detailed rules on sentences for each 
crime invade the executive and legislative policymaking roles in 
numerous ways for example it decided that sentences for 
whitecollar crimes were too short cut back sharply on the 
availability of probation and decided that all defendants except 
the poorest must pay fines 
wiggins in dissent said judges participation in a commission 
that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep the boundaries 
of the judicial role or tarnish judicial impartiality he said 
congress had set overall sentencing policies and could properly 
leave their implementation to a commission that included judges 
kozinski however also said presidential appointment and 
removal of commission members created a continuous and fairly 
significant entanglement between the judicial and executive 
branches of government and interfered with the aura of judicial 
impartiality 
while we are confident that no federal judge would be swayed 
by such considerations the tens of thousands of persons who 
litigate against the government in civil and criminal cases may 
legitimately be apprehensive about the fact that the president is 
able to dispense plums among the federal judges who will decide 
their cases kozinski said 
although judges throughout us history have accepted 
appointments on nonjudicial commissions kozinski said any law 
requiring a judge to serve on a commission that made political 
decisions was unconstitutional

help is at hand for british motorists in the 
united states to keep them from getting stuck on the dual 
carriageway with a bad silencer and not a spanner in the boot 
driving in the usa a 32page pamphlet written by two 
british journalists aims to dispel some of the mystery of motoring 
the american way and to protect this years crop of selfdriving 
british vacationers from death speeding fines and big lawsuits 
the pamphlet is another of those occasional reminders that the 
potential for angloamerican misunderstanding is enormous 
especially on the highways they drive on opposite sides and have 
little in common other than that both use miles instead of 
kilometers 
the dictionary alone takes up 1 pages a trunk is a boot a 
hood is a bonnet a wrench is a spanner a muffler is a silencer a 
stickshift is a gearshift a fender is a bumper gas is petrol a 
trailer is a caravan a divided highway is a dual carriageway and a 
beltway is a ring road 
some words dont even have a british equivalent thus gridlock 
is translated laboriously as a traffic jam in all directions 
the booklet is filled with surprises as to how much britons 
dont know about american driving such as toll roads the fact 
that cars with automatic transmissions creep forward if the 
brake isnt pressed and that speeding can mean fines 
you are not in great britain where many drivers exceed the 
speed limit and appear to get away with it you will not do so in 
the us every state has large numbers of patrol cars with traffic 
police who know every trick 
the pitfalls are not obvious ones such as driving on the right 
but some that are dangerously subtle said coauthor tim 
symonds 
there are some very confusing things like no standing or 
speed zone which dont mean a thing over here he said in an 
interview 
the booklet advises british motorists how much insurance to take 
on a rental car to avoid damage claims astronomically higher than 
anything at home 
under the heading the american policeman motorists are told 
treated with courtesy and respect the american cop will be 
polite even friendly in a wary sort of way his or increasingly 
her job is to enforce the law prevent crime and survive 
american police with good reason fear for their lives 
so if stopped just leave your hands on the wheel while the 
police officer approaches the pamphlet says do not attempt to 
joke do not get aggressive and do not be insulting or facetious 
avoid any comments of the itsdifferentintheuk variety 
with 400000 britons going on driving vacations in the united 
states this summer theres a lot of potential for mayhem a lot 
of people who will drive out of petrol stations onto the wrong side 
of the road symonds said 
symonds 48 said he gained his expertise as a student in 
california when he would earn money by driving cars from new york 
to los angeles 
i used about eight different routes and really got to know the 
country he said i hate to say it but i think the americans 
are much better drivers theyre not so prissy the british have 
got laws that make no sense like not letting you pass on the 
inside lane on a fourlane highway 
symonds and coauthor lesley abdela say 300000 copies of their 
booklet have been distributed to travel agencies and airlines 
selling flydrive vacations in the united states 
driving in the usa is not like a hollywood film the 
american driver is lawabiding and used to driving long 
distances writes british publisher john driscoll in the preface 
to get his readers into the spirit of things american he signs 
off have a nice day

the little mermaid staring longingly 
out to sea from her rocky perch in copenhagen harbor was honored 
with a 21gun salute and a laurel from the mayor as she turned 75 
she has been beheaded had an arm cut off and suffered various 
other indignities but the bronze statue created in honor of writer 
hans christian andersen was treated like royalty at tuesdays 
celebration 
mayor egon weigekamp led the party placing a wreath of flowers 
around the neck of den lille havfrue as she is known in danish 
children of 40 nationalities from the copenhagen international 
junior school waved flags on the quay older visitors were offered 
free beer by the brewery that financed the statue in 1913 
the mermaid is one of copenhagens most popular attractions 
drawing about 500000 visitors a year pouring rain kept tuesdays 
crowd down to about 100 
the statue which sits on a small rock outcropping at the 
entrance to copenhagen harbor is based on andersens tale of the 
daughter of the sea king who fell in love with a prince and was 
doomed to wait 300 years before she could turn human 
she leans on one hand her fish tail stretched behind her and 
she is half turned toward the sea so visitors must strain to see 
the wistful look on her face she has often been used as a symbol 
of denmark and antinuclear activists have depicted her as a 
skeleton 
visitors often are surprised at her small stature about the 
size of a small girl and artists have debated her artistic value 
the mermaid was beheaded in 1963 and a new head was cast from 
the original mold the police department called on its homicide 
division to handle the case even though the squad was dealing with 
16 unsolved murders the head was never recovered 
twenty years later hooligans amputated an arm which also was 
replaced grafitti and paint splotches are a recurring problem for 
city cleaners 
she was created by edvard eriksen who took the face of danish 
ballerina ellen price and modeled her upper body from his wife 
eriksen who lived from 1867 to 1959 attached little artistic 
importance to the mermaid he authorized the manufacture of about 
50 halfsized replicas of his mermaid to be placed in public areas 
around the world including salt lake city stanford university in 
california san francisco and solvang calif 
eriksens heirs reportedly earn royalties of about 750000 a 
year on trinkets and souvenir models

a us appeals court struck down new 
guidelines establishing a range of sentences for federal crimes 
ruling the standards are unconstitutional because they were drafted 
by judges as a political act 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals the highest court to rule 
on the issue said tuesday that placing three federal judges on the 
sevenmember sentencing commission violated constitutional 
separation of powers 
in a 21 vote the court decided the use of judges on the 
commission interfered with the aura of judicial impartiality by 
allowing the president to appoint and remove members said the 
opinion by judge alex kozinski 
congress may not under our system of separated powers 
require judges to serve on bodies that make political decisions 
kozinski said 
the decision affects only the region covered by the 9th circuit 
comprising nine western states guam and the northern marianas 
however the court is the nations first on the appellate level to 
rule on the validity of the guidelines 
other federal judges nationwide have issued numerous conflicting 
rulings on challenges to the guidelines mostly based on the 
separationofpowers issue 
the guidelines were challenged by public defenders who were 
displeased with provisions that lengthened sentences for many 
crimes and restricted judges authority 
the chairman of the sentencing commission judge william wilkins 
of the 4th us circuit court in appeals in richmond va said he 
was disappointed by the ruling but added well be having a 
definitive and final answer from the us supreme court real soon 
wilkins interviewed from washington on larry kings syndicated 
radio talk show said courts have decided about 200 cases based on 
validity of the sentencing guidelines with the rulings about 
evenly divided 
the supreme court has scheduled arguments on the issue for oct 
5 in a missouri case he said 
tuesdays ruling on two consolidated challenges from san diego 
said the commission violated the constitutional limit on the role 
of the judiciary because its function is political and not 
judicial in nature 
kozinski said the commission had to make rules and policies 
having the force of law tasks that only the legislative or 
executive branches and not the judiciary may constitutionally 
perform 
the guidelines which took effect in november recommend minimum 
and maximum sentences for each crime requiring the judge to state 
unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the range 
the appeals court also found invalid the 1984 sentencing law 
that created the sentencing commission and abolished parole in 
postnovember 1987 cases such a ruling would restore the entire 
previous law which generally gave judges wideranging sentencing 
discretion and provided for parole eligibility after onethird of a 
sentence 
were very happy with the guidelines being thrown out said 
geoff hansen an assistant federal public defender in san 
francisco were just ecstatic that we dont have to deal with 
this nightmare any more 
but he said lawyers will be in some state of uncertainty in 
dealing with many recent cases including some where the guidelines 
helped individual defendants and others involving pleabargains 
based on the guidelines the status of parole is also unclear he 
said 
kozinski said the commissions detailed rules on sentences for 
each crime invade the executive and legislative policymaking roles 
in many ways for example it said sentences for whitecollar 
crimes were too short that all defendants except the poorest must 
pay fines the commission also refrained from issuing any 
guidelines on the death penalty he said 
kozinski said the decision on the death penalty a 43 vote of 
the commission apparently resulted from a fear that controversy 
over the issue might prevent congressional approval of the 
guidelines 
while the decision leaves the issue of capital punishment with 
congress it illustrates that the commissions work was indeed 
substantive and political not procedural and impartial he said 
judge charles wiggins in dissent said judges participation in 
a commission that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep 
the boundaries of the judicial role or tarnish judicial 
impartiality he said congress had set overall sentencing policies 
and could properly leave their implementation to a commission that 
included judges

the director of philadelphias aids program 
says hell push for distribution of condoms in city jails even 
though the city prison board rejected the idea saying it 
encouraged homosexuality 
i am totally confident they will change their minds david 
fair director of aids programs for the health department said 
acknowledging that could take years 
meantime fair said he will continue with an aids education 
program for prisoners that encourages abstention 
the board monday night rejected the distribution program by 32 
with one abstention 
fair said the proposal would have made condoms available to 
inmates on request not as some board members thought through 
mass distribution 
it makes me very sad fair said noting that infected 
prisoners can spread the deadly disease after release from jail 
somebody is getting infected with aids 
board member m mark mendel a lawyer who strongly opposes 
condom distribution said the policy would have condoned 
homosexuality in jails 
this jail isnt a sex factory he said it isnt a place 
to shoot up drugs this is not proper conduct 
during a twohour discussion before the vote public health 
commissioner maurice c clifford urged approval of the policy 
saying sexual activity was rampant in the citys jails 
we are not condoning sexual activity clifford said we 
are saying it is taking place and the best protection against 
aids is using a condom 
board member allen hornblum who voted in favor of the 
distribution said the issue will not disappear as long as acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome spreads 
there will be more pressure to adopt condom distribution 
hornblum said 
hornblum said he knows of three other prison systems that have 
programs allowing distribution of condoms in vermont mississippi 
and new york city 
fair said eight prisoners in philadelphia have been diagnosed as 
having aids and two prisoners have died from the disease while in 
custody 
he said the number of prisoners infected with the aids virus is 
hard to estimate but could be more than half of the 3700 in 
custody

a swiss clinic that falsely claimed it had 
treated frank sinatra with a youth serum of sheep cells has 
been ordered to pay the singer 450000 in damages 
its excellent that the court has seen fit to vindicate the 
right of a us citizen to protect his name and his reputation from 
avaricious appropriation both here and abroad said john a 
lawrence a lawyer for sinatra 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on tuesday upheld the 
september 1986 award against the clinic la prairie rejecting the 
montreux switzerland clinics claim that us courts lacked 
jurisdiction in the case 
the clinics employees fabricated an elaborate story 
calculated to link sinatras name with their services said judge 
dorothy nelson in the 30 decision 
patricia beaman a lawyer for the clinic was unavailable for 
comment tuesday her office said 
the dispute stemmed from an october 1984 article in the national 
enquirer that said sinatra had been treated at the clinic with a 
youth serum extracted from sheep cells intended to retard aging 
but sinatra had never even visited the clinic although an 
attempt was made to recruit him as a patient according to the 
court 
while the clinic has no branches in california it was trying to 
solicit business in the state when it planted the phony story in 
the tabloid in 1984 knowing that sinatra lived in the state and 
the enquirer circulated widely here the court said 
the clinic viewed the article as essentially a free 
advertisement that could reach between 5 million and 20 million 
people nelson said in the 30 decision 
the court said the enquirer called the clinic the previous month 
asking if sinatra had been a patient the clinics us 
representative richard van vrooman then arranged a visit by an 
enquirer reporter who was given false statements by the clinics 
president medical director and others about sinatras supposed 
visit and their personal contacts with him the court said 
sinatra sued the enquirer and the clinic in los angeles and 
later settled the case against the newspaper on undisclosed terms 
the clinic said the court lacked jurisdiction and refused to 
take part in the trial chief us district judge manuel real 
after hearing sinatras witnesses without a jury awarded 350000 
for the value of the unauthorized use of his name and 100000 in 
punitive damages

an unemployed truck driver who served in the 
indiana national guard with dan quayle says he needed no special 
connections to secure a spot with the guard 
retired sgt stephen w morell says he dropped out of college 
walked into a recruitment office and was offered a clerktypists 
position within 90 days he served sidebyside with the republican 
vice presidential candidate 
we entered the guard the same rank and left the guard the same 
rank morell told the associated press on tuesday night and i 
was a nobody 
sen quayle of indiana has been accused of using family 
connections to gain a position at the guards headquarters 
detachment where he eventually worked in a public information unit 
that published news releases and a quarterly magazine the indiana 
guardsman 
if his family really had all this influence like everyone 
says he would have been sent directly to officers candidate 
school and come out a lieutenant or captain morell said 
dan was an ok guy morell said he did his job and i did 
mine we washed dishes and washed jeeps together 
capt cathi kiger a national guard spokeswoman confirmed the 
service was below its authorized strength when the then22yearold 
quayle signed up in may 1969 
i can find no evidence that he was given special consideration 
and there was no need kiger said units that were not up to 
100 percent strength could continue to recruit 
but maj gen alfred ahner said tuesday that he received a call 
at that time regarding quayle from an editor of the indianapolis 
news one of several newspapers published by quayles maternal 
grandfather eugene c pulliam 
as a result of that call ahner said he contacted the guards 
personnel office on quayles behalf 
they said they had a couple of spaces ahner told the ap on 
tuesday i said hold one of them theres a good guy coming 
over 
ahner also said in an interview with wthrtv i couldnt have 
done a thing if there hadnt been a vacancy 
retired col jerome rafferty said quayle was a prime candidate 
for the guard based on his background and at least in part the 
way the system works 
the unit sen quayle served in was a specialized unit he 
could have been recruited very simply for the fact that he got a 
college degree was in law school and had a newspaper background 
said rafferty who was director of personnel for the adjutant 
generals staff in 1969 
rafferty acknowledged the recommendations of highranking 
officers carried some weight 
if any of the generals called me and said they knew a man 
who would make a good guardsman id prick my ears because they 
only sent the highest quality young man rafferty said thats 
the way the system worked 
a 1969 guard report indicated the indiana guard was overextended 
in mid1969 but a separate monthbymonth breakdown made available 
to the associated press on tuesday showed quayles detachment had 
an authorized strength of 138 people in may 1969 guard records 
show 134 men were in the unit at the end of april 132 were serving 
in may when quayle joined and 133 men were enlisted in june

hundreds of thousands of people rallied in 
estonia latvia and lithuania to demand greater autonomy on the 
49th anniversary of the pact that led to the soviet takeover of 
their baltic nations activists said 
demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their 
former nations tuesday and carried banners denouncing the secret 
agreement between the kremlin and nazi germany the activists said 
some called for independence from moscow 
three years after the aug 23 1939 pact was reached the 
soviets moved into the three countries 
this is another step toward lithuanian independence said 
antanas terleckas a 60yearold former political prisoner he said 
he attended a rally of about 200000 people at vingis park in 
vilnius the capital of lithuania 
according to reports from activists in the three republics 
about 300000 people demonstrated tass the official soviet news 
agency estimated the total at 100000 
the demonstrations unprecedented in size were another 
indication of ferment in the baltic republics under soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policies of greater openness 
authorities gave permission for the demonstrations and there 
were no reports of violence or arrests 
moscowbased foreign reporters who sought to cover the events 
were told by staterun agencies that no plane or train tickets or 
hotel accommodations were available 
in kaunas lithuanias secondlargest city an estimated 50000 
people gathered for a candlelight roman catholic mass and 
procession said valdas analauskas correspondent in lithuania for 
the unofficial journal express chronicle 
at least 8000 estonians attended an outdoor rally and filled 
the tallinn town hall for a panel discussion about josef stalins 
repression of the baltic states 
ents tsavilitis a former political prisoner and a member of an 
unofficial environmental group said he was among 30000 to 40000 
people who demonstrated in riga the latvian capital 
in a report from riga tass said several thousand people 
attended a meeting organized by informal political groups it 
estimated the number of demonstrators at kaunas as 10000 and 
characterized the rallies as dedicated to condemning stalinism 
tass reports on the days activities were unusually detailed and 
speedy 
terleckas said many yellow green and red flags of independent 
lithuania were displayed in vingis park and that the threehour 
gathering closed with the singing of the anthem of independent 
lithuania 
nationalist flags also were displayed in riga and kaunas and 
the outdoor gathering in tallinn ended with the estonian anthem 
from presoviet days activists said 
the 1939 agreement was a nonaggression pact that divided 
eastern europe into german and soviet spheres of influence it is 
commonly called the molotovribbentrop pact after foreign ministers 
vyacheslav molotov and joachim von ribbentrop who signed it 
tsavilitis said protesters in riga listened to more than a dozen 
speakers including one who read a message of support from a group 
of us senators 
the riga protesters carried the national flags of all three 
baltic nations he said 
protesters would have risked jail or fines not long ago for 
displaying the national flags but officials in the baltics have 
eased up recently and some have expressed limited support greater 
autonomy 
leonard bartkevich the latvian foreign minister defended the 
molotovribbentrop pact and declared that the baltic states 
voluntarily joined the soviet union to protect themselves from 
germany 
he said in an interview with tass there was one alternative 
either union with the ussr or hitlerite occupation and 
enslavement 
soviet officials say the pact was necessary to buy time to 
prepare for germanys attack on the soviet union which occurred in 
1941

residents in this baltic port where 
solidarity was born stocked up on sugar flour and bread fearing 
shortages during polands worst outbreak of labor unrest since 1981 
im making sure im prepared said one elderly woman 
staterun media in a campaign to erode public sympathy for the 
striking workers on tuesday quoted factory workers as blaming the 
strikers for long lines and shortages 
we are scared by the lines in the stores warsaw radio 
quoted a textile worker in lodz as saying poland went through a 
very hard time in 1980 and we should have learned from this 
goods were in short supply during the tide of strikes eight 
years ago the spawned solidarity the only independent labor 
federation ever allowed in the soviet bloc 
although there was no evidence of panicbuying in gdansk stores 
residents said many people had rushed out to buy basic staples 
early tuesday 
but the stores were later restocked and even supplies of scarce 
commodities turned up on store shelves after a long absence 
residents said 
now you can get cheese and ham said a 20yearold native of 
the countrys largest port they have been in short supply or 
missing for two months 
the government pledged to increase distribution of staples and 
other goods during the strikes which began aug 16 and seek higher 
wages and reinstatement of solidarity which was outlawed after 
being crushed in a december 1981 military crackdown 
the government contends solidarity activists are exploiting 
polands economic woes and strikes are creating unnecessary 
hardships for citizens 
residents of gdansk where strikes have idled the port and the 
lenin shipyard expressed surprise at the announcement monday night 
by interior minister czeslaw kiszczak empowering officials to 
impose curfews in areas hit hard by strikes 
people were surprised by the curfew announcement because the 
media have only reported that there were rallies and no strikes in 
gdansk said one young resident 
the radio quoted a worker who said he approved of kiszczaks 
curfew order 
the only criticism i have is that it should have come 
earlier the worker said 
strikers at the lenin shipyard where solidarity was founded 
said the threat of curfews was meant to intimidate strikers and 
their families and scare the population into turning against them 
we are not afraid said an 18yearold worker at the yard 
most doubted a curfew would be imposed in the city 
we have thousands of tourists here said a resident how 
do you think a busload of german tourists is going to react when 
you tell them to be in by 9 pm

the government will restrict to a 
border area contra rebels who have in the past four months entered 
the country in a mass exodus from nicaragua the foreign minister 
said 
the government is keeping the rebels near the nicaraguan border 
to prevent instability in honduras foreign minister carlos lopez 
contreras said tuesday 
contra officials have said more than 14000 rebels and civilian 
supporters of their campaign against nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
leaders entered honduras in the past four months seeking refuge 
and humanitarian aid distributed by the united states 
lopez contreras said honduras was allowing the us aid to reach 
the contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by five 
central american presidents 
he said the contras cross the frontier frequently because under 
the plan they were to be assigned to a zone in nicaragua that 
borders honduras but he acknowledged that some contras were 
entering honduras as refugees then later returning to their 
country to fight 
since 1981 the ussupported rebels have maintained base camps 
in honduras in their fight to overthrow the sandinistas a 
provisional ceasefire has been in effect in nicaragua since march 
21 
lopez contreras noted that anticommunist rebels from nicaragua 
and leftist guerrillas from el salvador have used frontier 
territory for their war bases damaging honduras social stability 
he said the superpowers had created peculiar problems for 
honduras with the united states supporting the contras and the 
soviet bloc backing nicaraguas sandinista government and the 
salvadoran rebels 
there have been several antiamerican demonstrations this year 
in honduras which is considered one of washingtons strongest 
allies in the region

seven senior members of the house armed 
services committee want the pentagon to add provisions in future 
defense contracts to ensure that any illegally gained profits can 
be recovered by the government 
the call arises from the current investigation into allegations 
that private consultants illegally bought information about future 
contracts from pentagon employees 
there is an urgent need to protect both the national security 
and the interests of the us taxpayer in defense procurement 
the congressmen said in a statement issued tuesday 
a clause in all future contracts allowing the defense 
department to recover the profit from illegally obtained contracts 
would go a long way toward doing that it said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other top pentagon 
officials have said the pentagon can use existing laws to recover 
the profits if any of the contracts involved in the investigation 
turned out to have been won on the basis of illegal information

sending americas children to public elementary and secondary 
schools is expected to be 4810 this year up more than 2000 
since 1980

inflation in this decade department statistics released tuesday 
show 
the 2762 per pupil spending of the 198081 school year would 
have risen to 3462 if simply adjusted for inflation yet the 
department expects spending to top that by nearly 39 percent 
increased spending by state and local governments in an effort 
to improve schools was cited by statistician vance grant as a major 
reason for spending being ahead of inflation 
overall the agency expects education spending at all levels 
public and private to rise to 328 billion for the coming school 
year a record that is up from 3088 billion last year and 1828

the president of the private arms control 
association says the reagan administration is using a disputed 
soviet radar facility in siberia as an excuse to undercut the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
a fiveyear review of compliance with the treaty which 
restricts us and soviet antimissile defenses opens on wednesday 
in geneva 
president reagan has authorized american negotiators to accuse 
the soviets of a material breach of the pact with the radar 
facility at krasnoyarsk such a charge would give the united states 
the right to break out of the treaty 
spurgeon keeny who heads the arms control association said 
tuesday he agrees the facility violates the treaty but he said 
a material breach can only be claimed by a country seeking an 
excuse to suspend or terminate the abm treaty 
keeny a former deputy director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said it may set in motion a series of events 
that could have a very serious impact

nearly 40000 owners of chrysler 
motors corp cars whose odometers were disconnected while company 
executives testdrove them are entitled to more than 16 million in 
restitution under a nationwide settlement 
attorneys general from 10 states assisted in the settlement 
which will pay the wronged car owners at least 500 apiece 
missouri attorney general william webster said at a news conference 
tuesday 
chrysler already has announced it will increase warranty 
coverage for cars on which odometers had been disconnected in the 
companys overnight evaluation program a few were involved in 
accidents and consumers that later purchased those cars will 
receive new automobiles webster said 
webster served as the lead negotiator in the settlement 
affecting 39500 consumers in 46 states guam and puerto rico the 
agreement was filed aug 19 in us district court in st louis 
the states that did not participate in the settlement were 
georgia kentucky nevada and south carolina webster said 
webster said his office and officials in some other states were 
mailing letters to the car owners chrysler also will run 
advertisements about the settlement in 20 newspapers friday he 
said 
the practice by chrysler of selling what were supposed to be 
new cars which had already been driven hundreds of miles is in my 
opinion a deplorable business practice that results in deceiving 
consumers said kansas attorney general robert t stephan who 
also announced the settlement 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said the company has set 
aside 163 million to settle the claims but will add more money 
to the reimbursement fund if that runs out 
in the testdrive program new cars were driven by company 
executives before the vehicles were shipped to dealers the program 
had been going on for many years said webster who added that 
mileage on the cars probably ranged from 40 miles to 300 miles 
the settlement affects consumers who purchased a car made by 
chrysler before oct 9 1986 and which was involved in the 
overnight evaluation program consumers must have owned that car on 
july 31 1987 to be reimbursed 
us district court judge john f nangle will hold a fairness 
hearing regarding the settlement oct 11 in st louis webster said 
consumers who have objections about the settlement must file 
complaints with the court by sept 30 
stewart said if the judge approves the settlement most 
purchasers of the cars would receive payments early in 1989

give em an inch and theyll take a 
kilometer 
crusaders for wider use of the metric system are happy about an 
obscure section of the trade bill signed tuesday by president 
reagan a section they say will help america measure up in a metric 
world 
the bill designates the metric system as the preferred method of 
measure for trade and commerce and requires government agencies to 
start buying metric whenever practical 
for the us metric association which since 1916 has been 
prodding america to join most of the world in using metric measure 
the bill is a milestone or perhaps a kilometer post 
i think the governments decision to adopt this law is pulling 
the country in the right direction said lorelle young 
association president 
we interpret it to be saying that the metric system is highly 
important to the united states to educate our youngsters in this 
scientific world to put us in sync with the rest of the world and 
to give us the advantage of the best measurement system ever 
devised 
the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 gives us 
negotiators more leeway to bargain at international trade talks 
strengthens the governments ability to fight restrictive trade 
policies of other countries and provides for retraining of 
americans who lose their jobs because of foreign competition 
it also says that by 1993 agencies should use the metric 
system of measurement in procurement grants and other 
businessrelated activities except to the extent that such use is 
impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiency or loss 
of markets to us firms 
analysts at the national association of manufacturers dont 
expect much impact from the section because of the language giving 
agencies an economic out said howard lewis a vice president of 
the washington dc lobbying group 
but for the 3500member metric association which promotes the 
switch nationwide from its headquarters in the los angeles suburb 
of northridge the bill seems likely to hasten the inevitable 
conversion 
ms young recalled with relish that the bills example of an 
economic hardship big enough to win an exemption from the metric 
policy was a company faced with competition from a foreign producer 
of nonmetric goods an unlikely situation 
automakers and other sectors of heavy industry are gradually 
getting on the metric bandwagon ms young said though lumber and 
machine tool industries are notable for their adherence to 
tradition 
our liquor industry hasnt suffered she noted and they 
were one of the first to convert 
the metric system uses weights and measures such as the liter 
and the gram that are multiples of 10 calculations in the 
traditional english system are more difficult because that system 
is based on varying multiples 
little has been done to promote use of the metric system 
nationwide since passage of the metric act of 1975 said valerie 
antoine executive director of the association 
the act set up a us metric board that would monitor a 
changeover and educate the public but it was not given any real 
clout she said they didnt really get any place

israel is building 
three huge missile boats and two submarines under a usfinanced 
program that will better equip it to thwart terrorist attacks the 
nations navy chief says 
rear adm avraham benshoshan outlined details of the 12 
billion program on tuesday navy day he said the submarines and 
two of the three missile boats should be deployed by the mid1990s 
the terrorists are making serious efforts to invest people 
resources and training to develop a better capability we must be 
prepared in time benshoshan said 
the missile boats will carry new weapons against aircraft 
missiles and submarines the new ships each to cost 120 million 
are nearly 400 feet long and will accommodate more weaponry and 
helicopters 
we believe this ship must carry many weapons because we have a 
lot of enemies and very few missile boats said benshoshan 
he said one new weapons system is the barak antimissile 
missile to be deployed in the early 1990s described as highly 
accurate it carries an explosive head weighing 48 pounds and can 
be used at a range up to 7 miles 
benshoshan said the antimissile missile was preferable to 
systems designed to confuse and divert incoming missiles 
we must have a hard kill and the barak system gives us a hard 
kill this will be the answer to the missile threat for the israeli 
navy he said 
he said the system could also be used against helicopters and 
ships 
the new ships are needed to replace frenchdesigned boats up to 
20 years old those include some of the vessels israel commandeered 
from cherbourg after france imposed an arms embargo because of the 
1967 middle east war 
according to the jaffee center for strategic studies at tel aviv 
university israels navy has 28 missilecarrying ships including 
two highspeed hydrofoil craft shown for the first time tuesday 
the geula demonstrated for reporters outside israels northern 
port of haifa is israels largest ship 
the israelibuilt vessel is 198 feet long weighs 450 tons and 
carries a helicopter it is armed with usmade harpoon 
surfacetosurface missiles and vulcan phalanx antiaircraft guns 
benshoshan said the terrorist threat remains high even though 
guerrillas launched just five attacks from the sea last year 
in the past three years the navy has killed 58 guerrillas and 
captured 100 he said 
during the past year the navy stopped two attempts by lebanese 
shiite moslems to plant mines and on two occasions destroyed 
guerrilla boats hiding among fishing vessels off lebanon 
benshoshan said it also stopped a rubber raft trying to enter 
israeli waters 
benshoshan reached agreement with us officials on financing 
the expansion program during a visit to washington in june 
he said us firms are bidding to build the ship and various 
systems and west germany was among european countries competing to 
build the submarines 
israel has three aging britishmade vickers type 206 submarines 
it turned to european manufacturers after the united states refused 
to build the dieselpowered submarines benshoshan gave no details 
on the new submarines 
the admiral defended israels stopping ships in international 
waters of the mediterranean saying it has to go as far afield as 
needed to protect its coastline 
he said israels navy stopped 40 ships in the past year and 
about four were found to have hostile intent the navy impounded 10 
other vessels carrying 10 tons of drugs most of it hashish he 
added

a un team of chemical weapons experts 
has backed irans claim that iraq dropped mustard gas on an iranian 
city this month in a raid that came after both sides had accepted a 
un ceasefire resolution 
in a note attached to the report tuesday secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar said the bomb attack violated provisions in 
the 1925 geneva convention on the use of poison gases 
there were no reported deaths in the aug 2 attack on the city 
of oshnaviyah which is a few miles from the northeast corner of 
iraq though iran said 2680 people were injured baghdad denied 
responsibility for the raid 
the chemical weapons experts said they found medical and 
chemical evidence of mustard gas including shell fragments like 
those used in previous gas attacks when they visited the site aug 
1214 
the attack at 245 am on the civilian residents of oshnaviyah 
took place in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any 
protection against that kind of attack the team said in its 
report to the security council 
at the time of the attack both iran and iraq had accepted 
security council resolution 598 which calls for a ceasefire in 
their nearly 8yearold war though negotiations on a truce 
starting date were still in progress 
patients injured in the attack and iranian authorities told the 
team that a propellerpowered plane dropped eight bombs as most 
residents slept four bombs landed in a neighboring field and four 
fell in nearby mountains 
when the un team arrived 24 of those injured in the attack 
were still hospitalized most of them farmers who lived near the 
field where the four bombs fell 
the team said the farmers and their wives suffered coughing and 
skin blisters symptoms typical of mustard gas attacks 
air and soil samples taken at the bomb sites were analyzed in 
swiss and swedish laboratories and found to contain mustard gas 
agents the team reported 
security council president li luye of china held talks about the 
report with other members of the council tuesday said un 
spokeswoman nadia younes 
members of the un team were dr erik dahlgren of swedens 
defense research establishment col ulrich imobersteg former 
chief of switzerlands nuclear biological and chemical defense 
force and dr anp van heijst former director of the dutch

a fairly close brush with the sun may spell 
doom for the fourth comet discovered by an amateur astronomer who 
spends 100 nights a year searching for the dirty snowballs in 
space 
don machholz who holds a kind of unofficial record for the most 
hours spent unsuccessfully comet watching spotted comet machholz 
1988j with his giant homemade binoculars on aug 6 but conceded 
theres some cause for concern about its existence 
the comet might sort of fizzle out about the time it makes 
its closest approach to the sun on sept 17 agreed brian marsden 
director of the international astronomical unions central bureau 
for astronomical telegrams 
that happens with comets that are not terribly big to start 
with going only 15 million miles from the sun its pretty hot 
there it may disintegrate completely marsden said by phone from 
cambridge mass where his agency records astronomical discoveries 
its 80 million miles from the sun as we speak machholz 
said tuesday from his office in santa clara it will go twice as 
close to the sun as mercury and six times as close as earth 
machholz said the comet is a very nice looking comet but its 
not getting brighter as it should suggesting that the dustladen 
balls of ice is too small to give off enough gas and dust to form a 
bright head 
it wont be the first time a comet broke up after being 
discovered by machholz 35 of san jose who works at a company 
that makes medical lasers but he doesnt mind 
its kind of a gift to find a comet youre grateful he 
said so if its taken away thats the way it goes 
machholz said his second discovery comet machholz 1985 viii 
disintegrated when it got within about 11 million miles of the sun 
he also discovered comets machholz 1978 xiii and machholz 1986 viii 
during a typical year about six comets are discovered and six 
known comets are recovered or spotted during their latest 
orbits through the inner solar system marsden said the j in the 
new comets name means it is the years 10th either discovered or 
recovered last year a record 16 comets were discovered and 17 
recovered 
comet machholz 1988j is a couple hundred times fainter than 
the north star marsden said its not going to be a bright 
comet and is likely to be seen only by advanced amateur 
astronomers using telescopes 
while more comets have been discovered by other astronomers 
machholz holds the record of four for us amateur astronomers who 
are still alive marsden said 
machholz made his latest discovery after 475 hours of 
observation from his customary viewing spot along a dirt road 
3300 feet up loma prieta a peak in the santa cruz mountains south 
of san francisco bay 
im up there about 100 nights a year most of the time its 
after midnight he said his biologist wife laura and 
2yearold son accompany him but sleep in the back of the family 
truck 
as with his 1986 discovery machholz spotted the comet using a 
pair of homemade binoculars weighing 150 pounds he found his first 
two comets with a 10inch reflector telescope 
i enjoy comet hunting he said its a challenge 
despite his discoveries machholz is better known for spending 
1700 hours searching before discovering his first comet his 
second comet took 1742 hours to find 
its the longest period of time anybody is known to have spent 
unsuccessfully comet hunting marsden said

officials plan to give hogs raised by the 
corrections department a chance to pig out on 350 tons of crackers 
that have been in storage 26 years 
the oklahoma city emergency management department found the 
crackers had not gone rancid and began looking last month for ways 
to get rid of them said department administrator donna grant 
she said the crackers no longer are tasty and have lost some 
nutritional value 
corrections officials requested the crackers to feed the hogs 
the prison system slaughters about 4400 swine each year and uses 
the pork to feed inmates 
ms grant said the city received several requests from private 
farmers for the crackers but there was really no fair and 
operable way to offer them to individuals and organizations 
the 50000 boxes of canned crackers will be hauled to the jackie 
brannon correctional center in mcalester and mixed in with hog 
feed which will later be distributed to swine farms at other 
prisons officials said

of the home affairs ministry dharan was hardest hit at least 131 
bodies were found in the city of 100000 
indian officials have maintained since monday that the death 
toll in their country was 200 or less but the figure was 
questioned by opposition politicians survivors and the local 
media including the times of india a newspaper that generally 
supports the government 
they put the india death count at anywhere from 400 to 1500 
indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake 
nepalese officials listed 752 injured down from their earlier 
estimate of 1000 
in bhaktapur a city of 50000 where seven people died in the 
quake 63yearold nhuchhe raj sakya said his fivestory brick and 
mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10 
were still living in it 
what else can we do the goldsmith said we have no tent 
how can i leave my place 
prime minister marich man singh shrestha visited dharan on 
tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once threestory and 
fivestory houses 
this is the biggest calamity to strike nepal shrestha said 
as he toured the town 
dharan 105 miles southeast of katmandu sits on a rolling plain 
at the base of a steep hill most of the victims died in their 
houses which were made of bricks held together by mud that had 
loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains

more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation 
we will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied 
the ones remaining are safe to live in he said 
adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the 
government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes 
were demolished most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors 
or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth 
the earthquake which struck when most people were still asleep 
registered 65 on the richter scale and was the deadliest quake in 
the region since 1950 when a temblor in the east indian state of 
assam killed 1500 by official count and 30000 by seismologists 
accounts 
aftershocks have persisted since sundays quake and rumors of 
an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the 
streets in panic before dawn tuesday in katmandu and dharan 
the rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by 
word of mouth in dharan men ran from houses to houses rousing 
people from their sleep

three siblings whose parents have fought 
with school officials since spring because the children were not 
allowed to preach at the school gates will be taught at home a 
mediator says 
we pretty much got what everybody wanted said dan rodden 
president of caleb campaign of chicago a nonprofit christian 
rights organization negotiating with school officials on the 
familys behalf 
rodden said tuesday that david and robin strode of mcdowell 
county had signed a statement asking that their children be removed 
from eastfield elementary school and be taught at home 
but the county school superintendent david ricketts said he 
was not sure an agreement had been reached 
who would teach the children and what arrangements would be made 
were not disclosed to reporters strode who is unemployed said 
his family could not afford to hire a teacher or to pay for athome 
instruction 
rodden said his organization would help with the education and 
even help the 40yearold strode find a job 
on monday the childrens first day of school lasted less than a 
minute ending with 11yearold duffey being suspended for 10 days 
duffey and his 6yearold brother matthew began shouting 
bible verses while at the gate and their 7yearold sister pepper 
yelled repent 
we were there to welcome them to school said eastwood 
principal jim gorst 
duffey stuck his bible in my face and he said you go to 
hell 
the strodes did not meet with school officials tuesday but 
allowed rodden to shuttle between the school and the strode home 1 
blocks away for negotiations 
richard schwartz an attorney for the north carolina school 
boards association said he hoped to reach an agreement that would 
result in both sides waiving the right to future litigation 
rodden the superintendent and schwartz met with eastfield 
elementary assistant principal shirley ramsey and assistant 
superintendent shearon crawfordfurther meetings were planned for 
today 
tuesday morning rodden said he was working to save the 
marriage between the children and the school but by noon he 
said i realized the marriage was unsavable and we went for a 
divorce 
although rodden said the agreement satisfied everyone strode 
left the house late in the day with his eyes red apparently from 
crying 
as the world builds bigger and better schools and bigger and 
better churches the children are going to hell by the thousands 
he said before turning away 
the children were suspended repeatedly last spring when they 
stood behind the school screaming bible verses and refusing to 
enter the building when asked 
their favorite verse is hebrews 134 marriage is honorable in 
all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and fornicators god 
will judge

the plo says it will pay the salaries of 
the more than 20000 educational health and administrative workers 
in israels occupied lands who jordan says it will no longer pay 
but plo leader yasser arafat in a statement tuesday did not 
say where the salaries would come from or how they would be paid 
jordan early this month announced it was letting go the 21200 
employees in phases gradually eliminating payment of about 45 
million in salaries a year 
king hussein said his decision to abandon his claim to the 
occupied west bank and to sever financial links with the gaza strip 
was aimed at giving greater responsibilities to the plo 
the plo shall shoulder full responsibility for the employees 
and workers as regards rights entitled to them salaries and wages 
on the basis of the regulations and lists of their appointments to 
office arafat said in the statement which was made available by 
the plo office in nicosia 
the statement was referring to the jordanian government salary 
scale used to pay many of the employees who worked in schools 
hospitals government offices and other institutions 
although jordan laid off or retired the employees arafat said 
they would remain in their current positions 
the statement added that all law and regulations in force in 
the occupied territories shall remain in force until such time as 
they are amended or abrogated by the palestinian legislative 
authorities 
it did not elaborate the plo has been debating the possible 
formation of a provisional government or governmentinexile for 
the territories 
in addition to severing administrative links to the territories 
hussein canceled a 13 billion development plan for the 
territories and dissolved the lower house of parliament half of 
whose members were palestinians 
jordan later announced it would issue temporary twoyear 
passports for west bank residents that would no longer confer 
jordanian citizenship but could be used as travel documents 
hussein has said the changes are in response to the plos desire 
to secede and form its own state with its heart in the west 
bank the occupied territories have been wracked by an 8monthold 
uprising against israeli rule 
the plo has substantial although largely secret financial 
resources provided by arab countries and the palestinian diaspora 
outside the arab world 
israeli leaders have vowed to prevent the plo from taking over 
any of the salaries or services on the west bank and in the gaza 
strip

south korea wants to resume talks 
friday with north korea on a nonaggression pact and on the norths 
demand to cohost the olympic games officials said today 
the national assembly made the announcement after its senior 
delegate rep park joonkyu held a private meeting with his north 
korean counterpart chon kum chol at the truce village of 
panmunjom 
park refused to disclose details of the private meeting he said 
the souths decision on resuming talks would be relayed to the 
north 
assembly officials were reluctant to say whether they believed 
the deadlocked talks which began friday and collapsed monday 
could be revived but one senior official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said neither side wants to take the blame for 
breaking off the talks 
although park said he expected new proposals from north 
korea he admitted he was not encouraged by north koreas stand at 
todays meeting 
isnt it meaningful that the talks would continue he said 
when asked about prospects of the upcoming meeting 
fridays meeting would be the fourth in talks between lawmakers 
of the two koreas on sharing the olympics and various peace 
measures including a nonaggression pact 
the talks ended in a stalemate on monday with both sides 
failing to fix a date for further talks 
south korean delegates said after a third round of talks on 
monday that they hoped to postpone further contacts until after the 
olympics scheduled for sept 17 through oct 2 in seoul 
north korea called for urgent talks on the olympics but they 
were not so enthusiastic in pursuing the subject they seemed more 
concerned about a nonaggression pact 
in an effort to break the deadlock at mondays meeting south 
korea proposed a private meeting between the senior delegates of 
the two sides north korea agreed to consider the suggesion 
the talks were called to prepare for fullscale parliamentary 
talks on north koreas bid to cohost the olympics and on other 
measures including a nonaggression pact to ease tension between 
the nations 
the two sides differed over an agenda and the size of the talks 
north korea insists the main talks include the full legislatures of 
both sides involving nearly 1000 members but the south wants 
delegations of up to 30 lawmakers from each side 
north korea also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint 
declaration of nonaggression which seeks among other things the 
withdrawal of the 42000 us troops in south korea and nuclear 
weapons allegedly in their arsenal 
the south sees the us forces as vital to its defenses against 
the communist north 
north korea said it will boycott the olympics unless it can 
cohost them the international olympic committee has rejected the 
north korean demand saying the olympics are given to a single city 
and cannot be shared 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was 
divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 they fought the korean 
war from 1950 to 1953

at least 150 coal miners were on strike 
in southern hungary today and many more miners were joining the 
stoppage official reports said reports on strikes in communist 
hungary are rare 
the state news agency mti said the stoppage near the town of 
pecs was over wages and had no political undertones 
it said a senior official from budapest had gone to the mecsek 
coal mines near pecs just north of the yugoslav border to mediate 
the dispute 
the official laszlo kapolyi returned to budapest today with 
representatives from the miners management and the work force to 
negotiate with the government over wage grievances mti said 
laszlo kovacs head of the official mineworkers union was also 
said to be taking part in the negotations in media discussions in 
recent months he has criticized management of the mining industry 
the relatively swift reporting of the stoppage appeared to 
reflect the greater openness seen in the staterun media since 
karoly grosz took over as communist party leader and head of a 
reformminded politburo in may 
mti said trouble started tuesday evening when 150 miners refused 
to start work on the evening shift budapest radio said many 
more joined the strikers today but it gave no numbers 
the strikes came at a time of widespread labor unrest in poland 
where coal miners dockworkers and transit workers have gone on 
strike to demand reinstatement of solidarity the only independent 
labor federation ever allowed in the soviet bloc 
mti said the workers in pecs were complaining that the new 
personal income tax introduced in hungary on jan 1 has cut their 
bonuses by up to onethird 
it is especially irritating for the miners that miners on sick 
leave often earn more than their colleagues on regular shifts 
mti said describing this as another unwelcome byproduct of the 
recently introduced personal income tax 
radio budapest said in its morning broadcast that miners were 
also complaining that unspecified legitimate demands had not been 
met for years and that other unspecified steps were taken 
over their heads 
the manager of the mine was said by the radio to have expressed 
sympathy for the miners grievances one miner was quoted as 
saying we are seeking a solution of our problems if that is 
impossible we accept the closure of the mine but the present 
situation must be changed 
hungarys official trade unions have been highly critical of 
recent economic policy emphasizing that workers pensioners and 
the unemployed must be protected against price rises caused by 
government efforts to curb the 18 billion foreign debt and 
stimulate the stagnating economy 
mti said the mine management had promised to return to pecs from 
budapest tonight to report on the outcome of negotiations in 
budapest with industry minister frigyes berecz and other government 
officials

the kremlin says it is watching with concern the 
situation in poland but it has not issued any official comment on 
an 8dayold strike wave in the soviet unions western neighbor 
soviet media today issued reports on a meeting of the polish 
communist partys politburo but offered no commentary 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov at a regular 
news briefing tuesday said we closely follow the situation in 
poland 
we are of course very attentive and interested and we are 
concerned by the events of poland he said 
the soviet news agency tass quoted a statement by the polish 
politburo saying that difficult living conditions and justified 
criticism of authorities were not acceptable reasons for the 
strikes plaguing the sovietbloc country 
the strikes are the worst labor unrest in poland since 1981 
when the warsaw government stifled the solidarity free trade union 
movement with a military crackdown 
economic damage is piling up polands prestige and economic 
confidence in poland in international relations suffered 
substantially the tass report said of the current strikes 
it reported that the politburo approved a letter to party 
members calling on them to counter the strikes 
asked if the strikes in poland and protests sunday in 
czechoslovakia on the 20th anniversary of the sovietled invasion 
of that country helped soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
opponents find fault with his policy of greater openness gerasimov 
said i think you can find ammunition in any event

pravda said today that a distant asteroid has been 
named after anna akhmatova one of russias favorite 20th century 
poets her work was barred from publication during most of her life 
the communist party newspaper said soviet scientists requested 
that the international planetary center in the united states grant 
the name in honor of the poets 100th birthday 
akhmatova was born in 1889 and gained fame for her works 
inspired by the style of alexander pushkin before the 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
her husband fellow poet nicholas gumilev was executed by the 
bolsheviks in 1921 and officials frowned upon her work from then 
until 1940 she was rehabilitated during world war ii but lost 
favor again in 1946 and was expelled from the soviet writers union 
for bourgeois decadence 
akhmatova was reinstated in 1959 and died seven years later 
her works are in great demand in the soviet union where poetry 
is a popular art form

a treasurehunter who has spent three 
years diving for riches from a spanish galleon lost in a 1715 
hurricane says a find of 900 silver coins has pointed him in the 
direction of the mother lode 
it was a very good sign as far as letting us know were going 
in the right direction who knows whats ahead now were very 
excited about that roy volker said tuesday 
the 63yearold explorer from st louis hopes to find 200 
million in gold that went down with the nuestra senora de la regla 
the flagship of an eightgalleon fleet that left vera cruz mexico 
for spain in july 1715 
in addition to the coins the ship yielded two gold rings a 
small silver statue of an angel holding a christ child several 
shoe buckles pottery and other artifacts 
volker estimated the value of the find his largest at 
250000 however a spokeswoman for treasure hunter mel fisher 
who owns the wreck said the coins alone could be worth 400 to 
500 each for a total of between 360000 and 450000 
twenty percent of the treasure and artifacts will go to the 
state and an undisclosed percentage to fisher 
weve been expecting to find a pretty good sizable pile of 
coins somewhere along the line said volker who made the find a 
few hundred yards off sebastian inlet 
we know theres a lot of treasure on the ship thats never 
been found he added 
carrying a cargo of treasure for the spanish crown the ships 
were struck by a hurricane and sank along the central atlantic 
coast of florida killing 700 people 
the regla was smashed and its treasure strewn along the sandy 
coast and buried by subsequent storms and tides making its 
discovery difficult said bleth mchaley spokeswoman for fishers 
company 
between 1964 and 1970 fisher and his partners took about 20 
million in treasure from the site ms mchaley said

a threeyear undercover operation has 
resulted in charges against 43 people accused of poaching black 
bears for their gall bladders which are prized in asia as 
aphrodisiacs and medicine 
the federalstate probe was sparked by the danger poaching poses 
to the nations black bear population gary myers executive 
director of the tennessee wildlife resources agency said tuesday 
in announcing the charges 
during the investigation agents bought 266 gall bladders 85 
claws 77 feet four heads nine hides and one live black bear cub 
officials said 
among the items displayed at a news conference tuesday were 
several plastic bags containing a bears gall bladder which 
resembles a swollen heavily veined lima bean 
the parts were sold to asians in the united states and overseas 
said tim hergenrader of the tennessee wildlife agency he said the 
gall bladder is dried and ground into a powder thought to be good 
for health and an aphrodisiac 
bear claws are used to make jewelry and heads are used as 
trophies hergenrader said 
arrest warrants were issued in knoxville asheville nc and 
atlanta for residents of the three states and agents began making 
arrests early tuesday 
hergenrader said the 43 people were charged with more than 130 
federal and state violations 
officials estimate the black bear population in the southern 
appalachians at about 2000 the bears already are threatened by a 
loss of habitat areas in public land are set aside as bear habitat 
where hunting is prohibited 
hergenrader said some of the bears were legitimately killed but 
he said it is illegal to sell any part of a bear no matter how or 
where it is killed 
myers said studies of the black bears indicated that we were 
driving our black bear population to extinction and that poaching 
accounted for half or more of the annual bear deaths 
he described the poachers as a loose informal network of 
people who knew who you needed to see if you want bear gall 
bladders

deportation policy

twoday general strike to protest the deaths of four arabs in 
israeli prisons 
john whitehead the us deputy secretary of state urged israel 
to reconsider its policy of deporting palestinian activists and 
said continued expulsions would damage relations between the two 
countries 
the israeli foreign ministry today responded israel does not 
accept the american interpretation of international law regarding 
deportations the legality of deportations was checked recently 
by israels supreme court which ruled that deportations are legal 
according to both israeli and international law

deportations in a 90minute meeting today with us ambassador 
thomas pickering said shamirs spokesman avi pazner

whiteheads statement was sharp i dont see it as an 
ultimatum but they definitely want us to stop the deportations 
former foreign ministry director david kimche told army radio 
israel has said it uses the measure only as a last resort 
and calls it an acceptable means of deterring violence

solidarity with 5000 arab prisoners and detainees in israeli jails 
in jelazoun a refugee camp of 5000 north of jerusalem 
soldiers ordered a curfew after destroying homes belonging to three

week 
the three allegedly beat an arab youth to death while 
interrogating him about suspected collaboration with israel 
an ap reporter saw two army jeeps blocking the entrance of the 
camp the streets were virtually empty

organized by the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee 
in the west bank town of jenin soldiers rounded up six 
palestinians suspected of belonging to the palestine liberation 
organizations mainstream fatah faction the army said

the strike the third in four days some shops were open and taxis 
transported some workers to israel 
masked arab youths pelted rocks at some of the cars along a

and two who the army and police said committed suicide within the 
last month

nadil mustafa beduah of east jerusalem had his teeth knocked out

a foam producer has agreed to pay a record 
700000 in civil penalties to settle what is believed to be the 
first lawsuit in the nation filed by a state to stop emissions 
suspected of depleting the ozone layer 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon announced terms of 
the settlement tuesday and said the company pi inc of hyannis 
also agreed to end its emissions by years end 
the settlement must be approved by the us bankruptcy court 
handling pis reorganization and by superior court where the suit 
was filed 
the state accused pi with emitting 1300 tons of 
chlorofluorocarbons a year in violation of state regulations cfcs 
are a class of chemicals implicated in the decline of the ozone 
layer that protects earth from solar radiation 
the compounds are manmade chemicals used to create plastic 
foams for cleaning electronic parts and for refrigeration the 
chemicals were also used as propellants in aerosol cans until 
banned by the federal government in 1978 
our action demonstrates that we can make a difference in 
protecting the earths fragile environment shannon said cfcs 
have been directly linked to the destruction of the ozone layer and 
consequently pose a threat to the earths survival 
the attorney generals office found no record of any other state 
filing such a suit said shannon spokeswoman mary breslauer 
telephone calls to pis president and attorney were not 
immediately returned 
shortly before the attorney general filed suit in june pi filed 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code according to news accounts the companys insurer 
had become insolvent leaving pi with no protection from numerous 
product liability suits 
daniel greenbaum commissioner of the states top environmental 
enforcement agency said the resolution marks the first success by 
the state department of environmental quality engineering in its 
effort to stop unregulated emissions of cfcs

new york stock exchange chairman john phelan today 
called for common rules and definitions of insider trading among 
world stock markets 
different rules and definitions of illegal dealing is hindering 
control of unscrupulous trading practices in the increasingly 
borderless equity markets worldwide the chief of the leading us 
exchange told reporters 
everybody comes from different culture and corporate 
background but the users of those markets have to see those 
markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in 
them phelan said at the foreign correspondent club of japan 
he urged each market to spell out its definition of insider 
trading then work together to set up common rules 
within the market place everybody talks the same language 
but if it is perceived by any major participant that the market is 
unfair there will be a lack of use of the market and that will be 
detrimental to everybody 
phelan criticized the japanese approach as a narrow 
interpretation but he declined to assess recent measures by 
japanese securities authorities their needs are different from 
our needs he said 
several cases of what western finance experts charge are insider 
trading deals buying and selling securities based on information 
not available to all are raising questions in japans financial 
community about the ethics of japanese stock deals 
in the most prominent case several politicians aides and 
senior journalists admitted buying stock of a real estate concern 
before the issues were made public and making huge profits by 
selling the shares after they were listed

one of the soviet unions largest newspapers today 
detailed an accord that led to the 1940 takeover of three baltic 
republics the report appeared one day after hundreds of thousands 
of residents protested the pact 
the fullpage article in sovietskaya rossiya the newspaper of 
the russian republic provided the first opportunity for many 
soviets to learn details of the agreement between nazi germany and 
the soviet union 
in the last two weeks papers in the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia also have published details of the 
agreement and on tuesday people jammed parks and public squares to 
mark the 49th anniversary of its signing 
many baltic people are seeking greater independence from moscow 
for their relatively advanced and westwardlooking economies and 
some radicals are agitating for independence 
the small countries were independent after the bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 until they were added to the soviet union in 
1940 
lithuanian historian robertas zhyugzhda writing in sovietskaya 
rossiya of the developments in lithuania said germany and the 
soviet union violated principles of international relations and 
that josef stalins final contacts with the independent government 
of lithuania amounted to an ultimatum 
but he said the soviet unions actions and concerns were 
understandable in the tense atmosphere building up to world war ii 
the pact signed aug 23 1939 is commonly known as the 
ribbentropmolotov pact after german foreign minister joachim von 
ribbentrop and soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov 
zhyugzhda revealed to soviet readers that estonia and latvia 
were assigned under the agreement to a soviet sphere of influence 
and that lithuania originally was assigned to the german sphere 
but in later negotiations after germany attacked poland on sept 
1 lithuania was assigned to the soviet sphere which zhyugzhda 
said was a gross violation of international principles and 
norms 
aside from recent publications in the baltic republics today 
was the first time the soviet press told its readers about the 
spheres of influence 
soviet officials say the nonaggression treaty with germany gave 
their country a vital two years to prepare for an attack by 
hitlers forces which finally came in june 1941 
the historian said lithuanias government tried to reorient 
itself toward germany after signing a mutual assistance treaty with 
the soviet union and that stalin responded by demanding a change in 
the lithuanian government 
from the point of view of normal diplomatic relations such 
demands took the character of direct interference in the internal 
affairs of a sovereign country he said 
hundreds of thousands of people rallied in estonia latvia and 
lithuania on tuesday to demand greater autonomy on the anniversary 
of the pact 
demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their 
former nations and carried banners denouncing the secret agreement 
authorities allowed the protests and there were no reports of 
violence or arrests 
the demonstrations unprecedented in size were another 
indication of foment in the area under mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies of greater openness 
tass the official soviet news agency said in a report on the 
gathering in the estonian capital tallinn that historian yuri 
afanasyev urged estonians to cool their passion for independence 
afanasyev one of the most outspoken critics of stalin said 
there might be various assessments of the 1939 pact but one 
cannot ignore presentday realities 
the reality is that the estonian economy is so much 
interconnected with the allunion economy that mechanical 
separation will inevitably lead the republic to economic 
disaster tass quoted him as saying 
in a report from the latvian capital riga tass said city 
officials had agreed to hoist the historic blueandwhite city flag 
of riga along with that of the soviet union and soviet latvia on 
special occasions the decision by riga officals probably was meant 
as a small concession to nationalist feelings

leaders of canadas largest protestant 
denomination the united church of canada decided today that 
homosexuals can be considered for the ministry 
the vote by the churchs general council was 205 to 160 and 
followed months of heated debate in which onequarter of the 
churchs 4000 ministers and 30000 of its 860000 members signed a 
declaration opposing the ordination of homosexuals 
the decision at the councils biannual meeting in victoria 
british columbia came after midnight tuesday and followed a 
marathon debate it was expected to lead to resignations and a 
possible schism in the united church which was founded in 1925 as 
a union of the congregational methodist and presbyterian 
denominations in canada 
more than 350 delegates finally adopted this resolution 
that all persons regardless of their sexual orientation who 
profess faith in jesus christ and obedience to him are welcome to 
be or become full members of the united church all members of the 
church are eligible to be considered for ordered ministry 
while some argued that sexual orientation could mean those 
with homosexual inclinations conservative delegates interpreted 
the phrase as welcoming candidates who actively practice 
homosexuality 
if we pass this we do a far greater injustice to the people 
who sit in the pews said the rev jim somerville of ottawa 
they will vote with their feet and their dollars if were not 
sensitive to their needs 
ordination candidate bill siksay of ottawa a member of a 
national group for gays called affirm said im very happy about 
what weve done so far but no one in affirm is under any illusion 
that tomorrow our task in the church will be any different 
opponents of homosexual ordination vowed to continue their 
fight saying the recommendation changes the churchs constitution 
and requires a poll of all 4205 congregations 
however the rev eilert frerichs a member of affirm tried to 
lessen fears by saying there will be no rush to the pulpit by gays 
and lesbians 
given the present controversy in the church surrounding sexual 
orientation i dont think there are going to be very many of us 
for the next 10 years at least who will stand up and say im 
lesbian or gay im seeking ordination or commissioning i think 
god in gods own time will send us a final resolution 
church procedures leave ordination up to regional conferences 
and say it is inappropriate to ask candidates about sexual 
orientation only the hamilton ontario conference has a stated 
policy of not ordaining selfdeclared practicing homosexuals 
the vote followed a controversial report on sexuality last march 
which said homosexuality should not be a barrier to ordination and 
also suggested that sex outside of marriage was morally 
responsible in a committed relationship 
the general council voted only to receive not endorse that 
report

chair early thursday for the 1977 stabbing death of a mother of two 
but was granted a stay of execution tuesday by the louisiana 
supreme court 
roemer said he would wait before acting on a pardon board

monday that the panel found that monroe had been deprived of his 
rights during the hearing monroe maintained his innocence 
prosecutors contend that lenora collins 33 was killed after 
she told monroe he was being evicted from an apartment in the 
familys duplex the victims daughter then 11 also was stabbed 
and identified monroe as the assailant 
eighteen inmates including three this year have been executed 
in louisianas electric chair since the us supreme court

workers struggling to make ends meet 
under yugoslavias rising inflation stampeded while waiting on line 
to buy bread and a newspaper said today that 20 people were 
injured 
the incident occurred in the town of titov veles in macedonia 
yugoslavias southernmost province the vecernje novosti daily in 
belgrade said 
it did not say when the stampede occurred 
quoting the local newspaper nova macedonia vecernje novosti 
said bakeries are told to make at least 60 percent of their 
production cheaper varieties of bread but that many stores do not 
follow this advice 
as a result many people wake up early in the morning to 
form lines in front of bakeries to obtain the less expensive 
loaves the paper said 
southern yugoslavia is the poorest part of the country and many 
people have to manage on wages that are the equivalent of 50 to 
100 a month that is onethird to twothirds of the average 
yugoslav income 
their task is made more difficult by 170 percent inflation 
the international monetary fund which is trying to help 
yugoslavia lower the inflation rate to 95 percent this year says 
stringent economic controls including a ban on wage increases are 
necessary to win the funds approval for rescheduling payment of 
yugoslavias 21 billion debt

navy recruiting office in belfast slightly injuring a pregnant 
woman and causing widespread damage to buildings police reported 
police said those responsible for the attack had stolen the car 
after bursting in on a childrens party in west belfast 
while some assailants held five adults and four children hostage 
in the house for several hours before releasing them unharmed 
others loaded the bomb aboard the family car and drove it to the 
city center 
police said they received telephone warnings before the tuesday 
night blast and cleared the area of most residents 
the explosion was on a side street near the recruiting office 
where lt alan shields had worked before being killed in an ira 
bombing on monday he died when an ira bomb attached to his car 
exploded as he drove into east belfast 
he was the 26th british military man to die this year in ira 
attacks compared with three last year 
the mostly roman catholic ira has stepped up attacks recently in 
its fight to end british rule in this protestantdominated province 
and to unite it with the predominantly catholic irish republic 
british authorities say the ira has acquired sophisticated new 
explosives and detonators from libya 
it is our intention to begin using new devices in future car 
bomb attacks against commercial and administrative property 
devices which will minimize the risk to the public the ira said 
in a statement today 
the statement unveiled a new carbomb technique in which a smoke 
grenade would go off before a blast giving bystanders time to 
flee at the same time a switch would be activated to immediately 
set off the main charge if police attempted a controlled explosion 
of the bomb 
tom king secretary of state for northern ireland said he 
attributed the iras steppedup violence to the fact that theyve 
received increased armaments in terms of explosives and weapons 
from libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
king in an interview on abctvs good morning america 
called the ira a dedicated vicious marxist revolutionary group

the chief of japans military resigned today to 
take responsibility for the deaths of 30 civilians killed when a 
naval submarine crashed into a sport fishing vessel 
i presented prime minister noboru takeshita with a notice of 
resignation today just now tsutomu kawara said at a news 
conference many innocent lives were lost in an extremely 
regrettable accident in which the defense force was one of the 
parties involved 
kawara was the first defense agency directorgeneral in 17 years 
to relinquish his post in a controversy linked to the armed forces 
only 18 of the 48 passengers on board survived when their 
fishing boat the 154ton no 1 fujimaru collided with the 
submarine nadashio in tokyo bay on july 23 
public outrage flared when televised reports backed by 
survivors accounts showed the submarines crew standing by as 
people drowned 
kawara speaking slowly and fighting back tears urged his 
successor to work to restore public confidence in the military 
there have been a large number of incidents involving the 
defense agency and it is my hope that under the new 
directorgeneral this problem will be dealt with 
kawaras 10month term as agency head was marred by accidents 
involving the military which even in the best of times is 
unpopular so far this year eight ships and three planes were 
involved in 11 military accidents and two pilots were killed 
takeshita appointed kichiro tazawa 70 the new defense agency 
chief 
tazawa said at a televised press conference that he was taking 
his new responsibility under very difficult circumstances he 
praised his predecessors moves to investigate the submarine 
collision and said his main goal was implementing measures to 
prevent accidents 
takeshita attending a memorial service for the 30 victims 
today also said the government would take steps to prevent 
maritime accidents and promised compensation for the victims 
families 
kawara 51 reportedly turned down the resignations of two other 
defense officials seiiki nishihiro deputy defense agency head 
and adm shuichiro higashiyama chief of staff of the maritime 
selfdefense forces 
in japan it is customary for highranking business executives or 
government officials to assume responsibility for a major incident 
and step down from their posts in an attempt to restore public 
confidence in the institution they represent

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen today criticized his republican opponent as inexperienced 
and young saying i dont think america can risk having dan 
quayle a heartbeat away from the presidency 
bentsen who has shied away from attacking his senate colleague 
dropped his reticence before the southern legislative conference a 
bipartisan lawmakers group that quayle will also address later 
today 
bentsen said he was surprised when quayle the indiana senator 
and gop vice presidential nominee suddenly announced his support 
for making the veterans administration a cabinetlevel agency 
quayle was one of only 11 senators to oppose the bill but 
before the veterans of foreign wars on monday night he made a 
deathbed conversion bentsen said 
quayle told the vfw his vote against the bill was a youthful 
indiscretion 
a youthful indiscretion my friends that vote occurred only 
five weeks ago bentsen said 
i dont think america can risk youthful indiscretion in 
someone who could become our president at any moment the 
67yearold texan said of his 41yearold opponent 
bentsen has been touring the south in a campaign to sell running 
mate michael dukakis to southerners skeptical of the massachusetts 
governor and more of that was expected in todays speech 
the senators staff said he would stick to the theme he used 
before a pair of union audiences on tuesday when he hit quayle and 
vice president george bush on specific issues and steered clear of 
personal attacks and the controversies surrounding quayle its 
not his style to pile it on said one staff member 
instead the senator planned to hammer away at quayles voting 
record 
bentsen attacked quayle on tuesday for fighting against the new 
law requiring 60 days notice for plant closings 
quayle fought it tooth and toenail bentsen told a clearly 
friendly crowd of some 500 members of the united auto workers who 
packed a meeting hall in taylor mich 
i know in some years past some democrats went off and voted 
for ronald reagan bentsen told them eliciting boos of 
disapproval and then cheers when he said well im telling you 
come on home 
bentsen also chided quayle on tuesday for suddenly deciding to 
support the bill creating a cabinetlevel veterans department 
quayle announced his support for the legislation at his speech 
before the veterans of foreign wars on monday night quayle 
attributed his earlier opposition to youthful indiscretion 
that was just a month ago when quayle voted against it on 
the senate floor bentsen said 
one of the goals of the week which will include bentsens own 
speech to the vfw on thursday is to show that republicans dont 
have proprietary rights over patriotism said joe oneill one of 
bentsens top aides 
in addition to his open campaign schedule bentsens days have a 
liberal sprinkling of private fundraisers including a 
1000aperson event at a private home in the ritzy bloomfield 
hills suburb of detroit on monday night

the peruvian shining path guerrillas said jorge alderete 
rosales bolivias undersecretary of the interior

10 billion in damage 
guarachi an experienced climber said the guerrillas used 
walkietalkies and that five wore khaki uniforms he said the men 
made references to a peruvian when they surrounded the camp but he 
did not elaborate 
bolivian air force planes and helicopters today flew over the 
snowcovered mountains about 50 miles north of la paz police said

a dutch activist was sentenced to 
five years in prison today for setting fire to two supermarkets and 
a shell service station to protest south africas apartheid policy 
rene roemersma argued that he was acting in defense of south 
africas 25 million blacks by setting fire to the facilities of 
dutch firms doing business in that country but the court ruled 
that no political motives were sufficient to justify such crimes 
the attacks could easily have caused casualties the court 
said in sentencing the 30yearold protester they also caused 
millions of dollars worth of damage 
the fires at the two makro supermarkets in duiven and 
duivendrecht prompted the owner of the stores to sell its south 
african factories the firm that owned the markets the shv trading 
company complained publicly that the dutch government could no 
longer guarantee the safety of its stores 
although roemersma never admitted to membership a group called 
revolutionary antiracist action or rara claimed responsibility 
for each of the attacks for which he was convicted 
they were among a spate of attacks by rara an acronym meaning 
guess who in dutch all occurred in the predawn hours when 
few or no people were on the premises 
rara targeted a dozen shell service stations across the nation 
for arson and other vandalism to protest the dutchbritish oil 
giants operations in south africa the group claimed 
responsibility for attacks on three makro stores roemersma was 
convicted in one of the gas station attacks 
on april 11 police arrested eight rara suspects after an 
investigation by a special task force assigned to the attacks they 
released seven for lack of evidence within days so only roemersma 
remained to stand trial 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in south africa in which blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

more than 1 million newborns will be tested for 
aids antibodies by the end of 1989 in a program federal researchers 
hope will give them a true picture of the spread of the disease in 
the united states 
the infants will be tested randomly and anonymously in the 
program part of a 40 million package of initiatives to track the 
spread of the virus 
the tests will determine only whether the mother is infected 
dr timothy dondero said tuesday and a positive result does not 
necessarily mean the child has or will get aids 
dondero head of the seroepidemiology branch of the aids 
program at the centers for disease control here said some studies 
indicate 30 percent to 50 percent of newborns testing positive for 
the virus could eventually develop the disease 
the program is intended to test a representative sample of the 
population to determine where aids infection among women is 
concentrated and to determine where to target prevention programs 
dondero said 
so far it is concentrated in big cities it is important to 
assess if it is prevalent in some rural areas as well he said 
over time we will be able to monitor trends of infection in the 
female half of the general population 
dondero said plans for the tests are in place in 23 states plus 
puerto rico and the district of columbia and testing is already 
under way in about half of those 
dondero said he expects about 30 states to participate by years 
end and more in 1989 
officials hope to test about 13 million infants or onethird 
of all babies born by the end of 1989 and continue testing at the 
same rate in succeeding years dondero said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system crippling its ability to ward off infection the disease 
has killed more than 30000 americans 
aids is carried in blood and other bodily fluids it is most 
commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by shared contaminated 
drug needles it is also spread less often from an infected 
mother to her child before or at birth 
the tests will conducted in addition to those routinely done on 
newborns for treatable conditions 
no names will be attached to the blood samples and consent from 
parents is not required dondero said otherwise the random aspect 
of the sample would be tainted 
most groups involved in testing military recruits sexually 
transmitted disease clinics blood donors are to some extent 
selfselected he said people do not agree to take part who 
have some reason for not wanting to take part 
the cdc said the testing sites are expected to include atlanta 
baltimore boston chicago cleveland dallas denver detroit 
houston jacksonville fla los angeles miami new orleans new 
york newark nj richmond va san francisco san juan puerto 
rico st louis washington dc albuquerque nm honolulu

when chinas army calls its soldiers dont 
always show up 
the official liberation army daily said today that when 50000 
reservists were told to assemble for an emergency exercise within 
three days 11500 of them failed to arrive 
the threeday mock battle in northwest chinas gansu province 
last week was chinas first provincewide mobilization maneuver of 
reserve forces under simulated battle conditions the paper said 
the report did not say whether onequarter of the reservists 
called had been unable to find transport or simply ignored the 
order 
two days after vice governor mu yongji issued the order 300 of 
the 1342 reservists in tianshui prefecture were still hundreds of 
miles away in the neighboring provinces of shaanxi qinghai 
ningxia and henan the paper said 
provincial army leaders concluded from the poor showing that 
the reserve forces are highly dispersed and a more effective 
way should be instituted to hasten assembly

scientists didnt find the hot springs 
they were seeking on the floor of crater lake but a park official 
said the 17 dives in a oneperson sub this month yielded valuable 
scientific information 
oregon state university oceanographer jack dymond made the final 
dive in the deep rover on tuesday said peter thompson chief 
ranger at crater lake national park 
the dives began aug 5 in the second year of a threeyear study 
funded by the national park service of the possible effect on the 
lake of hot springs or hydrothermal vents that may be the 
remnants of volcanic activity 
the work is part of a larger 10year study launched when the 
1932footdeep lake the nations deepest began to lose some of 
its famous clarity 
the scientists said earlier this month that nothing they have 
found so far could settle the question of whether proposed drilling 
for hydrothermal energy more than seven miles away would affect the 
lake 
although navigational difficulties precluded a precise search of 
the area where the hydrothermal activity was suspected thompson 
said a variety of hydrothermal information was gathered 
in addition he said a great deal of biological and 
geological information is going to be derived from the samples 
taken 
algae samples were taken as deep as 800 or 900 feet he said 
including some with forms of life never described before in 
addition a fish was sighted at 743 feet down 
thats as deep as anyone has reported a fish in waters like 
that thompson said 
crater lake was formed when rain and melted snow filled the 
crater created when the top of a volcano collapsed nearly 7000 
years ago

the united states and soviet union today opened a 
conference to review the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and 
both sides linked progress at separate arms talks to the other 
sides compliance with the pact 
the conference began today at the soviet diplomatic mission 
us spokesman terry shroeder said he declined to give details 
the first full meeting of both delegations headed by soviet 
disarmament official viktor karpov and the head of the us arms 
control and disarmament agency maj gen william burns was 
scheduled for thursday 
the conference is expected to last for one or two weeks under 
the abm treaty such meetings must be held every five years to give 
both sides a chance to list grievances 
the abm treaty allows each side to deploy only one abm system 
and limits the types of systems that may be deployed the theory 
for the agreement is that a potential aggressor would not launch a 
nuclear attack if it faced the prospect of devastating retaliation 
the united states has maintained a soviet radar under 
construction at krasnoyarsk in siberia violates the treaty and 
must be dismantled the soviets contend the us strategic defense 
initiative a research program aimed at creating a spacebased 
missile defense violates the treaty and should be limited 
according to an information sheet distributed by the us 
mission us officials recently told the soviets that unless the 
radar is dismantled no agreement is possible at negotiations on 
reducing strategic nuclear forces or start 
the start talks have been going on in geneva since march 1985 
both sides agree in principle that strategic forces should be 
reduced by 50 percent 
as a condition for the start agreement the soviets have for 
years demanded that the united states limit its strategic defense 
initiative 
the abm treaty review opened in a lowkey atmosphere following 
earlier us statements which hinted at a showdown over the 
krasnoyarsk radar 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said this month that 
after hearing the soviet position on krasnoyarsk at the abm 
conference should the situation remain unresolved the president 
will consult with the congress and our allies concerning next 
steps 
one possible next step according to the us information sheet 
would be for the united states to declare the radar a material 
breach of the treaty this would open the way for the united 
states to terminate or suspend the treaty and then go beyond its 
limits on the strategic defense initiative 
a us delegation statement issued tuesday did not speak of 
possible retaliatory action 
karpov in an arrival statement saturday said his side is 
prepared to discuss the krasnoyarsk radar he said his delegation 
is ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent adherence to 
the abm treaty 
moscow will insist on the preservation of the abm treaty 
intact as it was signed in 1972 he said apparently alluding to 
moscows position that the strategic defense initiative threatens 
the treaty

austin texas americanstatesman on a national energy policy 
sen lloyd bentsen the no 2 man on the democratic ticket is 
perfectly right to decry the reagan administrations lack of 
interest in expanding the us strategic petroleum reserve 
but it is also worth noting that an expanded reserve should 
be only one part of an overall national energy policy and neither 
the reagan administration nor the congress has yet come close to 
developing such a policy 
everything is partisan during an election campaign 
but after the issue of the presidency is settled it is to be 
hoped that the new administration and the congress will find time 
to agree on a bipartisan national energy policy that will include 
conservation alternative and synthetic fuels and incentives for 
domestic oil and gas exploration a policy that will enable the 
nation to become as energy selfsufficient as possible

sunday sunjournal lewiston maine on the influence of 
lobbyists 
influence peddlers on capitol hill spent more than 63 million 
trying to persuade congress in 1987 
the total represents a 45 percent increase from 1986 when the 
income tax changes caused a surge of lobbying efforts 
the list of groups continues with a seemingly endless number of 
causes 
lawmakers should be wary of the information supplied by special 
interest groups 
the inherent bias built into these organizations should raise a 
red flag of suspicion and any statistics given could be 
questionable 
hopefully congress evaluates each issue in isolation apart 
from the armtwisting that lobbyists exert 
with any luck lawmakers will not adopt barnyard appetites for 
this type of slop

saginaw mich news on dan quayle and his national guard 
service 
the issue of dan quayles vietnamera national guard service 
ought to be put into perspective 
in joining the national guard quayle the republican nominee 
for vice president did precisely what all but the most rare of men 
did in that day 
he looked for the best deal and so did just about everyone 
else including those who went to vietnam 
this is not to suggest any absence of dedication among those who 
served the evidence of vietnam was just the opposite 
how many of those who did heroically slog through the swamps and 
jungles and froze in the mountains can say today that given a 
choice and a chance they would not rather have missed out on all 
that fun and excitement 
the question is whether quayle did serve when his time came he 
did so lets drop the hypocrisy and the harping

geraldine ferraro says she cant understand what the fuss is all 
about 
her son john zaccaro jr was sentenced to up to five years 
in prison with all but four months suspended for selling cocaine 
when he was a college student 
as with many states vermont has an overcrowded prison system 
to get nonviolent offenders out of the state institutions a 
program allows them to secure their own housing while under the 
supervision of a corrections officer who periodically checks on 
them 
zaccaro was able to afford much better housing than his fellow 
convicts hes doing his time in a 1500amonth luxury apartment 
 
the concept behind the house arrest program is sound but it 
shouldnt include drug felons or make a joke out of the penal 
system by permitting those with money to buy a lockup that most 
lawabiding citizens can only dream of living in

our 89500 per year members of congress are being urged by no

has become a disgrace the honoraria that incumbents receive for 
giving speeches 
these appearances for which the members may receive up to 
2000 apiece are essentially the gravy boats to go with their 
porkchopping ways 
the money comes from special interest groups in a word 
lobbyists they think nothing of awarding the members of congress 
for any considerations that might be thrown their way 
this is legal but it is not right 
our congress was envisioned as a noble body acting as a balance 
against excesses in the executive branch and the fashioner of our 
laws 
instead with this disgusting largesse we are made witness to a 
feeding spectacle of embarrassing proportions 
perhaps wrights endorsement coming as it does from one more

east oregonian pendleton ore on george bushs selection of 
dan quayle 
george bushs choice of sen dan quayle to be his running mate 
is uninspiring but voters will make their decision basically 
on the performances of the presidential rather than the vice 
presidential candidates 
bushs selection of quayle on the republican ticket probably 
tells voters something about bushs political philosophy 
quayles voting record in congress is firmly on the conservative 
right wing of the political spectrum 
bush will easily attract the votes of conservatives away from 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis this november 
without a conservative running mate

the honolulu starbulletin on george bushs selection of dan 
quayle 
apart from whether family influence was used to get him into the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war era dan quayle 
presents basic problems for the ticket 
quayles presence reflects questionable judgment on the part of 
vice president bush a presidential nominee who had five months to 
think about a running mate and who rushed to select someone he did 
not know as well as he should have 
to repair the situation quayle needs to answer the national 
guard question and others about his prepolitical life and to 
begin campaigning in more serious settings 
he should get away from rally scenes that require him to shout 
political rhetoric and try other smaller arenas where he can be 
seen and heard in ways that may inspire more confidence in his 
government skills

the baltimore sun on the vincennes report 
the main effect of the pentagons investigation of the uss 
vincennes downing of an iranian civil airliner on july 3 is to 
exonerate the equipment 
confidence is maintained in the complex aegis radar tracking 
system and in the ticonderoga class of guided missile cruisers 
the equipment functioned as designed said defense 
secretary frank c carlucci 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
upheld the action taken by capt will c rogers iii on the basis of 
information available 
the secretary rejected the recommendation of the panel headed by 
rear adm william fogarty that an officer be censured 
mistakes are made in virtually every combat situation carlucci 
said 
an official who sends military personnel into combat must expect 
that so must an official who sends airliners over the area 
the reagan administration trusted in the perfection of american 
boys when it sent them into treacherous waters the khomeini regime 
in tehran made the same mistake in thinking it could attack them 
without risk to innocents nearby

albuquerque nm journal on nelson mandela 
its been nearly 10 months now since the south african 
government freed govan mbeki the 77yearold former chairman of 
the outlawed african national congress 
observers hoped that mbekis freedom signaled the imminent 
release of nelson mandela the charismatic anc leader who like 
mbeki and six other anc members was imprisoned in 1964 after being 
convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government 
but mandela 70 years old is still in prison and now his 
lawyer and family report that he suffers from tuberculosis that is 
all the more reason for him to be freed 
the time is ripe for countries such as the united states to step 
up calls for mandelas release 
south africa may be stubborn but it is not totally deaf to 
international sentiment or to its own best interests last years 
release of mbeki proved that

north jersey advance flanders nj on limiting house and 
senate terms 
although republican platform drafts are scripted in advance an 
unexpected plank swept the delegates 
it called for a limit on the number of terms that house and 
senate members can serve 
this harkened back to the 22nd amendment which limits a 
president to two fouryear terms 
with congress becoming a lifetime job with members holding huge 
advantages over challengers and with their increasing arrogance and 
unaccountability a limit in their service may be the best idea 
on either platform

las vegas nev reviewjournal on the homeless 
jesse jacksons out on the campaign trail trying to beat the 
reagan administration over the head with the homeless issue which 
jackson blames on the heartless economic violence of the 
aforementioned administration 
jackson contends in his speeches there are 5 to 10 million 
homeless people roaming the streets of the united states where 
he gets that figure is a mystery someone ought to ask him 
michael dukakis talks about the 3 to 5 million homeless in 
the united states is dukakis using different sources for his 
information than jackson we doubt it they are both guessing 
thats all 
a harvard university demographic analysis estimated the national 
homeless population at 279000 the census bureau estimates no 
more than 400000 nationwide 
all this is to say that before we go making massive 
taxsupported investments in bigscale lowincome housing 
projects as jackson would have us do lets first find out how 
serious the problem of homelessness is 
maybe with reliable figures not wild guesses we can 
formulate a rational policy

des moines iowa register on dan quayle and his national guard 
service 
if he remains on the gop ticket dan quayle will be a 
distraction from the issues throughout the campaign for the 
presidency george bush should replace him as his running mate 
in trying to reach out to the babyboom generation bush failed 
to discern how his choice of a running mate would dredge up one of 
that generations most terrible memories 
it is the memory of how the vietnam war was fought by the poor 
the black the blue collar while young men from betteroff 
families generally managed to avoid combat duty 
j danforth quayle iii although he came of age at the height of 
the war stayed home in the indiana national guard 
theres nothing wrong with national guard service but in 
quayles case it has the appearance of hypocrisy because his 
political record is that of a military hawk 
and it reeks of special privilege because his wealthy family had 
connections that eased his way into the guard 
the best thing bush could do would be to ask his running mate to 
withdraw

rochester minn postbulletin on george bushs acceptance 
speech 
if a strong acceptance speech was crucial to george bushs 
candidacy he met the challenge thursday night 
in accepting the nomination of the republican party bush 
restated the themes of the reagan administration but also went 
beyond them 
in addition to the expected conservative issues such as 
opposition to gun control and abortion and support for capital 
punishment he gave special emphasis to protecting the environment 
and to the problems of lowincome families 
bush clearly feels that he is now out of the shadow of president 
reagan and is free to chart his own course and to give free rein to 
his own personality 
bushs performance thursday night showed that he is better 
suited for the contest than his critics had believed

the miami herald on the need for prenatal care for the poor 
chalk up one more tragedy caused by crack cocaine one more 
tragedy complicated by the nations and floridas failure to 
provide adequate prenatal care to its poor 
the tragedy is the horrific increase in babies born in florida 
with syphilis 
last year 110 babies were born with the disease in the first 
half of this year that total soared to 120 91 of those in south 
florida 
the price of undelivered prenatal care is high and higher still 
for babies of the poor 
while clinic care costs about 600 intensive care for babies 
born too early or too small can range to 100000 for babies born 
damaged that bill is just a down payment on a lifetime of special 
needs 
that and the loss of a potentially productive citizen is the 
bill society pays for its neglect 
parents pay for their neglect with their guilt and tears but it 
is the babies who pay the dearest price their health and even 
their lives

permit unless the company adhered to its specifications and that 
levy complied with most of the conditions

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle began his first solo campaign trip today by ignoring the 
controversy over his vietnamera military service and instead 
urging creation of real jobs for millions of needy americans 
the indiana senator also told an audience of midwestern state 
legislators that congress could stand a little bit of 
perestroika a reference to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of economic restructuring in the way it drafts the federal 
budget 
quayle made only an oblique reference to the persistent 
controversy over his 1969 entry into the indiana national guard and 
reports of a florida golfing weekend he spent in 1980 with a female 
former lobbyist 
those of you thinking of running for vice president he 
said i want you to know that taking out your trash is a photo 
opportunity 
it was while quayle was taking out his trash at his mclean va 
home in the washington suburbs tuesday that waiting reporters and 
cameramen pounced on him for comment about the controversy swirling 
around him 
quayle denounced the allegations as rumor gossip and outright 
lies which were preventing him from showing the public how he 
intends to work with nominee george bush to promote gop goals of 
jobs peace freedom 
in his cincinnati speech at the outset of his first foray alone 
on the campaign trail quayle sought to do just that 
he stressed his support for a job training bill he cosponsored 
in the early 1980s which he said had created millions of jobs for 
women minorities and disadvantaged workers 
these arent makework makeshift type of jobs he said 
they are real jobs 
quayle also proposed that the federal budget be written every 
two years rather than going through the current laborious process 
every year in a crisis atmosphere 
he said the budget process should be simplified and the 
president should be given lineitem veto authority to reject 
objectionable portions of legislation rather than requiring veto of 
an entire bill 
from cincinnati quayle flew to lexington ky where he had an 
airport encounter with his democratic counterpart vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen of texas bentsen had just 
addressed the same group of southern state legislators that was 
waiting to hear from quayle 
ive warmed up the crowd for you bentsen said 
i hope you said good things about me quayle said 
i dont want to wish you that much good luck bentsen 
replied 
the two men laughed and shook hands 
quayle was to speak to a national conference of enlisted 
national guardsmen in st louis tonight 
at home tuesday quayle said he believed the guard issue will 
fade during the campaign because americans would rather hear about 
peace jobs and freedom 
as for new reports about his entry into the guard and 
relationship with former lobbyist paula parkinson quayle said 
this is just getting a little bit outrageous and im getting a 
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another 
quayle has denied using his familys influence to get into the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war saying that the 
guard had openings at the time 
but a retired indiana guard official acknowledged tuesday that 
he asked the guard personnel office to hold a space for quayle 
after receiving a call from a quayle family friend in 1969 
retired major gen alfred ahner former military support officer 
for indiana and later head of the states national guard said he 
was contacted by an old friend wendell phillippi a retired guard 
commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by quayles family 
wendell phillippi had called and said he had a good man and 
said he thought hed make a good guardsman ahner said in a 
telephone interview from indiana 
after learning there were a couple vacancies i said hold one 
of them theres a good guy coming over he said 
we couldnt take him if there wasnt any opening ahner 
said he said quayle was accepted into the states headquarters 
unit which was pretty selective and looked for recruits with 
intelligence and leadership potential 
he said he paid attention to phillippi because he was a 
former commanding general who would have an eye for who might 
make a good guardsman ahner said quayle received no preferential 
treatment during his service 
meanwhile playboy magazine said tuesday an article in its 
november edition includes a statement from ms parkinson that 
quayle propositioned her during a trip to florida eight years ago 
but that she rebuffed him because she was with another man 
we flirted a lot and danced extremely close and 
suggestively ms parkinson said in the playboy interview he 
said he wanted to make love 
the release by playboy followed a report in the daily news of 
los angeles in which two former attorneys for ms parkinson say she 
told the fbi in 1981 about the alleged proposition 
one of the attorneys washington lawyer glenn lewis told the 
associated press that playboys account was consistent with what 
ms parkinson had told the fbi 
quayle made a pass at her said he would like to sleep with 
her she said no im with tom lewis said referring to 
former us rep tom evans rdel who went on the golfing trip to 
florida in 1980 
ms parkinson evans quayle then a representative and a third 
congressman shared a cottage and the fbi looked into the outing in 
an investigation into whether sexual favors were traded for votes 
against legislation officials dropped the case seven years ago 
without filing charges 
i had nothing to do with her down there quayle said 
tuesday ive got a wife and three small children and i hope 
theres some respect and dignity for things i did not do before we 
go rushing off with all these socalled rumors 
quayle who has been married since 1972 has said he did not 
have an affair with ms parkinson

president mohammed zia ulhaq who 
died in a plane crash that government officials suspect was caused 
by sabotage had many enemies at home and abroad who wanted him out 
of power 
pakistani and us investigators searching the wreckage in 
eastern pakistan of the presidents c130 transport plane have yet 
to report their findings on the crash aug 17 that killed the 
fivestar army general us ambassador arnold raphel and 28 others 
acting president ghulam ishaq khan has said the crash was a 
dastardly crime but neither he nor any other official has 
indicated who is to blame 
zia made many enemies in his 11 years as the ironfisted leader 
of this nation of 107 million people in strategic central asia he 
also was surrounded by unfriendly governments in india afghanistan 
and the soviet union 
zia enraged the moscowbacked communist government of 
afghanistan by providing strong support to moslem insurgents 
fighting to overthrow kabul pakistan was the conduit for the 
shipment of american and saudi weapons to afghan rebels who have 
been fighting a guerrilla war for nearly a decade 
najib afghans president sent a condolence message to ishaq 
khan that referred to the crash only as an incident and did not 
mention zia by name 
a western diplomatic source in islamabad reported tuesday that 
khad the afghan intelligence agency and other kabul regime 
supporters spent the night of aug 17 celebrating president zias 
death 
zias support of the afghan rebels also angered the soviet 
union which has maintained troops in afghanistan since 1979 in 
support of najibs government moscow which is withdrawing its 
troops repeatedly has said pakistan is providing assistance to the 
insurgents in defiance of a unsponsored agreement reached this 
year to bring peace to afghanistan 
pakistan and its neighbor to the east india always have had 
tense relations and have fought three wars in 41 years new delhi 
was particularly concerned about reports which pakistan denied 
that zias government was developing an atomic bomb 
but one western diplomatic source who demanded anonymity noted 
that india on several occasions has indicated it could 
communicate with zia the source said new delhi equated the 
pakistani leader with stability 
zias enemies at home included political opposition leaders 
religious minorities and groups seeking autonomy 
benazir bhutto the main opposition leader who heads the 
pakistan peoples party has a personal grudge against zia he 
executed her father in 1979 
her father zulfikar ali bhutto was a populist prime minister 
ousted in a 1977 military coup led by zia bhutto was hanged two 
years later for alleged with conspiracy to murder a political 
opponent 
ms bhuttos party has been strongly critical of zia 
particularly his decision to forbid candidates from running as 
members of political parties in nationwide elections scheduled for 
november 
another significant political opponent of zia was abdul wali 
khan leader of the prokabul awami national party 
some members of the moslem shiite sect which makes up 5 percent 
of the nations population disliked zia for his religious and 
foreign policies 
zia a member of the majority sunni sect was the driving force 
behind instituting moslem law in pakistan but hardline shiites 
claimed the program did not take into account their form of 
jurisprudence 
pakistans shiites also disapproved of zias close ties to the 
united states which has had icy relations with shiiteled iran 
an englishlanguage newspaper the muslim of islamabad reported 
monday that members of the minority sect blamed zia for the death 
of a pakistani shiite leader who was assassinated aug 5 while 
leaving a mosque in the northwest frontier city of peshawar arif 
hussain alhussaini headed an opposition political party the 
movement for enforcement of shia jurisprudence 
more than 100 shiites were arrested when they fired in the air 
to rejoice the deaths of zia and raphel because they felt the 
pakistan government and the americans had a hand in the murder of 
alhussaini the newspaper said 
sectarian strife broke out in the northwest frontier the paper 
said when shiites and sunnis disputed whether to celebrate or 
mourn zias death 
shiite groups denied that such celebrations took place 
also dissatisfied with zia were groups in the southern province 
of sind who are seeking autonomy the late president was from 
northern punjab province 
some sindhis have sought more economic autonomy to build up 
their province which includes some extremely undeveloped regions 
they claim the province is not fairly treated because punjabis 
dominate the federal government

quayles appearance in cincinnati marked the latest in a string 
of attempts by the republicans to shed the controversy that has 
plagued the gop ticket 
bush told reporters on tuesday his campaign for the white house 
would get back on track whenever you stop asking me these 
questions 
but bush also told a crowd of supporters gathered in front of 
the california state capitol in sacramento im not going to let 
some insidious rumormongers drive me to change my mind im 
standing behind dan quayle 
quayle is facing questions about his national guard duty at the 
height of the vietnam war admission into law school and claims by 
former lobbyist paula parkinson that he propositioned her eight 
years ago during a golf vacation in florida with two other 
congressmen 
ms parkinson told playboy magazine she rebuffed quayles 
advances during the vacation because she was there with thenus 
rep tom evans a delaware republican 
we flirted a lot and danced extremely close and 
suggestively ms parkinson told the magazine about quayle 
according to excerpts of the forthcoming article released tuesday 
he said he wanted to make love 
washington attorney glenn lewis who represented ms parkinson 
when she was questioned by the fbi in 1981 said playboys account 
agreed with what she told the fbi 
but quayle said he had nothing to do with her adding 
this is just getting a little bit outrageous and im getting a 
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another 
dukakis spent tuesday campainging in his home state of 
massachusetts where he borrowed bushs line about voodoo 
economics to criticize the vice presidents budget plan 
there is no republican plan dukakis said the vice 
president is talking about a flexible freeze thats like a melting 
ice cube thats the son of voodoo economics bush criticized 
ronald reagans economic proposals as voodoo economics in 1980 
when the two were competing for the gop presidential nomination 
dukakis also questioned bushs support for mandatory recitation 
of the pledge of allegiance in schools saying the vice president 
was unfit to run for president if he would sign such legislation 
after being told by a court that it was unconstitutional 
bush continued to enjoy postconvention gains in the polls 
a new gallup poll said bush was leading dukakis 48 percent to 
44 percent among registered voters however the survey had a 
margin of error of 3 percentage points meaning that either figure 
could be off by that much gallup contacted 1000 likely voters 
last weekend immediately following the republican national 
convention 
there also were signs of progress being made on a debate 
schedule between the two presidential contenders with dukakis 
campaign chairman paul brountas to meet with his counterpart in the 
bush campaign james a baker iii early next week to discuss 
arrangements 
a new account of quayles entry into the indiana national guard 
also surfaced 
retired major gen alfred ahner former military support officer 
for indiana and later head of the states national guard said he 
was contacted by an old friend wendell phillippi a retired guard 
commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by quayles family 
ahner said in a telephone interview from indiana that after 
phillippi called him he checked with personnel they said they 
had a couple spaces he said i said hold one of them theres 
a good guy coming over 
quayle insisted there was no influence applied because when i 
applied there were openings and after i applied there were 
openings 
one indiana guard report indicated that the guard was 
overextended in mid1969 but a monthbymonth breakdown made 
available tuesday showed that quayles specific unit did have a 
handful of openings when he joined up in may and in the months 
before and after 
the bush campaign is backing away from bushs declaration that 
one of his missions as president would be to create 30 million 
new jobs in eight years the new york times reported today 
robert zoellick senior economic adviser on the bush campaign 
staff said bush used the figure in his acceptance speech for the 
republican presidential nomination to express a general goal rather 
than to promise 30 million new jobs

the defense department has reduced by 54 
percent the number of military families living outside us bases 
in panama over the past five months officials said wednesday 
the effort to move as many military families as possible inside 
us bases in the troubled central american nation has been aided 
by a growing number of servicemen deciding to accept socalled 
unaccompanied tours rather than bring families with them 
pentagon officials say they have no precise statistics available 
on that trend but add that onbase housing has been freed up this 
summer at an unusual rate compared to years past making it 
possible to move more families in from civilian homes 
according to maj kathy wood a pentagon spokeswoman there were 
2450 military families living offpost in panama city as of march 
1 that number had been cut to 1134 as of aug 1 and efforts are 
continuing to find space for as many more as possible she said 
we think we can do more the spokeswoman said of the 
movements there are clearly people choosing not to take their 
families to panama and that helps free housing 
although the pentagon has been working to move dependents to 
base housing for months the effort has taken on more momentum this 
summer because of what the united states has described as a 
deliberate campaign of harassing americans 
us officials in panama city reported last sunday that 
americans had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by 
panamanian authorities this year including stoppage of mail and 
attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations 
the united states is continuing to press economic sanctions 
against panama in a bid to oust military leader manuel a noriega 
noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on 
drug trafficking charges 
panama is the home of the us southern command the 
organization responsible for all us military forces in central 
and south america there are about 10000 american servicemen 
stationed permanently in panama plus about 2200 servicemen who 
have been assigned there on a temporary basis since spring to 
upgrade security at american bases

the national guard these days is no good place 
to hide from a war 
in the years since republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle joined the guard in indiana in 1969 americas oldest 
military organization has been made a full partner in the national 
defense with the regular army 
under the pentagons total force battle plan which came to 
fruition in the reagan years some national guardsmen would be on 
the front lines in a war in just a few days with most of the rest 
of guard combat units to follow within 30 to 60 days 
some would reach the battlefield even before their regular army 
counterparts 
it was not but a few years ago that they said we couldnt 
fight our way out of a wet paper bag and here were on the 
spearhead of an invasion says lt gen herbert r temple jr 
chief of the national guard bureau the liaison with the defense 
department baby weve come a long way and seeing the kids out 
there i dont know of any that say hell no i wont go 
even with the threat of being drafted no longer a factor 
conscription ended in 1972 the guard is at its greatest strength 
in its 352year history with 451900 soldiers in 2043 units 
greater even than during the vietnam war 
the militia that first fought for its homeland at bunker hill 
and has fought in every american war has also emerged into an 
international guard over the past few years half a million 
guardsmen have trained overseas in asia europe greenland and 
africa as well as south america and central america 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and minnesota gov rudy 
perpich went to court to block the dispatch of their states 
guardsmen to central america but failed 
under an army battle plan called capstone national guardsmen 
and army reservists will comprise roughly half the manpower of the 
total force in event of war 
the army cannot go to war without the national guard and they 
recognize this says maj gen donald burdick director of the 
army national guard todays guard is considered a full partner 
with the active component in the total force 
while the capstone strategy was worked out in the late 1970s it 
was not until the military buildup during the reagan years that the 
national guard which once trained with handmedown weapons was 
properly equipped after the vietnam war many of the units were 
down to less than 65 percent of their authorized strength 
the guard now has units with the latest weaponry such as the 
abrams m1 tank the m2 bradley fighting vehicle and the roland 
air defense missile and most units are at 90 percent or better of 
their authorized strength 
the georgia guard received the new abrams tank before the 
active component burdick says now this sends a hell of a 
signal to that young man out there in the guard as to his 
importance today 
the air national guard is also at record strength with 114600 
in 642 units 
the reserve forces policy board an advisory group for the 
defense department says that among other things the air guard is 
responsible for providing air defense on a daily basis for most of 
the continental united states and puerto rico it is solely 
responsible for the air defense of hawaii 
national guard air defense units provide 78 percent of the air 
defense assets for the united states with two fighterinterceptors 
on 24hour alert at each of 22 locations says the board 
air guard tankers provided airtoair refueling for the strikes 
on grenada and libya 
we were ready 10 years ago but it was kind of a paperthin 
combat readiness whereas today the air guard is in basically the 
very same firstline equipment that the active air force is in 
f15s f16s brand new c130s says maj gen john b conaway 
director of the air national guard 
cw3 george howard lloyd an ibm technician from plant city 
fla is a radar operator with floridas 53rd infantry brigade the 
gator brigade that is assigned to defend the panama canal he 
first joined the guard 40 years ago at age 16 and saw combat in 
korea 
brother there aint no comparison between now and what it 
used to be he says we used to meet once a week and play 
cards now we hit the ground running 
the national guard is the only military organization of its kind 
in the world with a dual role as a state militia and a federal 
defense force 
frequently called on to assist in emergencies such as natural 
disasters or riots the guard has been given more responsibility in 
helping curb drug traffic 
the national guard which traces its heritage to four militia 
regiments organized in the massachusetts bay colony on dec 13 
1636 has seen duty in every american war since the pequot indian 
war of 1637 the term national guard was first used in america 
by a new york militia unit on aug 25 1824 
eighteen of the countrys 38 presidents from george washington 
to harry s truman were members of the national guard or the 
militias that were the guards predecessors 
during world war i the guard supplied 17 combat divisions 
379071 soldiers or about 40 percent of the american expeditionary 
forces the records of the german high command noted that of the 
eight american divisions considered the best six were national 
guard divisions 
in world war ii of the first five us army divisions to enter 
offensive combat four were national guard among the 300034 
guardsmen who served in the war 20 received congressional medals 
of honor 
in the korean war 183600 army and air guardsmen were called to 
active duty 
but of the 34 million american servicemen and women sent to 
southeast asia during the vietnam war only 22745 were guardsmen 
president lyndon johnson felt largescale callups of reservists 
for extended periods would lead to more public pressure to bring 
the boys home

burmas president lifted martial law

decide whether to return to multiparty democracy state radio 
reported 
general elections will be held as soon as possible if the 
people vote for a multiparty system in a referendum and top 
government officials will not run in the elections said president 
maung maung 
hundreds of thousands of antigovernment protesters marched 
through rangoon burmas capital a western diplomat and news 
reports said it was the third straight day of mass protest against 
burmas oneparty government and the largest since military rule 
was imposed in 1962 
maung maung said the burma socialist program party would meet 
sept 12 to consider holding a referendum on multiparty rule 
radio rangoon reported in a broadcast monitored in bangkok 
he said he and the 13 other members of the central executive 
committee would step down if the party decided not to hold the 
referendum 
if the party does agree to put the issue to the people 
parliament would amend the constitution at an emergency session the 
next day to pave the way for holding the referendum the radio said 
if elections are held neither i nor any personnel of the 
state council the council of ministers the council of peoples 
justices the council of peoples attorneys and the council of 
peoples inspectors will run maung maung said 
longtime strongman ne win who toppled the elected government in 
1962 and instituted authoritarian rule proposed a referendum on 
multiparty rule in a speech to the party at an emergency session 
when he resigned july 23 
two days later the proposal was rejected by party members who 
were attached to the oneparty system maung maung said today 
the western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
todays demonstration attracted from several hundred thousand to 
up to 1 million people in rangoon a city of 35 million 
they were marching and chanting down with socialism and 
we want democracy he said 
another western diplomat also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that maung maung went today to see ne win who 
still appeared to be pulling strings behind the scenes 
radio rangoon said maung maung signed decrees lifting martial 
law in rangoon and in prome a town 150 miles north of the capital 
an order signed by brig gen myo nyunt the rangoon area 
commander withdrew the military administration from the capital 
it said 
former leader sein lwin imposed martial law on rangoon on aug 3 
after antigovernment demonstrations ne win imposed it on prome on 
july 22 after mobs destroyed houses and shops there 
no violence was reported in rangoon as demonstrators led by 
students and buddhist monks gathered in the morning outside rangoon 
general hospital the main rallying place since troops shot medical 
personnel there during earlier rioting 
diplomats said demonstrators marched from the hospital past the 
us embassy for five or six hours they dispersed peacefully after 
aung san suu kyi daughter of independence leader gen aung san 
addressed them at the hospital 
she urged calm and discipline and nonviolence to bring about 
democratic rule one western diplomat said theyre calling for 
friday to possibly be the biggest day ever a general strike and 
huge demos 
an asian diplomat said aung san suu kyi called for a united 
front against the government and a rally by 1 million people to 
demand full democracy she lives in england with her husband and is 
visiting rangoon 
about 5000 people sat outside the us embassy today listening 
to speeches over loudspeakers the first western diplomat said 
the speakers have been writers artists lawyers doctors and 
nurses and the demonstrators sent frequent messages to the 
embassy asking for support he said 
soldiers went to the embassy but they were 
nonconfrontational staying behind barbedwire barricades he 
said troops also were at intersections and other areas 
when the decree lifting martial law in rangoon was announced 
the soldiers got on trucks and left there was great cheering 
clapping and blowing of horns the diplomat said 
he also cited reports that six demonstrators were shot and 
wounded by security personnel in moulmein 45 miles southeast of 
rangoon but he had no details and the report could not be 
confirmed 
hundreds of thousands of people across burma took to the streets 
from aug 8 to aug 12 to protest the transfer of power from ne win 
to sein lwin widely hated in burma for suppressing dissent

dead and 267 wounded in rangoon alone but diplomats say hundreds 
of people may have died in the protests before sein lwins 
resignation aug 12 after 17 days in power 
the new government has freed more than 600 people arrested 
during the rioting several prominent figures remain in custody 
including aung gyi burmas leading dissident and sein win the

nearly two decades after the woodstock rock 
festival became a symbol of peace and love for the baby boom 
generation the music has been replaced by bickering over whether 
there should be an anniversary concert 
promoters are squabbling neighbor is pitted against neighbor 
and bucolic bethel is still trying to come to grips with its place 
in history 
this town doesnt want to forget it said allan scott 
bethels supervisor the town just doesnt want to get into the 
same thing it got into 20 years ago 
max yasgurs old farm where 300000 people converged for three 
days in august 1969 to hear musicians like the who jimi hendrix 
and crosby stills nash and young isnt a tourist trap largely 
because many people still think its in woodstock 45 miles away 
the only clue along route 17b is a small wooden sign advertising 
the woodstock camp ground that points down narrow hurd road 
about a mile down the road is a large sloping field empty except 
for a concrete and steel plaque that identifies its historic past 
every year more and more people have been assembling at the 
site its virtually become a shrine said stephen davis lawyer 
for the current owners of yasgurs farm brooklyn auto glass shop 
owner louis nicky and his wife june gelish 
the nickys offered the town 200000 for the right to be host 
for another concert in the summer of 1989 bethel would have to 
waive its ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 10000 
people passed in 1970 
no thanks said the town board 
i walked through it besides the drugs there were sex orgies 
all over the place said george neuhaus town supervisor during 
the original festival im 100 percent against another concert 
and i will do everything i can to prevent it 
other townspeople arent so harsh 
of course there was a lot of noisy music and nude people but 
there were a lot of good things too said marion vassmer who 
runs a general store that sold supplies to famished concertgoers 19 
years ago 
the small community two hours from new york city surrounded by 
farms and outoftheway vacation homes simply cant handle large 
crowds scott said 
the supervisor said hes heard from five or six promoters 
about an anniversary concert one even offered to pay for a new 
sewage and water system for bethel but scott said that after he 
asked the promoter to post a letter of credit he never heard from 
him again 
gelish said the people blocking a concert are simply 
oldfashioned 
my husband worked hard all his life he never had a chance to 
be famous gelish said of 61yearold louis nicky this is his 
chance to be famous 
yasgur who allowed promoters to hold the concert on his farm 
died of a heart attack in 1973 at age 54 
joel rosenman one of the four promoters of the original 
concert says the nickys who bought the property seven years ago 
just want to cash in on a piece of history they had nothing to do 
with 
rosenman not coincidentally wants to promote his own series of 
commemorative concerts but somewhere other than the catskills 
gelish who vows to continue fighting for a concert said she 
has no other plans for the land asked if she could envision a 
tourist attraction with the magnitude of graceland elvis presleys 
home her eyes lit up 
this is really hallowed ground she said 
back at the site one afternoon a man in a tiedyed tshirt and 
dirty jeans sat crosslegged in the field a greyhaired man took 
video pictures of trees and tall grass swaying in the wind mark 
duncan drove up his north carolina license plates reading 
woodstck 
duncan who works at a bank in charlotte didnt attend the 
original show but drives up each summer because its a nice 
feeling around here 
speaking above the blare of 1960s hits from his radio duncan 
said hes ambivalent about a woodstock anniversary concert 
if it happens it would be fine he said but i dont think 
it would ever be the same

a federal appeals court reinstating a suit 
by a woman who claims she was terrorized by her husband said 
police may have a special responsibility to protect a person who 
obtains a restraining order against another 
the decision tuesday by the 9th us circuit court of appeals is 
believed to be the first appellate ruling to allow a suit against 
police for harm caused by violation of a restraining order 
the woman jena balistreri of pacifica said in her suit that 
officers derided her complaints about her husbands violence and 
failed to help her 
restraining orders which generally forbid a person to 
approach contact or harass someone else have become common in 
domestic violence cases 
the restraining order in the balistreri case may have been an 
affirmative state commitment to protect the woman from her 
husbands harassment said judge betty fletcher in the 21 
decision 
while there is in general no constitutional duty of police 
to protect members of the public at large from crime such a duty 
may arise by virtue of a special relationship between police 
and a particular member of the public 
a special relationship is found most often when the plaintiff is 
in custody and claims a duty by authorities to provide protection 
from harm 
fletcher said such a relationship may be created when a 
plaintiff secures a protective order and tells officers she is 
still being harassed 
in dissent us district judge laughlin waters said a 
restraining order created no legal right to police protection at 
least without proof that the order had been violated 
he also asked whether the court was conferring preferred 
status on some citizens 
todd roberts a lawyer for police in pacifica declined comment 
on the ruling 
ms balistreri said she got a restraining order against her 
husband in 1982 prohibiting him from contacting her after he beat 
her severely and after he apparently committed vandalism and made 
hundreds of harassing phone calls 
after the order was issued she said he crashed his car into 
her garage and a firebomb was thrown through her window 
she said police refused to arrest him and suggested after the 
firebombing that she move or hire a private investigator she also 
said police responded to her complaints with ridicule and refused 
to investigate harassing phone calls she got between 1983 and 1985 
us district judge samuel conti had dismissed the suit against 
the pacifica police and chief al olsen saying police had not 
violated ms balistreris rights

about 150 parents toured a specially built 
glass booth where an aidsstricken girl is to be quarantined during 
class but many remained concerned that their children could catch 
the deadly virus 
if eliana martinez comes here my daughter wont robin 
preston declared tuesday referring to the mentally retarded 
6yearold who is to attend the manhattan exceptional center under 
federal court order 
theres too much unknown to say aids is not a communicable 
disease he said im sorry she has the disease but why put 
all the other children in jeopardy 
earlier this month us district judge elizabeth a kovachevich 
ruled that eliana could attend classes with other children but must 
stay in the 6by8foot enclosure outfitted with a toilet and sink 
until she becomes toilettrained and stops sucking her fingers 
citing possible emotional damage to eliana if she is so 
isolated elianas lawyers and mother have vowed to keep the child 
out of the cubicle 
chief us district judge william terrell hodges ruled today 
that until the case can heard by the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta eliana may stay in an athome instruction 
program rather than being put in the booth 
can you guarantee that the child will not infect our 
children one parent asked during tuesdays forum organized by 
the school district and health officials 
no i cant guarantee but i can give you the medical 
information said dr dennis ledford an allergist and professor 
at the university of south florida medical school a person 
walking around with this disease doesnt send it out like 
missiles 
the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted 
most often by blood or semen usually through sexual contact or the 
sharing of hypodermic needles 
i dont know what i am going to do said lynette green 
whose 11yearold son is one of a dozen children scheduled to 
attend class with eliana i guess im kind of scared

lost between 1979 and 1985 was 440 while the average wage of 
replacement jobs was onethird less 
thats the price american workers and families are paying for 
eight years of voodoo economics said dukakis borrowing a phrase 
that bush himself once used to describe reagans economic policies 
earlier the aflcio formally endorsed dukakis for president as 
expected with federation president lane kirkland charging that the 
reagan administration has favored greed over need for the past 
eight years 
the giant labor federations endorsement of the massachusetts 
governor was nearly unanimous of its 91 affiliated unions only 
the 30000member air line pilots association the 40000member 
marine engineers union and the 16million teamsters union 
abstained from the vote 
the reaganbush administration came to washington charging 
that government itself was the problem kirkland said eight 
years later we know that government is not the problem the problem 
lies with those who govern this is an administration that has 
favored greed over need 
teamster president william mccarthy said his union had not 
polled its members but is doing so through its monthly magazine 
teamster officials said they expect to announce an endorsement in 
midseptember 
the airline pilots said their board of directors had not met on 
the issue and the marine engineers said they were following a long 
tradition of not making presidential endorsements 
the newspaper guild cast 21390 votes or approximately 80 
percent of its membership in favor of dukakis but abstained on 
4000 votes in the membershipweighted tally 
guild president charles dale said the partial abstention 
reflected the policy of the unions wire service guild local in 
disassociating itself from any political endorsements 
dukakis flew here from boston to address the labor federation 
later today after reviving republican george bushs voodoo 
economics line to criticize the vice presidents own budget plan 
then dukakis planned two days of campaigning in the big 
industrial states of michigan ohio and pennsylvania 
the massachusetts governor spent tuesday wrapping up his annual 
trip to his states northeast communities but he took time to 
deliver some of his harshest criticism to date of bush his 
republican rival 
dukakis called bushs flexiblefreeze budget plan the son of 
voodoo economics it was bush who during his 1980 gop primary 
campaign referred to ronald reagans economic proposals as 
voodoo economics 
the governor also questioned bushs support for mandatory 
recitation of the pledge of allegiance in schools saying the vice 
president was unfit to run for president if he would sign such 
legislation after being told by a court that it was 
unconstitutional 
in addition dukakis reiterated that he was eager to debate 
bush and there was an indication some progress was being made on 
that issue dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas was to meet 
with his counterpart in the bush campaign james a baker iii 
early next week to discuss a debate schedule 
there is no republican plan to erase the federal deficit 
dukakis said after telling newspaper editors he would balance the 
budget within five years by holding the line on defense spending 
cutting some domestic spending and collecting unpaid taxes 
the vice president is talking about a flexible freeze 
dukakis said thats like a melting ice cube thats the son 
of voodoo economics 
dukakis also lashed back at criticism from bush and other 
republicans who have attacked his 1977 veto of state legislation 
that penalized teachers who refused to lead their students in the 
pledge of allegiance 
the governor vetoed the measure after the states highest court 
citing us supreme court precedent advised him the legislation 
was unconstitutional 
i encourage children to say the pledge of allegiance 
dukakis said i say the pledge of allegiance thats not the 
issue the republicans know it that law was unconstitutional 
if the vice president of the united states is saying that if 
he was president and the united states supreme court said the law 
was unconstitutional and the attorney general said it was 
unconstitutional and hed have signed it anyway well that raises 
very serious questions about what it means to take the oath of 
office dukakis said 
you are under a constitutional oath to veto the bill arent 
you he said is the vice president suggesting something else 
is he suggesting hed sign the bill anyway having been informed by 
the highest court of the land that it was unconstitutional if he 
does that he has no business running for this office 
bush spokesman mark goodin criticized dukakis for failing to 
challenge the massachusetts courts advisory opinion 
courts rule on constitutionality not governors goodin 
said the point is if he felt strongly on the issue he could 
have challenged it in court and he decided not to do that 
dukakis also applauded president reagan for signing major trade 
legislation tuesday but said democrats deserved credit for the 
measure dukakis was quick to point out that his running mate 
texas sen lloyd bentsen was the cosponsor of the senate bill 
he was the architect of it dukakis said

officials of north korea and south 
korea said thursday they are willing to resume talks on sharing 
next months olympics and a nonaggression pact 
but there was no clear agreement north korea suggested meeting 
on thursday and south korea proposed a session on friday 
officials at the national assembly said their chief delegate 
prk joonkyu met privately with his north korean counterpart chon 
kum chol at the truce village of panmunjom wednesday later in the 
day seoul telephoned panmunjom to suggest reopening talks friday 
north korea said in a radio broadcast monitored in tokyo that 
its delegation had proposed meeting on thursday 
park refused to disclose details of wednesdays meeting he did 
say he expected new proposals from north korea but he admitted 
he was not encouraged by wednesdays meeting 
assembly officials were reluctant to predict whether the 
deadlocked talks could be revived but one senior official 
speaking on condition he not be identified said neither side 
wants to take the blame 
seoul officials say they believe north korea does not expect a 
dramatic breakthough instead they think panmunjom is trying to 
distract world attention from the sept 17oct 2 olympics in seoul 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since their peninsula was 
divided at the end of world war 
the current round of talks which began aug 19 ended in a 
stalemate monday south korean delegates said then they hoped to 
pospone further contacts until after the olympics 
north korea had called for urgent talks on sharing the olympics 
but south korean officials said they were not so enthusiastic about 
pursuing the subject when the facetoface meetings began the 
north koreans seemed more concerned about a nonaggression pact 
they said 
these preliminary talks broke up over such basic issues as the 
agenda and the number of participants for later negotiations 
proposed for the two parliaments north korea insists the main 
talks include the full legislatures of both sides which would 
involve nearly 1000 people south korea wants delegations of up to 
30 lawmakers from each side 
north korea also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint 
declaration of nonaggression calling for the withdrawal of the 
42000 us troops in south korea as well as removal of the 
nuclear weapons allegedly in their arsenal seoul sees the us 
forces as vital to its defenses 
north korea has said it would boycott the olympics unless it can 
be a cohost the international olympic committee rejected the 
north korean demand saying that the olympics are given to a single 
city and cannot be shared

the state department said today it was 
shocked by israels decision to expel 25 palestinian activists 
and a senior diplomat said that relations between the two countries 
might be damaged if the expulsions continue 
the warning was conveyed monday by deputy secretary of state 
john whitehead to israels charge daffaires oded eran said an 
israeli source declining to be further identified 
israeli embassy spokesman yossi gal confirmed the meeting took 
place but declined to discuss its contents 
eran who is in charge of the embassy while ambassador moshe 
arad is on vacation was summoned to the state department after 
israel announced it would expel 25 palestinians accused of fueling 
the violence which has claimed more than 250 palestinian lives in 
the past eight months 
whitehead was emphatic about the us position that it objects 
to these expulsions said the source 
he said relations could be damaged if this goes on the 
source added 
we are shocked by the government of israels decision to expel 
an additional 25 palestinians said state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley 
she said that if israel carries out the deportation orders it 
will bring to 60 the number of palestinians expelled this year from 
the israelioccupied territories the expulsions can be appealed to 
the israeli supreme court although all the orders have been upheld 
this year 
the growing number of expulsions appears to indicate that 
deportations are the norm rather than the exception she added 
israel contends that it uses expulsions only as a last resort to 
ensure public order is maintained in the territories it has 
accused those expelled of fueling the palestinian uprising that 
began last december 
israel argues that it is entitled to deport palestinians in 
accordance with international law governing occupying powers as 
well as under british emergency laws applied by the government in 
the west bank and gaza 
but mrs oakley repeated the us view that deportations are not 
legal under the geneva human rights accords which govern the 
conduct of occupying powers and called on israel to charge and try 
palestinians rather than expel them 
expulsions only exacerbate the situation and increase tensions 
between israelis and palestinians she said 
nonetheless mrs oakley reaffirmed the strong ties between the 
two countries saying our friendship and close association with 
israel continue 
israel is the largest recipient of us foreign aid getting 3 
billion annually in economic and military support funds

a ussoviet conference reviewing the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty opened wednesday after both sides 
linked progress at separate weapons reduction talks to full 
compliance with the abm accord 
superpower delegates held two meetings wednesday one in the 
morning and one in the afternoon said us spokesman terry 
shroeder he said he had no details of what was discussed 
the first full meeting or plenary of both delegations is 
scheduled for thursday at the us diplomatic mission the us 
delegation is headed by maj gen william burns head of the arms 
control and disarmament agency and the soviet side by top 
disarmament official viktor karpov 
the conference is the third such meeting held since the abm 
treaty went into effect under the accord such meetings must be 
held every five years 
the abm treaty restricts each side to deploying only one abm 
system comprising a radar and antiballistic missiles the aim is 
to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective 
network under the theory that neither would launch a nuclear attack 
if it feared devastating retaliation 
the united states maintains that a soviet radar under 
construction in krasnoyarsk in siberia violates the treaty 
because it is not located on the periphery of the country facing 
outward as the treaty stipulates that missile tracking radars must 
be 
the united states has also voiced concern at soviet deployment 
last year of two other radars in gomel near kiev saying they also 
violate the treaty 
an information sheet distributed by the us mission says us 
officials recently told the soviets that unless the krasnoyarsk 
radar is dismantled no agreement is possible at separate 
negotiations on reducing strategic or intercontinental nuclear 
forces this was apparently the first time the us side made such 
a linkage 
the soviets have for years linked progress in the strategic 
weapons negotiations to limits on the reagan administrations 
spacebased missile defense system 
the soviets have said that some research on the system 
officially known as the strategic defense initiative and popularly 
called star wars violates the abm treaty but their public 
statements have not made clear where they draw the line the us 
has rejected the soviet call for limits on the program 
us officials in washington said early this month that the 
chief us aim at the review conference would be to get the soviet 
side to correct its violations of the abm treaty 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that if the soviet 
position on krasnoyarsk does not change at the review conference 
the president will consult with the congress and our allies 
concerning next steps 
karpov the soviet delegation chief said upon arrival saturday 
that his side is prepared to discuss the krasnoyarsk radar he said 
the soviets were ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent 
adherence to the abm treaty 
moscow will insist on the preservation of the abm treaty 
intact as it was signed in 1972 he said apparently referring to 
the soviet position that the star wars program threatens the 
treaty

a federal jury today convicted a man of burning 
an american flag outside an armed forces recruiting station during 
a demonstration 
william c cary jr a 22yearold member of the naval reserve 
could receive up to a year in prison no sentencing date was set 
he remained free on 1000 bond 
cary testified tuesday that he set fire to the flag in 
minneapolis in march to show his discontent with president reagans 
decision to send troops to honduras 
i dont necessarily agree with what my government was doing 
but that doesnt make me less of an american or less of a 
patriot said cary who at the time of his arrest worked in a 
used clothing store 
assistant us attorney thor anderson said the act was a show of 
contempt for the flag this case is not about political 
beliefs he told the jury 
there are ways one can be legally contemptuous he said 
one can stand on a podium and shout or sing but congress has 
said that for certain reasons you cant be contemptuous of the 
flag 
cary dressed in garb made from a us flag was arrested during 
a large protest in which demonstrators used bowling balls and rocks 
to break windows at the recruiting office he was charged with 
burning a flag in public 
cary testified that a woman he didnt know handed him one end of 
a flag she was carrying and asked for his help in burning it he 
said he used his own lighter and he and the woman laid the burned 
flag in front of the recruiting office doorway 
it seemed like an appropriate gesture he testified i 
knew there were cameras there i knew i could get peoples 
attention that way 
anderson said proceedings are under way to expel cary from the 
naval reserve of which he has been a member since age 18

a federal judge ordered the city to return a 
black boy to his white foster parents saying that deciding the 
childs placement on nonracial grounds will encourage treatment of 
people as individuals 
us district judge john hannum ruled tuesday that 5yearold 
raymond bullard now living with the rev willie williams and his 
wife elaine who are black should be returned to the home of john 
and marilyn mclaughlin 
the child lived with the mclaughlins between age 5 months and 2 
years 
deciding raymonds placement not on the basis of his race 
but on the quality of his relationships will advance the strong 
public interest in overcoming racial discrimination and will 
promote the goal that citizens be treated according to their 
individual human qualities hannum wrote 
the judge said the youngster received quality care from both 
sets of foster parents but he concluded the boy had become 
emotionally tied to the mclaughlins became depressed after being 
removed from their care and would suffer irreparable harm if not 
returned to them 
it is evident that use of race as a sole criterion in making 
proper longterm foster care placements of black foster children is 
inadequate hannum wrote 
factors such as the ability of foster parents black or white 
to care for the child to provide a safe secure and stable home to 
the child etc must be examined in making determinations of this 
kind 
mrs mclaughlin said she was tickled pink by the decision 
just to have him home in our arms what else can we tell you 
willliams said he did not believe it was in raymonds best 
interest to be moved again he said the child was well adjusted and 
was part of his family he said he and his wife wanted to discuss 
the ruling with their attorney before deciding whether to appeal 
raymond was placed with the mclaughlins in 1983 by catholic 
social services a nonprofit foster care agency under contract to 
the philadelphia department of human services 
catholic social services said the placement would be for six 
months then the boy would be returned to his natural mother but 
his mother who had emotional problems was deemed not ready to 
resume caring for the child at the end of the six months and 
raymond remained with the mclaughlin family 
in 1985 however catholic social services advised the 
department that raymond should be removed from the mclaughlins and 
placed with a black family to comply with the city agencys policy 
the child subsequently was placed with the williamses 
williams a board member of catholic social services said the 
agency told him they had viewed raymonds placement with the 
mclaughlins as shortterm care and the boys placement with the 
williamses as a longterm solution 
theres no set policy on placing children with foster 
parents of a different race said virginia durkinasti spokeswoman 
for the philadelphia catholic archdiocese which runs catholic 
social services we match children to families according to who 
is best able to help the child each case is individual 
the human services department denied it used race as the sole 
factor in placing raymond 
but hannum disagreed and said using race as the sole criterion 
was unconstitutional 
he granted the injunction the mclaughlins requested directing 
the department to submit a plan to return the child to the 
mclaughlins within two months 
the judge said the evidence showed the boy would benefit from 
returning to the mclaughlin home and would be harmed 
psychologically if not returned 
the judge added however the plan should give the boy contact 
with the williams family 
hannum noted that the mclaughlins live in a racially integrated 
neighborhood and had pledged to the court that raymond would attend 
a racially integrated school near their home 
this court is satisfied that raymond will have every 
opportunity to develop a positive sense of racial identity

the us trade deficit shrank 149 percent 
from april through june helped by a record high level of exports 
and the first quarterly decline in imports in three years the 
government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said the difference between what america 
spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of 299 billion in 
the second quarter compared to a deficit of 352 billion in the 
first three months of 1988 
that was the biggest quarterly improvement in more than five 
years and continued a trend which began after the deficit hit a 
record 412 billion in the octoberdecember quarter 
for the first six months of this year the trade deficit on a 
balance of payments basis has been running at an annual rate of 
1302 billion down almost 20 percent from the record 1603 
billion deficit suffered in 1987 
some economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by 
close to 25 percent for the year as a whole marking the first 
annual improvement since president reagan took office 
we have had a very good six months for trade it has taken a 
long time but the trade deficit is finally turning around said 
david wyss chief financial economist with data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm 
democrats have tried to make the countrys soaring trade 
deficits in the 1980s a campaign issue but republicans are hoping 
the voters will focus instead on this years improvement which has 
made us manufacturing one of the standouts of the economy 
the new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports those figures 
showed the trade deficit declining 128 percent to 326 billion in 
the second quarter compared to 374 billion in the first quarter 
wednesdays figures are smaller because they subtract such 
factors as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly 
numbers 
the new report said that imports edged down 08 percent to 
1096 billion in the apriljune quarter the first quarterly 
decline since the first three months of 1985 while imports of 
petroleum products were up by 26 percent to 102 billion nonoil 
imports fell 11 percent reflecting a big drop in car shipments as 
americans began to balk at higher sticker prices caused by the 
weaker dollar 
foreign car imports from countries other than canada fell by 12 
percent in the second quarter led by a 25 percent decline in 
shipments from west germany south korean car shipments fell by 19 
percent while japanese car imports were down 7 percent 
average prices for german cars shot up 21 percent in the second 
quarter while the average price of japanese cars rose by 3 percent 
us exports climbed 58 percent to a record 797 billion in 
the second quarter reflecting in part a 48 percent surge in us 
aircraft sales 
agricultural exports were up as well climbing 7 percent to 97 
billion the highest level since the second quarter of 1984 
corn sales climbed 27 percent with much of the gain attributed 
to increased sales to the soviet union and mexico wheat sales were 
up 10 percent due to an increase in sales to china while meat and 
poultry shipments rose 28 percent largely due to increased 
japanese purchases 
soybean and wheat prices both rose 13 percent while corn prices 
were up 7 percent analysts said even larger price increases would 
be seen in coming months since the spring advance did not reflect 
the impact of the summer drought 
the trade deficit decreased with every major geographic area 
except for canada the countrys largest trading partner where the 
imbalance climbed by 500 million to 41 billion 
the countrys largest deficit as usual was with japan an 
imbalance of 119 billion down 11 billion from the first 
quarter 
the deficit with latin american decreased 15 billion to 17 
billion while the deficit with western europe fell 900 million to 
38 billion the deficit with the newly industrialized countries 
of south korea taiwan singapore and hong kong declined 700 
million to 61 billion

strikers closed down the last section of

stella nickell convicted in federal court of 
using cyanidelaced pills to kill her husband and a stranger will 
not face state murder charges prosecutors said 
mrs nickell was convicted of product tampering in us district 
court last may and was sentenced to 90 years in prison 
dan donohoe spokesman for king county prosecutor norm malengs 
office said tuesday that maleng determined that substantial 
justice was already done in the federal court sentence 
the sentence is probably as much as she would have gotten for 
a state murder conviction donohoe said 
he also said maleng thoroughly checked the case and noted a us 
justice department opinion stated the conviction would withstand 
appeal 
maleng also said that if necessary he could impose a murder 
charge at a later date since there is no statute of limitations 
the charges against mrs nickell 44 of auburn stemmed from 
the june 1986 deaths of her husband bruce nickell 52 and sue 
katherine snow 40 also of auburn both died after taking 
cyanidelaced extrastrength excedrin capsules 
besides putting tainted pills in a bottle of capsules used by 
her husband mrs nickell was accused of placing poison pills in 
capsule containers on store shelves to make her husbands death 
appear to be at the hands of a random killer 
she stood to gain about 100000 more in life insurance policies 
if her husband died by other than natural causes 
the deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and caused 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyer to recall the brand

greek and turkish cypriot leaders agreed wednesday 
to meet next month for unconditional talks aimed at reunifying 
their wardivided island 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar held a working 
lunch for greek cypriot leader george vassiliou and rauf denktash 
of the turkish cypriot side in which he said the two men pledged 
a determined and sustained effort to resolve issues that have 
long divided cyprus 
vassiliou and denktash said the meeting created a new 
opportunity for finding a just and lasting solution of the cyprus 
problem the un leader told reporters 
it was a good beginning we made progress on the procedural 
issues said vassiliou recently elected president of the 
internationally recognized cyprus government 
it was vassilious first meeting with denktash president of the 
breakaway turkish cypriot state established in the turkishoccupied 
part of the island which is only recognized internationally by 
turkey 
denktash also seemed satisfied by the meeting saying vassiliou 
was a good talker and negotiator 
the cyprus problem arose first in the wake of intercommunal 
clashes in 1963 that led to the dispatch of a united nations peace 
force to the island it was aggravated in july 1974 when turkey 
invaded and occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of a coup 
by supporters of union with greece 
denktashs unilateral declaration of independence in november 
1983 was declared legally invalid by the un security council 
which demanded its abrogation 
previous negotiations between denktash and former cypriot 
president spyros kyprianou broke down in december 1985 
kyprianou had insisted the negotiations follow the 
implementation of united nations resolutions demanding the 
withdrawal of the estimated 30000 turkish troops from north cyprus 
i believe we will be able to find ways of settling the various 
problems he is different from kyprianou denktash said 
denktash however indicated the question of troop withdrawal 
was likely to be the biggest stumbling block 
denktash on wednesday reiterated his position that there can be 
no withdrawal before the dissolution of the illegal cyprus 
government and its replacement by a joint greekturkish cypriot 
administration 
a senior un official close to the negotiations said the 
meeting went better than we expected and the two leaders got 
along very well indeed 
we are sure they have already laid the foundations of fruitful 
future negotiations the official added speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
perez de cuellar said negotiations between the two cypriot sides 
will start sept 15 in nicosia the venue will be a hotel in the 
unpatrolled nomansland splitting the greek and turkish cypriot 
sectors of the city for 25 years 
he added that the two leaders will meet again sept 16 and 
recognized that the success of these talks depended on their 
personal and continuous involvement 
the two also agreed to meet with perez de cuellar in new york 
after the first rounds of meetings in nicosia to review the 
progress achieved during this initial stage he added 
greek and turkish cypriot sources revealed that the nicosia 
talks would be carried out on an intensive daily basis and that the 
new york meeting would be held at the end of october 
perez de cuellar said the two leaders also had reaffirmed their 
committment to agreements reached between 1977 and 1984 for the 
settlement of the cyprus problem through the establishment of a 
bizonal federation 
the other major outstanding issues involve the implementation of 
a series of un resolutions ignored by turkey 
these demand the repatriation of 50000 mainland settlers from 
north cyprus and the return of 200000 greek cypriot refugees 
onethird of the island population to their homes there 
the two sides however disagree on constitutional aspects and 
the powers of the central government

the head of japans defense agency resigned 
wednesday to take responsibility for a submarine collision that 
killed 30 people aboard a sports fishing boat last month 
tsutomu kawara fighting back tears urged his successor to take 
steps to restore public confidence in the selfdefense forces after 
a series of accidents 
many innocent lives were lost in an extremely regrettable 
accident in which the defense force was one of the parties 
involved kawara told reporters after handing in his resignation 
to prime minister noboru takeshita 
kawara 51 who served as directorgeneral for 10 months said 
his successor kichiro tazawa should take over the 
responsibility of ensuring that such an accident never occurs 
again 
tazawa installed as agency head wednesday night said in a 
televised news conference that pursuing a safer armed forces would 
be his major goal 
the fishing boat the 154ton no 1 fujimaru was rammed in the 
side by the massive nadashio naval submarine on july 23 japanese 
were outraged when television reports and witnesses accounts 
revealed crew members standing on the submarine and watching people 
drown 
while defense has grown increasingly important for our 
country there have been a large number of incidents involving the 
defense agency kawara said 
the submarine crash brings the number of military accidents this 
year to 11 and the death toll to 32 critics say public confidence 
in the military is waning in a country where the armed forces have 
rarely been popular 
kawara becomes the first defense agency directorgeneral in 17 
years to relinquish his post in a controversy involving to the 
armed forces 
in 1971 keikichi matsuhara resigned to take responsibility for 
the deaths of 162 people when a military plane collided with a 
commercial domestic airliner in northern japan

government officials to assume responsibility for a major incident 
and resign as a means of restoring public confidence in the 
institution they represent 
two other defense agency officials defense agency deputy head 
seiki nishihiro and adm shuichiro higashiyama chief of staff of 
the maritime selfdefense forces also indicated they would resign 
after the submarine collision but kawara reportedly refused to 
allow them to step down

gun enthusiasts who have been shooting clay 
targets along chicagos lakefront for generations are under fire 
from the parks agency and citizens groups who say the 76yearold 
club is polluting lake michigan 
patrons of the lincoln park gun club situated two miles from 
downtown argue that it is a unique part of the lakefronts heritage 
and one of few places in the city where people from all walks of 
life can compete on equal ground 
but the park district and others complain of lead shot clay 
targets and plastic wads from shotgun shells 
a park district committee takes up the issue tonight said nancy 
l kaszak an attorney for the agency 
the skeet and trap shooting club was founded in 1912 when 
patrons showed up in straw hats and threepiece suits now they 
wear everything from hunting clothes to shorts 
membership costs 220 per year and members can shoot for 3 per 
round while nonmembers must pay 6 
the club on cityowned land pays upkeep but no rent said club 
manager ed bishop it has 386 members but more than 5000 people 
come to shoot every year 
its an integral part of the lakefront and an example of the 
diversity of this city said john madonia a 41yearold health 
care executive who came to the gun club with his father more than 
20 years ago 
it doesnt make any difference how much money you make if 
you dont hit the target it doesnt break added john mickey 
club vice president 
club officials acknowledge that the plastic wads cause litter 
but said the organization is willing to hire people to pick up them 
up they also said the lead shot wads and clay targets do not 
pollute the water 
its more a litter problem than a pollution problem bishop 
said 
the gun club says its litter but we say its water 
pollution argued theodore denning manager of the chicago field 
office of the illinois environmental protection agencys division 
of water pollution 
denning said that the clay and shot do not appear to threaten 
marine life but that state law requires illinois waters be free of 
debris 
opponents of the club also say it is a safety hazard we have 
concerns about the operation and usage of guns in such a highly 
dense park facility ms kaszak said 
bishop said the clubs record speaks for itself weve been 
here 76 years and weve never have an accident he said youre 
safer here than you are in a golf course

the newspaper guild on wednesday qualified its 
backing of democrat michael dukakis presidential candidacy 
declaring a 15 percent abstention primarily because of opposition 
by wire service employees to any political endorsements 
three of the aflcios 90 other affiliated unions the air line 
pilots association the teamsters and the marine engineers voted 
to abstain their entire memberships in the labor federations 
formal endorsement of dukakis 
the marine engineers for three decades have opposed making a 
presidential endorsement and the air line pilots said they had not 
had a meeting of their executive board on making an endorsement 
teamster president william mccarthy whose union endorsed ronald 
reagan in 1980 and 1984 said he was abstaining on a presidential 
endorsement until after a mail poll of his unions members is 
completed in midseptember 
newspaper guild president charles dale said his unions 
executive board and convention in june gave its blessing to a 
presidential endorsement 
but primarily because of uproars in the past from its 
1000member wire service guild local he told the aflcios 
general board that he was casting only 21390 votes for a dukakis 
endorsement and voting his unions 4000 other members as 
abstaining 
at least one of our locals the wire service guild 
representing employees of associated press and united press 
international has a policy of dissassociating itself from any 
political endorsements by this international he said so i 
note that our vote does not carry with it the support of members of 
that local 
in 1983 the newspaper guild had cast all of its members votes 
in favor of the aflcios early endorsement of walter mondale 
the following week the wire service guild formally dissociated 
itself from that endorsement saying that because it represents 
reporters who cover political campaigns it should refrain from 
taking sides in them 
the local based its action on a membership referendum conducted 
in 1973 following the parent unions presidential campaign 
endorsement a year earlier of democrat george mcgovern

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen suggested wednesday that his republican counterpart 
dan quayle lacks the maturity required of someone who might have 
to lead the country 
i dont think america can risk youthful indiscretion in 
someone who could become our president at any moment bentsen 
67 told the southern legislative conference in lexington in his 
toughest attack on the 41yearold quayle 
the texas senator referred to a speech that quayle made earlier 
this week before the veterans of foreign wars in chicago where 
quayle blamed youthful indiscretion for his opposition to 
senate legislation that would establish a cabinetlevel department 
of veteran affairs 
the indiana senator told the vfw he was reversing that position 
bentsen said that was an example of how quayle would behave if he 
were in the white house 
a youthful indiscretion my friends that vote occurred only 
five weeks ago bentsen said i dont think america can risk 
youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at 
any moment 
at a news conference after his speech bentsen made a veiled 
reference to quayles decision to seek entry into the national 
guard in 1969 during the vietnam war bentsen whose son joined the 
guard one year earlier has refused to attack quayle directly on 
that issue 
asked about quayle bentsen a former world war ii bomber pilot 
said 
i certainly dont think hes too young but i think that you 
have to have some maturity 
and i think that the breadth of experience that ive had and 
the tests that ive undergone some of the things that happened to 
me early on in combat make you grow up pretty fast 
quayles quick switch on the va bill showed that he didnt have 
the continuity of judgment that you would expect said bentsen 
who supported the veterans bill which the senate approved july 12 
bentsen said he was not stepping up criticisms of his 
quayles personal life and he made no mention of allegations 
involving quayles association with former lobbyist paula parkinson 
during a florida golfing weekend in 1980 
but bentsen said he was just getting started comparing his 
record and experience with quayles 
asked if he thought quayle would still be on the gop ticket in 
november bentsen replied i hope so 
quayle received a warm reception from the southern legislators 
many of them proreagan democrats not long after bentsen addressed 
them the two candidates met briefly at the lexington airport 
where bentsen said he had just warmed up the crowd for quayle 
the two shook hands and laughed 
in his speech bentsen criticized republican nominee george 
bushs assertion that he would create 30 million new jobs in eight 
years bentsen said there were only 65 million people looking for 
work 
the only way youd get 30 million jobs is to take away the 
border patrol and move onethird of mexico here he said or 
raise the working age to 80 
bushs statement was another example of voodoo economics 
bentsen said 
there is no real alternative to the honest able leadership of 
mike dukakis bentsen said mike dukakis is right for the south 
take it from a texan 
from lexington bentsen flew to louisville and visited a senior 
citizens home the senate finance committee chairman talked about 
his efforts toward enacting a catastrophic health insurance law 
he told about 300 residents of dosker manor that despite their 
talk of helping the elderly the republicans had tried to cut back 
programs for seniors 
dont just read their lips see what they do he said 
twisting a phrase that bush used had used in his acceptance speech 
at the gop national convention in new orleans about opposing tax 
increases

the captain of the uss dubuque is refusing to 
appear at a navy disciplinary hearing on charges of dereliction of 
duty for failing to rescue a boatload of vietnamese refugees who 
claim they later resorted to cannibalism to survive the service 
says 
capt alexander g balian 48 of los angeles has been charged 
with two counts of violating lawful orders under a section of the 
uniform code of military justice that calls for nonjudicial 
punishment proceedings said cmdr david dillon a pacific fleet 
spokesman in san diego calif 
he was ordered to appear at a closed admirals mast this 
afternoon before vice adm george w davis jr the head of all 
surface ships in the pacific fleet the spokesman added at such a 
hearing balian could be stripped permanently of his command fined 
or issued a letter of reprimand or censure 
but balian notified the navy on tuesday afternoon that he was 
exercising his right to refuse the admirals mast said captain 
peter litrenta spokesman for the us pacific fleet 
this wont be dropped a source said if he doesnt show 
up for the mast tomorrow then theres going to be a court 
martial 
balian was charged with violating a general navy regulation by 
wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance to vietnamese 
refugees found on the south china sea on june 9 1988 in danger of 
being lost 
the second count accuses him of violating standing operational 
orders for the pacific fleet which require a commanding officer 
to aid and rescue refugees encountered at sea in lifeendangering 
circumstances 
the navy also alleges balian was derelict in the performance 
of those duties in that he negligently failed to investigate 
sufficiently and render appropriate assistance as it was his 
duty to do 
in an admirals mast davis would serve as the lone judge or 
authority in considering the evidence 
given balians decision not to attend davis will have to decide 
whether to drop the matter or order an article 32 hearing an 
article 32 hearing similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding is 
the first step in a full military court martial 
according to the navy balian could receive a maximum penalty of 
two years in prison and total forfeiture of pay if the case went to 
courtmartial and he was convicted 
balian was relieved temporarily of his command of the dubuque on 
aug 13 pending the outcome of a navy investigation 
the dubuque an amphibious landing ship encountered the 
boatload of vietnamese refugees while steaming to duty in the 
persian gulf the navy said the dubuque gave the refugees several 
hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids but did not 
take them aboard because the refugee craft was judged seaworthy 
by balian 
navy regulations and orders specify that warships should be 
alert for refugees on the high seas and if encountered ships 
are to extend humanitarian assistance as needed 
in the case of an unseaworthy vessel adverse weather or other 
special circumstances the refugees may be embarked and transported 
to the navy ships next port of call 
the boat people eventually were rescued off the coast of the 
philippines and taken to a refugee camp there where reports of 
murder and cannibalism began to surface 
some survivors have been quoted as saying they ate fellow 
passengers to stay alive after they encountered the dubuque two 
victims reportedly died of starvation but three others allegedly 
were murdered through drowning and then eaten 
some survivors charged the dubuque refused to take them aboard 
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure 
and starvation 
in addition to the navy the united nations high commission on 
refugees has been investigating those reports 
robert cooper the un commissions manila representative said 
52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58 people died during the 
crossing the refugees began their journey may 22 from the mekong 
delta town of ben tre aboard a 35foot wooden boat its engine 
failed two or three days later

the man whose book the graduate 
became the smashhit movie of an idealistic generation says he is 
nearly destitute living out of a van and trying to make ends meet 
on a few thousand dollars a year 
its hard to make anybody believe the author of the graduate 
needs money said charles webb 49 who says his abhorrence of 
materialism led him to give away two houses in his salad days 
hard times however have driven webb and his exwife an artist 
who calls herself fred out of the california campground where they 
lived for the last decade to the massachusetts town where webb went 
to college 30 years ago 
he came east he said wednesday in hopes of finding a publisher 
for his latest project a compilation of writings on prejudice his 
plight however has taken him to a welfare office in north adams 
which rejected him because he has no permanent address 
the things he stands for and believes in are principles he 
cant live by any longer said fred 48 who still lives with her 
exhusband 
the novelist whose hero in the graduate benjamin braddock 
struck a chord among young readers with his postgraduate misery at 
his parents suburban home has lived until now according to what 
friends consider impossibly high and even selfdestructive 
standards 
if hes hard up for dough its obviously due to his 
inclination toward divestiture said eric davis a college 
classmate who teaches at the private commonwealth school in boston 
webb said he gave a hollywood house to a real estate agent in 
the 1960s and another home to the massachusetts audubon society in 
1970 because he felt the need for getting free of things 
getting free also explains his and freds decision eight years 
ago to get a divorce although they had no intention of separating 
fred said the couple felt marriage violated their constitutional 
freedoms 
the couple were married in 1962 the year the graduate was 
published and a year after his graduation from williams college 
webb son of a california doctor epoused odd views even back in 
college davis said 
we always used to wonder whether chuck was putting us on 
davis said hes quite sophisticated a very intelligent person 
with a real heart but he always said things that sounded 
peculiarly simple 
webb says he received only 20000 for the film rights to the 
graduate which made a star of dustin hoffman when it came out in 
1967 the novel however is still in print and continues to earn 
him a few thousand dollars in royalties annually 
the graduate was followed by four other novels including 
the marriage of a young stockbroker which also was made into a 
movie his last work booze was published in 1978 
that year webb took his two sons then in the sixth and ninth 
grades out of school and went underground because of his fear 
that schools were harming their minds 
after a year in france the webbs moved to ventura county in 
california where they remained living in their van until they 
returned to massachusetts a few months ago 
webb said he stopped writing during that time reluctantly 
accepting support from his mother to raise his sons and 
concentrate on larger issues such as prejudice 
i came to feel that writing fiction was a more narrow concern 
than addressing problems that went beyond my narrow 
careeroriented goals he said

courtappointed lawyer no bail was set

her younger brother ben about the attacks that occurred after 
mrs caldwell left the familys home she found the children when

facedown in a bathtub wasnt told of his sisters death until a

more than 300 workers went on strike at 
a key mine in southern hungary on wednesday demanding restoration 
of cuts in bonuses and changes in a new income tax state radio 
said 
the strike at the mecsek mine near pecs marked the first known 
worker protest against the stringent economic policies of karoly 
grosz since he became communist party leader in may 
state radio said agreement was reached to restore the cut 
bonuses and that some strikers resumed work other strikers said 
to include more than 300 miners and an unspecified number of office 
workers would wait until thursday it was reported 
the radio reported the strikers threatened to stop work again if 
parliament does not vote to iron out a quirk in a new tax law that 
gives some workers on sick benefit more net income than those 
working normally 
the strike coincided with labor unrest in poland but appeared 
unconnected 
reports of strikes have been extremely rare in communist 
hungary although there were scattered reports of labor unrest in 
1969 1977 and 198081 
wednesdays relatively swift reporting of the miners stoppage 
appeared to reflect the greater openness of staterun media under 
grosz 
the state news agency mti said the stoppage began tuesday night 
when 150 miners refused to start the evening shift at the istvan 
pithead in the mecsek colliery at komlo 10 miles north of pecs 
near the yugoslav border 
the day shift of 150 miners also refused to go into the pit head 
and the stoppage spread to several other sections state radio 
said 
the state news agency mti called the stoppage a pure 
industrial dispute with no political undertones 
komlo is hungarys only mine producing highgrade black coking 
coal for the danubian iron works one of the nations three main 
iron and steel mills 
mti said one grievance of the striking miners was computation of 
personal income tax introduced jan 1 as part of groszs efforts to 
curb hungarys 18 billion gross foreign debt and to stimulate the 
economy 
hungarys official trade unions have criticized the policies 
saying workers pensioners and the unemployed must be protected 
against inflation already running at 18 percent this year 
miners are among the most militant workers in hungary 
the official trade union organization szot protested wednesday 
against a provision in the new tax system that means workers on 
sick leave can end up with more net income than those who work 
regularly 
government spokesman gyorgy marosan said without elaborating 
that this was an anomaly the government soon would fix 
the miners other main complaint was that the new tax system has 
sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50 percent radio said 
gyula zipper deputy industry minister told state radio it 
would be up to parliament to decide whether to change the tax law 
but that companies should make up bonuses to last years levels 
banks should give credits for this to companies posting a deficit 
zipper said 
this appeared to weaken recent government statements that 
enterprises would have to turn a profit or face closure as a result 
of reduced state subsidies

a new effort to improve the capitals 
beleaguered public schools will give principals broader power and 
eliminate some of their bosses officials announced wednesday 
weve been a topdown organization and we want to put more 
authority and responsibility where the action is school 
superintendent andrew jenkins said we are going to make the 
local school principal more responsible 
special and bilingual education programs also will receive more 
attention the superintendent said 
jenkins was appointed head of the citys schools in may under a 
contract that required him to overhaul the school system he 
pledged wednesday that the new plan would be put into effect by 
february 1989 
various national surveys have ranked the capitals public 
schools near the bottom of the list for urban areas one study by 
charles harrison former director of the education writers 
association gave the districts 88000student school system a 
grade of 17 out of a possible 100 after comparing attendance rates 
average sat scores teacherstudent ratios dropout rates and the 
number of collegelevel courses offered in 52 metropolitan school 
systems 
only oakland and hillsborough county schools near tampa fla 
rated lower than the capitals school system 
jenkins had no cost projections for the new program but 
promised the school system would stay within its 623 million 
budget for fiscal year 1989 which begins oct 1 
one major change is that the position of regions 
adminstrators responsible for overseeing several schools at once 
will be eliminated instead the principals of each school will 
report directly to jenkins or a yettobeappointed vice 
superintendent 
after awhile all bureaucracies become out of sync jenkins 
said they need to be put back together 
although he provided no specific figures jenkins said other 
less visible administrative positions would be eliminated those 
employees will be reassigned within the system instead of being 
dismissed jenkins said 
at the end of the school year i expect to see tangible 
progress in standardized achievement scores the superintendent 
said

the persistent controversy surrounding dan 
quayle is worrying some southern republican state legislators who 
said wednesday they fear it is diverting attention from gop nominee 
george bushs message to the voters 
quayle the republican vice presidential candidate received a 
warm welcome from the southern legislative conference for a brief 
speech that followed an address by his democratic counterpart sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas 
afterward several gop legislators said in interviews that the 
attention focused on quayles service in the indiana national guard 
during the vietnam war and other issues is hurting the national 
republican ticket 
i think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary 
issue obviously its divisive said louisiana state sen john 
hainkel of new orleans 
it hasnt been good because its taken the spotlight off the 
things we ought to be talking about hainkel said 
state rep bill strong of hazard ky agreed 
its kind of stymied the ticket strong saidits 
dominated the news where bush cant get his message across 
state sen jim tysinger of dekalb county ga said that both 
bush and the democratic ticket led by michael dukakis have suffered 
from all the attention paid to quayle 
it has hurt both of them tysinger said dukakis hasnt 
been in the news and neither has bush 
other gop legislators saw some benefits flowing from the quayle 
controversy 
it has added to the party and i want to thank the press 
said west virginia del robert jones of martinsville its 
inviting more questions and i think the exposures good 
i think its brought more focus to the ticket said state 
del martha klima of lutherville md you dont hear anything 
about dukakis and bentsen anymore 
no republican interviewed wednesday said quayles problems are 
serious enough to warrant his removal from the gop ticket 
if i was george bush i wouldnt even consider that hainkel 
said youd infuriate every man who ever served in the national 
guard for one thing 
many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer a backlash if 
they kept alive questions about quayles national guard service 
most said enough had been written and uttered about the subject 
its detracted from what the american people need to know

guerrilla and israel artillery batteries exchanged fire after 
the battle and the attacking soldiers moved back behind their 
lines israel television reported 
hezbollah or party of god is an umbrella group for shiite 
moslem extremists believed to be holding american hostages in 
lebanon 
the clash was near the village of kaoukaba north of israels 
security zone in southern lebanon israel established the six to 
10mile zone after withdrawing most of its troops from southern 
lebanon in june 1985 following a threeyear occupation 
the zone is patrolled by about 1000 israeli soldiers and more 
than 1000 south lebanon army militiamen trained and financed by 
israel

territory on a searchanddestroy mission all five guerrillas were 
reported killed

spot and a sixth was slightly wounded and hospitalized

the physical abilities test for city 
firefighters appears designed to ensure that women wont pass said 
the state human rights commissioner 
it is not a test that finds the best possible firefighters 
the commissioner stephen cooper said tuesday its a test for 
just a few qualities it would be like if i was going to hire you 
to be an overtheroad trucker and the only thing that i tested you 
for was the ability to eat french fries 
cooper said his investigators looked at firefighters 
examinations in several major us cities the result was a report 
issued tuesday in which an unidentified fire chief in another city 
was quoted as saying if you were going to design a test to 
exclude women youd end up with the st paul test 
the report concluded there was probable cause that 
discrimination against women took place cooper said 
a complaint was filed after all 17 women who took the test in 
may failed to pass they had all passed a separate written exam 
a judge temporarily halted the hiring of st paul firefighters 
pending the investigation by the human rights department 
cooper said the next step is to try to resolve the dispute 
through an informal conciliation process with city officials if 
that is unsuccessful he said litigation is a last resort 
assistant city attorney terry sullivan said neither he nor other 
city officials would comment immediately well respond in the 
next several days as to what approach were going to take he 
said 
coopers report said the test was unfair to female applicants 
and is discriminatory even in the absence of an intent to 
discriminate 
the city failed to meet its burden of showing that its 
methodology is valid and that the extreme effect it has on women is 
justified he said 
there is no evidence that a persons score on the physical 
test is predictive of hisher future job performance as a 
firefighter cooper said 
cooper said the timed test measured only sprinting ability and 
upper body strength areas in which men excel while ignoring 
stamina an area in which women can perform well a ladder climb 
and blindfold maze race events in which women can often outrun 
men were not rated for speed but scored on a passfail basis

a bitter feud among lawmakers over 
syrias role in lebanon has prevented the election of a new 
lebanese president and could rekindle the nations 13year war 
between moslems and christians 
parliamentary deputies representing the 80 percent of lebanon 
controlled by syria the nations main power broker and its moslem 
militia allies want a president willing to crush syrias main foe 
the rightwing lebanese forces 
the lebanese forces the christians main militia which has 
links to israel is blocking reelection of former president 
suleiman franjieh a christian branded by political rivals as 
syrias candidate 
should a constitutional vacuum develop one can kiss lebanon 
goodbye said christian politician shaker abu sleiman 
lebanons fate is at stake said parliamentary deputy joseph 
skaff also a christian 
franjieh 78 governed from 1970 to 1976 he is the frontrunner 
in a lackluster field of candidates that includes dany chamoun son 
of the late camille chamoun another former president 
behind the friction lie old hatreds 
franjieh holds the lebanese forces leader samir geagea 
responsible for killing his son tony tonys wife and 3yearold 
daughter along with 30 others in a raid on the familys summer 
mansion in june 1978 
geagea opposes syrias strategy of seeking political reforms 
that would give moslems equal power with the christians who have 
dominated the government judiciary and army since independence 
from france in 1943 
back then the christians were considered the majority 
now moslems comprise about 55 percent of lebanons 4 million 
people and christians make up 45 percent 
in july just 38 of the 76 members of parliament attended a 
session to elect a new president far short of the quorum needed 
all but two of the deputies who turned up were moslems they 
accused the lebanese forces of physically preventing christian 
deputies from attending no date for a new session has been set 
there have been no parliamentary elections in lebanon since 
1972 the 99seat house has simply renewed its mandate every two 
years 
the lebanese forces pledged there will be no quorum so long 
as franjieh is a candidate but the syrians declared they still 
back franjieh 
syrias staunch support for franjieh against local regional 
and international powers is a very risky move that could plunge 
lebanon into allout violence said a foreign diplomat who 
demanded anonymity 
a moslem politician who asked not to be identified said if 
the spirit of challenge persists we might not have a president by 
sept 23 
thats when the sixyear term of the incumbent president 
maronite catholic amin gemayel expires under constitutional 
rules gemayel 46 cannot run again for a consecutive second term 
the politician noted franjieh whether candidate or 
president means war if elected hell launch war on the lebanese 
forces and if not elected hell launch war on them 
after more than a decade of war and the fragmentation of lebanon 
into a cluster of sectarian cantons gemayels authority is limited 
to his own stronghold in the metn mountains 
the lebanese forces control the rest of the shrunken christian 
enclave 
syria and its moslem allies have boycotted gemayel for 2 years 
since he torpedoed a syrianbrokered peace accord under which the 
christians would surrender some of their power 
lebanons acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni went to 
damascus on wednesday for talks with syrian leaders on the 
presidential deadlock a senior government official said in beirut 
he will certainly discuss with the syrian command what should be 
done if a president is not elected by sept 23 the offcial 
added speaking on condition of anonymity 
despite their differences most lebanese factions believe a 
constitutional vacuum will be disastrous 
under an unwritten national covenant dating back to 
independence the president has to be a maronite the prime 
minister a sunni moslem and the house speaker a shiite moslem 
beiruts independent annahar daily said gemayel would form an 
interim government headed by a maronite prime minister if a 
president is not elected before sept 23 the 1943 covenant allows 
a maronite to be named prime minister if the presidential post is 
vacant 
but 10 syrianbacked leftist and moslem factions warned they 
will prevent such a government from running the country 
besides franjieh a warlord whose private army controls north 
lebanon none of the other halfdozen christian contenders appears 
to have much of a chance

blacks and other racial minorities constitute 
16 percent of the workforce of american newspapers but only 8 
percent of the news and editorial staffs according to the american 
newspaper publishers association 
the anpa survey made public wednesday also said that 37 
percent of the papers employees are women 
in the nations overall workforce minorities constitute 21 
percent and women 47 percent of the total 
the study suggested that the newsroom was the place in a 
newspaper plant were minorities were least likely to be found ten 
percent of newsroom employees were members of minorities and when 
clerical and administrative workers were subtracted the number 
dropped to 8 percent according to anpa spokesman joe lorfano 
that finding approximates the results of an annual survey 
conducted by the american society of newspaper editors 
in april the 1988 asne survey found blacks hispanics 
asianamericans and american indians constituted 702 percent of 
newsroom employees a slight increase from the 656 percent level 
in 1987 but a sharp increase from the 395 percent in the surveys 
first year 1978 
the asne survey was based on responses from 1092 of the 
approximately 1645 daily newspapers published in the united states 
in the anpa study responses came from 546 of the 1443 daily 
newspapers that were sent questionnaires 
the study conducted by belden associates of dallas was 
undertaken to give the association a benchmark to measure the 
effectiveness of our programs to assist individual newspapers in 
their efforts to increase employment and promotion opportunities 
for their employees said arthur ochs sulzberger chairman of the 
anpa and publisher of the new york times 
it was the first industrywide attempt to determine the racial 
composition of all departments in newspapers 
the survey said that minorities constitute 22 percent of the 
employees in newspapers general management including executive 
professional technical clerical and service workers they were 19 
percent of the production workers and 19 percent of circulation 
workers 17 percent of those in accounting finance and information 
services 13 percent of those in advertising and 11 percent in 
marketing promotion and research 
the anpa said its minority opportunity committee chaired by jay 
smith publisher of the atlanta journal and constitution is 
considering establishing a computerized national employment program 
to allow newspapers to list minoritiy job opportunities

thousands of nagornokarabakh residents rallied 
around their legislative building wednesday while the deputies 
inside discussed grievances in the disputed region 
the actions ended a month of relative quiet in nagornokarabakh 
an enclave of mostly christian armenians located within the soviet 
republic of azerbaijan near the border with turkey and iran from 
february to july the residents went on strikes and street protests 
to demand that jurisdiction of their region be moved from 
predominantly moslem azerbaijan to the soviet republic of armenia 
the campaign subsided in late july after the central leadership 
rejected the demand 
wednesdays report of many thousands of people gathered outside 
the nagornokarabakh legislative building in stepanakert came from 
the staterun radio station in yerevan the armenian capital the 
broadcast was monitored by the british broadcasting corp in london 
the soviet news agency tass reported an allcity meeting at 
which the opinions of work collectives were expressed 
the legislature appealed to moscow to consider the opinions of 
these work collectives and the wishes expressed by deputies 
about the administrative subordination of the region tass said 
this appeared to be a veiled reference to earlier demands for 
nagornokarabakh to be placed under the control of armenia 
a resident of stepanakert said by telephone that people massed 
wednesday to renew the annexation demand but the telephone 
interview was cut off before the resident a woman could identify 
herself other calls to stepanakert and the azerbaijani capital 
baku did not go through 
the nagornokarabakh legislature also approved a new plan to 
improve the social and economic conditions in nagornokarabakh by 
1995 tass said so far the program was being implemented 
unsatisfactorily the legislature declared 
the lawmakers also approved plans for strengthening the regions 
economic ties with business enterprises in armenia and called for 
closer cooperation with the republic in spiritual and cultural 
life tass said 
nagornokarabakh was made part of azerbaijan in 1923 although 
more than threequarters of its residents are ethnic armenians 
they claim economic cultural and religious discrimination under 
azerbaijani rule 
the presidium of the communist partys central committee in 
moscow on july 18 said nagornokarabakh should remain part of 
azerbaijan but it set up a commission to consider changes in its 
territorial status the area is now classified as an autonomous 
region of azerbaijan 
the presidium sent a representative arkady i volsky to 
nagornokarabakh to help local authorities improve living 
conditions tass said without elaborating that he attended

rank and i was a nobody morell told the associated press 
capt cathi kiger said how quickly recruits pass through 
preliminary processing such as aptitude tests interviews and 
physical examinations often depends on the schedule of the person 
undergoing the tests 
enlisting can take anywhere from a week to a year she said 
we try to accomodate their schedules 
kiger said 348 nonpriorservice recruits and 92 priorservice 
recruits wre enlisted during fiscal year 1969 the guard lost 902 
enlisted men during that year she said 
reports that quayle entered the guard with the help of his 
familys influence have dogged his campaign 
if his family really had all this influence like everyone 
says he would have been sent directly to officers candidate 
school and come out a lieutenant or captain morell said of 
quayle whose maternal grandfather eugene c pulliam published 
several newspapers in arizona and indiana 
dan was an ok guy morell said he did his job and i did 
mine we washed dishes and washed jeeps together 
morell said he would not have found it particularly 
objectionable had quayle received preferential treatment 
if someone would have offered me a hand i would have shaken 
it and said thank you he said i dont want to insinuate he 
got a hand but if he was offered help any fool would say thank 
you and dan isnt any fool 
morell said he was forced to drop out of college at indiana 
university for financial reasons and began considering the 
national guard 
if you werent a fulltime student you were fulltime draft 
there was no inbetween he said 
i figured i might as well stay at home do my weekend a month 
and get married morell said 
kiger said the service was below its authorized strength when 
the then22yearold quayle signed up 
i can find no evidence that he was given special consideration 
and there was no need kiger said units that were not up to 
100 percent strength could continue to recruit 
but maj gen alfred ahner said tuesday that he received a call 
at that time regarding quayle from wendell phillippi managing 
editor of the indianapolis news a pulliam newspaper phillippi was 
a retired guard major general 
ahner said he contacted the guards personnel office on quayles 
behalf 
they said they had a couple of spaces ahner said tuesday 
i said hold one of them theres a good guy coming over

us south african cuban and angolan 
officials met wednesday to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops from angola 
no statement was issued after the four parties met for three 
hours but reporters were told they would meet again thursday a 
soviet and united nations representative were present in the congo 
capital but did not attend the talks 
chester crocker us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs met separately with south africa and the cuban and angolan 
delegations before the fourparty talks began 
in luanda angolan president jose eduardo dos santos said the 
possibility of peace in angola has never been nearer since rebels 
took up arms against the portuguese colonial army for independence 
of the southern african nation in 1961 
never as now since the historic morning of feb 4 1961 has 
peace for our heroic and suffering people been so visible on the 
horizon dos santos told members of the peoples assembly the 
countrys representative body in an angolan news agency report 
cuban troops have supported angola in fighting us and south 
africabacked unita rebels in a guerrilla war against the 
marxistoriented popular movement for the liberation of angola 
government the war has continued since angola gained its 
independence from portugal in 1975 
jonas savimbis guerrillas of unita which stands for national 
union for the total independence of angola have not been involved 
in the talks the angolan government refuses to negotiate with 
unita calling them bandits and stooges of south africa 
unita also has refused to adhere to the ceasefire agreement 
which was signed monday on the angolansouthwest african frontier 
by military representatives from south africa angola and cuba 
savimbis forces have received support the last year from the 
united states president reagans administration has pressed angola 
to negotiate with unita saying that no complete peace could be 
reached without such a reconciliation 
dos santos said disagreement exists over the timetable for 
withdrawal of cuban troops south africa wants them to be out in 
12 months the united states wants 36 months and angola and cuba 
have proposed 48 months 
but dos santos continued all indications are that an 
agreement on a timetable will be possible 
in lisbon news reports have raised the possibility that 
portuguese troops could participate in an international 
peacekeeping force in the region 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar was quoted by the 
french newspaper le monde as saying he would accept south africas 
invitation to visit that country if the brazzaville talks go well 
south africa has said it will withdraw its troops from southern 
angola where they have supported antimarxist rebels as well as 
pursued black nationalists seeking to drive them from southwest 
africa by sept 1 this was to be the first phase leading to 
elections and independence for southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
but south africa insisted on a cuban withdrawal within a year 
saying their continued presence in angola would pose a threat after 
southwest africa is granted independence 
in cape town south africa president pw botha said wednesday 
that the new leadership of mikhail s gorbachev has prompted the 
soviet union to throw its support behind the peace initiative in 
angola and southwest africa 
the gorbachev factor is important botha told parliament 
this does not mean that the russians have relinquished their 
plans for world domination and have become the worlds friendly 
neighbor botha said what it does mean is that mr gorbachev 
has realized that the russian economy cannot support the extremely 
expensive involvement in remote regions of the world 
the soviet union has provided the weaponry for angolas marxist 
government

black people do not encounter racism in their 
daytoday lives as brutally as they did 40 years ago but they are 
always reminded of their racial identity by a society that 
emphasizes race in politics and big business a panel of black 
sociologists said wednesday 
and while they are aware of efforts to stave off racial attacks 
minorities still believe they are viewed with disdain by a society 
that designs its institutions to oppress nonwhites said the 
panel which convened in atlanta during the annual meeting of the 
association of black sociologists 
institutional ways of handling overt discrimination have 
improved but there has been no significant change in dealing with 
white attitudes toward people of color said panelist myrna 
adams an administrator at the state university of new york at 
stony brook 
we see considerable attention given to overt actions which 
could be labeled plain ol blatant redneck racism and its on the 
rise she said 
ms adams said the incidence of racially motivated violence grew 
in proportion to the amount of publicity given the subject she 
said the new york times published 144 articles on racial attacks in 
1987 compared to 16 the previous year 
the prevailing attitude among whites in american society is that 
anything done for people of color is at their whites 
expense and little has been done to dispel that sentiment ms 
adams said 
joseph scott a sociologist at the university of washington 
said the nation is fighting a new breed of institutional racism 
created by an administration that gave too much power to the 
private sector 
this society has expounded on an economic sector of 
governance by private corporations larger than most states when 
you speak of economic units controlling jobs and labor scott 
said 
he charged that president reagan is putting the private 
governance in control of the decisions that used to be wielded by 
public government large corporations then used testing 
screening and access to training to control the flow of minorities 
into the private sector scott said 
all of these devices used by bureaucracies can be used in 
the service of white supremacy he said how did that happen if 
we have an equal distribution of intelligence skill and knowledge 
it can only happen because private bureaucracies are able to 
use their bureaucratic mechanisms to deny the payment of a 
living wage to millions of fulltime manual and service workers 
because they are black and powerless 
scott also charged that the united states uses machiavellian 
principles such as atlarge voting districts gerrymandering and 
willful discrimination in housing practices to work in the 
service of white advantage and white affirmative discrimination

students at irelands largest university 
said wednesday they would fight an attempt by an antiabortion 
group to keep them from distributing information on legal abortions 
earlier this month the high court served noncriminal summonses 
on four student leaders and an officer at university college 
dublin who had refused to agree not to publish the names and 
telephone numbers of legal abortion clinics in england 
ireland whose population is 95 percent roman catholic has made 
abortion illegal under a 1983 constitutional amendment after a 
campaign led by the society for the protection of the unborn child 
the four students said wednesday they would fight the societys 
allegations that they were breaking a supreme court ruling that 
said it was illegal under the 1983 amendment for pregnancy 
counseling centers to provide women with information on how to get 
a legal abortion the supreme court has power over the high court 
the four students elected to represent university colleges 
10000 students said they will distribute the abortion information 
in a manual to be published in october 
the antiabortion group has demanded that the university 
administration not provide funds or facilities to aid the students 
in publishing the manual the administration has not responded 
publicly 
our mandate is to provide information on all pregnancy 
options said student union president diarmuid coogan if they 
are to succeed in this case it will have grave implications for 
civil liberties in irish society 
coogan said other colleges including dublins trinity college 
alsp have stated their intention to provide the names and addresses 
of the same clinics but the antiabortion society has not taken 
any action against the other schools 
coogan said university college was being singled out by the 
antiabortion group in a witch hunt and accused the group of 
using the school as a pawn in their game 
university college welfare officer anne marie keary who also 
received a summons said 24 women had sought information on 
pregnancy and abortion from her since july 1 
within three weeks the antiabortion society must submit a 
detailed argument on their case against the students to the high 
court the students then have another three weeks to present their 
defense 
during the six weeks the antiabortionists may seek a temporary 
injuction from the high court against publication of the manual 
if the high court rules in favor of the antiabortion group the 
students will be banned from distributing the abortion information 
last month marie vernon spokeswoman for the group said in an 
interview the right to life is written into the constitution 
and it overrides the right to information

wouldbe presidential assassin lynette 
squeaky fromme and many other prisoners have been transferred 
in a major shuffling of female inmates in the federal prison 
system officials said wednesday 
prisons in west virginia kentucky california and florida were 
most affected by the transfers which began this month corrections 
officials said 
a growing female prison population partially caused by an 
increase in the number of women convicted of drug crimes is 
forcing the government to shift inmates and open more facilities 
prison officials said 
fromme and four other women were moved from the highsecurity 
unit of the federal prison in lexington ky on friday when the 
unit was shut down the lexington facility is being converted into 
an allfemale medium and minimumsecurity prison 
fromme a follower of cult leader charles manson and two others 
were transferred to a new highsecurity unit of the marianna 
federal correctional institution in florida one was sent to a 
california prison and federal officials refused to identify the 
fifth inmate or where she was sent 
the allfemale medium and highsecurity facility inside the 
marianna prison known as the shawnee unit had received 23 other 
women as of wednesday 15 from the alderson federal correctional 
institution in west virginia seven from the pleasanton federal 
correctional institution in california and one direct commitment 
officials said 
it eventually will house about 55 inmates and will remain 
separate from a allfemale lowsecurity camp and a mediumlevel 
mens prison that is under construction authorities said 
it looks like a combination of an old roman coliseum and a 
garish modern office building fromme said wednesday in a 
telephone interview from marianna in floridas panhandle 
theres so much concertina wire it looks like they went into the 
hardware business 
fromme said the first floor of the shawnee unit was flooded 
tuesday by rain a prison spokeswoman said she wasnt aware of 
flooding but acknowleged some minor problems with the new facility 
its like when you buy a new house you work the bugs out 
said spokeswoman jama acuff 
many of the women believed they were being transferred to a 
nicer facility and some volunteered to go to florida said fromme 
who is serving a life term for attempting to kill thenpresident 
gerald ford in 1975 
alderson where fromme spent 10 years before being moved to 
lexington after she escaped from the west virginia prison last 
year is being turned into a less secure camp facility said 
warden ron burkhart 
were currently reviewing all of our inmates to see who can 
reasonably remain in a camptype setting burkhart said 
in addition to marianna alderson highrisk inmates could be 
sent to federal prisons in danbury conn or pleasanton calif 
he said about 35 percent of the inmates at alderson are serving 
time for drug trafficking offenses burkhart said 
a female satellite camp at an allmale prison also is under 
construction in phoenix ariz officials said

president reagan touted republican 
presidential nominee george bush today as a man of action for whom 
the backup role of vice president didnt come easily 
george bush is a man of action a man accustomed to 
command reagan said at a reaganbush rally at the hotel where 
the president is staying during a break from his california ranch 
vacation 
bush renewed his criticism of democrat michael dukakis veto of 
a pledge of allegiance bill saying that if confronted with such a 
measure he would have left it up to the us supreme court to 
determine whether it was constitutional 
what is it about the pledge of allegiance that upsets him so 
much bush asked 
dukakis in 1977 vetoed a bill that would have penalized any 
school teacher who failed to lead the pledge every morning 
i would have signed the bill bush said any 
constitutional question that some might raise should be decided by 
the supreme court of the united states 
before the rally reagan and bush met privately for 15 minutes 
with approximately 50 california supporters and gop leaders 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and bush press secretary 
sheila tate in a joint statement said bush told the group we 
will not give away one inch of ground in this state they quoted 
reagan as urging them to saddle up and ride hard to exert every 
bit as much energy for george as you did for me 
reagan praised bush at the rally saying the vice presidency 
doesnt fit easily on such a man but george bush is also a 
patriot and so he made it fit and he served with a distinction no 
one has ever matched 
i once said he is a great vice president but i know and ive 
seen that it didnt come easily the president said 
reagan made no reference to the controversy surrounding the gop 
vice presidential candidate but he said dan quayle stands for 
the same principles as george bush and i do 
reagan heaped scorn on the democrats in his speech saying they 
had fielded a threeheaded ticket that doesnt know left from 
center a reference to presidential nominee michael dukakis 
running mate sen lloyd bentsen and runnerup jesse jackson 
they talk about reaching for the center but on issues like 
national defense theyve taken positions that only a mcgovern 
could love he said reaching back to 1972 when liberal sen 
george mcgovern of south dakota was the democratic presidential 
nominee 
on tuesday reagan signed a landmark trade bill on a pier at 
long beach and spoke at a rally in irvine for republican sen pete 
wilson of california 
as he left the platform in long beach the president replied 
with a firm no when asked whether bush should drop his running 
mate sen dan quayle of indiana from the ticket 
hes a fine man and well qualified for the job reagan said 
of quayle who is the center of controversy over his military and 
academic record 
california sen alan cranston the secondranking democrat in 
the senate was among officials on the platform as reagan signed 
legislation designed to reduce us deficits in world trade 
the presidents signature climaxed three years of skirmishing 
between the white house and capitol hill but clearly did not mark 
an end to partisan debate over the trade issue 
in 1981 george bush and i arrived in washington committed to 
getting government out of your way reagan told an audience of 
port officials dock workers and others 
using an old nautical term reagan described the us economy as 
yare meaning easy to handle quick to respond bright lively 
this bill will allow us to provide up to a billion dollars a 
year for retraining workers to adjust to our turbocharge economy 
an economy that with the right leader will remain yare he said 
in his fundraising address for wilson who is challenged by 
democratic lt gov leo mccarthy reagan said america is not 
going to trade away our winning team for thirdstringers with a 
weak defense a foreign policy of errors curveball campaign 
promises a set of policies to be named later and billions of 
dollars in higher taxes 
the speech is expected to be the first of many on behalf of gop 
senate candidates as well as the bushquayle ticket 
the president has two political appearances for california 
republicans in thousand oaks and for rep robert lagomarsino in 
santa barbara scheduled saturday on his way back to his ranch 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president also is expected 
to visit eight to 15 cities on behalf of gop candidates after he 
returns to washington on sept 6

burundis ruling party on wednesday 
threatened to deal a death blow to instigators of tribal 
warfare that left 5000 people dead and sent about 40000 fleeing 
across the border 
the refugees pouring into burundis northern neighbor rwanda 
claim the burundi army which along with the government is 
dominated by the minority tutsi tribe is taking part in a mass 
slaughter of the nations majority hutu tribe 
a un official said there was evidence refugees were wounded by 
troops but a senior western diplomat in burundi said the idea 
the army is massacring hutus burning huts etc is just not what 
were hearing here 
nongovernmental sources including missionaries coming down 
from the north say the army is acting with a great deal of 
restraint said the diplomat who spoke on condition his name not 
be used 
but he said the army still is engaged in fighting with 
dissident hutus 
the ruling union for national progress party issued a statement 
vowing to deal a death blow to outsiders who have been inciting 
peaceful burundians to cause trouble in the country according to 
staterun radio burundi 
the statement did not refer directly to refugees claims of army 
involvement in a slaughter but urged burundians to desist from 
listening to foreign propaganda and false reports by foreign 
media 
the hutu people liberation party an exiled opposition group 
has charged that burundis military massacred thousands of hutus 
the government has denied the accusations and claims 5000 
people were killed in a slaughter instigated by exiled hutus who 
infiltrated the tiny central african country to inflame antitutsi 
sentiment 
despite making up nearly 85 percent of burundis 5 million 
people the hutu are subservient to the tutsi who comprise the 
remaining 15 percent and dominate the government and army 
the hutu and the tutsi are longtime enemies following an 
abortive 1972 coup attempt in the former belgian colony the tutsi 
massacred more than 100000 hutu including most of the tribes 
intelligentsia according to human rights groups 
as of tuesday about 38000 refugees had fled into rwanda since 
the violence began aug 14 and an estimated 5000 peasants 
continue to cross the border daily said code cisse the un high 
commissioner for refugees representative in rwanda 
we saw many people who had been injured by bullets and 
bayonets cisse said in a telephone interview they said they 
were fleeing because they didnt want to get shot by the military 
most of those fleeing are members of the hutu tribe said cisse 
who visited border areas over the weekend 
rwanda a densely populated and impoverished nation has 
appealed for international aid to cope with the influx of refugees 
which it says are straining its meager resources 
burundi meanwhile has promised to work with those who fled to 
rwanda and to make possible a speedy return home 
details about what sparked the current violence are sketchy 
refugees told cisse the unrest began aug 56 with local 
opposition to an army attempt to arrest some hutu although the 
mass killing did not start until more than a week later 
diplomats in burundi however said they understood hutu 
initially turned on tutsi 
the region where most of the killing took place is in burundis 
north a remote hilly and marshy region around the farming 
communies of ntega and marangara the army has since sealed off the 
region 
the government has restricted travel between towns enforced a 
dusktodawn curfew nationwide and banned meetings of more than 
five people 
the massacre was the first reported violence since maj pierre 
buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup sept 3 1987 while former 
president jeanbaptiste bagaza was attending a francophone summit 
in canada 
burundi covers an area about the size of maryland about 6 
million people live in slightly smaller rwanda there the 
hutututsi percentages are roughly equal although the hutu 
dominate the government

a federal appeals court judge once 
branded by opponents as unfit for the federal bench said wednesday 
the smooth political career of his law school friend dan quayle 
left illprepared to handle controversy 
daniel a manion a vietnam veteran and conservative republican 
dismissed questions about quayles vietnamera service in the 
national guard and a claim by former washington lobbyist paula 
parkinson that quayle propositioned her during a 1980 florida 
vacation 
manion said quayle should remain on the republican ticket as 
george bushs running mate but he said quayles political career 
might have gone better if bush had chosen someone else 
he walked into this thing unimpeded manion said 
quayle scored upset victories over incumbent democrats to win 
seats in the house and senate and easily won reelection to the 
senate in 1986 
from a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized bang 
hes suddenly put in the spotlight manion said he was 
unprepared and thats probably not a very good way to put a vice 
president in 
manion became a controversial figure when president reagan 
nominated him in 1986 for an appeals court judgeship opponents on 
the senate judiciary committee attacked him as poorly qualified and 
ideologically extreme 
it was quayle who telephoned manions south bend law office from 
capitol hill to tell him of his narrow confirmation victory 
manion a former army supply officer in vietnam in 1966 said 
questions about quayles use of family influence to enter the 
national guard and avoid vietnam combat in 1969 dealt with 
obscure things that should not prevent government service 
manion also defended quayles emotional response to ms 
parkinsons claim that he propositioned her eight years ago 
hes a strong family man manion said hes not one of 
these philanderers who goes looking for lost weekends he is a 
golfer and thats why he went 
manion and quayle attended the indiana university school of law 
together manion was graduated a year ahead of quayle in 1973 
very personable nice fellow manion said he was just kind 
of an average guy 
manion said he expects the controversies over quayle to fade 
and would advise the republican ticket to ride out the storm 
i say man youre on the horse you ride it he said it 
may not be the one you thought had the speed but you hope its got 
the endurance

the pain was so extreme the patient prayed 
to die and endured living hell for 40 minutes as he lay awake 
through gall bladder surgery according to testimony at a medical 
negligence trial 
lynn wahls couldnt move he couldnt talk he couldnt 
scream he couldnt do anything due to muscle relaxants and the 
insertion of a tube down his throat attorney robert strodel told a 
peoria county jury during opening arguments tuesday 
wahls felt the surgeon cut into his abdomen move several organs 
about and snip out his gall bladder strodel said and should be 
compensated for the ordeal 
the attorney contends the anesthesiologist dr kuotung 
kenneth cheng was negligent during the february 1987 operation 
at proctor community hospital 
the evidence will not show that cheng is a bad doctor 
strodel said hes not but in this one case he was negligent 
chengs attorney richard quinn disputed the contention that 
wahls felt extreme pain 
theres no way he felt what he claims he felt quinn said 
adding im not here to tell you he didnt feel some discomfort 
or pain 
he said cheng used the recommended dosage of anesthetic 
wahls who lost consciousness later in the procedure is seeking 
at least 15000 in damages from cheng 
wahls a peoria county deputy coroner contends he heard 
everything said by the surgical team during the first 40 minutes of 
surgery including surgeons remarks about his obesity and his 
professional honesty 
strodel paraphrased the remarks wahls said he heard hes a 
deputy coroner you know what deputy coroners do they get out 
before anybody else and rip off steal from dead bodies 
quinn said wahls obesity was a factor in deciding how deeply to 
sedate the patient without endangering his chances for safe 
recovery from the anesthetic 
he said cheng administered as much of the anesthetic as the 
manufacturer recommended 
quinn said expert anesthesiologists would prove cheng who has 
practiced in peoria for 14 years was not negligent in his 
treatment of wahls 
strodel said his own expert would use chengs own notes from the 
surgery to prove wahls was aware during surgery and in pain

conservative economist arthur b laffer on 
wednesday questioned republican nominee george bushs goal of 
creating 30 million new jobs in eight years as president 
at a news conference for gop senate candidate joseph malone 
laffer said 20 million jobs in eight years might be an attainable 
figure 
bushs goal is a large number and an estimate that i would 
not have made laffer said 
whether 30 million is a reasonable or optimistic goal or not 
the point is you want to keep those jobs going keep that 
prosperity going he said 
the 48yearold economist is best known for the laffer curve 
which holds that beyond a certain point increasing taxes wont 
increase government revenues because high taxes slow down the 
economy 
bush talked about creating 30 million new jobs in his acceptance 
speech at the republican national convention in new orleans last 
week he spoke of his goal of creating 30 in eight 30 million 
new jobs in the next eight years 
on tuesday bushs aides retreated somewhat from the vice 
presidents declaration they said bush used 30 million as a goal 
rather than a promise 
the labor departments bureau of labor statistics recently 
projected a growth of 184 million jobs over the next 12 years 
that 30 million i dont think is a number you should focus 
on laffer said twenty million would get the point across 
laffer a californian and member of president reagans economic 
policy advisory board questioned democratic nominee michael 
dukakis contribution as governor to the economic growth of 
massachusetts 
laffer said the dukakis administration created its own deficit 
problems by overestimating tax revenues in the state but laffer 
agreed with dukakis that more should be done to collect delinquent 
federal taxes

american efforts to switch to the metric 
system are set to get a major boost from a littlenoted feature of 
the trade bill president reagan signed into law this week a 
congressman says 
this metric provision could be one of the best kept secrets of 
the trade bill rep george brown dcalif the sponsor said 
tuesday in a statement 
the law requires the federal government to start doing business 
with its private suppliers under the metric system centimeters 
instead of inches kilograms instead of pounds and liters instead 
of gallons starting in 1992 
a deliberate loophole has been left for cases in which the 
changeover would not be costeffective but brown said a broad 
range of business could be affected by the measure 
albert navas president of the american national metric council 
called the provision outstanding and longneeded to 
accelerate the metric conversion process in the united states 
the united states is now one of only three countries not using 
the metric system based on the number 10 the other nations that 
have not adopted it are burma and liberia he said some nations 
have made only a partial conversion 
its still 90 miles from stratfordonavon to london not 
kilometers even though britain has adopted the system navas 
said and football fields wont change to the metric system id 
be against that myself 
there have been efforts to put the united states on the metric 
system for more than a decade including 1975 legislation but 
progress has been slow not everyone is thrilled with the idea 
one opponent is the national federation of independent 
businesses a washington group whose 550000 members around the 
country have an average of 10 employees and gross annual sales of 
around 350000 
the nfib is opposed to a conversion to the metric system 
because quite frankly its difficult said chief house lobbyist 
david rehr given the size of their businesses it would be very 
costly both to convert to metric and in the case of federal 
contracts to make necessary adjustments 
brown said that proponents were careful not to put the spotlight 
on the metric provisions in the legislation for fear of arousing 
more critics 
our strategy was to downplay the metric language in order to 
avoid confrontation with those who might oppose the measure without 
fully understanding its provisions brown said now that the 
trade bill is enacted however i want everyone to know that this 
country is finally taking real steps to convert to metric

federal engineers have opened an investigation 
of claims that the rear seat belts on 17 million ford escort and 
mercury lynx cars can cripple passengers in a crash the national 
highway traffic safety administration said wednesday 
but the agency said the belts which have an unusual design 
comply with federal standards 
nhtsa granted part of a petition by a la plata md couple 
larry and patricia garrett whose son was crippled in a 1985 
accident while riding in a ford escort 
the garretts through their attorneys alleged a strap retainer 
causes the rear seat belts on the escort and lynx cars to ride up 
on the passengers waist rather than settling around the hips 
greatly increasing the likelihood of serious injury in accidents 
in the event of a collision they said a seat belt over the 
waist cuts through softer parts of the body to the spinal column 
while the hips provide a large mass of bone that enables a belt to 
hold a passenger in place without serious injury 
the garretts last december won a 33 million judgment against 
ford motor co for their sons injuries 
nhtsa in a letter said based on the limited information 
gathered in our technical review we are unable to conclude that 
the strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of 
the system 
however testing did indicate that the escort and lynx rear 
safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit differently on 
test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some other cars 
the agency said its investigation was needed to understand the 
safety effects of the different fit of these belts 
nhtsas engineering analysis a midlevel investigation covers 
19841988 escort and lynx cars 
ford said after the petition was filed that the seat belts were 
positioned properly during the garretts accident and it 
attributed their sons crippling injury to the force of the crash 
the automaker on wednesday vowed to cooperate with nhtsas 
investigation and expressed confidence the agency would find no 
safetyrelated defect in the belts 
the belts meet or exceed all federal lmotor vehicle safety 
standard performance requirements including those for location 
fit strength and ease of use ford said 
a washington attorney for the garretts harold sakayan accused 
nhtsa of trying to put the case on the back burner for awhile 
in response to congressional critics 
the letter they sent us today acknowledged there was a 
problem sakayan said they acknowledge that the belt didnt 
fit the way it should they didnt tell us what the problem was 
what are they waiting for if there was a problem 
james garrett then 11 was buckled into the back seat of the 
escort when it crashed into a tractortrailer truck near annapolis 
md 
two frontseat occupants were hospitalized but were spared 
crippling injuries despite the crumpling of the passenger 
compartment in the headon crash 
james became a paraplegic as a result of injuries in the crash 
and another backseat passenger 14yearold christopher gaboury 
was killed 
while investigating the safety of the escort and lynx belts 
nhtsa continues to believe that you are far better off wearing 
any kind of belt than no belt at all said ron defore a 
spokesman for the agency

heavy rains this month flooded about 
25000 people out of their homes on the isolated caribbean coast 
and destroyed thousands of acres of subsistence crops officials 
said wednesday 
reynaldo antonio tefel minister of social welfare said the 
majority of those affected are indians who live mostly on corn and 
whatever else they can grow 
he said 37 tons of food had been sent to the area and the 
government is asking the united nations and the red cross for help 
barricada the newspaper of the ruling sandinista party said 
switzerland and norway plan to donate food and other aid 
the remote jungled region is home to about 155000 people most 
of them suma rama ormiskito indians many of their wooden homes 
are built on stilts to avoid damage by floods when rivers rise 
during the rainy season 
a preliminary survey by the national emergency commission showed 
90 percent of the areas crops were destroyed tefel said and 
this means those 25000 people will need food for the next six 
months 
he said the leftist sandinista government was short of funds 
because of economic difficulties created by the 7yearold war the 
us backed rebels 
red cross spokeswoman salome valle estimated 80 percent of the 
corn yucca and bean crops were damaged she said the red cross had 
provided shelter to about 3000 people

a conservative media watchdog group accused 
the four major television networks wednesday of displaying 
blatant anticonservative bias in their coverage of the 
democratic and republican nominating conventions this summer 
l brent bozell founder and chairman of the media research 
center said his group analyzed 100 hours of primetime coverage on 
abc cbs nbc and cnn and found a seriously flawed double 
standard among the networks 
the media let michael dukakis get away with murder at the 
democratic convention in atlanta by failing to report on issues 
bozell said 
at the republican convention in new orleans he said the 
media spent too much time looking for scoops when they should 
have been reporting on issues 
the media research center rated cnn best of the four networks it 
studied followed by nbc abc and cbs 
bozells group looked at the ideological labels network 
reporters and commentators used their choice of who to interview 
the types of questions they asked which if any controversies they 
highlighted and whether the coverage was valuable to the viewer 
sen dan quayle of indiana the controversial gop vice 
presidential candidate was the subject of 432 of the 889 questions 
posed by network questioners during primetime coverage of the new 
orleans convention bozell said 
of 190 citations of all gop controversies he said there were 
140 mentions of quayles service in the indiana national guard 
during the vietnam war 
by comparison he said there were only four mentions of 
controversy during the democratic convention he said there were 
three comments about the ethics investigation of house speaker jim 
wright and one on vice presidential nominee sen lloyd bentsens 
former fundraising breakfast club for lobbyists 
bozell said said the quayle issue would not have come up 140 
times if questions had been answered better initially if the 
bush people had handled it better theres no question that fewer 
questions would have been raised he said 
robert lichter codirector of the nonpartisan center for media 
and public affairs said quayles selection during the convention 
made it inevitable that he would be scrutinized quickly and 
intensely by reporters 
lichter blamed the focus on quayle partly on the republicans 
the republicans handed the material to the media who then 
proceeded to tailor it he said if quayle had had the right 
answers at the beginning he could have defused a lot of this 
controversy 
lichter has been analyzing abc cbs and nbc political coverage 
since the start of the primary season he said network coverage of 
the two parties pretty well balanced out during the primaries

the aflcio officially endorsed michael 
dukakis for president on wednesday and labor leaders said they can 
deliver the massachusetts democrat a margin of 25 million union 
votes in november 
aflcio president lane kirkland told dukakis the endorsement 
represents our commitment to work for you in every state in the 
union but a spokesman for republican george bush called the 
endorsement a classic dog bites man story 
the presidents of the labor federations 91 affiliated unions 
voted 957 percent of their 141 million members in favor of a 
dukakis endorsement with only three unions abstaining entirely 
not a single union worker was counted in the aflcio tally as 
favoring an endorsement of republican george bush 
however among those unions abstaining was the largest the 16 
millionmember teamsters who in 1980 and 1984 endorsed ronald 
reagan after making no presidential endorsement in 1976 
newly installed teamster president william mccarthy of boston 
who sources in the union say personally dislikes dukakis said he 
is withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is 
completed sept 16 
asked if the teamsters could endorse bush an official in the 
union said i just dont see it 
if the poll comes back strong for dukakis well probably 
endorse him said the teamster official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity if its close well probably remain 
neutral 
the 30000member air line pilots association and the 
40000member marine engineers union also voted to abstain from 
making a presidential endorsement the newspaper guild voted 4000 
of its 25390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition 
to any endorsement by its wire service guild local 
kirkland had estimated earlier that the federations endorsement 
of walter mondale in 1984 was worth a net 2 million votes despite 
exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of voters from union 
households cast their ballots then for reagan 
our rule of thumb is that we have to do twothirds or better 
in order to be successful in the election he said we fell 
short of that im reasonably confident that the results this time 
will be improved 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin calling the endorsement a 
classic dogbitesman story said every four years the aflcio 
trots out what has become an obligatory endorsement of a democratic 
presidential candidate and 1988 is obviously no exception 
communications workers president morton bahr said four polls of 
his unions members in the past year show that those who voted for 
reagan in 1984 a slight majority according to political 
operatives in the union are coming home to the democratic 
party 
united auto workers president owen bieber said a poll of his 
unions members in july and august at 28 sites showed 969 percent 
favoring a dukakis endorsement 
obviously we had a lot of people in 1980 and 1984 who made a 
mistake bieber said citing the loss of hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in the past seven years including a 52 percent decline in 
farm and heavy equipment factories alone the attitude of our 
members has changed 
the 13 millionmember united food and commercial workers which 
has a higher concentration of republicans than most unions said 
its latest telephone poll showed a twotoone edge for dukakis 
among those members who had made up their minds 
for the first time in four years a majority of our members 
classify themselves as democrats with fewer than 24 percent calling 
themselves republicans said ufcw president william wynn who 
noted that his unions members split even on mondale and reagan 
four years ago

sen paul simon visited black 
squatters wednesday in soweto met with archbishop desmond tutu and 
renewed his clemency appeal for the sharpeville six a group of 
blacks facing execution 
the illinois democrat on a fiveday trip to south africa 
conferred briefly with prakash diar lawyer for the sharpeville 
six the five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for 
involvement in a mob that killed a black town councilor in 1984 in 
sharpeville a township south of johannesburg 
later simon spent about 30 minutes with tutu leader of the 
anglican church in southern africa and winner of the 1984 nobel 
peace prize for his campaign against south africas apartheid 
system of race segregation 
speaking to reporters after the meeting simon predicted that 
congress will toughen sanctions against south africa as chairman 
of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on african affairs 
simon will have a major role in that decision 
congress would be eager to avoid sanctions if we got a good 
strong clear signal from the government here that they were going 
to do away with apartheid simon said but im not getting that 
signal 
he contends that sanctions could push the white authorities 
toward reform 
before meeting tutu simon toured soweto the black township of 
25 million people outside johannesburg he also visited two 
squatter camps and an allmale hostel for migrant workers 
ive just spoken with a man with five children who sees his 
family only once a year simon said after emerging from the 
hostel this is an illustration of what happens under a system of 
injustice based on racial separation 
simon also met with albertina sisulu a prominent antiapartheid 
activist whose husband walter is serving life in prison with 
fellow african national congress leader nelson mandela 
simon is leading a us campaign seeking clemency for the 
sharpeville six whose case has drawn worldwide attention 
president pw botha has refused to intervene they were granted a 
reprieve in march hours before they were to be executed 
diar will argue the case before the appeal court next month 
his clients did not physically contribute to the death of the 
councilor according to court testimony they were convicted under 
the doctrine of common purpose which holds them responsible 
for being an active part of the mob that carried out the killing 
there is a feeling that the system has not provided justice 
for a great many people and to some extent the sharpeville six are 
a symbol of that simon said 
he said his request to visit with the sharpeville six was turned 
down but he planned to mention the case in a scheduled meeting 
thursday with foreign minister roelof f botha

a navy skipper believes he acted properly in 
declining to take aboard a boatload of vietnamese refugees who 
later reportedly turned to cannibalism to survive the officers 
attorney said wednesday 
the captain is confident that what he did was correct given 
the facts and circumstances said lt cmdr ron petronio the 
attorney for capt alexander g balian who provided supplies to 
the refugees 
balian 48 of los angeles faces a possible courtmartial for 
alleged dereliction of duty 
balian informed the navy tuesday that he would exercise his 
right not to attend an admirals mast disciplinary hearing that 
had been scheduled for wednesday before vice adm george davis 
head of the pacific fleets surface forces 
under military law davis now must decide whether to drop the 
matter or order an article 32 hearing such a hearing similar to a 
civilian grand jury proceeding is the first step in a full 
military courtmartial 
its not that he would not get a fair hearing because he 
would have but the nature of the admirals mast proceedings are 
such that theyre not public and balians side of the story would 
not have come out petronio said 
balian who was skipper of the amphibious landing ship uss 
dubuque is charged with failing to render appropriate assistance 
to the refugees and violating a standing order to aid and rescue 
refugees found at sea in lifethreatening situations he was 
temporarily relieved of command aug 13 
the charges were prepared for balians administrative hearing 
and could be changed if a courtmartial is ordered 
according to navy officials the dubuque encountered the refugee 
boat june 9 in the south china sea while en route to the persian 
gulf 
balian gave the refugees several hundred pounds of supplies 
including food water and navigational aids but didnt take the 
estimated 110 people aboard because he judged their vessel 
seaworthy according to the navy 
the refugees who left ben tre in southern vietnam on may 22 
were at sea 37 days before fishermen from the philippines rescued 
them on june 28 only 52 survived 
some of the survivors have been quoted as saying they killed and 
ate some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they 
encountered the dubuque on june 9 two of the victims reportedly 
died of starvation but three others allegedly were murdered 
through drowning and then eaten 
the navy and the united nations high commission on refugees are 
investigating the reports 
petronio said balian would have no comment until the navy 
decides whether or not to proceed with a courtmartial 
hes a very loyal navy officer whos not going to buck the 
system he said

federal payments for the drug azt are running out for about 
6000 aids patients nationwide and many may be forced into poverty 
to qualify for the lifeprolonging drug under medicaid officials 
said wednesday 
a onetime emergency appropriation of 30 million was enacted 
by congress last summer to help those aids patients who couldnt 
afford the 8000ayear treatment had inadequate health insurance 
and made too much money to qualify for medicaid 
about a fifth of all aids patients in the country are receiving 
azt under the grant according to richard schulman of the federal 
health resources and services administration 
azt or azidothymidine has been shown to prolong the lives of 
some aids patients but has severe side effects 
because few states have taken action to continue funding many 
of those patients may be forced to spend down until they reach 
medicaid level schulman said 
you use your own resources until youre out of money and you 
qualify for medicaid which can be pretty devastating he said 
thats whats going to happen i have no doubt about it 
aids activists have criticized the states for not continuing the 
program the federal program technically expires sept 30 when the 
governments fiscal year ends but states with surpluses at that 
time will be allowed to continue supporting their aids patients 
until their azt money runs out officials said 
in florida the money has already run out despite extra funds 
voted by the legislature 
congress made it very clear to the states that they needed to 
pick up the slack once this federal program expired said jeff 
levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian task 
force it is unfortunate that the states have waited until the 
last minute to react 
levi suggested that congress enact some type of matching 
program during the transition to state funding 
it doesnt make a lot of economic sense to have people who are 
working to stop working and go on social security so they can 
get medicaid to get a very expensive drug that may not work said 
larry kessler director of bostons aids action committee 
so far only the district of columbia has actually appropriated 
money to continue the program after the grant expires schulman 
said 
the fiscal 1989 budget includes 250000 for emergency drug 
assistance says jane silver who administers the districts aids 
office however the districts budget still must be approved by 
congress 
while no state has acted to continue azt funding for all those 
receiving it under the grant six states arkansas florida 
kansas louisiana missouri and texas have changed their 
medicaid rules to cover the drug for the poorest patients 
only in alabama and colorado is azt not paid for by medicaid 
the 30 million azt grant was disbursed proportionately among 
the states based on the number of aids patients as of july 1987 
money from some states that had overestimated their need was later 
transferred to other states 
new york which has more aids cases than any other state got 
the most about 85 million and has helped about 900 patients so 
far 
according to barbara mctague director of new yorks aids drug 
assistance program the money is expected to last a year beyond the 
grant expiration as a result there is as yet no legislative push 
to come up with state money to continue to program she said 
schulman said most states with surpluses will be allowed to keep 
the money provided it is spent on azt normally unspent grant 
money must be returned to the treasury at the end of the fiscal 
year sept 30 
california was next with 76 million for 1500 patients it was 
followed by texas which got 21 million to treat 520 patients 
according to donna marler the azt coordinator for the texas 
department of health she said the texas legislature which 
convenes in january will be asked to provide state money for aids 
treatment 
florida got the fourth largest grant of 17 million and later 
received an additional 329000 from states where the money was not 
needed when the state still overspent the grants in treating about 
630 patients over the year the legislature appropriated an extra 
278000 
still schulman said florida was forced to discontinue the 
grant program about five weeks ago the deficit stemmed primarily 
from the fact that until july 1 medicaid in florida did not pay 
for azt

mustang a 28500 corvette and 25000 in cash according to 
tuesdays 13count indictment 
the games were sold by c amp k marketing to the alpha beta 
supermarket chain and the taco bell fastfood chain but neither 
alpha beta nor taco bell took part in the fraud said assistant 
us attorney david katz 
named in the indictment were c amp ks president john edward 
curtin iii 37 of sea girt nj vice president kevin joseph

port au peck nj and james frederick lee 50 of san diego 
the defendants were scheduled to be arraigned in federal court 
here sept 6 
the indictment alleges mail fraud wire fraud aiding and 
abetting and use of misleading conduct 
the alpha beta game was called california dreamin and taco 
bells game was dubbed wheels reels and meals 
the indictment said kim curtin gave his friend james lee the 
winning ticket for the mustang in the alpha beta contest in 1985 
and john curtin and kissane rigged the taco bell game the following 
year to make lee the winner of the corvette 
in the taco bell game lee elected to take 28500 in cash 
instead of the car but his victory was on paper only and the 
marketing company kept the money the indictment alleged 
lee acknowledged winning the mustang and selling it for 12000 
but he declined to say if kim curtin had given him the winning 
ticket he declined to comment further 
baratta a relative of kissane was the arranged winner of a 
25000 second prize in the taco bell game and the money actually 
went back to the company according to the indictment 
baratta said he was unaware the contest was a setup the curtins 
and kissane declined comment

vice president george bush renewed his 
criticism of rival michael dukakis stand on the pledge of 
allegiance on wednesday accusing the democrat of looking for a 
reason to avoid signing a bill requiring teachers and students to 
say the pledge 
what is it about the pledge of allegiance that upsets him so 
much bush queried at a highvoltage pep rally where he was 
joined by president reagan in their first postgop convention 
campaign appearance 
i would have signed that bill bush said lets face it 
my opponent was looking for a reason not to sign that bill i 
would have looked for a reason to sign it 
battered by questions over the military record of his running 
mate sen dan quayle rind during their first week of 
campaigning bush appeared intent on focusing the attention 
elsewhere 
bushs renewed emphasis on the issue came one day after dukakis 
questioned bushs dedication to the constitution and the rule of 
law on the matter dukakis said bush had no business running 
for the white house if he was willing to sign a bill that he knew 
to be unconstitutional 
the vice president used the pledge to wrap up his acceptance 
speech to the republican convention and twice recently bush 
faulted dukakis at campaign appearances because the governor vetoed 
a bill in 1977 that would have penalized any school teacher who 
failed to lead students in the pledge every morning 
dukakis says he rejected the bill because the massachusetts 
supreme court declared the law unconstitutional 
bush used his appearance with reagan to argue the matter should 
be decided by the supreme court of the united states 
i find it hard to believe that the founding fathers would have 
objected to teachers leading students in the pledge of 
allegiance bush said 
the vice president also faulted his democratic rival with being 
weak on defense and crime as well as eager to raise taxes 
we cant take another gamble by putting a democratic 
governor like jimmy carter in the white house bush contended 
we must have tough experienced leadership which someone 
whos been there and someone you can trust i am that man bush 
said 
reagan has appeared several times in his home state to press the 
cause of his vice president california with its rich deployment 
of 47 electoral votes is seen by both campaigns as essential for 
winning the white house 
in his remarks to the crowd of several thousand at the century 
plaza hotel reagan contended bush will shift gears smoothly from 
being a loyal no 2 to being a strong president because he is a 
man of action a man accustomed to command 
the president argued that being a loyal no 2 isnt always a 
simple job 
the vice presidency doesnt fit easily on such a man but 
george bush is also a patriot and so he made it fit and he served 
with a distinction no one has ever matched reagan said 
i once said that he is a great vice president but i know and 
ive seen that it didnt come easily george bush is a man of 
action a man accustomed to command reagan said 
reagan said he was comfortable with the idea of passing on the 
mantle of chief executive to bush 
i have seen him keep a cool head in hot crises i have seen 
his leadership and vision i have given him some of the most 
sensitive and difficult tasks weve had and he has never let me or 
the country down reagan said 
reagan lambasted the democratic ticket as a threeheaded 
ticket that doesnt know left from center an apparent reference 
to dukakis his running mate sen lloyd bentsen and democratic 
runnerup jesse jackson 
reagan also tried to offer a boost to quayles troubled 
campaign dogged by questions over his entry into the national 
guard and his relationship with a female lobbyist on a florida 
golfing trip 
id say america has a great candidate and i must confess i 
like his running mate too reagan said in comments that were not 
included in his prepared remarks 
dan quayle stands for the same principles as george bush and i 
do the president said 
reagan and bush appeared together at the noisy pep rally after 
conferring privately for about 15 minutes 
besides california gov george deukmejian and sen pete wilson 
rcalif attending the rally were actor charlton heston actress 
cheryl ladd singer pat boone and comedian bob hope who quipped 
that quayle can not only be our vice president he can be our 
national bird

dances featuring dance numbers from some of robbins biggest 
hits will cost 55 when the 7 million musical opens early next 
year it was announced wednesday 
we are limited to one source of income in the theater the 
box office said gerald schoenfeld chairman of the shubert 
organization which is coproducing the show its a question of 
economics and this is a lavish show 
the current top ticket price on broadway is 50 the going rate 
for such musical hits as the phantom of the opera les 
miserables cats me and my girl and into the woods 
by any standards jerome robbins broadway dances which 
begins preview performances at the imperial theater jan 16 and 
officially opens feb 26 is a mammoth undertaking 
schoenfeld said the musical has a cast of 60 and is expected to 
include production numbers from such robbins shows as fiddler on 
the roof west side story gypsy on the town 
peter pan the king and i and high button shoes in 
some of the shows he was the choreographer and in others he was 
both director and choreographer 
adding to the cost is the musicals unusually long rehearsal 
period of 22 weeks compared with six to eight weeks for most 
musicals broadway dances which features a cast of relative 
unknowns began rehearsals aug 15

research and reconstruct the dance numbers interviewing many of 
the original performers in his shows as well as watching videotapes 
of the original productions 
schoenfeld said the show would need to gross 420000 a week to 
break even and would need to play more than 60 weeks at capacity 
to pay back its 7 million investment 
although the show would be the first regular broadway production 
to crack the 50aticket barrier the limitedrun eighthour

the ira bombed an armored 
police car wednesday and announced a sophisticated new terror 
strategy to go with its summer blitz against the british army that 
has killed 26 soldiers 
explosives packed in a parked van blew the patrolling police car 
across a road at maghera 40 miles northwest of belfast slightly 
injuring the two officers inside police said 
the incident resembled the irish republican army bombing of a 
military bus saturday near omagh about 30 miles away which killed 
eight british soldiers and injured 27 
it came a day after a car bomb blew up in the center of belfast 
shattering windows and possibly signalling a return by the ira to 
the commercial war of the 1970s that devastated the city center 
a telephoned warning enabled police to evacuate the area and 
the only casualty of the 400pound bomb was a pregnant woman who 
suffered minor injuries police said 
police said gunmen burst into a childrens birthday party in 
roman catholic west belfast on tuesday held five adults and four 
children and stole the family van for use as a car bomb it said 
the captives were released unharmed after the bomb exploded at 
maghera 
police said they were questioning several people arrested in the 
magheraomagh area about serious terrorist crimes 
in belfast dozens of homes were evacuated while police checked 
two other suspected car bombs that turned out to be harmless 
the british government claims the regime of libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi has given the ira highquality arms antiaircraft 
missiles and czechmade explosives 
northern ireland secretary tom king flew to london to discuss 
antiira strategy with prime minister margaret thatcher king told 
nbc news the injection by col gadhafi of more powerful 
explosives and additional weapons may have given some people the 
idea that somehow violence can actually win 
following the twohour meeting with mrs thatcher king said 
some matters that had been resolved will become apparent shortly 
in various ways 
he declined to give further details and said more meetings with 
the prime minister were planned because other unspecified issues 
will require further detailed work 
king said the government faced a serious vicious terrorist 
challenge which would be met 
in statements issued through the legal republican press center 
in belfast the outlawed ira said tuesdays car bomb was aimed at 
the windsor house office block 
it also announced a new strategy for bombing commercial and 
administrative property at minimal risk to civilians in future 
car bombings a smoke grenade would go off simultaneously warning 
bystanders and sensitizing the bomb to any attempt to defuse it 
the group said 
a renewed bombing campaign in central belfast would be a blow to 
rejuvenating its commercial and entertainment heart which the 
government sees as crucial to returning life to normal 
latenight shopping has played a major role in stimulating 
business confidence proving so popular among violenceweary 
belfast residents that the law has been changed to allow two 
latenight shopping days a week instead of one 
the government faces demands to crack down harder on the ira 
following a series of attacks on british soldiers in northern 
ireland mainland britain and continental europe this summer 
the most recent was a bomb monday that killed a navy officer as 
he was driving into belfast 
among measures being proposed are locking up suspects without 
trial changing the law to deny suspects the right to remain silent 
and outlawing the iras political wing sinn fein 
except for changing special license plates on the cars of 
british soldiers in europe to make them less identifiable mrs 
thatcher and king have refused to disclose what measures might be 
taken saying they dont want to tip the ira 
sinn fein president gerry adams said attempting to defeat the 
ira is not a viable or sensible option despite thatcher and kings 
bravado 
in a statement he said the british people need to ask if 
there is not another way they need to ask why the question of 
their governments immoral claim to a part of ireland is constantly 
being forcibly rejected by the ira which their government claims to 
have defeated 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to rid northern ireland 
with its protestant majority of british rule and unite the 
province with the 95 percent catholic irish republic

the state department said it was shocked 
wednesday at israels planned deportation of 25 palestinian arabs 
and sources said the administration would not lend its usual 
support to israel if the issue arises in the united nations 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley complained that the 
deportation moveappears to make expulsion the norm rather than 
the exception 
we are shocked by the government of israels decision mrs 
oakley said she stressed the numbers involved distressed the us 
government most 
as a strong friend of israel we are deeply concerned over the 
widening use of expulusions she said 
diplomatic sources told the associated press meanwhile that 
the united states notified israel it would be obliged to take this 
position in conflict with israels if the deportation issue reached 
the united nations 
the two governments have differed only infrequently before the 
world body where us support for israel has often rescued israel 
from condemnation over various policies and actions 
but the sources speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
the united states had informed israel the dispute was harmful to 
usisraeli relations 
mrs oakley said she was not speculating on the strength of 
what we all consider to be a very strong relationship 
the us spokesman added our friendship and close association 
with israel continues but what we are saying is that this is an 
issue of concern and weve expressed these concerns to the 
government of israel 
mrs oakley said enforcement of the expulsion orders would mean 
a total of 60 palestinian arabs were deported this year 
the statement did not specifically condemn all expulsions or 
question israels attempt to maintain order on the west bank and in 
gaza in the face of rising unrest among the 15 million palestinian 
inhabitants 
however the state department on several occasions has publicly 
urged israel not to use expulsions as a punishment for criminal 
acts but rather to apply the regular process of charging and trying 
suspects based on evidence 
the last such us statement was made by mrs oakley last friday 
even as israel was in the midst of moving against the palestinians 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead on monday summoned 
deputy israeli ambassador oded eran to the state department to 
convey us unhappiness with the deportations 
yossi gal the israeli embassy spokesman defended the policy on 
tuesday as a measure of last resort in dealing with agitation 
he said the expulsions were carried out in conformity with the 
law of the land and subject to review by the israeli high court 
the israeli spokesman said the purpose was to try to ensure 
public safety and that expulsions were ordered only when we are 
convinced it is the best way to handle the instigators and 
inciters of violence in the territories 
despite the disagreement gal said on wednesday there was no 
crisis in usisraeli relations 
at least 252 palestinian arabs and 4 israeli have died in the 
disorders that broke out last december meanwhile secretary of 
state george p shultz has made four trips to the region this year 
to try to promote arabisraeli negotiations over the palestinians 
his missions foundered over israeli palestinian and jordanian 
resistance to hold talks on a middle east settlement under the 
terms proposed by the united states 
with shultz on vacation whitehead is in charge of the state 
department in his session with eran he was speaking for the 
us government as he does in any situation like this mrs 
oakley said

michael dukakis tucked away the 
endorsement of the aflcio on wednesday and promised strong 
businesslabor relations backed by a president who is an economic 
leader not a cheerleader 
dukakis in speeches to the labor group in washington and a 
college audience in michigan said that more americans are working 
now than ever before but he said the new jobs created during the 
reagan administration have been low paying and average family 
income stands where it was 20 years ago 
thats the price our workers and their familes are paying for 
voodoo economics the democratic presidential nominee said 
resurrecting a line george bush used against ronald reagan in 1980 
i have met too many young people who have accepted jobs over 
the last eight years that pay less than their old jobs dukakis 
said in a speech at grand valley state university i have met too 
many couples who are working harder at two jobs just to stay in 
place 
the democratic presidential nominee criticized bushs promise to 
create 30 million new jobs if elected to two terms as president a 
pledge senior bush ecomonic advisers have conceded may be overly 
optimistic 
this election is not about whether mr bushs own economists 
believe his speeches dukakis said it is about making every 
american a full shareholder in the american dream its about 
creating jobs with a future jobs you can count on jobs you can 
raise a family on 
it was the second consecutive day dukakis has directly 
criticized bush on tuesday dukakis noted that bush has no 
experience as a chief executive and also said the vice president 
was unfit for the presidency if he would sign a law mandating 
recitation of the pledge of allegiance in schools even if advised 
that it was unconstitutional 
in washington dukakis chastised the vice president for not 
mentioning the trade and budget deficits in his speech to the 
republican convention 
and to add insult to injury he wants to cut taxes for the 
wealthy again dukakis said my friends if this were a movie 
wed call it son of voodoo 
dukakis also said bush had failed when sent to japan by reagan 
in 1983 to improve trade relations he also criticized both reagan 
and bush for suddenly supporting the trade bill signed by the 
president tuesday 
trade is an issue which requires presidential leadership each 
day not just 77 days before a presidential election dukakis 
said in 1983 mr bush was put in charge of managing our trade 
problems with japan when the trade deficit with japan was 22 
billion after visiting japan and meeting with japanese government 
officials he came home declaring usjapanese trade relations 
were superb since then our trade deficit with japan has 
tripled 
he also touched on several fronts important to labor promising 
to help foster improved managementlabor relations and to 
strengthen the national labor relations board the federal trade 
commission and the occupational safety and health administration 
we want to be able to say that theres a new spirit of 
determination in america a new economic patriotism that brings us 
together as one people one nation helping us to compete and win 
in the world market dukakis said 
my friends the next president of the unites states must be an 
economic leader not a cheerleader he said he must do more 
than talk about creating more jobs he must be a president who 
knows how to build a strong economy and has done it a president 
who knows how to create and save jobs and has done it a 
president who has the strength and the vision and the values to 
build a strong economy and a vibrant future for america

george bushs boost from the republican national 
convention shows signs of decaying as quickly as it arose a victim 
of the controversy surrounding running mate dan quayle pollsters 
said wednesday 
bush rebounded to at best a narrow lead in public opinion polls 
this week after badly trailing the democratic nominee michael 
dukakis last month but new polls indicate that bushs bounce may 
have peaked virtually as soon as it began 
two polls wednesday put bush ahead by leads so slim they were 
within the margins of error 4439 in an nbc newswall street 
journal poll done saturday through monday and 4947 in a harris 
poll done friday to monday 
i think hes been hurt in the long run for the race said 
michael traugott a gallup organization pollster as this 
reporting takes hold there has to be some negative consequence for 
the bushquayle ticket 
news reports since the gop convention last week have been 
dominated by questions about quayles entry into the national guard 
during the vietnam war and about a former female lobbyists claim 
he propositioned her in 1980 
those issues arose at a critical time in the campaign when bush 
needed to capitalize on the positive response to his acceptance 
speech by keeping attention focused on his themes pollsters said 
if you hit a high note youve got to keep hitting it because 
the public isnt paying attention and it needs to have that 
constantly reinforced said keating holland a cbs news pollster 
the good news that bush is trying to continue to pump out is 
getting lost in this quayle thing 
the result in a gallup poll conducted thursday and friday bush 
led dukakis by nine percentage points but in a gallup poll done 
friday through sunday he led by just four points a dead heat 
because of the margin of error 
similarly bush led by six points also within the error margin 
in a cbs news poll conducted friday through sunday holland noted 
that bushs support was strongest friday and seemed to wane as the 
weekend progressed 
it was expected that bush would receive a boost in popularity as 
a result of television coverage of the republican convention just 
as dukakis won a bounce from the democratic convention in midjuly 
the partisan speechmaking and careful choreography of modern 
conventions reliably lift their nominees in the polls albeit 
temporarily 
but quayle questions arose even before the convention closed 
traugott likened the effect to the 1976 debate in which president 
ford contended that eastern europe is not under soviet domination 
initial polls found no effect but ford soon suffered as news 
reports stressed the gaffe 
this will turn out to be one of those events like the 1976 
debate that will be cited as a major explanatory factor for either 
a narrow bush loss or a victory which could have been bigger 
given the boost that he should have received from the reagan 
performance of the past eight years traugott said it will 
become part of the folklore of the 1988 election 
while fords misstatement reflected on himself pollsters 
doubted that concerns about quayle personally were harming the gop 
ticket because voters tend to decide exclusively on the 
presidential nominees 
people repeatedly say the vice presidential choice doesnt 
matter said jeff alderman pollster for abc news if the vice 
presidential candidate cant help very much then its equally 
difficult for him to hurt very much 
instead others said the apparent damage stems from a lack of 
positive publicity for the bush campaign coming out of the 
convention with voters somewhat unfamiliar with the nominees and 
not strongly committed to either one negative developments such 
as the quayle questions can strongly influence the electorate at 
least briefly they said 
that is not to say polls now can predict the elections outcome 
measures of underlying public attitudes for months have indicated a 
close contest even as dukakis rose to an 18point lead on the tide 
of publicity from his convention dukakis bounce was greater and 
lasted longer than bushs but some polls put the race back at a 
tie even before the republicans met 
bounce is not momentum momentum implies youre going to 
continue on indefinitely holland said bounce means youre 
going to rise youre going to fall and the fall can be as quick 
as the rise is 
the nbcjournal poll was conducted saturday through monday among 
1762 registered voters the harris poll friday through monday 
among 1310 likely voters both had error margins of plus or minus 
three points

a spokesman for kurdish rebels said 
wednesday that iraqi troops were massing for an allout offensive 
against the guerrillas who are supported by iran 
western diplomats in the iraqi capital of baghdad speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday the iraqis were taking 
advantage of a ceasefire in the persian gulf war with iran to step 
up operations against the rebels 
a bloody massacre is awaiting the 150000 civilians trapped in 
the area the spokesman for the kurdish democratic party said in 
a telephone call from a western european city he did not identify 
we believe the iraqi authorities will use chemical weapons 
this is a matter of life and death for us 
the iraqis were planning largescale operations in all the 
kurdish liberated zones along the entire 220mile border with 
turkey the rebel spokesman told the associated press in the 
telephone call to nicosia he spoke on condition his name not be 
used because of security reasons 
he said many iraqi army troops were gathering in the northern 
cities in mosul dahok and zakho and predicted fierce fighting in 
northeastern iraq when the offensive is launched but he did not 
say when that might happen 
about 20 million kurds are spread across the mountainous region 
where the borders of turkey iraq iran syria and the soviet union 
meet iraqs 35 million kurds have been fighting for a separate 
homeland for more than 50 years 
the kurdish democratic party and other kurdish factions backed 
by iranian revolutionary guards escalated their war against 
baghdad two years ago their attacks created a second war front in 
northern iraq pinning down tens of thousands of iraqi troops badly 
needed in the main battlefields farther south 
but in recent months the iraqi army has pushed the iranians out 
of their footholds in iraq and intensified pressure on tehran the 
kurds said the iraqis intensified their attacks on rebel forces a 
week before the ceasefire between iraq and iran took effect aug 
20 
the recent iraqi offensive involving about 50000 troops has 
brought about a dramatic reversal in the guerrillas fortunes they 
now appear to be trapped between iraq and the turkish border to the 
north 
the turks who are also fighting the kurds have been reported 
to deploy large numbers of their own troops along the frontier 
apparently in collaboration with iraqi president saddam hussein 
the rebel spokesman said the movements leader massoud barzani 
has appealed to the international committee of the red cross for 
immediate assistance to kurdish refugees and called on the united 
nations to protect them 
kurdish officials and western diplomats in baghdad say the 
iraqis have razed hundreds of villages in recent months and 
forcibly moved about 150000 civilians to camps in the south 
barzani son of the famous kurdish general mustafa barzani who 
died 18 months ago also has called on un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar and world leaders to intercede with baghdad 
to halt its genocide against the kurds 
he has said the iraqis have thrust deep into the kurdish 
stronghold using poison gas air strikes and scorched earth 
tactics kurdish officials list nearly 30 chemical attacks on 
villages in recent months 
charges that iraq has used chemical weapons outlawed under a 
1925 geneva agreement are difficult to confirm however the 
united nations has reported at least some use of chemical arms by 
iraq in the war 
iran claimed 4000 kurdish civilians were killed in the town of 
halabja when the iraqis dropped poison gas bombs in february 
western correspondents who visited the town captured by 
proiranian forces reported seeing the bodies of hundreds of men 
women and children 
kurdish alarm has deepened with the ceasefire iranian and 
iraqi leaders meeting in geneva thursday for peace talks were 
expected to seek guarantees that both sides will halt support for 
opposition forces 
moreover the guerrillas have long been suspicious of their 
iranian ally both the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi and current 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini tried to crush kurdish 
groups inside iran before the war made them allies 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia reported wednesday that yar ahmad husseini leader of an 
iraqibacked kurdish faction was publicly hanged in the western 
town of bakhtaran monday

ms parkinsons roommate john gideon who was arrested friday

rescuers found a mountainclimbing party 
of five frenchmen one canadian and two bolivians on wednesday the 
day after their guide reported what he described as a guerrilla 
attack 
eduardo perez beltran acting interior minister told the 
associated press the climbers were expected in la paz on thursday 
and police were continuing to investigate 
jorge alderete interior undersecretary said earlier we do 
not yet have a clear picture of the situation but the first 
information indicates it is a group linked to the peruvian shining 
path guerillas 
berfardo guarachi the bolivian guide said 16 heavily armed men 
surrounded the climbing partys base camp monday at about 15000 
feet in the andes 50 miles north of la paz guarachi said he heard 
shots before escaping down a glacier 
guarachi said tuesday that the men communicated with 
walkietalkies and five wore khaki uniforms 
after the climbers were found perez beltran said a preliminary 
investigation indicated they were surrounded by armed indians who 
may have been hunting and there was no evidence of guerrilla 
involvement 
he said military aircraft flew over the site and helicopter

the mayor of an israeli town 
where arsonists killed three palestinians apologized to a victims 
family wednesday in an attempt to patch up strained arabjewish 
relations 
what happened really shocked me yitzhak bukovza mayor of 
or yehuda near tel aviv told relatives of mustafa khalil abadlah 
during a visit to their home in this central gaza strip town 
its a religious commandment to bring the spirit of peace 
and express our will to live together bukovza said 
abadlahs three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and 
accepted the mayors apology but they also demanded harsh 
punishment for the arsonists and better protection for arab workers 
in israel 
three palestinians laborers sleeping in a construction site 
shack in or yehuda were killed when assailants set the hut on fire 
aug 8 three or yehuda residents are being held in the attack 
police said the assailants were not out to attack arabs but to 
take revenge on a jewish contractor who refused to give them work 
earlier this week police detained four arabs suspected of 
hurling smoke bombs and firebombs at an or yehuda home to avenge 
the arson 
however israel television reported wednesday that police 
detained two or yehuda residents ages 20 and 30 on suspicion of 
carrying out the attack for which the four arabs were held the 
report said one of the suspects lives in the apartment building 
where the bombs were thrown 
their aim was to provoke neighbors to expel palestinians from 
the town the television said 
several or yehuda residents welcomed the arson attack so what 
if an arab burned to death shuki calif 16 told the hadashot 
newspaper whats an arab anyway he isnt human 
in his visit to qarara bukovza defended city residents saying 
those who are under suspicion are or yehuda residents but we can 
say with a clear conscience that our boys were not involved in 
this he did not elaborate 
bukovza was accompanied by a dozen city residents during the 
trip the delegations bus was guarded by two army jeeps and 
followed by about two dozen journalists 
when the group arrived at the fourstory home of the abadlah 
family mayhem broke loose as camera crews and photographers pushed 
for positions leaving the relatives bewildered and intimidated 
the meeting was awkward at first the victims three brothers 
were seated in chairs and bukovza delivered his statement standing 
in front of them until a village leader pointed out that it would 
be more appropriate for him to be seated as well 
one of the brothers abdel razik abadlah said after the 
meeting im very thankful that this important man came to see 
us im very happy that he apologized to us 
however abadlah said he would no longer work in israel because 
if i go i will get killed he said he has worked as a 
construction worker in the tel aviv area for 10 years 
the family demanded a thorough investigation better protection 
for arab workers and compensation from or yehuda 
bukovza speaking in hebrew and halting arabic invited the 
family to or yehuda at the end of the 40day period of mourning and 
promised compensation 
when asked for immediate assistance bukovza said he and others 
would pay a symbolic sum until a deal was worked out 
initially the mayor whose parents were born in libya also 
planned to pay condolences to the families of the other two 
victims it was not clear why they did not attend the meeting 
the or yehuda arson was one in a recent series of violent 
confrontations between arabs and jews inside israel

three thousand people driven from their homes by 
a fire at a pcb depot in suburban montreal waited with friends and 
relatives late wednesday while scientists conducted water and soil 
tests for contamination 
many evacuated residents complained they were being kept in the 
dark about the possible dangers of inhaling pcbs a liquid chemical 
suspected of causing cancer 
im not afraid for me but for my baby said chantal labarre 
24 eight months pregnant we all have questions and wonder what 
the danger is 
another resident jeanpierre reinesch said the firemen were 
told to burn their clothes what about us 
environment minister tom macmillan promised a thorough 
investigation into the cause of the sixhour inferno in st 
basilelegrand 15 miles east of montreal the blaze sent flames 
more than 150 feet into the night sky on tuesday and covered the 
area with a thick black cloud 
more than 50 residents were treated for skin and lung irritation 
at local hospitals alain lavoie an official of the quebec 
environment ministry told the associated press 
police sealed off the area as federal and provincial scientists 
conducted soil and water tests doctors checked residents of a 
5squaremile area 
production of pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls now is banned 
but it was formerly used as a coolant in hydroelectric 
transformers pcbs inhibit electrical flow and wont burn at 
temperatures under 1832 degrees 
the depot stored drums containing thousands of gallons of 
discarded oil with pcbs 
environment official antonio flammand said some test results may 
not be available for weeks until then it is impossible to predict 
the longterm effects of inhaling the fumes 
theres a possibility that animals near the scene and 
firemen who were exposed may suffer longterm effects said 
flammand 
residents in st basile and neighboring sections of east 
montreal were advised not to eat fruit or vegetables from their 
gardens or drink tap water in nearby stejulie people were 
warned to keep windows closed and keep children and pets inside

with steel outer walls and a cement floor has been a topic of 
controversy with residents pressing for better safety the quebec 
government found seven safety violations two years ago but 
improvements reportedly remained to be carried out 
its a scandal that its still there said resident renee 
archambault it takes a disaster like this before people wake 
up 
the only plant in canada capable of destroying pcbs is in swan 
hills alberta but does not accept pcb waste from other provinces 
st basile is one of 50 storage sites in quebec alone

the defense ministry on wednesday said 
the us army can station 39 more attack helicopters in central 
hesse state despite objections by local officials that the skies 
are already too crowded 
defense minister rupert scholz found no grounds for refusing the 
us request to base the helicopters at a us air field near 
wiesbaden in september the ministry said in a statement 
earlier this month the hesse state parliament told the defense 
ministry it objected to more helicopters being based near 
wiesbaden saying air traffic was overcrowded near frankfurts 
international airport 
wiesbaden is 25 miles west of frankfurt 
however the defense ministry said that after careful study 
scholz decided the advantages of the helicopters in boosting the 
north atlantic treaty organizations security and defense of west 
germany outweighed objections to the stationing 
but the statement said the decision was limited to the basing 
only of the 39 additional attack helicopters and does not include 
the us militarys plans to expand to 181 total aircraft at the 
air base by 1993 
there are currently 57 us military helicopters based at the 
wiesbaden site 
the us army released a statement late wednesday which said the 
ministrys decision confirmed the planned stationing is within 
the scope of international agreements governing the use of 
wiesbaden air base by us forces

a us bankruptcy court judge rejected the 
proposed ptl reorganization plan wednesday saying it did not take 
into account the television ministrys poor financial health 
this plan does not work judge rufus reynolds said it 
does not reflect the situation 
reynolds gave bankruptcy trustee mc red benton until oct 
1 to prepare a new plan and until sept 10 to return with 
information on potential buyers for the ministrys assets 
reynolds considered but rejected the idea of closing operations 
down saying that would kill ptls source of revenues which 
include donations from television viewers and proceeds from the 
heritage usa christian retreat near fort mill 
the ministry which entered bankruptcy proceedings in june 1987 
after the resignation of founder jim bakker in a sexandmoney 
scandal has been divided into the newly named heritage ministries 
and a corporation holding ptls assets 
the rejected reorganization plan would have given the trustee up 
to five years to sell assets and repay ptls debts which could be 
more than 130 million 
after the 75minute hearing benton said he would propose to 
sell the assets over a shorter period of six to seven months to 
satisfy ptls creditors and the court 
benton did not say whether the rejection of the reorganization 
plan would affect a proposal by samoth capital corp owned by 
canadian businessman peter thomas to buy ptls satellite 
television network the heritage usa property and 1700 acres of 
undeveloped property samoth has offered 113 million but the 
money would be paid over several years 
benton said solidifying a sale within the next six to seven 
months would let creditors know exactly how much they would receive 
much sooner than the five years allowed in the rejected 
reorganization plan 
benton said he expected to have a firm offer from samoth by 
sept 1 and possibly competing offers from bakker charlotte 
nc businessman george shinn who owns an nba expansion franchise 
in that city and an oklahoma group he declined to name 
both reynolds and benton said any potential buyer would need to 
maintain a ministry on the property to support operations 
reynolds also agreed to transfer 885000 in proceeds from other 
assets sales to the corporation holding the ministrys assets 
benton said the corporation has been losing 400000 a month 
reynolds did not act on a request for funds for heritage 
ministries which benton said was already some 400000 in debt 
afterwards heritage village church pastor sam johnson blamed 
the shortfall on legal expenses and the ministrys television 
program having to go through a name change 
he said he would once again appeal to ministry supporters for 
help and should know by the end of september the ministrys future 
if they respond well have a ministry if they dont it will 
be shut down he said

the death of more than 7000 seals in the heavily 
polluted north sea indicates major problems in all the worlds 
oceans and is a warning to humans living around them british 
scientists said wednesday 
no link has been established between pollution and the virus 
leading to the severe pneumonia that is killing the seals but 
dumped chemicals may be destroying their immune system so they 
cannot fight disease said scientists of the british governments 
natural environment research council 
whatever is causing the problem in the north sea could spread 
to affect all the worlds oceans said dr brian mccartney 
director of the proudman oceanographic laboratory monitoring the 
north sea 
pollution is higher in the north sea than in the atlantic 
ocean but the two seas are connected and the state of the north 
sea is an early indicator of the state of all the oceans he told 
a news conference 
seals are prone to infection but we have seen nothing like 
this before said dr john harwood head of the governmentfunded 
sea mammal research unit at cambridge 
we feel powerless as there is almost nothing we can do to stop 
the seals dying he said 
the british government announced it would fund new research to 
discover how and where seals pick up harmful pollutants in the sea 
junior environment minister virginia bottomley said the 
government was concerned about the death of seals because disease 
could reach britain from the eastern north sea and the baltic sea 
the research involves taking samples of blood and tissue from 
seals and fitting some of the animals with radio transmitters so 
ships can track their feeding movements a report should be ready 
within six months mrs bottomley said 
the scientists said a group of highly toxic compounds called 
pcbs polychlorinated biphenols used in electrical equipment 
like transformers are among the prime suspect chemicals 
seals represent the highest mammals in the north sea and are 
the closest to man physiologically so when they die in thousands 
it is a warning to man mccartney said in an interview 
harwood said half the population of common seals in northwest 
europe has died from the virus on the coasts of denmark west 
germany the netherlands norway sweden and britain 
he said britains 200000 gray seals might be threatened these 
seals account for half the world population of gray seals and still 
are not known to be affected by the virus 
only 500 to 1000 monk seals survive in the eastern aegean sea 
of the mediterranean and the west african coast of mauritania 
these seals could be in terrible danger if the disease spreads 
and the disease could also spread to dolphins and porpoises he 
said 
harwood said dutch scientists isolated two viruses in dead 
seals one a type of herpes and the other a type of picorna which 
causes polio and hoof and mouth disease in livestock 
dr minnie courtney an independent marine biologist of london 
university said we know nothing of immunity in seals or fish 
only in man we are in a very weak position when something like 
this happens its as if you had to start studying medicine for 
human beings all over again 
sir richard body a conservative lawmaker called for urgent 
government action to stop north sea pollution because britain was 
pouring more filth into it than any other nation 
opposition labor party lawmaker david blunkett said it is 
time for britain to act to prevent the north sea becoming the dead 
sea and to work with the dutch and the scandinavians in saving what 
seals we can

a conference sponsored by the united nations 
and the organization of african unity adopted a plan wednesday to 
help ease the plight of 54 million refugees in southern africa it 
asked for intensified world aid 
the oslo declaration and plan of action said relief efforts 
should concentrate on rebuilding agriculture finding jobs for 
displaced people and providing them access to credit and marketing 
structures 
the threeday conference attracted more than 400 delegates from 
80 countries specialized un agencies and african liberation 
movements 
the plan suggested a general outline for helping refugees in 
nine states bordering or near south africa angola botswana 
lesotho malawi mozambique swaziland tanzania zambia and 
zimbabwe 
it said greater efforts should be made to forecast and prepare 
for emergencies to assess relief needs and plan deliveries to 
help affected areas recover and develop and to step up the 
mobilization of resources 
the conference recognizes that the conditions of refugees 
returnees and displaced persons is a global responsibility the 
declaration said stressing the need for international 
burdensharing 
documents distributed at the conference estimated some of the 
annual recovery costs for southern africa as 150 million for 
agriculture 100 million for health and education 50 million for 
housing 50 million for roads 40 million for emergency food 
stocks 25 million for water supplies 20 million to deal with 
soil erosion and 15 million for sanitation 
the conference recommended more coordination among existing 
organizations particularly the high commissioner for refugees the 
world food program the un childrens fund the un development 
program and the world health organization 
the document blamed south africas racial policy for many of the 
problems in the area although millions of the refugees also were 
displaced inside their own countries by domestic conflicts 
the root causes of the tragic humanitarian crisis unfolding in 
the region is south africas apartheid policy its illegal 
occupation of namibia the policies it pursues in the region of 
direct and indirect acts of aggression intimidation and 
destabilization the declaration said 
the fundamental and lasting solutions to the regions refugee 
problem lie in the adoption of political and other actions aimed at

a prominent jewish leader said 
wednesday hes disappointed and saddened at the response of pat 
robertson to his request for a statement condemning antisemitic 
remarks made about the film the last temptation of christ 
abraham h foxman national director of the new yorkbased 
antidefamation league of bnai brith chastised the former 
republican presidential hopeful for failing to quickly condemn 
statements made by some critics of the martin scorsese film the 
new york times reported wednesday 
foxman in a telephone interview with the associated press said 
he was sad the personal correspondence between him and robertson 
had become public in the newspaper and that he considered robertson 
to be a friend 
but he repeated his contention that robertsons initial response 
to his letter asking the television evangelist for a condemnation 
of antisemitism had been inadequate 
i appreciated his advice foxman told the ap and i 
respect his judgment 
but i am still disappointed and saddened this is something 
that needs no great strategy or counsel we should be able to stand 
up and say antisemitism is wrong 
some conservative christians unhappy with the universal 
pictures film claimed it is a jewish attack on christianity lew 
wasserman the head of mca universals parent company is jewish 
robertson criticized the film but did not join in the attacks on 
wassermanin a statement wednesday he said he did eventually 
condemn the antijewish comments about the film on his television 
show the 700 club 
in his first letter to robertson foxman asked the evangelist to 
condemn antisemitic rhetoric 
in his response robertson said he would condemn any 
antisemitism that might occur and suggested the adl join him 
in criticizing the picture 
robertson founder and chief executive officer of the christian 
broadcasting network issued a statement wednesday saying he too 
was upset that private correspondence had been made public and 
expressed disappointment that the adl leader had not taken his 
advice to condemn the film 
i was advising a dear personal friend of what i felt was the 
most effective strategy in this particular situation to stop 
antisemitic rhetoric and sentiment about this film before it ever 
began robertson said 
had they done what i suggested it would have been a great 
move to solidify the rapport between christians and jews in america 
and further prompt unity between us 
foxman said he believed that whether the adl took a stand on the 
film or not robertson should speak out on the antisemitism 
i have seen the film and i can understand why christians are 
upset i think that the discussion of the portrayal of jesus in the 
film is certainly proper within the christian community 
but at the same time the antisemitism is something we have 
been fighting for 2000 years if we let these things stand 
unchallenged they become the accepted truth it is time that those 
in the middle stand up and be heard rather than only those on both 
extremes foxman said 
in his statement robertson said i will always stand against 
antisemitism i have already spoken out on the 700 club on this 
matter as i promised 
cbn spokeswoman frankie abourjilie said she had no details on 
what robertson had said or when he said it

israeli soldiers shot and 
wounded up to 15 palestinians on wednesday and their government 
rejected us criticism of its policy of deporting activists from 
the occupied territories 
the united states told israel in the first such warning that 
relations would be damaged if the israelis continued deporting 
palestinians from the occupied lands deputy secretary of state 
john whitehead delivered the warning monday at a meeting in 
washington with an israeli diplomat 
in nablus the west banks largest city troops fired on 
palestinians who hurled stones and burned tires in the alleys of 
the central market the army said 
as soldiers and palestinians skirmished scores of kites flown 
by children on rooftops darted in the sky one box kite sailing 
near the casbah or old city wore the red white black and green 
colors of the outlawed palestinian flag 
a spokesman said two palestinians were wounded by gunfire two 
by rubber bullets and two by plastic bullets arab hospital 
officials put the number hit by gunfire at 11 including a 
17yearold girl seriously wounded in the chest 
four palestinians were wounded at the shati refugee camp in gaza 
city the army spokesman said arab hospital officials said an 
8yearold boy was shot in the back 
israel radio said a 10yearold israeli boy on his way to the 
jewish settlement of kiryat arba was struck in the head by a rock 
as his bus passed the el arrub refugee camp near bethlehem 
palestinians began a twoday general strike wednesday in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip to protest the deaths of four 
arabs held in israeli prisons 
the mayor of an israeli town where arsonists killed three 
palestinians drove to the gaza strip to apologize to the family of 
one victim 
at least 252 arabs have been killed in the uprising that began 
dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians who live in the occupied 
lands most of them shot by israeli soldiers four israelis also 
have been slain 
soldiers with bulldozers demolished three homes before dawn 
wednesday in jelazoun refugee camp the houses belonged to members 
of outlawed local committees who were suspected in the beating 
death of a palestinian youth who allegedly collaborated with 
israel the army said 
an associated press reporter in nablus counted more than 20 
instances of soldiers opening fire most often into the air as 
warnings or with rubber or plastic bullets which are lethal only 
at close range 
at least twice while the reporter was present soldiers radioed 
commanding officers for permission to fire live ammunition 
maj elkana whose full name cannot be disclosed because of army 
regulations turned down a soldier who asked permission to fire a 
22 caliber rifle at the legs of protesters blocking a main road 
mayor yitzhak bukovza of or yehuda near tel aviv told 
relatives of arson victim mustafa khalil abadlah what happened 
really shocked me its a commandment to bring the spirit of peace 
and express our will to live together 
abadlah was sleeping a construction site shack in or yehuda when 
he was burned to death 
his three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and 
accepted bukovzas apology but demanded harsh punishment for the 
arsonists and better protection for palestinian workers in israel 
the foreign ministry in a reply to the us criticism said 
wednesday israel does not accept the american interpretation of 
international law regarding deportations the legality was 
checked recently by israels supreme court which ruled that 
deportations are legal according to both israeli and international 
law 
us ambassador thomas pickering spent 90 minutes with prime 
minister yitzhak shamir discussing the issue 
israel television later reported that both shamir and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin told pickering the deportation policy would 
continue israels inner cabinet of 10 senior ministers met 
wednesday and endorsed the policy the television said 
washingtons criticism has created a small crisis certainly 
tension in the relationship said eytan gilboa a specialist on 
the united states at jerusalems hebrew university the language 
was exceptionally strong 
israel has deported 33 palestinians since the rebellion began 
contending they are leaders of resistance to israeli rule and has 
ordered the expulsions of 25 more 
the united states considers expulsions a violation of human 
rights and an obstacle to peace in the middle east state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said wednesday the united 
states was shocked by the decision to deport another 25 
palestinians 
washington has longstanding differences with israel on 
deportation detention without trial and other punitive measures 
against palestinians but never had indicated they threatened 
relations

the rightwing government on wednesday 
decreed an end to all state of emergency measures for the first 
time since president augusto pinochet took power in a 1973 coup 
the interior minister announced 
the action was taken less than a week before chiles military 
commanders meet to nominate a candidate expected to be pinochet 
himself for a presidential referendum planned for october 
interior minister sergio fernandez in a news conference at the 
government palace told reporters that presidential decrees 
removing the emergency measures have been issued today and will 
take effect upon publication in the official bulletin within the 
next few days 
the two measures now in effect are a state of emergency and a 
state of disturbance to internal peace 
under the state of emergency the government is authorized to 
suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict 
public gatherings 
the state of disturbance measure permits pinochet to order the 
arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days send into 
exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security order 
internal exile for up to three months and restrict freedom of 
information and public gatherings 
opposition figures reacted with cautious approval 
better late than never said alejandro hales head of the 
national lawyers association and a prominent critic of pinochet 
i now hope the government will not resort to any legal 
loopholes to prevent chileans from exercising rights of which they 
have been deprived for 15 years hales told reporters 
manuel bustos leader of the main labor conferation called the 
governments action positive because it creates better conditions 
for a clean referendum 
the president of the countrys episcopal conference monsignor 
carlos gonzalez lauded the government action 
it makes me profoundly happy gonzalez said in remarks 
broadcast by radio cooperativo of santiago i think this will 
contribute to the peace of everyone it gives tranquility it gives 
confidence 
since sept 11 1973 when pinochet led a coup that toppled the 
government of elected marxist president salvador allende chile 
always has been under a state of siege of emergency or of 
disturbance of internal peace each has been lifted at one time or 
another but never before have all been lifted and often more than 
one has been in effect at the same time 
according to fernandez the new decrees were issued because 
authorities had established order within the country 
the efforts of the competent government agencies to 
guarantee public calm and order have born fruit he said 
neither the cunning aggression of extremists nor the violence 
that certain groups persistently utilize has managed to compromise 
the general atmosphere of order peace and progress 
the roman catholic church several foreign governments including 
the united states the political opposition and even many 
government supporters had called for lifting the states of 
emergency before the referendum they said the ballot would lack 
credibility if civil liberties were restricted during the political 
campaign 
pinochet navy commander jose merino air force chief fernando 
matthei and national police director rodolfo stange meet aug 30 to 
pick the presidential nominee and announce a date for the 
referendum pinochet is virtually assured of the nomination 
although the precise date of the ballot has not been announced 
pinochet has said it will take place in early october if the 
candidate wins a majority in the vote he will begin an eightyear 
term in march if a majority rejects him open elections will be 
held in 1990 with pinochet remaining in place until then 
according to lawyer gustavo villalobos of the local catholic 
churchs human rights agency the lifting of the states of 
emergency could allow most of chiles 504 political exiles to 
return the law allows for some exiles to remain barred from 
returning he told the associated press in an telephone interview

police converged on strikebound coal mines 
and a port activists said thursday after more workers joined 
stoppages and solidarity denounced official repression of the 
protests 
the government and workers are struggling for the initiative in 
the biggest labor upheaval since gen wojciech jaruzelski imposed 
martial law in december 1981 to crush and then outlaw solidarity 
the first independent labor union in the soviet bloc 
strikers demand higher pay better working conditions and that 
solidarity be made legal again 
we condemn and strongly protest these acts tadeusz 
mazowiecki a senior solidarity adviser said wednesday of police 
strikebreaking actions 
government spokesman jerzy urban was asked by telephone whether 
the government was getting the upper hand and replied there is 
more and more news about strikes ended but on the other hand there 
are new centers of workers conflicts still appearing 
solidarity founder lech walesa declared to young strikers it 
is you the young people who will renew solidarity and renew the 
country 
strikes began aug 16 and have spread to more than 20 sites 
a soviet spokesman said wednesday his government was watching 
the polish strike situation with concern but the kremlin has not 
made an official statement 
in hungary where the soviet army crushed an uprising in 1956 
more than 300 miners struck wednesday against bonus cuts and a new 
income tax it was the first known worker protest of stringent 
economic policies introduced by karoly grosz who became communist 
party chief in may 
in northwest poland helicopters circled over the strikebound 
szczecin port early thursday and police massed outside its 
barricaded gate said solidarity spokesman piotr niemczyk 
police invaded a bus depot in szczecin early wednesday and 150 
strikers who had been holed up there for a week yielded quietly a 
strike at the mieszko coal mine in walbrzych ended tuesday night in 
similar fashion when police broke down the barricaded gate 
adam michnik another senior solidarity adviser said the 
situation in silesia has become extremely serious 
he said workers at other coal mines in southwestern poland may 
follow the example of those at the 30 years of poland mine who 
have barricaded themselves in more than 1500 feet below the 
surface 
other miners are preparing to evacuate to underground if 
there are signs of intervention michnik said 
polish strikers occupy their job sites instead of walking out 
as do workers in the united states and other countries 
the official news agency pap said strikes ended peacefully at 
the lenin victoria marcel and borynia mines all in the silesia 
region of southern poland but niemczyk said the voluntary 
evacuation at borynia occurred only after riot police threatened a 
raid 
late wednesday large convoys of police vehicles headed toward 
strikebound coal mines in southern poland said an activist in 
jastrezebie lycyna wujec 
up to 60 vehicles were seen going toward the july manifesto mine 
in jastrezebie where the strikes began last week ms wujec said 
the convoy consisted of police vans armored personnel carriers 
water cannons and ambulances said ms wujec she said about 12 
other police vans headed to the morcinek mine 
witnesses said earlier about 30 police vehicles had moved in 
around the july manifesto mine 
an army helicopter hovered and a convoy of 103 police vehicles 
including water cannon jeeps trucks and an armored personnel 
carrier moved through the town according to reporters at the 
scene 
foreign journalists were barred from the mine area for the first 
time since aug 16 
about 1000 employees quit working wednesday in two departments 
at the nowa huta steel mill where a strike attempt fizzled after a 
few hours monday said maciej mach a worker leader who spoke from 
the plant by telephone 
nowa huta which has 30000 employees was the scene of a major 
strike during the last labor unrest in may but a police raid ended 
it 
solidarity activists said strikes spread on wednesday to the 
knurow mine in silesia and the dzialoszyn cement works in central 
poland but the government did not confirm the reports pap said 
eight mines remained on strike and solidarity spokesmen reported 10 
the latest gdansk strike brought all major dock and shipyard 
industries to a halt in the baltic port 
employees of the lenin shipyard where walesa works as an 
electrician went on strike monday in support of the miners and of 
port and transport workers in szczecin 
workers at the other port and shipyard facilities in gdansk 
quickly followed paralyzing the nations vital export industries 
tons of highgrade export coal remain in rail cars at the 
bulkloading terminal which has also been idle since monday 
riot troops have sealed off all strikebound operations in gdansk 
walesa led rallies at three shipyards wednesday some of his 
comments were on a tape provided to reporters 
hundreds of workers including some on the deck of a soviet ship 
undergoing repair listened as he blamed government leaders for 
bringing poland to economic ruin

a war between two colombian gangs to 
control new york citys cocaine market is out of control the mayor 
of medellin said in a report published wednesday 
the commander of the national police in medellin col antonio 
sanchez asked the federal government on wednesday to use state of 
emergency and state of siege measures to combat the violence 
on tuesday mayor juan gomez martinez told a news conference 
the only thing we can do is increase the size of the police 
force 
gomez said it is impossible for medellin to control the mob war 
national or international help is needed 
colombian newspapers reported the news conference in wednesdays 
editions 
one gang has headquarters in medellin colombias second largest 
city and the other in cali the third largest city the two 
cartels have been at war for six months for supremacy of the new 
york city cocaine market estimated by colombian authorities to be 
worth 35 billion a year 
eighty gang members have been killed 62 of them belonging to 
the cali mob 
the entire nation has been under a state of siege for all but a 
few months of the last 35 years a state of siege was imposed anew 
four years ago when drug traffickers assassinated justice minister 
rodrigo lara bonilla in the capital city of bogota colombias 
largest city with 6 million people 
president virgilio barco could use the state of siege to give 
search and seizure authority to the army and other government 
security forces without requiring them to act on a judges orders 
barco also could impose curfews and restrict the right of public 
assembly 
last year he issued a decree allowing the army to arrest and try 
civilians in an effort to combat drug trafficking but the supreme 
court struck the decree down as unconstitutional

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed in principle to extend for one year the current deal between 
the two countries for soviet purchase of american grain a us 
official said wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
terms were essentially identical to current arrangements under 
which the soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of us grain 
annually the fiveyear pact expires sept 30 
the official said the two sides reached a mutual decision to try 
to devise a new accord but to stick to the terms now in force he 
told the associated press the deal was sealed last week through 
diplomatic channels 
a second official said he hoped a pact between the two countries 
could be reached at the next negotiating session but said that no 
final agreement has been reached 
we feel like we made some progress but were still far apart 
on pricing minimums and things of that nature said thomas kay 
chief of the department of agricultures foreign agricultural 
service 
the grain deal benefits american farmers now experiencing 
severe drought problems and the soviet union which often looks to 
the west for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year 
last month the agriculture department estimated that the 
soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons 
which would be their third best crop ever the soviets are 
importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding 
livestock herds 
the soviets have already been given permission to purchase more 
than 12 million tons of grain for this year as of last month they 
had bought more than 5 million tons of corn more than 9 million 
tons of wheat 830700 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of 
soybean meal

want to learn more about the interesting people and places here 
in dixon the group will be greeted by storefront signs 
proclaiming peace on earth in english and russian and flags of

19thcentury swedish merchant who provided supplies for the

maria desillers went to court wednesday to fight a 
possible jail sentence for failing to turn over financial records 
and luxury items allegedly purchased with donations for her late 
sons liver transplants 
at the opening of an oftenacrimonious contempt hearing the 
attorney for the courtappointed curator of ronnie desillers 
estate said ms desillers fate was in her own hands 
we are here with a sincere sense of regret said michael 
dribin the curatortrustee has no desire to see ms desillers 
punished the key to the jailhouse cell is held by ms 
desillers 
as dribin spoke ms desillers muttered what a joke 
ms desillers attorney roy black said he would show his 
client had already complied with the courts demands 
dade circuit judge francis christie has repeatedly ordered ms 
desillers to surrender a bmw car jewelry clothes and other items 
believed bought with about 200000 of the almost 700000 donated 
to pay for operations on ronnie 
so far however ms desillers has turned in only the car her 
attorneys have complained that the order is unclear and includes 
items she bought with with her own money 
the contempt hearing was scheduled to continue thursday the 
judge could rule immediately on whether to jail or fine ms 
desillers or take the decision under advisement 
when curator karen gievers took the witness stand black 
repeatedly attacked her testimony 
christie admonished black several times to stop interrupting ms 
gievers who testified she had never received documents that would 
enable her to determine whether some of ms desillers expenditures 
were legitimate 
black grilled ms gievers on whether she knew the intentions of 
all the donors who include president reagan and on whether the 
money was given in ronnies name or his mothers 
to this day i havent gotten any of the information ms 
gievers responded i was trying to find out what the assets 
were 
black also criticized the curator for hiring expensive attorneys 
without negotiating a fee first but she said she would not have 
had to pay anything if ms desillers had obeyed the court orders 
ms gievers also brushed aside blacks contention that by 
turning over the financial records ms desillers was being forced 
to testify against herself 
ms desillers cannot hide behind the fifth amendment and flout 
the courts said the curator 
black then called to the stand christine penrod whose son was a 
classmate of ronnie desillers mrs penrod said ms desillers threw 
herself into building a foundation for other transplant children 
after her son died 
it was disorganized perhaps misguided i think it was her 
way of handling grief said mrs penrod something needs to be 
done for these children but its not maria desillers she said 
the effort was sincere however 
ronnie 7 died at pittsburgh childrens hospital in april 1987 
after undergoing three unsuccessful liver transplants ms 
desillers has refused to pay 262000 to the hospital claiming 
that her son received improper care 
his case was widely publicized after more than 4000 gathered 
for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet and 
donations began pouring in from around the world

the total 4775 tons 
in statements carried by the news agency mena ahmed said 13 
arab states had come to sudans rescue 
what we need now is not food or blankets but medicine and 
agricultural material he said it is not important now to send 
food but to help us produce it 
earlier wednesday sudanese authorities said there was no 
epidemic outbreak of diseases so far quelling fears of fatal 
diseases resulting from a scarcity of clean drinking water 
following recent floods 
health officials said 19 cases of suspected cholera in and 
around the capital proved to be only a mild form of diarrhea 
cholera and acute diarrhea kills the young and the weak a lack 
of fresh water supplies makes even basic treatment difficult 
officials said cases of malaria another gastrointestinal 
infection are on the rise as are respiratory tract infections and 
eye diseases 
the reports were carried by the daily alayam newspaper quoting 
unidentified health officials 
wednesdays reports seemed to contradict earlier statements from 
the sudanese red crescent a relief organization which last week 
said more than 5000 people were suffering from severe diarrhea 
most of them children officials reportedly had identified some 
cases as malaria cholera and typhoid 
following the floods health officials predicted deadly 
epidemics of waterborne diseases as people cut off from drinking 
warter supplies are forced to drink from contaminated pools left 
behind by the rainstorms and floods 
in his meeting with foreign reporters ahmed defended the 
governments decision to impose press censorship saying these were 
ordinary measures used in democratic countries in europe and the 
united states to preserve the security and reputation of the 
country 
on tuesday ahmed ordered foreign journalists and photographers 
to conduct interviews and take pictures only in the presence of an 
information ministry representative he said news stories and films 
must be cleared before being allowed out of sudan

republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
told a national guard assembly wednesday dan quayle doesnt run 
away from a fight as he sought during his first solo campaign 
trip to set aside questions about his military record during the 
vietnam era 
in an impassioned defense of his national guard duty during the 
war the indiana senator told a cheering audience of 1000 present 
and former guard members that im not looking for any medals 
but i served loyally 
nearly 20 years ago i had no reason to be ashamed of my 
service and you know what im sure as hell not ashamed of it 
now quayle said quayle noted that missourian harry truman also 
served in the guard and said harry truman never ran away from a 
fight and the national guard never runs away either and by the 
way dan quayle doesnt run away from a fight 
quayle said he wasnt looking for favors when he entered the 
guard in 1969 and reiterated that no rules were broken and no 
effort had been made to influence the process of his admission 
during the height of the vietnam war 
im not looking for any medals and im not asking for a pat 
on the back but let me say this i served i served loyally and i 
served to the best of my ability quayle said 
the indiana senator began this campaign swing seeking to shift 
attention from the controversy and focus instead on his message of 
peace freedom and jobs 
almost at the very start he had a goodnatured airport 
encounter with his democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas who had just warned southern state legislators not to risk 
youthful indiscretion in someone like quayle who might someday 
ascend to the presidency 
in the speech he criticized democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis for an antidefense attitude 
one of the worst false impressions michael dukakis has put 
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense 
quayle said maybe he sincerely believes that but he stands for 
the opposite and that position has been clouded over by the 
distractions of the last few days 
i suppose michael dukakis is enjoying this firestorm because 
its helping distract people from the issues of this campaign he 
said 
an nbcwall street journal poll released wednesday yielded some 
encouraging results for quayle sixtyfour percent of the 
respondents said quayles military record should not be an issue in 
the campaign while 27 percent said it should also 42 percent of 
registered voters approved of quayle as the gop vice presidential 
nominee 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were not sure 
the poll was conducted saturday through monday among 1762 
registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
points 
during the day quayle kept out of range of reporters and sought 
to concentrate on campaign issues and the prospective virtues of a 
george bush presidency an aide said quayle wanted to focus on 
things we want to talk about 
quayle ignored reporters shouted questions seeking a response 
to bentsens remarks bentsen had tried to exploit quayles earlier 
comment that his youthful indiscretion was to blame for his 
vote against elevating the veterans administration to a 
cabinetlevel department 
quayles press secretary david a prosperi told reporters 
later that if dukakis the democratic candidate were elected 
president the country would be plunged into a midlife crisis 
because he knows very little about defense issues 
in appearances before midwestern state legislators in cincinnati 
and a southern legislative conference in lexington ky quayle 
avoided any discussion of his military record or allegations about 
his past association with former lobbyist paula parkinson 
quayle 41 the scion of a wealthy indiana publishing family 
has denied that strings were pulled to get him into the guard 
during the vietnam war or to gain his admission to indiana 
university law school after a mediocre performance in college 
quayles father james c quayle was quoted wednesday in an 
interview with the new york daily news as saying his son had 
majored in booze and broads quayles spokesman refused comment 
quayle has also denied having a sexual affair with paula 
parkinson who shared a florida vacation house with quayle and 
several other house members in 1980 quayle termed outrageous a 
parkinson assertion that he had propositioned her 
in his speeches before state lawmakers wednesday quayle said he 
was proud of a jobs training bill he had cosponsored in the senate 
in the early 1980s he said the legislation had resulted in 
training 34 million economically disadvantaged people and there 
will be millions more 
these arent makework makeshift type of jobs these are real 
jobs quayle said 
he said he supported reforms of the federal budget process 
which is now carried out annually through budget resolutions and 
appropriations and authorization bills 
congress has a threelayer cake out there and one of them is 
going to have to go quayle said 
he said the budget should be drafted every two years instead of 
one and that the president should be authority to veto individual 
budget items rather than entire bills 
i believe that the congress could stand a little bit of 
perestroika to coin a phrase quayle said referring to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of economic restructuring

a radio station manager said wednesday 
that his stations hiring of jessica hahn as an onair personality 
was more than a publicity stunt 
hahn whose sexual encounter with jim bakker led to the ptl 
evangelists downfall has signed a 30day contract starting monday 
with station koyfm 
we feel that jessica has the potential to develop into a 
strong radio personality said jay stevens the stations 
operations manager that coupled with her desire convinced 
us 
he and miss hahn who appeared in a white leather miniskirt koy 
shirt and high heels spent most of a 30minute news conference 
trying to convince reporters that the station was serious about 
developing her into a fifth member of its morning show 
the 29yearold former church secretary did a test run on koys 
ymorning zoo show aug 18 and listener reaction was 
overwhelmingly positive stevens said 
miss hahn was modest about her qualifications though 
im not a professional i know i need to learn a lot and 
polish up she acknowledged nevertheless she said she had been 
interested in being on radio for years and felt at home with koy 
stevens said miss hahns contract includes promotional 
appearances but insisted the station which has played elaborate 
pranks in its search for publicity was not trying to raise its 
ratings a publicrelations firm distributed sheets from the 
tapscan rating analysis system showing koyfm sixth of 20 phoenix 
stations in listenership 
the contract has a renewal option and stevens said we both 
hope to make this a longterm agreement but neither he nor miss 
hahn would say definitely that she planned to be with the station 
by october 
nude photographs of miss hahn following breastenlargement and 
other cosmetic surgery appear in playboy magazines latest issue 
stevens refused to discuss salary details but playboy spokesman 
bill farley of los angeles said the contract included housing and 
very adequate compensation 
glenn beck another personality on the show described miss hahn 
as the vanna white of the morning show shes going to be our

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen criticized 
republican rival dan quayles voting record on wednesday and said 
the nation cant risk youthful indiscretion so close to the 
oval office quayle touted his work on jobs legislation and 
defended his military record before a cheering national guard 
audience 
dan quayle doesnt run away from a fight the indiana 
senator told a group of 1000 former and present guard members in 
st louis 
george bush campaigned in california with president reagan who 
said quayle stands for the same principles as he and the vice 
president 
democrat michael dukakis received an endorsement from the 
aflcio in washington and charged that the legacy of the reagan 
administration was more jobs but lower family income 
meanwhile two fresh polls indicated that the surge bush 
received during last weeks republican national convention already 
was dissipating an nbcwall street journal survey put the vice 
presidents margin as 4439 while a harris survey pegged it at 
4947 both leads were within the margin of error indicating the 
race is a dead heat 
the two campaigns also sparred over the timing of campaign 
debates for the fall dukakis aide paul brountas said it was 
inexcusable for bush to decline dates of sept 8 and 14 
established by organizations interested in staging the 
confrontations bush campaign chief james baker said it is 
unlikely that a debate can occur prior to sept 20 
but the political spotlight was uncharacteristically fixed on 
campaign understudies particularly on the 41yearold quayle and 
the controversy about his vietnam era stint in the national guard 
democrat bentsen told southern legislators meeting in lexington 
ky that quayle had said earlier in the week that youthful 
indiscretion initially led him to vote against senate legislation 
granting cabinetlevel status to the veterans administration 
bentsen also noted quayle told the veterans of foreign wars 
convention that he had changed his mind on the subject and now 
favored the bill a youthful indiscretion my friends that vote 
occurred only five weeks ago bentsen said i dont think 
america can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become 
our president at any moment 
at a news conference following his speech bentsen noted 
quayles reversal on the va bill and said youve got to stand up 
to that kind of heat 
he also referred indirectly to quayles vietnam era stint in the 
national guard 
i certainly dont think hes too young bentsen said of his 
senate colleague but i think you have to have some maturity 
he added and i think the breadth of experience that ive had 
and the tests that ive undergone some of the things that happened 
to me early on in combat make you grow up pretty fast 
quayle in his debut as a campaign soloist said he had helped 
draft the job training and partnership act in the early 1980s 
which he claimed had provided jobs for millions of workers 
including women and poor people 
this program is working we have trained 34 million 
economically disadvantaged people in america so far and there will 
be millions more he said before flying on to kentucky 
in his st louis speech quayle said he wasnt looking for 
favors when he entered the guard in 1969 he said no rules were 
broken and no effort had been made to influence the process 
of his admission during the height of the vietnam war 
im not looking for any medals and im not asking for a pat 
on the back but let me say this i served i served loyally and i 
served to the best of my ability quayle said 
the nbcjournal poll yielded some encouraging results for 
quayle sixtyfour percent said quayles military record should not 
be an issue in the campaign while 27 percent said it should also 
42 percent of registered voters approved of quayle as the gop vice 
presidential nominee 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were 
not sure 
dukakis made no mention of quayle as he traveled to washington 
to receive his endorsement from the aflcio in a speech to union 
members he promised new economic patriotism based on strong 
businesslabor relations 
the massachusetts governor conceded that more americans hold 
jobs than ever before but said lowpaying positions have been the 
legacy of the reagan administration and that average family income 
is no greater than it was 20 years ago 
thats the price our workers and their families are paying for 
voodoo economics he said in a speech in a hotel a few blocks 
from the white house 
bush campaigned with reagan for the first time since winning the 
republican nomination next week he sought to deflect attention 
away from the controversy over his running mate accusing dukakis 
of looking for a reason to veto massachusetts legislation 
requiring teachers to lead their students in recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance 
what is it about the pledge of allegiance that upsets him so 
much bush asked dukakis has said he vetoed the bill after 
receiving an advisory opinion from the state supreme court that the 
measure was unconstitutional 
reagan heaped praise on his vice president 
george bush is a man of action a man accustomed to 
command reagan told a rally at the hotel where the president is 
staying during a break from his california ranch vacation 
the vice presidency doesnt fit easily on such a man he 
said but george bush is also a patriot and so he made it fit 
and he served with a distinction no one has ever matched 
dukakis aide brountas said the massachusetts governor intends to 
go ahead with plans to be in annapolis on sept 14 the date 
selected by a bipartisan presidential commission for a debate on 
national security issues he said bushs decision not to debate 
before sept 20 threatens the full schedule of debates 
anticipated for the fall 
but baker said it was unlikely that bush could debate before 
sept 20 because the republican national convention concluded only 
last week 
aides to the two candidates are expected to open face to face 
negotiations on debates next week in washington 
the nbcjournal poll was conducted saturday through monday among 
1762 registered voters the harris poll friday through monday 
among 1310 likely voters both had error margins of plus or minus 
three points

a soviet fishing vessel collided with a 
panamanian freighter in the fog wednesday off the canadian coast 
the coast guard said 
there were no injuries said coast guard chief roy compton 
coast guard petty officer michael cobb said the freighter ocean 
fame took on water from a gash in its bow and proceeded under its 
own power to barkley sound on vancouver islands southwest coast 
canadian coast guard officials examined the freighter 
cobb said the soviet vessel irtyshsk remained in the vicinity 
of the collision and was unloading some of its diesel fuel to 
another soviet fishing boat 
the collision occurred about 630 am about 35 miles north of 
cape flattery wash and the coast guard cutter clover was at the 
scene the coast guard said 
the soviet vessel carried a crew of 120 the 500foot panamanian 
freighter which left vancouver on tuesday loaded with grain for 
japan had a crew of 18 
micheline brodeur of transport canada said she did not have 
details of the panamanian ships damage but added apparently 
there was some concern for a while that it would sink 
the canadian naval support vessel glendyne was to check any 
damage on the soviet boat she said the canadian marine casualty 
investigation branch would investigate the accident ms brodeur 
said 
a navy spokesman in seattle senior chief james jones declined 
to speculate on whether the soviet vessel was gathering 
intelligence on trident submarines based at the navys base at 
bangor 
in the past soviet vessels have parked outside the strait of 
juan de fuca to gather information about the nuclear submarines 
which must use the strait between coastal canada from washingtons 
olympic peninsula to reach the pacific ocean 
jones said the intelligencegathering ships usually are not 
disguised as fishing vessels and plainly display their radar towers 
and other monitoring devices

seasoned by some new more conservative members 
the us supreme court seems to be occasionally taking a more 
tolerant tack about religions place in public affairs 
this was indicated in several of the courts rulings in its 
198788 term notably in upholding inclusion of religious 
organizations in a federal program to fight teenage pregnancy and 
abortion 
in a time of soaring churchstate litigation the case was among 
a dozen of this kind handled in the high courts latest term 
the family life act of 1981 which critics derisively call the 
chastity law had been challenged as unconstitutionally 
advancing religion by funding religious as well as secular groups 
to foster sexual discipline among youths 
there are nearly a million teenage pregnancies annually in the 
united states with about half of them aborted 
under the law about a fourth of the 10 million spent annually 
under the act has gone to religious groups american civil 
liberties union and others charged this unconstitutionally promoted 
religion 
however in a 54 decision on the final day of the courts term 
june 30 it upheld the law saying congress may recognize the 
important part that religious organizations play in resolving 
certain secular problems 
such organizations arent barred from participating in 
publicly sponsored social welfare programs wrote chief justice 
william h rehnquist adding that any boost to religion was at 
most incidental 
justice harry a blackmun dissented saying government funds 
are paying for religious organization to teach and counsel 
impressionable adolescents on a highly senstive subject of 
considerable religious significance 
in another case that turned out favorably for religious groups 
the court let stand an illinois law exempting religious daycare 
centers from state regulations 
about 33 states have such laws churches provide the largest 
sponsorship of daycare centers in the nation 
the illinois supreme court had upheld a state law exempting 
churchrun centers from state regulations rejecting a challenge to 
it as violating the first amendment ban against establishing 
religion 
the high court left the ruling in place the state had argued 
that such exemptions enhanced churchstate separation by avoiding 
state inquiries into religious beliefs as would be required if the 
centers were state licensed 
another case of historic potential in upholding religious 
rights an 81 high court decision overruled a lower court decision 
and held the us roman catholic church had a right to appeal a 
contempt citation against it 
the contempt citation had been issued by a district court for 
the churchs refusal to produce a vast array of internal church 
records demanded in a lawsuit by a new york proabortion group 
it sought to have the internal revenue service revoke the entire 
churchs federal tax exemption on the ground that it had engaged in 
political activity opposing abortion 
most of the nations other major denominations protestant and 
eastern orthodox had sided with catholic church in opposing the 
attack on its tax exemption seeing it as a threat to all 
religious bodies 
another potentially major decision came when the high court 
ruled that former leaders of the new jersey legislature had no 
legal standing to appeal a lower court ruling that struck down the 
states moment of silence law 
the law required a oneminute period of silence for quiet and 
private contemplation or introspection in state public schools at 
the beginning of each school day more than 20 states have similar 
laws 
under challenges lower federal courts struck down the law as 
violating the religion nonestablishment clause legislative 
leaders appealed but later lost their positions and the high 
court said they had no standing to appeal that left basically 
unresolved the question of whether momentofsilence laws are 
constitutional 
two other churchstate cases involved claimed religious rights 
by american indians 
one of them them testing whether the ceremonial smoking of the 
hallucinogenic drug peyote is protected by the first amendments 
free exercise of religious clause was sent back to the oregon 
supreme court it now must decide if the practice violates oregon 
law 
in earlier proceedings the oregon high court held two state 
employees both american indians were entitled to unemployment 
compensation benefits following their firing for smoking the drug 
in religious ceremonies 
in another case the high court ruled that the federal 
government may complete a stretch of road through a 
governmentowned section of northwest california held sacred by 
three indian tribes 
among other churchstate cases the high court 
let stand a lower courts ruling that churches must comply with 
registration and disclosure requirements in a tennessee law 
regulating political activity in referendum campaigns 
declined to review another case in tennessee in which a federal 
appeals court held parents do not have a right to teach their 
children at home when required reading texts offend their religion

more blacks are appearing on prime time 
television shows and not just in stereotypical roles as cute kids 
domestic workers criminals and jivetalking comedians according 
to industry researchers and observers 
there has been an improvement in the employment of black 
performers and the range of character portrayals has improved 
said rodney mitchell affirmative action administrator for the 
screen actors guild no longer are they confined to street types 
nonprofessionals crime victims and crime perpetrators 
some credit the success of the cosby show for opening the 
doors to more positive black portrayals a recent howard university 
study of 58 black characters in 26 network shows last season found 
that instead of the lower class roles that dominated the 1970s 
blacks on television are generally portrayed as belonging to 
middle and upper classes 
women played nearly half of the black roles compared to 
previous years when men greatly outnumbered them the howard 
researchers reported the study also noted more middleage and 
elderly black characters fewer obese women and more characters 
portrayed as competent 
some things havent changed the howard scholars found blacks 
were still more likely to be cast in situation comedies than dramas 
and were most often supporting or minor characters more than half 
appeared in shows with black themes such as amen cosby 
227 and a different world 
black characters continue to be cast primarily in allblack 
settings wrote howard communication researchers carolyn stroman 
bishetta merritt and paula matabane yet there is a notable 
difference in that these allblack settings tend to be upscale 
middle class rather than low income 
a 1987 study by the center for media and public affairs in 
washington dc found that the number of black characters on tv 
rose slowly from 1955 to 1965 when only one in 20 was black and 
more rapidly since 1975 when one character in 11 has been black 
over the 31 years studied blacks played 6 percent of all roles 
the civil rights movement opened up attitudes said dan 
amundson study coauthor white audiences will watch black 
performers in a wide range of roles based on the quality of the 
show rather than the racial question 
sags mitchell credits union affirmative action pressures 
advocacy by minority rights groups and the success of blackthemed 
shows for the increasing number of roles and new shows such as 
franks place and in the heat of the night provided 
dramatic parts for blacks last season he said 
black viewers have become more important in the 1980s as overall 
network audiences dropped in competition with vcrs and cable but 
mitchell said he had never heard industry officials say they were 
improving black roles to attract more black viewers 
more blacks watch television than do other racial groupings 
according to nielsen audience data a recent nielsen viewing 
analysis reported that television usage averaged 106 hours per day 
in black households versus 73 hours daily in all other homes 
with just 11 percent of us television homes headed by blacks 
viewing patterns would have to change markedly to directly affect 
program portrayals said cbs television research vice president 
arnold becker 
even with more viewing theyre still a minority group in the 
tv audience said becker if blacks really viewed dramatically 
different programs than nonblacks then they would have a very 
substantial effect but they generally view not all that 
dissimilarly than the rest of the population 
becker instead of attributing gains in black roles to changing 
television economics said white americans were more receptive to 
mainstream black characters 
the attitude of the world toward blacks has changed he 
said people out there are predisposed to accept this kind of 
social change

matlock plot in knotts don knotts won five emmy statuettes 
as a deputy sheriff with a short fuse and brains to match the 
main comic element of the andy griffith show now starring as 
attorney matlock griffith came up with the idea of adding 
knotts to the cast where he will stay for about eight episodes 
the shows executive producer fred silverman said in the first 
episode of the new season knotts is introduced as a neighbor of 
matlock who becomes a client when hes accused of a crime perry 
mason would get him off but will matlock if they bring up all the 
trouble knotts caused as deputy barney fife the defense attorney

first came the clowns balloons cotton candy 
and coupons for free hamburgers 
then came the hidden fees 
the carnival atmosphere that was part of banks efforts to 
convince customers to use automated teller machines about a decade 
ago has turned strictly businesslike now that the era of 
hightech consumer banking has clearly caught on 
banks and savings and loans today charge anywhere from 10 cents 
to 3 for atm services such as cash withdrawals deposits 
transfers or balance inquiries compared with no fees and little 
freebies when the machines were first introduced 
financial institutions originaly installed atms because they 
were less costly than human tellers but theyre finding now that 
their expenses have risen sharply as more of their customers 
about a third on average or 60 million people nationwide 
regularly use atms through expanded regional state and national 
automated networks 
were providing a much expanded service 24 hours a day seven 
days a week in a lot of locations and thats pretty expensive 
robert w moyer chief executive officer of wilber national bank in 
oneonta ny said in defending the fees 
atm fees have become more evident in recent years the american 
bankers association the banking industrys biggest trade group 
says that about 25 percent of all banks charged for selected atm 
transactions in 1987 that compared with just a handful of banks in 
1980 and none the year before 
more recenlty bank network news a chicago newsletter randomly 
surveyed 29 big banks and found that in january 1987 about 55 
percent of them charged for atm use when polled in may about 70 
percent of those same banks imposed fees 
fee structures vary with some institutions charging more for 
withdrawals from checking accounts than savings and others waiving 
fees if balance thresholds are met 
banks charge the most for foreign transactions at atms owned 
by another bank but linked to a customers bank through a local or 
national network the aba estimates the cost of an atm transaction 
at foreign machines is between 57 cents and 66 cents vs 40 
cents to 56 cents for transactions at a banks own machine 
moyer who runs the small upstate new york bank said much of 
the expense stems from electronic switches when banks transfer 
funds to other banks to cover the withdrawals their customers make 
 
while many industry watchers say most atm fees are probably 
justified they point out that not all customers are aware of these 
charges 
consumers may not know in advance what the atm fees are they 
might show up in unusual debit entries with the endofthemonth 
statements explained robert k heady publisher of bank rate 
monitor a north palm beach fla newsletter 
ten years ago when banking institutions introduced automated 
teller machines they used clowns cotton candy and balloons to 
educate you now that the institutions have a captive audience 
theyre socking consumers with higher charges simply to know 
things like how much money they have in their accounts 
the aba says banks havent run into any major resistance from 
customers because of the fees 
in a recent report it noted the fees are user fees which 
means consumers can elect to pay the fee if they use the service 
and avoid the fee if they do not use atms 
aba encourages consumers to take advantage of the competitive 
environment by shopping for the blend of prices and services that 
they find most beneficial

when the countrys worst drought in half a 
century hit this summer desperate michigan farmers kept coop 
extension agent jim lecureauxs phone ringing 
many wanted to know about his tests of a lowcost irrigation 
system that also controls flooding and sharply boosts crop yields 
hard times have given lecureaux a ready audience for his pitch 
about the wonders of subirrigation 
its not a new concept its just being refined he said 
from the office of the huron county cooperative extension service 
which serves farmers in the tip of michigans fertile thumb region 
a wide peninsula jutting into lake huron 
in controlled studies last year subirrigated corn fields 
produced up to 60 more bushels an acre than nonirrigated fields 
lecureaux said 
this year sugar beets were added to the studies 
it sure helps in dry seasons said leroy kretzschmer who 
uses subirrigation on about 200 acres of the 1800acre farm he and 
his brothers operate near caseville it is one of two county sites 
where pilot studies are being conducted this year 
were kind of going littlebylittle now but eventually if 
this works out well irrigate more he said 
kretzschmer and lecureaux are part of a network of researchers 
agricultural agents and farmers who are finetuning an irrigation 
technique first used in 19th century europe 
subirrigation is a twophased water control system that uses 
underground pipes drainage ditches and pumps to keep just the 
right amount of moisture in the field 
the idea is very old said jim fouss a researcher at the 
us department of agricultures lab in baton rouge la a form of 
subirrigation was employed in new yorks central park in 1858 he 
said 
if the drainage system that you use during wet season can be 
used to put water back on then you essentially get it for free 
fouss said 
ironically subirrigation is a system for putting water into 
fields that once were considered too wet to farm 
about 100 million acres of us farmland need some kind of 
drainage in order to grow crops effectively according to fouss 
who is working to design computer rain forecasts to help run 
subirrigation systems 
typically the land is low and flat with a layer of bedrock or 
clay within a few feet of the surface creating a high water table 
the soil remains saturated from the spring rains and snowmelt 
often forcing farmers to put off planting until late in the growing 
season the same problem often occurs in the fall making it 
difficult or impossible to harvest the crops 
these soil conditions are common along the atlantic seaboard in 
the ohio mississippi and missouri river basins and in portions of 
the great lakes region including michigans thumb 
but as quickly as farmers installed underground drainage on 
their land they began encountering another problem drought 
farmers in georgia and the carolinas ran into this problem when 
largescale drainage projects went in 40 to 50 years ago said 
claude phene a us department of agriculture scientist in fresno 
calif who did early subirrigation research while working at a 
usda lab in florence sc 
farmers who installed underground drain pipes to remove enough 
water in order to plant in the spring often would find their crops 
parched for water by summer but by damming up some of the runoff 
in the drainage ditches they found they could put water back into 
their fields through the same pipes 
by hit or miss farmers discovered that by conserving a certain 
amount of water in drainage ditches they could maintain proper 
moisture in the plants root zones during drier summer weather as 
water flowed back into the fields 
in prolonged dry weather however drainage ditches couldnt 
hold enough water to keep the soil moist so some farmers began 
pumping water into the ditches from streams or wells 
because of the expense of installing miles of heavy tile pipes 
subirrigation made sense only for highvalue crops such as 
vegetables now with the development of lighter plastic piping and 
laserguided installation equipment the system has became feasible 
for use on field crops as well fouss said 
its not a major irrigation practice yet but its grown quite 
a bit in the last 10 years phene said the appeal of 
subirrigation he said isnt so much that it raises yields but 
rather that it smooths the ups and downs 
we want consistent production a sustainable yield were not 
trying for the maximum yield said george merva of michigan state 
university who is conducting research on the most effective water 
levels for subirrigating corn and soy beans 
he and other researchers say it isnt yet clear how widely 
subirrigation can profitably be applied 
although this years drought has had disastrous consequences for 
many farmers it might also prod some into seeking greater 
independence from natural rainfall lecureaux said 
this year farmers are willing to listen 
if youre looking for a teachable moment he said youve 
got her

george bush took a dive off the deep end when he 
pledged to create 30 million jobs over the next eight years 
independent economists and even republican advisers are saying 
the wildly optimistic commitment may have been a mathematical 
error or it may have been sheer exuberance 
either way though bushs pledge seems to have been made 
without much thought to what could be the sleeper issue of the 
1990s labor shortages 
neither party has come to terms with the implications of the 
ongoing baby bust says ben wattenberg senior fellow at the 
american enterprise institute and author of a 1987 book the 
birth dearth pharos books 
the annual birth rate per 1000 women has fallen from 23 in 1960 
to 15 last year and is projected to fall farther to 13 in the year 
2000 
given those figures the united states would be hardpressed to 
find people to fill even 20 million new jobs in the next eight 
years unless of course it opened the doors to massive 
immigration which seems unlikely 
the lack of a substantial number of young people coming into 
the labor force will create major economic dislocations which can 
cause great trouble in employment markets wattenberg said 
wednesday 
weve never lived through something like this in this country 
weve always been growing growing growing and i think its a 
serious problem he said 
while public policies have not done much to cope with labor 
shortages businesses have already been forced to respond 
creatively 
businesses are massively increasing onthejob training because 
they cant hire people with the skills they need in some cases 
the skills in question are simple reading writing and arithmetic 
the fastfood industry is hiring retirees and busing workers 
from inner cities to restaurants in laborshort suburbs coming 
soon are robots that will flip hamburgers stuff burritos and 
spread pizza dough 
kelly services inc offers free training on computers no 
strings attached if you train an individual they do develop a 
certain loyalty to you said thomas anton kellys executive vice 
president 
labor shortages are most apparent in fields such as food service 
and baby sitting but equally critical perhaps more so are the 
shortages of qualified people at the highest ranks of the labor 
force engineers for example 
thirty percent of the electronics industrys engineers are 
immigrants according to the national academy of engineering if 
they chose to stop coming perhaps because of improving 
opportunities in their home countries such as china india and 
ireland this nation would be in a severe quandary 
the problems of a low birth rate are compounded by societal 
problems that have left millions of citizens unable or sometimes 
unwilling to take on the challenges of the job market 
with more than 500 jobs open in new york citys furniture 
industry only 60 people are enrolled in classes at the nonprofit 
furniture training institute in the borough of queens 
people in the city are not being connected with careers that 
actually exist al miller executive vice president of the 
federal employment and guidance service told the new york times 
recently 
better education training and social support especially for 
disadvantaged minorities would obviously help the labor shortage 
but in the long run nothing would help more than a higher birth 
rate 
thats where wattenbergs political proposal comes in to 
encourage more births through education allowances child 
allowances more generous maternal leave better child care 
wattenberg has been faulted for pushing women to have more 
babies but he says the criticism is unfair 
i just want to make it easier for people to have the option to 
do what they want there are a substantial number of people who 
would like to have children but its getting damn hard these 
days

like other 40yearolds sunday nights 
emmy awards is fighting to stay youthful 
while liposuction has yet to be contemplated the 40th annual 
prime time emmy awards are being produced this year by someone 
who has built a career out of spoofing the very medium the emmys 
are intended to celebrate 
lorne michaels as the creator and original producer of nbcs 
saturday night live has excelled at trashing television from 
top to bottom from biting gameshow and newscast parodies to 
scathing highway patrol and ozzie and harriet sendups 
but can michaels satirize the emmys themselves 
well this show wont take itself too seriously michaels 
said 
if the emmy telecast carried live by the fox broadcasting co 
at 8 pm edt has suffered in the past it has sprung from its 
unerring aptitude for boredom last years ceremony at four 
hours was just 20 seconds shy of qualifying for a miniseries 
michaels said too many awards are handed out at the emmys 
that he cant change so in trying to make the show 
entertaining what ive tried to do is strip it down to its core 
the awards and make that go as quickly as possible and then try 
to weave the entertainment parts through it 
michaels promised there would not be any production numbers 
per se whatever that means and he said he would try to 
squeeze some comedy into the usually dull governors award given 
this year to animators william hanna and joseph barbera 
michaels a sixtime emmy winner will be joined in the control 
booth at the pasadena civic auditorium by dave wilson the longtime 
saturday night live director and he plans to use several 
celebrities including mary tyler moore dick van dyke danny 
devito and michael j fox as hosts rather than depend on an 
individual 
its hard to say if another new emmy twist is serious or not in 
one of the stranger moves in emmy lore this years emmy statuette 
normally cast in gold pewter and iron is being played by a person 
the human emmy is norwegian actress benedikte handal 
we talked to over a hundred women before we found benedikte 
handal said lewis goldstein a vice president of offair 
promotion for fox broadcasting she had the ethereal quality we 
were looking for 
handal is being used in national television advertisements for 
the awards broadcast and her ethereal qualities will also be 
displayed in posters and newspaper spots plugging the show 
handal will not however be handed out to award winners 
the closer emmy races this year revolve around nbcs hot drama 
series la law and cbs newcomer beauty and the beast 
for the second year in a row la law gathered more 
nominations 19 than any other television program the series will 
be competing for best drama series best actor in a drama series 
for michael tucker and corbin bernsen and best actress in a drama

beauty and the beast an improbable hit about a love affair 
between an attorney and a hulking hairy denizen of manhattans

for the secondmost nominations with 12 apiece

collected just one nomination for a guest performance by eileen 
heckart its spinoff a different world the second most 
popular show had none 
for the first time in emmy history cable television programs 
are eligible for trophies although chances are slim that any cable 
show will emerge with that strong a showing 
the cable shows drew 15 of the 337 nominations their first time 
out home box office and showtime each collected six nominations 
the disney channel drew two and turner broadcasting system had one 
among the cable companies best chances for an emmy are best

white children in san diego face only about half 
the risk of getting the most serious form of diabetes as finnish 
children suggests new research that found an inexplicable 17fold 
difference in risk across 14 nations 
the risk of insulindependent diabetes runs generally generally 
higher in cooler climates said researchers who are studying such 
differences for clues to the far more basic question of what causes 
insulindependent diabetes 
the disease occurs because the insulinproducing cells of the 
pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the bodys 
immune system the 1 million americans with it must inject 
themselves with insulin every day to stay alive otherwise sugar 
will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart 
and kidney disease blindness and nerve damage 
genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune systems 
attack the vast majority of people who develop insulindependent 
diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease 
however most people with the susceptible genetic background do 
not develop diabetes and the geographic variation in rates is 
evidence of an environmental role said ronald laporte associate 
professor in the epidemiology department at the university of 
pittsburgh 
studies also suggest that rates for american children younger 
than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976 which argues for a 
change in the environment said james warram of the joslin diabetes 
center in boston 
what could this environmental factor be 
viral infections are one theory since viruses show seasonal and 
temperature preferences as does insulindependent diabetes diet is 
another proposed trigger with some support from animal studies 
the question is complicated because the immune system starts 
attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes 
symptoms so any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in 
the past said jerome i rotter of cedarssinai medical center in 
los angeles 
rotter also said much of the geographic difference in rates may 
be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in 
various populations rather than just environmental causes 
geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an 
international team of scientists who compared insulindependent 
diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries their 
work appears in the august issue of the journal diabetes 
rates ranged from 17 cases per 100000 personyears in 
hokkaido japan to 295 cases per 100000 personyears in finland 
a personyear is like a manhour it represents the equivalent of 
following one person for one year 
within the united states the rates per 100000 personyears 
also showed variation 94 in san diego 114 in jefferson county 
ala 134 in allegheny county penn 151 in colorado 178 in 
north dakota and 208 in rochester 
those figures are not adjusted for ethnic differences which 
play a role because whites have higher rates than nonwhites for 
example figures for white children only give a rate of 138 for 
san diego and 169 for jefferson county north dakotas rises to 
203 and rochesters dips to 206 
the studys overall variation was most pronounced for children 
younger than 5 suggesting the unknown environmental agent may 
exert more influence in that population said laporte it seems 
to be affecting the youngest children the most whatever it is

other contract months also declined wholesale heating oil for 
october dropped 079 cent a gallon to 4467 cents a gallon 
analysts said tuesdays energy futures market was influenced by 
trader expectations that the apis weekly report released after 
the close of trading would show higher inventories of oil 
products particularly oil 
the report indicated that while stocks of gasoline and 
distillates rose last week crude oil inventories declined by 
nearly 43 million barrels

awaiting fresh news affecting supply and demand and particularly 
developments involving the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries they say 
last week the united nations intervened to stop the fighting

beatrice co is looking for a new chairman and 
donald p kelly may be in the market for some new corporate 
dealmaking 
kelly a reknowned takeover artist is resigning as beatrices 
chairman the company announced tuesday as the company moves 
further from megabuck wheeling and dealing to focus on running its 
three main foodmaking companies 
frederick b rentschler 49 beatrices president and chief 
executive officer since june 1987 will continue running the 
privatelyheld company on a daily basis 
kelly 66 still will play a role as a director and major 
investor in beatrice but several analysts see his resignation 
effective oct 1 as a sign kelly wants to deal himself back into 
the highstakes game of corporate mergers and acquisitions 
i think kelly was put on this earth to do deals and i think 
his leaving just reflects that he wants to get back in the game 
said john mcmillin a food industry analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
mcmillin noted that beatrice also is losing two key managers 
brought on board by kelly js corcoran 45 senior vice 
president of finance and william e reidy 57 senior vice 
president of strategic planning 
the fact that he took his top financial guy and his top 
operating guy with him indicates to me that theyll be looking for 
another company to run mcmillin said kelly likes to play 
poker kelly likes to do deals hes not going to florida to retire 
and play golf 
liz sode beatrices vice president of corporate relations said 
kelly was not available for comment tuesday she also said she did 
not know and would not speculate on his future plans 
in a statement released by the company kelly said we have 
helped shape beatrice into a successful highly focused 
topquality consumer products company and accomplished this at a 
faster pace than we had originally planned today our operating 
units have better market shares and better overall operating 
profits than before a 62 billion leveraged buyout engineered by 
kelly in 1986 
reporting directly to renstschler will be the chiefs of 
beatrices three major foodmaking companies albert j crosson 
president and chief executive officer of beatrice huntwesson inc 
lee o lochmann president and chief executive officer of 
swifteckrich inc and robert h burns president and chief 
executive officer of beatrice cheese inc 
this transition from don to fred really is in keeping with 
beatrices focus as an operating company now and with the fact that 
its no longer going to be involved in restructuring and 
acquisitions ms sode said dons forte of course has been 
in the dealmaking 
the 1986 leveraged buyout that took beatrice private with 
financial backing from the new york investment firm of kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co was one of the biggest such deals in us 
corporate history 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with the target companys cash flow 
or with money raised by the sale of its assets 
since the buyout beatrice has sold more than 7 billion in 
assets including its tropicana products fruit juice division 
beatrice international eii holdings inc group of companies and 
its bottled water division 
the company still produces such products as hunt tomato sauce 
orville redenbacher popcorn la choy oriental foods butterball 
turkeys and county line cheeses 
kelly was chairman president and chief executive of esmark 
which made swift meats and huntwesson products when it was 
acquired by beatrice in 1984 after a bidding war with kohlberg 
kravis he then left to form his own company before turning the 
tables and negotiating the beatrice buyout in 1986 for a total 
purchase price and financing of 84 billion the company said 
in the fiscal year ended feb 29 beatrice had net sales of 
401 billion but reported a loss from continuing operations of 
105 million because of remaining debt from the buyout ms sode 
said

the surprise announcement that donald p kelly 
will leave the chairmans post at beatrice co is no reason for 
managers to breathe any easier at companies in need of turnarounds 
kellys personal war chest garnered from sharp dealmaking 
golden parachutes and willing lenders virtually guarantees that 
hell resurface on the takeover scene before long experts say 
for a man who orchestrated one of the biggest leveraged buyouts 
in us corporate history kelly 66 is likely to keep doing what 
he does best turning deals 
it sounds to me as if don is regrouping to try to do 
something new said ronald morrow a managing director at smith 
barney harris upham amp co its been widely speculated that don 
wants to start a new dealmaking company 
kellys resignation from beatrice effective oct 1 was 
announced tuesday 
observers had been expecting kelly to spin off part of beatrice 
as a vehicle for acquisitions particularly after last months 
announcement that for the first time since the 62 billion buyout 
that took beatrice private in 1986 the company was not for sale 
but kelly may not need an operations base dons track record 
will carry with him wherever he goes said john bierbusse an 
analyst with ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
he is regarded as a very savvy individual and companies 
kelly may have targeted can be nervous about him bierbusse 
said 
and who wouldnt be concerned about a man who once said he gets 
more nervous about a 6foot putt than a billiondollar deal 
under kellys leadership beatrice sold off some 7 billion in 
assets from tropicana juice and international playtex units to a 
cocacola bottler to max factor cosmetics 
but rumors have been circulating that kelly has had a falling 
out with kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the aggressive new york 
buyout firm that backed his beatrice deal as bierbusse sees it a 
conflict may have arisen over whether to sell what remained of 
beatrice as a whole or in parts 
if i wanted to go it alone i could probably raise a lot of 
money without kkr kelly told fortune magazine last month but 
i believe that don kelly always needs someone of equal or greater 
power than he 
short on modesty and highbrow education but long on instinct 
kelly was raised on chicagos roughandtumble south side starting 
work at a gas station when he was barely a teenager 
kelly a onetime navy torpedoman was known as a quick decision 
maker as he worked his way up the corporate ladder at swift amp co 
while traveling the country as many as 50 weeks out of the year for 
swift kelly built relationships with the rankandfile over 
countless beers and cups of coffee 
he knew he could get the benefit of 50 years experience at 
swift just by sitting in a tavern with an employee he told 
fortune 
by 1977 kelly was raking in a sixfigure salary as chief 
executive of the food conglomerate esmark inc the new name for 
swift which he skillfully pruned and pared when esmark was 
acquired by beatrice in 1984 kelly was believed to have made as 
much as 20 million 
two years later kelly won his own battle for chicagobased 
beatrice backed by kohlberg kravis kelly took the company private 
in a 62 billion deal made under the premise that the whole was 
worth less than its parts 
kelly then formed eii holdings inc a conglomerate made up of 
beatrice subsidiaries with the intention that it would buy and 
sell other companies through leveraged transactions but eii was 
acquired by american brands inc for 27 billion earlier this year 
after eii made a bid to take over that company 
proceeds from the eii sale were estimated to have put 50 
million in kellys pocket in addition to a golden parachute 
severance agreement valued at about 25 million 
kelly was unavailable to comment on his future plans but as he 
told fortune i can be very convincing and very hard to change 
when i get going on something i get going like a freight train 
 
observers are certain of only one thing as one put it he 
aint gonna retire

polaroid corp says it discussed 
increasing an employee stock ownership plan long before there was 
any whisper of a takeover bid from roy e disneys shamrock 
holdings inc 
shamrock a california investment firm owned by the disney 
family claimed in a lawsuit filed in july that polaroid improperly 
increased an employee stock ownership plan from 5 percent to 14 
percent to help thwart an unwanted acquisition 
carolyn berger a vice chancellor of delawares court of 
chancery scheduled hearings for oct 1925 on shamrocks suit to 
halt the expansion a court clerk said tuesday 
cambridgebased polaroid is a delawarechartered corporation 
delawares takeover law prohibits acquirers who obtain 15 percent 
of a companys stock from completing a takeover for three years 
unless they have approval from the targets board of directors or 
acquire at least 85 percent of the targets stock 
richard f delima polaroids vice president and secretary said 
tuesday the companys board of directors had considered increasing 
the size of the esop after it first was approved in march 
by the time of the july board meeting we were aware of 
shamrocks interest in the company and were thoughtful about 
whether our plans for the esop might be interfered with he said 
delima said that in the period between the esops approval and 
its increase polaroids board determined it could increase the 
size of the stock issue to 10 million shares with relatively 
modest reductions in pay and benefits 
on aug 16 polaroid rejected a sweetened takeover proposal from 
shamrock of 40 per share and 40 percent of any settlement in 
polaroids 57 billion patent infringement case against eastman 
kodak co 
shamrock which owns 69 percent of polaroid contends polaroid 
increased the number of shares in the stock issue after getting 
wind of its bid 
the increased esop was announced july 12 as part of a 
reorganization that included the 300 million stock purchase plan 
up to 800 layoffs and entry into the conventional film market 
polaroid last week announced it was targeting 1500 early 
retirements in a streamlining effort aimed at fighting the takeover 
one wall street securities analyst said that because employees 
who own the stock can decide whether to sell their shares a 
hostile takeover of polaroid technically is not impossible despite 
the 14 percent employee control 
as a practical matter it really does make it harder said 
the analyst who asked not to be named the legal fiction is that 
each employee is an individual stockholder they can play the 
arbitrage business too

texas oil producers and politicians say the repeal 
of the federal windfall profits tax is only the first step needed 
to help revive the oil and gas industry 
financial incentives for exploration and to keep marginally 
producing wells in operation also are needed oilmen say 
the landmark trade bill president reagan signed into law tuesday 
in california included the repeal of the eightyearold windfall 
profits tax on oil companies 
john e watson president of the texas independent producers and 
royalty owners association said the trade group had fought for 
repeal since the tax was signed into law in 1980 
the windfall profits tax was enacted in exchange for the 
phaseout of price controls on domestic oil congress was 
attempting to recapture some of the money oil companies were 
expected to make when prices increased after full decontrol began 
in 1981 
about 773 billion in taxes have been collected since it was 
imposed 
although low oil prices have kept oil companies from paying much 
windfall profits tax during the past 2 years oil producers still 
have had to certify their production and report it to the internal 
revenue service watson said 
the base crude oil price upon which the tax is levied is between 
19 and 20 a barrel for independent producers watson said crude 
oil sold for about 15 a barrel tuesday 
of course when youre not paying any tax and it gets 
repealed its not going to have a whole lot of immediate monetary 
effect on you watson said some accounting work will be taken 
off our back hopefully 
both us senators from texas democratic vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen and republican phil gramm played prominent 
roles in the effort to repeal the tax 
it is in fact the first positive step congress has taken on 
oil in a decade gramm said in a telephone interview tuesday 
they oil companies wont have to figure in this confiscatory 
tax in figuring their benefits 
but watson said that to further help the beleaguered oil and gas 
industry federal financial incentives are needed for marginal and 
stripper wells 
stripper wells generally produce less than 10 barrels of oil a 
day wells are considered marginal if production is low in 
comparison to the amount of revnue obtained watson said 
he also tax credits are needed for exploratory wells 
major oil companies fared well in the last quarter said watson 
whose organization includes about 4000 independent producers and 
royalty owners 
independents on the other hand are still struggling theyre 
still falling by the wayside he said 
gramm said the oil industry has continued to pay an estimated 
100 million in complying with the tax rules during each of the 
past two years even though oil companies have paid only small 
amounts of the actual tax 
the federal government has spent about 15 million each of the 
past two years for paperwork overseeing the tax he said 
gramm said other measures including tax incentives to spur 
drilling and deregulation of gas prices are still needed to boost 
the industry

prices of fed cattle are topping 70 per 
hundredweight in late august up sharply from 66 in july says the 
agriculture department 
the recent price strength reflects tighter supplies of 
finished fattened cattle stronger export demand and continued 
brisk movement at retail the departments economic research 
service said tuesday 
in all cattle slaughter in august may rise only 8 percent from 
july although there are two additional working days this month 
which would suggest as much as a 10 percent increase from july the 
agency reported 
cow slaughter has begun picking up the report said 
however this appears to be a seasonal movement of beef cows off 
grass pasture rather than a forced drought movement 
there had been an increase in cow slaughter earlier this summer 
as some producers in the droughtstricken northern plains and in 
the lakes states were forced to send beef and dairy cows to market 
because of feed shortages 
in many cases however quality breeding animals have been 
purchased by producers in other areas where feed is available thus 
forestalling massive selloffs of herds 
according to federal inspection reports the slaughter of beef 
cows this year through the first week in august totaled about 189 
million head down 9 percent from the same period in 1987 airy cow 
slaughter at 166 million head dropped 3 percent 
prices of fed cattle in the southern great plains are selling 
for more than 70 per 100 pounds of live weight in late august up 
from 66 in july the report said 
beef from cows goes mainly into hamburger and processing while 
grainfed steers and heifers provide the highergrade cuts found in 
supermarkets 
looking at pork the report said weekly slaughter is expected to 
increase sharply in september pushing prices down 
meanwhile hot weather has disrupted marketings and slowed 
weight gains of hogs that has lent some support to an otherwise 
weak market this summer the report said 
wholesale prices of dressed broiler chickens in early august 
remained around 70 cents a pound well above the 53 cents of a year 
earlier prices should average around 61 to 65 cents a pound during 
the third quarter the report said

the agriculture department says farmers have 
developed conservation plans for protecting 54 million acres of 
highly erodible cropland about 38 percent of the 143 million acres 
targeted for protection by the 1985 farm law 
wilson scaling chief of the soil conservation service said 
tuesday that plans have been put into effect on 17 million acres 
or about 12 percent of the affected land 
under the 1985 law farmers who raise crops on highly erodible 
land must have a conservation plan approved by dec 31 1989 and 
implement it fully by dec 31 1994 to remain eligible for usda 
program benefits 
we are on target for meeting the 1989 deadline scaling 
said we hope to have 65 percent of the plans completed by the 
end of 1988 and the remaining 35 percent completed by the end of 
1989 
however scaling cautioned farmers not to wait until the last 
minute to request technical assistance from scs because they might 
have a long wait

figgie international which moved its 
corporate headquarters to suburban richmond in 1982 is returning 
to cleveland a newspaper reported today 
cleveland councilman john e barnes told the richmond 
timesdispatch that the company will build a new headquarters on 
600 acres of cityowned land just outside cleveland in warrensville 
township figgie will buy the land from city barnes said 
there are several reasons for figgies decision to leave 
richmond barnes told the newspaper cleveland is within 500 
miles of nearly 60 percent of the nations population it is a 
strategic location and it is hot for development now 
the move will add at least 1500 jobs to the cleveland area and 
possibly as many as 15000 when operations are at full steam 
barnes said 
officials in henrico county where figgie bought 1500 acres in 
1982 said they had done everything they could to persuade the 
company to stay 
im sorry to see them leave said supervisor richard w 
glover certainly wed like to have them here i think theyre 
quite an asset to henrico county but the land stays here im sure 
that there will be others to come and im sure that there will be 
others to go 
figgie officials could not be reached for comment tuesday night 
a news conference was scheduled for 3 pm today in cleveland to 
make a formal announcement of the move barnes said 
harry e figgie jr chairman and chief executive officer had 
said in april that the company moved to richmond from its former 
headquarters in willoughby ohio because of the virginia citys 
stable labor climate good general business conditions and access 
to transportation systems he said there would have to be an 
economic reason to move back to ohio 
revenues in 1987 for the diversified company which makes a 
range of products from baseballs to fire trucks were a record 
102 billion up 11 percent from 1986 its 1987 profits were 493 
million up from 424 million in 1986 sales in the first quarter 
of this year increased 12 percent over the same period last year 
the paper reported that sources said tax advantages lured the 
company to move to cleveland 
i would think its more than some tax abatement said paul 
ellsworth president of the metropolitan richmond chamber of 
commerce citing the expense of moving there have to be a lot of 
issues 
henrico supervisors said they had not known of the impending 
move until last night and did not know if the company intends to 
sell its virginia property

about 300 longshoremen protesting the 
use of nonunion labor to load explosives onto a military ship have 
been ordered to return to work by a federal judge 
a temporary restraining order was issued tuesday by us 
district judge howell w melton against members of international 
longshoremans association local 1408 who had refused to return to 
work at blount island until the ship left port 
charles spencer president of the ila local said the workers 
would immediately comply with the judges order 
the court order was requested by the jacksonville maritime 
association which represented the owners of four ships filled with 
hondas mazdas isuzus and subarus waiting to be unloaded by the 
ila 
the union had refused to unload the ships to protest the use of 
nonunion labor by florida transportation services inc of fort 
lauderdale to load explosives on a military ship 
a similar work stoppage occurred on june 20 when the union 
refused to work when the same company unloaded explosives from 
another military ship 
the union claimed the use of nonunion labor to handle the 
explosives was unsafe because the workers were inexperienced in 
handling the devices 
the judges injunction will remain in effect until sept 2 when 
the union and the maritime association will meet in his courtroom 
the judge asked the two parties to try and work out their 
differences by that time 
the next scheduled work by florida transportation is sept 8 
when it will unload explosives from a ship

kids are changing in japan appearing to lose 
interest in some of the worlds most timeless creatures bugs 
purveyors of insects say modern entertainments like computer games 
have slowed their sales to a crawl 
this has been a terrible year for sales said mitsuo otsuka 
manager of the insect corner at tokyos takashimaya department 
store 
otsuka said the store used to sell 380 to 480 worth of insects 
on a good sunday now were lucky if we can sell half that 
much he said 
in rural japan the sight of a child with net out to nab a 
cicada or dragonfly is common but in the city otsuka and other 
bug salesmen say hopping insects are no match for modern diversions 
its computer games kids are more interested in machines 
these days otsuka said 
even so he said takashimaya expects to sell about 6000 worth 
of bugs this year 
the bughunting season in japan hits its peak in early july and 
lasts through august rural children collect the bugs near their 
homes and keep them in plastic cages sold at local pet stores the 
children also are encouraged to bring their bugs to school where 
they are studied in science classes 
no one knows when the summer pastime began among japanese 
children but ancient scrolls contain pictures of people keeping 
bugs in their homes 
to city kids the hunting ground is often the rooftops of 
department stores like takashimaya where such exotic creatures as 
the coleopteran cricket and stag beetle are easy prey for the 
right price 
a clerk at the tokyu department stores pet shop said she had 
sold a 3inch male stag beetle for 770 early this month but 
only insectcrazy adults buy those bugs not kids 
a mediumrange item she said was a pair of smaller stag 
beetles the beetles which came with a plastic cage dirt and a 
few slices of rotting eggplant were priced at 77 
its a real buy she said until yesterday the price was 
15000 yen 115 
otsuka said takashimaya doesnt sell pricey insects anymore and 
relies on the smaller stag beetles the homoeogryllus japanicus or 
bellringing insect and the coleopteran or atlas beetle most of 
otsukas insects were selling for 154 to 460 
the male atlas beetle is the most popular with the kids 
because its horns are shaped like a samurai helmet he said 
referring to the ancient japanese warriors 
when i was a child growing up in tokyo they didnt sell bugs 
in department stores said otsuka who has been in charge of 
takashimayas bugs for the past 10 years but children now have 
less chance to see insects in their natural environment its very 
sad to think that they have lost interest

the european economic community 
wednesday reiterated it will defend its international trade rights 
if these are damaged by the us trade bill president ronald reagan 
has signed into law 
eec external relations commissioner willy de clercq said in a 
statement the bill confirmed a us tendency to interpret 
international trading rules unilaterally 
the community stands ready to defend its legitimate interests 
each time these are threatened by unilateral measures by us 
authorities on the basis of the trade bill he said 
de clercq said he would seek an adequate eec response to the 
bill when the eec foreign ministers meet here sept 26 
de clercq said the eec had trade rights in the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade the international trade organization and 
that it will defend them if necessary 
president reagan signed the trade bill into law on tuesday 
among others things it gives us negotiators more bargaining 
room at international trade talks boosts us ability to fight 
restrictive trade policies of other nations and allows the 
president to block foreign investments if these are seen to impair 
us national security 
the eec objects to portions of the bill including a section 
raising retaliatory powers in trade and to the extension for two 
years of the export enhancement program the program pays surplus 
farm commodities from government bins to exporters to boost 
overseas sales the program has a price tag of 25 billion 
a commission spokesman said the eec will check on a 
casebycase basis to see how the bill is implemented but we first 
want a reaction from the member states 
he noted that the bills contents clashed with president 
reagans strong views on free trade guarantees 
the president signed the bill and in a speech acknowledged 
it could lead to an import fee that would be illegal according to 
international law and inconsistent with our goal of moving toward a 
free world trade 
in his statement de clercq said the united states had declared 
at the toronto summit of industrialized nations in june that 
nations must continue to resist protectionism and the temptation 
to adopt unilateral measures 
the eec also was party to the declaration

detroits two major daily newspapers are asking 
their six unions to support an attempt to overturn a 30day stay 
blocking implementation of the joint operating agreement 
the detroit free press and the detroit news on tuesday asked the 
unions which originally opposed the partial merger to sign briefs 
asking us district judge george revercomb in washington dc to 
overturn the decision 
revercomb is to hold a hearing sept 8 
the unions represent 80 percent of the 4200 employees at both 
papers union officials were mixed on whether they would comply 
with the papers request 
i imagine were probably going to sign it unless theres 
something in there we really cant agree with said joel wilson 
president of mailers union local 2040 
im against it the way that thing is worded said donald 
kummer administrative officer of the newspaper guild of detroit 
robert hall free press general manager said the threepage 
brief says the papers are convinced that the free press is in 
probable danger of financial failure 
former us attorney general edwin meese iii approved a joint 
operating agreement between the two newspapers aug 8 
on aug 17 us district judge joyce hens green issued an order 
blocking the partial merger saying there was a strong likelihood 
joa opponents could have meeses decision overturned 
knightridder inc which owns the free press has said it would 
close the paper if the joa is denied under the plan the free 
press and news would combine some business functions but maintain 
separate editorial staffs

grand metropolitan plc said wednesday it purchased 
a 45 percent stake in irish distillers group plc as part of a 
hostile attempt to acquire irelands largest distiller 
working through the subsidiary gcampc brands ltd grand met 
offered 253 million irish punts or about 354 million for irish 
distillers late last week but irish distillers board rejected the 
offer on monday 
the new bid made following gcampcs restructuring last week as a 
wholly owned subsidiary of grand met replaces a 278 million offer 
made by gcampc in may gcampc originally was controlled by a 
threeparty consortium which also included guinness plc and 
alliedlyons plc 
the original offer attracted only 2034 percent of irish 
distillers shares before protests by the european commission 
forced the consortium to disband 
ec officials said the consortium had decided in advance to split 
up irish distillers markets and brands which would violate the 
communitys competition law

the nations trade deficit for the second quarter posted the 
biggest improvement in more than five years narrowing by 149 
percent the government reported today 
the news boosted the dollar on world currency markets the us 
currency was quoted at around 13435 japanese yen shortly after the 
release of the trade figure up from 13411 yen late tuesday in new 
york 
the dollar had surged tuesday in spite of continued efforts by 
major central banks to restrain it 
the commerce department said a record level of us exports and 
the first quarterly decline in imports in three years pushed the 
deficit down to 299 billion in the second quarter 
the secondquarter trade gap was down from an imbalance of 352 
billion in the first three months of the year both quarters 
represented improvements from a record deficit of 412 billion in 
the fourth quarter of last year 
the 149 percent narrowing in the deficit represented its 
biggest decline since the fourth quarter of 1982 when the 
imbalance fell by 189 percent 
the new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown 
up in the departments monthly merchandise trade reports the 
earlier figures showed a 128 percent drop in the deficit to 326 
billion in the second quarter compared to 374 billion in the 
first quarter 
the droughts impact on consumers was reflected by a government 
report tuesday that indicated grocery prices jumped by 14 percent 
during july the biggest monthly increase since early 1984 
although it showed little evidence of accelerating inflation 
elsewhere in the economy 
excluding food overall retail prices rose just 03 percent for 
the month slower than the pace of the first half of 1987 the 
labor department reported tuesday 
the report reassured bond investors wary of inflationary 
pressures sparking a mild rally in the credit markets the price 
of the treasurys 30year bond one indicator of inflationary 
speculation rose about 5 for every 1000 in face value as its 
yield fell to 938 percent from 945 percent late monday 
wall street failed to follow the bond market and finished 
little changed amid low trading volume the dow jones average of 30 
industrials which fell 2578 points on monday to reach its lowest 
level in nearly three months dipped another 089 point to close at 
198933 
the government also reported that orders for big ticket 
durable goods plunged ny 7 percent in july the biggest drop in 
four years primarily due to huge declines in orders for cars and 
to decreased military purchases 
the decline had been anticipated after durablegoods orders 
skyrocketed 87 percent in june the biggest monthly increase in 
more than six years 
in another report the labor department said americans average 
weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation climbed 06 percent 
in july the best showing since a 12 percent increase in april 
the inflation report indicated that including the 
droughtrelated price spikes for food which accounts for about 
onesixth of peoples spending consumer prices rose 04 percent 
in july an annual rate of 52 percent 
despite all the talk about inflationary pressures its very 
difficult to find much in the way of evidence of it even with this 
huge increase for food said sandra shaber an economist for the 
futures group a washington consulting firm 
the higher food prices from the four months of dry weather in 
the farm belt had been anticipated and if anything analysts were 
surprised that they were not bigger 
the 14 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 96 
percent jump in egg costs a 74 percent boost for poultry and a 
47 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables

the dow jones average of 30 industrials which slipped 089 on

long after explorers charted their course by 
stars or compass a computer software pioneer has literally mapped 
out a product and a business strategy that is guiding his company 
to success 
the 3yearold company is mapinfo corp which sells a software 
package that allows the personal computer user to merge databases 
and digital maps of areas within the united states 
with a couple of keystrokes the user can place the cursor at a 
point on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access to 
volumes of information about that point 
mapinfo can search a database for points within a boundary 
determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address 
users can focus in on a 52foot span of a city block or zoom out to 
a 5000mile range 
that may not sound like anything new says mapinfo president 
sean osullivan with a smile but his young company claims to be 
no1 in desktop mapping in fact he says there isnt even any 
competition yet 
these kinds of capabilities have been available on 
minicomputers and mainframes before but its never been made so 
that the common person can use it or its never been priced so that 
the common person can afford it said osullivan who developed 
the company with three other students of rensselaer polytechnic 
institute in 1985 
while some might view mapinfos product as competition for 
mapping via larger computers it can also complement those methods 
says thomas delaney manager in ibms geographic and mapping 
products department in kingston ny 
ibm is on mapinfos list of customers and is also a competitor 
the market is not really a market where if you do pc stuff 
youre going to influence mainframes it really all has to work 
together he said 
delaney refused to say if ibm which now is involved in mapping 
using mainframes and minicomputers is developing a program that 
would be comparable to mapinfos 
so just who uses digital maps and databases on personal 
computers 
companies or individuals use mapinfo for sales and marketing 
trend analysis demographic analysis dispatching and even planning 
of routes for optical fiber cables 
customers include police departments who want to map out crime 
scenes real estate agents city planners cemetery planners 
orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or aids 
concentrations 
even if the job is really large and theyve clients got 
their heart set on a larger system we would recommend mapinfo to 
start out with and to train their people if nothing else said 
mickey talton vice president of caps consulting which works with 
the growing market of geographical information systems 
based in tuscaloosa ala caps consulting deals primarily with 
urban planning departments and recommends mapinfo frequently 
because of its quality speed with large databases ease of use and 
price he said 
smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford to 
have this in their offices he said 
osullivan said sales went from zero to millions within one 
year but he refuses to disclose figures 
their customers which are located in 18 countries include the 
us postal service united parcel service the us geological 
survey american telephone amp telegraph co chrysler corp general 
motors corp chemical bank and mcdonalds corp 
this spring mapinfo won a 250000 contract with the us army 
to provide mapping software to its recruiting command 
the system will be used for sales and marketing applications to 
help the army better allocate recruiting personnel 
theres a potential for mapinfo to be a 50 million to a 
100 million dollar company down the road osullivan said 
mapinfo came to be when osullivan completed the design of an 
electronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of a 
college project by the time sullivan graduated in 1985 he and 
three other engineers and programmers had joined with business 
consultant michael marvin and obtained financial backing to launch 
the firm 
the first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987 the 
current version in january 1988 
the software package costs 750 and digital maps for 300 
metropolitan areas in the united states range in price up to 2000 
the programs provide names of streets rivers and bridges as 
well as address number ranges for every block and side of a street 
buyers can also use the software with their own maps 
because the firm has met with success so far and has been 
written about in technical magazines the threat of competition 
always looms 
we always feel like were running against ghosts said 
marvin who is mapinfos chief executive officer 
an offshoot of the firm called map media international was 
launched this spring which uses the mapinfo software and adapts it 
to the markets for newspaper and television 
and at mapinfo the development staff is always working on the 
next version of the mapping system 
this company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10 
software companies in the united states because the market is just 
exploding at this point in time osullivan contended

rules against insider trading are so inconsistent 
in stock markets worldwide that surveillance officials are having 
trouble controlling the illegal practice the head of new york 
stock exchange said wednesday 
john phelan chairman and chief executive officer of the leading 
us stock market called for establishing common definitions of 
insider trading on international exchanges in an attempt to combat 
unscrupulous traders and reassure the investing public that the 
markets arent rigged 
everybody comes from different culture and corporate 
background phelan told reporters at the foreign correspondent 
club of japan but the users of those markets have to see those 
markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in 
them 
phelan urged each market to spell out its own definition of what 
insider trading is and then work together to set up common rules 
within the market place everybody talks the same language 
he said but if it is perceived by any major participant that the 
market is unfair there will be a lack of use of the market and 
that will be detrimental to everybody 
phelan criticized the japanese approach to insider trading as 
taking a narrow interpretation but he declined to assess 
recent measures taken by japanese securities authorities saying 
their need are different from our needs 
currently several cases of what western finance experts charge 
are insider trading deals securities transactions based on 
information not available to the public are raising questions in 
japans financial community about the ethics of japanese stock 
deals 
in the most prominent case several politicians aids and senior 
journalists admitted to buying stock of a real estate concern 
before the issues were made public and making huge profits by 
selling the shares after they were listed 
phelan also announced the formation of a new committee to 
counsel the nyse board of directors on japanese business and 
financial matters 
the japan advisory committee will be chaired by exjapanese 
foreign minister saburo okita and vicechaired by akio morita 
chairman of sony corp phelan said 
japans corporate community has become an important partner in 
worldwide commerce and at the same time japan is opening the 
doors of its financial community to western participants he said 
the committee is the latest of 11 advisory bodies the exchange 
has established a european advisory committee was formed in 1985 
phelan credited japans efforts to open its financial market to 
foreign investors and companies 
when i came here three years ago what everyone was talking 
about was more market access he said and today more and more 
what you hear about are things you hear about in new york and 
london how to make money how the market is growing what new 
instruments are coming into the market 
he said it is still difficult for us securities firms to 
penetrate the japanese market but it is equally difficult for 
japanese to break into the us market 
clearly it is not easy to penetrate the national market which 
was established by domestic insitutions over a period of time he 
said but i expect to see continuing opening up of the 
japanese market because i think it is a japanese interest to do 
so

japan and south korea expressed regrets wednesday 
over the us trade bill that was signed tuesday by president 
reagan saying it has protectionist provisions 
reagan called the trade bill a step toward opening worldwide 
markets to american products but expressed displeasure with some 
of the provisions 
in tokyo prime minister noboru takeshita said he regretted the 
trade bill but hopes the us government will implement the law 
in a manner to curb trade protectionism he said previously 
that he would ask reagan to veto the package when the us congress 
passed it earlier this month 
foreign minister sosuke uno said japan will promote the uruguay 
round of trade talks in order to curb protectionist pressures in 
the united states 
some of the nations that say the bill is protectionist are 
themselves accused of being protectionist by the united states 
among other measures the bill transfers authority from the 
president to the trade representative to decide on measures to be 
taken against what the united states considers unfair trade 
practices 
in south korea a foreign ministry statement accused the us 
trade bill of having all the protectionist elements which aroused 
so much concern and protest from korea and many other trading 
nations 
we are particularly concerned with the likely 
counterreactions from us trading partners the statement said 
adding the legislation would encourage enactment of similar laws or 
retaliation 
the south korean foreign ministry urged the us administration 
to ensure the law be implemented in such a way as not to 
adversely affect the smooth growth of the koreaus trade 
relationship 
the signing tuesday climaxed months of negotiations between the 
reagan administration and congress reagan vetoed a previous 
measure because it contained a provision requiring a 60day notice 
to employees of plant closings and layoffs congress passed the 
advancenotice provision as a separate bill and it became law 
the united states record 171 billion trade deficit in 1987 was 
a key reason behind congressional action to try to improve the us 
standing in the global marketplace 
of the overall us trade deficit last year up from 1562 
billion in 1986 the shortfall with japan was again the largest at 
a record 598 billion up from 586 billion in 1986 and 497 
billion in 1985 
the deficit with taiwan was 190 billion up from 71 billion 
in 1986 and the shortfall with south korea was 99 billion up 
from 71 billion in 1986 
japanese international trade and industry minister hajime tamura 
said i urge the us government in enforcing this law to 
maintain its policy of protecting free trade and never to give way 
to the pressure of protectionists

times and deferred major loans until the war came to an end they 
expect the iraqis to reward them for their loyalty he said 
several western european companies have also continued to do 
business with iraq 
britains paterson candy international is helping build a 1 
billion irrigation project west of baghdad and a west 
germanitalian consortium is building the 17 billion saddam dam 
on the euphrates river italys saipem group has won a 14 billion 
contract to build an oil pipeline from iraq across saudi arabia 
when the war started iraq was investing its billions of oil 
dollars in an ambitious development plan that included steel 
petrochemical fertilizer and automobile plants and massive water 
road and housing projects 
iraq has refused to provide figures on its losses in the war 
either human or economic but foreign estimates put the cost of 
just rebuilding the countrys wardamaged transport facilities oil 
installations housing factories schools and hospitals at 30 
billion 
damage to oil installations alone from iranian bombing and 
shelling attacks has amounted to 8 billion according to an 
estimate by kiyotaki tsuji of the japanese institute of middle east 
economic studies 
steel and oil giant usx corp plans to sell an idle steel plant 
in baytown texas to iraq which wants to dismantle the plant and 
ship it home to build pipes for irrigation and oil production iraq 
reportedly has offered pittsburghbased usx 100 million for the 
plant but some texas congressmen oppose the sale 
in recent years iraqi president saddam hussein has changed some 
of his economic policies pushing privatization rather than the 
socialist central planning and government control that prevailed 
before the war 
last week for example the iraqi government said the countrys 
seven major hotels its biggest restaurants and other tourist 
facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector 
south korean companies were the primary contractors for many of 
iraqs suspended projects including power plants oil refineries 
highways pipelines and ports immediately after iraq and iran 
agreed to a ceasefire south koreas major construction companies 
hastily dispatched their chief executives to baghdad 
one ghost from the war hanging around the reconstruction banquet 
is iraqs foreign debt estimated at 60 billion 
but since iraq has oil reserves second only to saudi arabias 
foreign businessmen seem ready to overlook this 
diplomats said they expect the iraqis to continue to defer some 
of their debts by seeking new credits as they repay old ones 
france west germany italy and japan have already rescheduled 
billions of dollars in loans to iraq 
france iraqs secondlargest arms supplier after the soviet 
union has extended about 5 billion in credit for weapons 
purchases 
a south korean businessman expressed confidence in iraqs 
postwar economy 
assuming oil prices hold steady revenues from oil are 
projected to reach around 14 billion this year he said 
speaking on condition he not be identified 
looking further ahead the countrys revenues could be 20 
billion in early 1990 he said 
some japanese companies have begun lobbying for major postwar 
contracts raising the prospect of tough competition between the 
two asian powers at the same time that western european and us 
companies are becoming more active in the iraqi contest 
the south korean companies left their offices in iraq open 
during the war and kept their equipment in the country hoping to 
return and do business there 
we have always been able to distinguish between wartime iraq 
and iraq of the next century with its great economic 
potential the south korean businessman said 
us companies are seeking a big slice of iraqs reconstruction 
pie the reagan administration restored financing to iraq from the 
exportimport bank last year after withdrawing it when baghdad 
stopped debt repayments 
usiraqi trade estimated last year at more than 700 million 
also is expected to swell in the wake of the ceasefire

a federal judge wednesday rejected a prosecution 
complaint that probation for millionaire and convicted tax evader 
victor posner gives the impression that the rich can buy their 
freedom while the poor go to prison 
posner pleaded no contest in february to overvaluing land he 
donated to a college he received five years probation and a fine 
of 4 million after agreeing to donate an additional 3 million to 
a program for south floridas homeless 
thenus attorney leon kellner challenged the sentence in 
april arguing that it would only emphasize that the rich can 
trade money for liberty while the poor cannot 
but in a ruling released wednesday us district judge eugene 
p spellman who had sentenced posner rejected the prosecutions 
arguments he emphasized that under the probation requirement the 
industrialist must devote 20 hours a week to the homeless project 
posner may have avoided prison but his service obligations 
will be so personally demanding and timeconsuming that he is by no 
stretch of the imagination a free man the judge wrote 
in 1985 posner who runs a 40company empire valued at 4 
billion was rated the nations highestpaid executive with an 
annual salary of 127 million the judge said he conservatively 
calculated that posners time was worth 3200 an hour 
as one of the highestpaid individuals in the united states 
this time commitment alone over five years is worth more than 16 
million spellman wrote 
there is no plausible punishment more reasonably related to 
posner and his crime than to have him roll up his sleeves and 
dedicate a substantial part of his life to furthering a vital 
charitable cause said the judge 
the prosecution had specifically attacked the requirement that 
posner donate 3 million to the homeless project saying that 
portion of the sentence was illegal 
but spellman noted that posner had agreed to the donation no 
matter what decision was made on the prosecution challenge and 
called the issue moot 
in recent months posner has been discussing plans for the 
homeless project with a courtapproved committee that will oversee 
the effort he has said he envisions a pilot project aimed at 
providing homes perhaps taking advantage of federal subsidies 
posner was convicted on 10 tax fraud counts for inflating the 
value of land donated to miami christian college when writing the 
charitable gift off on his income tax return 
with the time he must spend on the homeless project spellman 
noted charity will no longer merely mean a tax writeoff to 
victor posner

guinness plc said wednesday it will continue to 
appeal a ruling by the panel on takeovers and mergers which 
decided the brewer violated the panels code of conduct during its 
1986 takeover of distillers co 
if the ruling is upheld guinness may be required to pay as much 
as 100 million pounds or about 168 million to former 
shareholders of distillers maker of gordons gin and johnnie 
walker scotch whiskey the ruling already has been upheld by the 
british high court and the court of appeal 
guinness said it now plans to ask the house of lords britains 
final court of appeal to consider the regulatory bodys ruling 
the panel ruled last september that a swiss company pipetec ag 
acted in concert with guinness when it bought distillers shares 
during the final stages of its 43 billion takeover battle 
the purchase gave guinness more than 15 pecent of distillers 
shares 
under panel rules a 15percent holding would have forced 
guinness to make a cash offer to distillers shareholders at least 
equal to the maximum price it paid for distillers shares over the 
previous 12 months 
guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for 
third parties to buy guinness shares during the takeover 
apparently to boost the share price and make guinness 
cashandstock offer more attractive than a rival bid 
seven men including former guinness chairman ernest saunders 
have been charged with criminal offenses in the case

the international monetary fund on wednesday 
offered brazil 141 billion in new credits to add to the 1202 
billion the nation is expected to owe at the end of the year 
us banks hold about 20 billion of brazils debt which is the 
biggest in the third world the us government holds the biggest 
block of shares in the international fund to which brazil already 
owes 308 billion the fund is owned by 151 countries 
the government of brazilian president jose sarney hard hit by 
inflation may draw installments of the funds standby 
arrangement as the new loan is called through feb 28 1990 
under the funds usual practice reviews are held after each 
installment to decide if the borrower has been performing as agreed 
and whether the next installment can be drawn 
the funds credits go along with 52 billion being offered to 
brazil by banks worldwide to which it already owes about 68 
billion brazil has 700 creditor banks which have pledged 95 
percent of the additional loans promised disbursal of such loans 
is often withheld if the funds disbursements are stopped 
interest on old debt already costs brazil 102 billion to 104 
billion a year much of the interest owed to banks was not paid 
last year but some payments have now resumed the principal has 
not been reduced in recent years as is generally the case with 
third world debt which is expected to reach a total of more than 
12 trillion by the end of the year 
the fund said brazil has pledged to cut the governments deficit 
in 1988 to 4 percent of the countrys gross national product and to 
cut it again in 1989 the deficit amounted to 55 percent of gnp in 
1987 the world bank calculates that brazils total production in 
1986 was worth about 250 billion or 1810 for each citizen 
brazil is promising to cut inflation according to the funds 
announcement figures from brazil say inflation reached a record 
2404 percent for the month of july and may run close to 1000 
percent for the year by the funds calculations consumer prices 
have been rising at an annual rate of about 500 percent in the 
first four months of the year 
the brazilian governments program as outlined by the fund 
aims to shrink differences of income among its people to increase 
savings improve the countrys surplus in world trade reduce 
barriers to imports increase efficiency reduce government 
regulation privatize stateowned industry and reform the financial 
system 
these reforms are expected to contribute to foster overall 
economic growth the fund said 
despite its economic problems brazil already has one of the best 
records for growth in the western hemisphere 43 percent annually 
for each citizen over the years 1965 to 1986 according to the 
world bank growth in the united states as only 16 percent over 
the same period but americans earn almost 10 for every dollar the 
average brazilian makes

home builder bert garey thinks of his 
work as art so hes refusing to sell one of his latest creations 
unless the buyer agrees to pay a 1 percent royalty 
the unprecedented proposal is sending new shudders through the 
already trembling california realty market where the median price 
for a singlefamily home has jumped 212 percent in the past year 
to more than 170000 
the home on which garey wants a royalty is priced at 685000 
garey is requesting the 1 percent cut for him or his heirs each 
time the house is sold 
every time a realtor spends two weeks selling a house he gets 
6 percent said garey i dont see why the person who designed 
and built it shouldnt get 1 percent 
but real estate attorney ken fishbach said the housing market 
could be set reeling if the royalty idea catches on 
this has a huge potential to snarl up real estate 
transactions he said unusual deed restrictions can make it hard 
for title companies to provide clear title for properties he 
explained 
its the kind of thing that only happens in california 
quipped ralph holmer the chicagobased chief counsel for the 
national association of realtors he said its the first time hes 
heard of an artists royalty in real estate 
if builder royalties should become commonplace many believe it 
could only add new fuel to the blazing california realty market 
the california association of realtors reported wednesday that 
the median price of an existing home rose during july to 172347 
in california 208110 in the san francisco bay area 
nevertheless the number of home sales has risen 82 percent in the 
past year 
gareys homes are priced about 20 percent higher than homes of 
comparable size in the area but the builder still considers them a 
bargain he says the royalty has nothing to do with money 
its pure ego garey said i want something that shows my 
17yearold son that i was here something to be seen for my 
effort 
garey has admired berkeleys distinctive houses since he was a 
19yearold history and literature student at the university of 
california at berkeley 
one day about 25 years ago he rode his motorcycle through the 
hills and discovered a home under construction by local 
designerbuilder judd boynton that night he recalls he dreamed 
about the house and later went to boynton and said he wanted to buy 
it even though he didnt have any money 
im not going to sell it but ill teach you to build your 
own boynton replied 
since then garey has designed and handcrafted 11 homes he says 
he has hoisted every handpolished beam and hammered every board 
usually with the help of just one assistant he also says he has 
done the wiring set the tile caulked the windows and installed 
the plumbing 
i love it he said its like sculpting on a large scale 
a brochure describes the home for which garey wants a royalty as 
timeless architecture not a style but an attitude a 
living sculpture of form and feeling light and view redwood and 
mahogany 
so far there has been no taker for the fourbedroom house in 
the berkeley hills with a spectacular view of the golden gate 
bridge

the corn market led grain and soybean futures to 
a sharply higher close wednesday on the chicago board of trade 
partly on fears of a freeze this weekend in the midwest 
analysts were skeptical of the frost talk which helped drive 
corn futures prices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a 
bushel 
i find it hard to believe with all the hot weather weve 
had said jerry gidel an analyst with gh miller amp co a 
chicagobased division of the britishowned trading company lit 
america inc 
he called the freeze talk crazy but acknowledged that some 
meteorologists have predicted an early frost which would do 
further damage to corn and soybeans already damaged by the 
summerlong drought 
crop futures also advanced on perceptions that rain was slowing 
the wheat harvest in the soviet union possibly reducing the amount 
of wheat that will be harvested there gidel said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 7 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 391 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 10 cents higher with september at 283 a bushel oats 
were 5 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 253 a bushel 
soybeans were 16 cents to 26 cents higher with september at 831

ashland oil inc said wednesday it would 
take an aftertax charge of about 25 million in its fiscal fourth 
quarter to cover the cost of settling a lawsuit brought by two 
former executives 
company spokesman roger schrum said the charge against earnings 
would amount to about 22 cents per share in the three months ended 
sept 30 
the announcement came after ashland reached a settlement in 
principle to pay 25 million to the former executives who claimed 
they were fired for refusing to offer or cover up bribes to foreign 
officials 
us district judge william o bertelsman who announced the 
arrangement tuesday in the fouryear legal battle said he had 
picked the figure and applied constructive pressures on each 
side to accept it 
an eightweek jury trial of the case in covington ended june 10 
with a 695 million decision again ashland the biggest ever 
verdict in kentucky ashland later sought a new trial or a 
different judgment 
the jury award included damages for lost past and future wages 
of 144 million for former vice president bill mckay and 77 
million for former vice president harry williams 
those amounts were tripled because of a finding that ashland 
violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act by 
engaging in a pattern of illegal interstate activity to obtain oil 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
in addition ashland chairman john r hall senior vice 
president richard spears and the company were assessed a total of 
3 million in punitive damages for their treatment of the two men

the dollar sank wednesday with a slight push 
from a few central banks after having resisted concerted official 
efforts to lower it in previous sessions 
gold prices rose republic national bank of new york said gold 
was bid at 43460 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt up from 43185 
an ounce late tuesday 
traders said the market was influenced by an article in 
wednesdays editions of the new york times that quoted an unnamed 
senior us official as saying the reagan administration believes a 
further rise of the dollar could be troublesome 
also bank of japan governor satoshi sumita reportedly said the 
dollars recent rise against the west german mark was 
inexplicable 
further undermining the dollar was a sale of hundreds of 
millions of british pounds for west german marks said jerry egan 
a senior trader for the bank of boston he said the trade was done 
by selling sterling for dollars and then selling dollars for marks 
the result was to lower the dollar against the mark starting a 
slide 
the dollars fall was fairly steady most times when the dollar 
is falling it stages periodic rallies or bounces but wednesday 
it was bouncing like a dead cat egan said 
currency dealers in europe said there were spurts of 
intervention by the central banks of west germany switzerland and 
belgium 
in london the pound fell to 16788 from 16795 late tuesday 
influenced by fears that britain would report a bigger trade 
deficit thursday but later in new york it rose to 16869 from 
16740 late tuesday 
in tokyo where the business day ends before europes begins 
the dollar rose 037 yen to a closing 13430 yen later in london

the aluminum industrys bid for early labor 
contract settlements failed wednesday in cincinnati where 
bargaining ended in disagreement over economic issues 
pittsburghbased aluminum co of america the industry leader 
and reynolds metals co of richmond va opened talks aug 9 with 
the united steelworkers of america and the aluminum brick and 
glass workers 
about 21000 members of the two unions will continue working 
under twoyear contracts that dont expire until may 1989 since 
the two sides reached an impasse in the early talks they planned to 
reopen the bargaining nearer the expiration date 
the problem was that what they came up with on profit sharing 
was very inadequate said usw spokesman charles robb in 
pittsburgh 
alcoa offered to give union members a share of only those 
profits that exceeded 6 percent of the value of its us assets 
and reynolds offered a share of those profits exceeding 10 percent 
of shareholders equity he said 
under those proposals in 1987 reynolds biggest profit year 
they would have shared slightly more than 600 per worker and 
alcoa would have shared nothing robb said 
combined with other provisions the companies offers would have 
represented hourly wage increases projected at 37 cents he said 
our members gave up about 95 cents an hour in the current 
contract robb said certainly we want our members to recoup 
what they had given up since the companies are tremendously 
profitable 
we offered both unions a fouryear agreement featuring a 
profitsharing plan an immediate insurance option and increased 
pension benefits said alcoa chairman paul oneill 
alcoa reported 1987 profits of 200 million on sales of 777 
billion and 1988 firsthalf profits of 4163 million on sales of 
459 billion 
reynolds reported 1987 net earnings of 2195 million on sales 
of 432 billion and 1988 firsthalf profits of 2049 million on 
sales of 265 billion 
the pittsburghbased usw represents about 4000 reynolds 
employees at 21 locations in the united states and canada and about 
6000 alcoa employees at nine locations in the united states the 
abgw represents about 4000 reynolds workers and about 7000 alcoa 
workers 
the two unions negotiate sidebyside on separate contracts

and belownormal rainfall for the midwest next week 
roemer said early frosts early meaning september followed 
two of the last four summer droughts in 1974 and 1983 
he said the early freeze in 1974 wiped out a large part of the 
soybean crop but added that this years crops were maturing at an 
aboveaverage pace so frost would have to occur no later than 
sept 20 to cause significant damage 
jerry gidel an analyst with gh miller amp co a chicagobased 
division of the britishowned trading company lit america inc 
called the freeze talk crazy 
i find it hard to believe with all the hot weather weve

americas bulging trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the 
apriljune quarter the government said wednesday in a report that 
strengthened republican campaign claims of economic achievement but 
didnt impress financial markets 
although the commerce department figures showed the biggest 
quarterly improvement in more than five years the dollar fell and 
bonds weakened the stock market rallied but trading was light and 
brokers attributed the gain to internal market influences that had 
little to do with the general economy 
the commerce department said the difference between what america 
spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of 299 billion in 
the second quarter compared with a deficit of 352 billion in the 
first three months of 1988 
many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most 
visible weaknesses in the economy reflecting a relentless 
addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic 
companies trying to compete democrats have attempted to make the 
trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign 
but the improvement reported wednesday suggested that us 
manufacturers are making strong gains in selling abroad some 
economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by close to 
25 percent for the year as a whole marking the first annual 
improvement since president reagan took office 
republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement 
which has already shown up in the commerce departments monthly 
merchandise trade reports 
but on wall street the trade news was largely disregarded and 
the volume of trading remained low the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks which had lost nearly 38 points over the 
previous three sessions climbed 3734 to close at 202667 in what 
brokers described as a technical recovery 
in foreignexchange trading the dollar which ordinarily would 
be expected to rally on improved us trade figures fell with a 
slight push from selling by a few central banks concerned about its 
recent rise 
traders said the currency market was influenced by an article in 
wednesdays editions of the new york times that quoted an 
unidentified senior us official as saying the reagan 
administration believes a further rise of the dollar could be 
troublesome 
the dollars decline was partly responsible for a poor showing 
in the bond market where traders are sensitive to changes in the 
value of the us currency because it directly affects the demand 
for us bonds by foreigners 
the treasurys key 30year bond fell about 250 per 1000 in 
face amount and its yield which moves inversely to price rose to 
939 percent from 937 percent late tuesday 
in other economic news major automakers said midaugust sales 
of usmade cars and trucks fell by 132 percent from the same 
period a year earlier when sales were inflated by buyers taking 
advantage of dealer incentives 
companies making cars in the united states reported selling 
298580 cars and trucks during the aug 1120 period this year 
compared with 343845 vehicles during the same period last year

ncnb texas national bank depositors have withdrawn 
about 300 million from the bank in recent weeks and bank 
officials say the total could double 
were concerned but only because we would like to hang on to 
every deposit and customer we can said timothy hartman ncnbs 
vice chairman 
hartman said tuesday the withdrawals apparently reflect concern 
about the approaching end of a guarantee on deposits above 100000 
and the loss of additional deposit insurance that was available 
through the 40bank system of ncnb texas predecessor first 
republicbank corp 
in late july ncnb based in charlotte nc acquired the 
former banks of first republicbank from the federal deposit 
insurance corp ncnb agreed to invest up to 240 million for the 
130 texas banking locations of first republicbank which was 
declared insolvent 
ncnb initially will acquire a 20 percent stake in the bank but 
has an option to buy the rest from the fdic which promised to pump 
4 billion into the texas institution 
i dont know if it is possible to find a more sound 
institution anywhere hartman said 
under terms of an agreement announced july 29 the fdic planned 
to withdraw the additional coverage for deposits above 100000 
that it installed in march to halt a run on first republicbank 
the move does not affect the normal coverage of up to 100000 
offered to depositors at all federally insured institutions 
hartman said ncnb has alternative sources of funding including 
3 billion in cash due from the fdic as part of the transaction 
and faces no cash squeeze because of withdrawals 
in fact ncnb expects withdrawals to total as much as 600 
million about 10 percent of the 6 billion in the 100000plus 
accounts the bank maintains 
hartman said depositors apparently had grown accustomed to the 
luxury of multibank insurance a program through which customers 
could spread their deposits among several first republicbank 
institutions for additional fdic protection

a young computer whiz pleaded innocent 
wednesday to 11 counts of felony larceny stemming from an alleged 
scheme to bilk six investors out of more than 500000 to keep his 
business operating 
tex zachary hildreth 24 faces a maximum penalty of five years 
in prison or a 25000 fine and two years in jail on each charge if 
convicted he was ordered held in lieu of 100000 bail at the 
local jail 
hildreth who fled to new hampshire and attempted suicide with 
his mother after authorities and creditors moved in on his software 
firm massdata corp had been free on 1000 bail during a 
twomonthlong grand jury investigation 
norfolk county superior court judge andrew gill meyer approved 
the prosecutions recommendation that bail for hildreth be 
increased because more indictments are expected in the case 
defense attorney gregory sullivan said he would ask during a 
bail review hearing thursday that hildreth be allowed to post 
5000 to 10000 cash bail which would be returned when he 
appeared for trial instead of paying a surety bond as requested 
which would not be returned 
mike mcgorty spokesman for the norfolk county district 
attorneys office said assistant district attorney dennis mahoney 
told the judge that hildreth orchestrated a scheme of grand 
proportion to get people to invest in his company 
mahoney head of the countys white collar crime unit told the 
court hildreth obtained loans by telling investors of a phantom 
family trust that he would use to pay back their inestments 
hildreth told investors he would soon be eligible for funds from 
the trust left to him when his father died he said but 
investigators determined that hildreths father is still alive and 
that the trust never amounted to more than 30000 
as massdata slid into the red hildreth also allegedly used 
falsified documents to obtain bank loans 
as part of the investigation we determined that certain banks 
made loans based on papers presented by mr hildreth and the 
documents were allegedly fictitious or forgeries mcgorty said 
this could stretch well beyond a million dollars mcgorty 
said 
the grand jury is also looking into a 400000 loan to hildreth 
from the rockland trust co 
it appears that some of this money was being solicited to pay 
off other investors and also some bank notes mcgorty said 
after hildreth and his mother rose 50 fled massachusetts with 
creditors close behind they were recaptured when an employee at 
the manchester nh holiday inn reported a bloodied man wandering 
about the lobby 
police found hildreth who apparently had slashed his wrists 
his mother and a bottle of nonprescription pills were found in 
their hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes 
police said 
hildreth bought his first computer at the age of 16 and with 
the help of a mentor rented office space to start his own software 
firm at the age of 20 
he quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success including 
a 220000 weymouth condominium a 32000 bmw and a 50inch 
4000 color tv

stock prices surged wednesday bouncing back 
from levels last seen nearly three months ago in a rally that 
gathered momentum toward the finish trading volume however 
remained sluggish 
analysts said the market had been due for a rebound after this 
months steady decline but they said some encouraging news on the 
trade deficit and some bargainhunting also contributed to the 
rally 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which slipped 089 on 
tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions 
climbed 3734 points to close at 202667 its biggest gain in 
nearly a month tuesdays close had left the markets bestknown 
indicator at its lowest level since late may 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5to2 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
1089 issues up 376 down and 498 unchanged the nyse index rose 
199 to 14793 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 12780 million shares 
up from 11954 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
15127 million shares 
prices rose smartly for the first hour of trading pulled back 
somewhat at midday and then extended their gains during the early 
afternoon a 12point spurt in the final hour of trading lifted the 
dow jones industrial average to its biggest gain since a 4640 rise 
on july 29 
jack solomon an analyst for bear stearns amp co said a 
combination of factors helped lift prices 
he said this months decline had soured the markets mood and 
wednesdays activity reflected a release from excessively 
consistent selling pressure 
he said some investors may have found soem bargains at their 
depressed levels while professional traders who had previously 
sold borrowed stocks expecting prices to fall decided to buy 
stocks 
solomon said the stock rally may have also reflected a delayed 
reaction to tuesdays government reports that consumer prices were 
up modestly in july while orders for durable goods tumbled 
he said a new government report that the nations trade deficit 
narrowed in the second quarter to 299 billion from an imbalance 
of 352 billion in the first three months of the year may also 
have provided some encouragement 
all three reports were seen as reducing pressure on the federal 
reserve to push interest rates higher he said 
if we get some good political or economic news this rally may 
continue we may have broken the backbone of the decline solomon 
said 
but other analysts noted the gains came in continued slow 
trading and were skeptical about prospects for further gains 
this seems to be feeding on itself a little bit said bill 
raftery an analyst at smith barney harris upham amp co i dont 
think it means a turning point in the market

a federal bankruptcy judge approved wednesday a 
14 million state bailout of the chicago missouri amp western 
railway 
citicorp and heller financial inc which are owed more than 
100 million by the railroad had opposed the rescue plan and 
sought to have the railroad shut down and its assets sold 
but us bankruptcy court judge john schwartz said in a written 
decision that the public interest required the railroad to continue 
to operate while its courtappointed trustee daniel r murray 
works out a reorganization plan 
the history of this railroad the lenders relationship to it 
as well as the history of this case demand this opportunity be 
given to the trustee if the public interest is not to be damned 
schwartz concluded 
a spokeswoman for illinois gov james r thompson who put 
together the rescue package of grants and loans applauded the 
decision to keep the cmampw running 
the creditors attorney neal wolf was out of his office and 
not immediately available for comment 
the railroad operates freight service over its entire 632mile 
line between kansas city mo and joliet with trackage rights 
extending the final 40 miles to chicago 
the 157mile amtrak route between joliet and springfield is used 
by 300000 people annually according to thompsons office 
the creditors had argued that even under the best of 
circumstances the railroads earnings would not come close to 
paying even the interest on the loans 
cmampw filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws on april 1 listing debts of 1318 million 
and assets of 1035 million 
on july 29 schwartz allowed cmampw to accept 1 million of the

cos claim that bvitamins in its rice krispies cereal provide 
pep and the company has agreed to stop some of its advertising on 
the claim new yorks attorney general said wednesday 
kellogg of battle creek mich agreed aug 4 to stop all 
advertising in new york that might mislead consumers about the 
health benefits of rice krispies said state attorney general 
robert abrams 
kelloggs ads had claimed bvitamins in rice krispies would give 
consumers added physical energy vigor and power and also asserted 
that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins abrams said 
of the five bvitamins contained in rice krispies three 
thiamin riboflavin and niacin are known to help convert food 
into the type of energy needed by the bodys cells abrams said 
but there is no evidence that eating rice krispies has an effect on 
a persons energy level or feeling of wellbeing he said 
studies have shown bvitamins are readily available in the 
american diet and the majority of consumers who suffer from fatigue 
do not have any primary vitamin deficiency abrams said in a 
statement 
the attorney general obtained a formal assurance of 
discontinuance from kellogg on aug 4 stating the company would 
not use any advertising or labeling that might lead consumers to 
believe bvitamins added to rice krispies provide energy or relieve 
fatigue 
the company admitted no liability but paid 10000 toward the 
cost of new yorks investigation 
a recording at kelloggs battle creek headquarters said the 
offices were closed wednesday afternoon 
the center for science in the public interest a 
washingtonbased public advocacy group applauded the attorney 
generals efforts cspi brought the rice krispies health claim to

offers of food lodging money and 
equipment continued to pour in wednesday for a group of iowa 
farmers who have come to idaho to cut free hay for their 
droughtstarved livestock 
meanwhile organizers of the hay harvest said theyve received 
calls from farmers and farmer groups in north dakota minnesota and 
iowa asking whether there was enough hay to feed their livestock as 
well 
when we put out the notice we didnt realize we were going to 
get such a tremendous response said mike tracy director of 
information for the idaho farm bureau its turned into a 
monumental task 
organizers of the hay harvest had worried there wouldnt be 
enough machinery to keep the iowans busy but offers of equipment 
began pouring into the farm bureau office here tuesday after a farm 
bureau official appealed on television for donations 
tracy said the 64 iowans would begin cutting hay on thursday 
the tired contingent iowans arrived late tuesday in two 
greyhound buses donated by the transportation company for the 
1600mile trip west 
the men women and teenagers stayed overnight in rooms donated 
by three motels while farm bureau and national farmers organization 
officials scouted about 4500 acres of hay on pasture land placed 
in the governments conservation reserve program 
they really like what theyre seeing tracy said theyre 
real pleased with the quality 
the harvest could provide as much as 5000 tons of hay as of 
the first of this week 76 percent of the hay crop in iowa was 
considered in poor condition by the us department of agriculture 
the iowans who plan to harvest bail and ship for about 10 
days faced an aug 31 deadline to be off the reserve lands which 
are under the control of the usda 
a lot of us guys are just plain out of hay said don 
tibbals an albia iowa dairy farmer the usda finally realized 
that and released the conservation reserve program lands 
a lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now said 
junior mccall of clarinda iowa we usually dont have to start 
feeding hay until december added larry keller of nunia iowa

the reserve lands in northern and eastern latah county about 30 
miles east of moscow tracy said 
the hay is to be shipped back to iowa on rail cars donated by 
the burlington northern railroad 
details were still being worked out on getting the hay to 
loading points and how it will be distributed when it arrives in 
the midwest said mccall who made the trip with his son jeff 
hopefully it will be dropped off at different spots he 
said 
help for the iowa farmers came from fraternities at the 
university of idaho and washington state university which have 
offered to help harvest the hay as did future farmers of america 
and other farm organizations tracy said 
local restaurants and granges have donated food to feed the 
field workers three banks in chariton about 45 miles south of des 
moines put up cash for meals along the way 
we havent had to pay for anything yet said keller 
norman plank an idaho farm bureau official estimated 200 
boxcar loads of hay might be moved

hay said dan harwood of colfax wash a national farmers

financiers who have acquired troubled 
savings and loans told a capacity crowd of highstakes investors 
wednesday that the thrift industry is the investment bonanza of 
the next decade 
more than 350 investors packed a conference room at the fairmont 
hotel to hear three nationallyknown investors share their insight 
on how to make money buying into the beleaguered thrift industry 
the daylong event was sponsored by the federal home loan bank of 
san francisco which hopes to lure investors with at least 15 
million to spare into purchasing an ailing thrift 
this will be your bonanza in the next decade lucky you 
said preston martin chairman of wespar financial services inc and 
former vice chairman of the federal reserve 
martin who is involved in several investment groups including 
that of former us treasury secretary william e simon appeared 
with investment banker alan e rothenberg and stephen t mclin 
president of san franciscos america first financial corp 
the panel members are touting thrift investment because they say 
the competition will help their own businesses thrive and will 
improve the health of the whole industry 
its important to get this problem solved said mclin 
its going to help the health of the entire industry the sooner 
we get this thing fixed the better its going to be for 
everybody 
the symposium also featured federal home loan bank board 
chairman m danny wall who told listeners it was important to 
build up the industrys capital 
we see that more and more of our attention should be given 
to the savings side wall said this country has got to do more 
about capital expansion if we want to continue to be competitive in 
this world 
thrifts are attractive investments in several aspects according 
to the federal home loan bank of san francisco unlike commercial 
banks they are relatively easy to acquire and there are few 
restrictions on what types of businesses may acquire an ailing 
thrift 
furthermore they provide flexibility in investment powers 
including broad powers for realestaterelated diversification and 
are relatively easy to expand geographically under federal laws 
allowing thrifts to branch in up to three states 
in its latest acquisition dp holdings inc the investment 
group headed by martin and simon received federal approval tuesday 
to acquire two california savings and loan institutions including 
one that is insolvent 
dp holdings will raise up to 2075 million in new capital to 
finance the acquisition and will get a federal assistance package 
totaling an estimated 565 million 
mclin whose limited partnership in may acquired eureka federal 
savings amp loan association a troubled san franciscoarea thrift 
said that to successfully take over a thrift an investor must have 
capital good management and patience 
we went into federal savings and loan insurance corp with 
the willingness to invest 100 million and we had this in cash 
he said describing the eureka acquisition 
conversely if youre short on capital youd better be very 
long on management if you can go in and hit them with a proven 
track record then its possible without creating more of a joint 
venture framework mclin said 
regulators are trying to sell 259 thrifts a much larger number 
are technically insolvent but have not yet been taken over by 
federal officials 
last week in atlanta a similar symposium attracted 600 people 
bank board officials have struggled to bring new capital into a 
thrift industry battered by bad loans and see the interest in the 
symposiums as a sign that enthusiasm among investors may be growing
