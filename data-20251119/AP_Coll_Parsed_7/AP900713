fire raged through a subway tunnel under 
construction near downtown friday collapsing a section near the 
hollywood freeway and snarling traffic when the thoroughfare was 
shut for fear it might also fall 
commuters were thrown into chaos and firefighters and engineers 
reported damage to the metro rail tunnel running under the freeway 
one of the principal routes linking northern and southern 
california 
current information has part of the tunnel collapsed due to 
failure of the metal rings binding the tunnel together said city 
chief administrative officer richard b dixon 
by late afternoon the blaze was confined and contained but 
not out fire spokesman greg acevedo said 
the tunnel is 750 feet long the fire is in 450 feet of it 
he said 
about 150 firefighters remained on site but were unable to get 
far into the tunnel because of the intense heat he said 
fire department estimates variously put the collapsed section at 
80 or 140 feet by 20 feet a california department of 
transportation spokeswoman said the collapsed section was at least 
100 feet and included a segment under the freeway 
were quite concerned about the integrity of the freeway 
said deputy fire chief craig drummond 
the fires cause was unknown and not likely to be known until it 
was out 
there was no estimate of when the fire would be controlled and 
predictions of when the freeway would be reopened stretched as long 
as monday morning 
as big a headache as it is we want to be safe said margie 
tiritilli a spokeswoman for caltrans we want to make sure that 
the structure will not collapse and were just not certain 
underneath with that tunnel 
the 13 billion 4mile subway project was scheduled to open 
sometime in 1993 officials of the southern california rapid 
transit district werent sure how the fire would affect the 
timetable 
smoke poured out of tunnel vents and the odor permeated downtown 
it started getting to me it was just disgusting said jeff 
singer who got to work at the district attorneys office after 
being stuck in traffic almost an hour it was just starting to 
make me nauseous 
firefighters poured water into the tunnel during the first hours 
and then began considering whether to smother it with foam or pump 
in an inert gas such as nitrogen to displace the oxygen that 
allowed the fire to burn 
two minor injuries to firefighters were reported six cleanup 
crew workers in one of two underground tubes smelled smoke in the 
adjacent tunnel and escaped unharmed 
the top of the tunnel is 18 feet underground the tunnel is 19 
feet in diameter 
the hollywood freeway us 101 is a main artery linking 
downtown to hollywood and the san fernando valley suburbs traffic 
from the valley was suprisingly light some commuters reported but 
freeways such as the santa ana san bernardino and glendale were 
snarled as they tied into the downtown grid surface streets also 
backed up 
it was a mess said elizabeth munnerlyn a court secretary 
who got to work two hours late 
some mail will not be delivered today they could not get into 
some areas because of safety reasons said larry dozier of the 
postal service the downtown post office on los angeles street is 
just blocks from the fire

colombias presidentelect cesar gaviria 
said friday the united states must curb its appetite for drugs 
before his nation can significantly stem illegal cocaine production 
gaviria told reporters after meeting with president bush that 
the demand for drugs is the engine of the trafficking problem if 
the united states and the industrial countries dont get a way to 
reduce consumption we will not solve the problem 
it doesnt matter how much we work against the trafficking of 
drugs how many lives we lose it doesnt matter how great our 
effort the problem will be there the united states and 
industrialized countries need a way to reduce the consumption of 
drugs 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the two presidents 
had discussed the administrations pending proposal for 805 
million in drugfighting assistance to colombia 
colombia has made a great effort against narcotraffickers 
gaviria told reporters we have had a lot of violence three 
of our presidential candidates were assassinated thousands of 
colombians have been killed and we really are in the front line 
all the time 
in an interview with the washington post gaviria said 
colombians are waiting for severe sanctions against marion 
barry the mayor of the nations capital who is on trial for drug 
and perjury charges 
colombians are extremely interested in the barry trial gaviria 
said adding people were quite upset and surprised that barry 
had not resigned 
the colombian leader told the post that public support for his 
drugfighting efforts would be diminished if barry is acquitted 
gaviria was elected may 27 when millions of colombians went to 
the polls in defiance of terrorist threats following the bloodiest 
campaign in the nations history 
in a photo session bush praised gaviria for his forthright 
commitment to fight drugs 
gaviria also said he asked bush to help reverse us moves that 
have cut colombian revenues from coffee and cutflower exports 
colombia has been unhappy over new us tariffs on colombian 
flowers and over the usled collapse of an international 
coffeepricing agreement 
we have a kind of survival at stake everyday gaviria said 
adding that colombia wants the industrialized world to understand 
that colombia needs some help its not economic aid not military 
help but basically what we expect is trade 
fitzwater said bush and gaviria had pledged to continue 
working toward mutually satisfactory agreements on various trade 
issues one white house official said flowers and coffee had come 
up in a general discussion on trade 
the united states had dropped out of the coffee cartel 
complaining that some coffeegrowing nations were secretly selling 
coffee surpluses in eastern europe at lower prices than those 
charged in the united states 
without us support the cartel collapsed the subsequent drop 
in coffee prices cost colombia more than 500 million in 1989 
coffee represents onethird of colombias legal exports 
the administration now says that it is trying to get the 
agreement renegotiated but that other countries that are a party to 
it including large producers such as brazil are not in agreement 
colombia wants its cut flowers allowed into the united states 
tarifffree 
early this year the commerce department made a preliminary 
decision to increase tariffs on colombian cut flowers to an average 
as high as 85 percent in may however the department eased its 
initial decision placing a tariff averaging 416 percent on the 
flowers the colombians say even that is too high 
the department acting on a complaint by us flower growers 
had accused colombia of dumping freshly cut flowers at below 
fairmarket prices 
the us trade representatives office is engaged in talks with 
the colombians on bushs recent proposal to have freetrade 
agreements with all latin countries

consumers are paying more attention to prices 
and taking advantage of coupons and supermarket specials regularly 
reflecting an overall concern about the economy according to an 
industry survey 
at the same time supermarket prices this year have increased 
faster than expected but should moderate during the rest of 1990 
a government economist said at a forum thursday sponsored by the 
food marketing institute 
price is increasingly becoming a factor in consumer decisions 
about where to shop according to a survey by the institute a 
nonprofit grocery store trade group 
the survey taken every january for 20 years questioned the 
primary grocery shopper in 1005 households about attitudes and 
practices 
this year it found that 96 percent of shoppers rated low prices 
as very or somewhat important up from 92 percent in 1989 94 
percent 1988 and 93 percent in 1987 
and nearly 40 percent of the people surveyed said they used 
coupons or watched for specials in newspaper ads said timothy m 
hammonds the institutes senior vice president of research and 
education he said that figure was 2 percent to 4 percent more than 
a year ago and reversed a general trend since 1982 
people were beginning to get a little less confident about the 
economy there is a general unease he said the only factors 
ahead of prices were quality produce wide selection and quality 
meat 
prices at the nations 147000 supermarkets rose more in 1989 
than in any other year since 1981 denis dunham an agricultural 
economist with the us department of agriculture said at the 
conference 
he said prices averaged 65 percent more than in 1988 partly 
because of lingering effects of the drought of 1988 
largely reflecting the price increases that have already 
occurred this year food prices in the second half of 1990 will 
average about 4 perent higher than a year earlier he said 
the causes he said included a december freeze in florida and 
texas and low production of some dairy products these were offset 
in the spring dunham said 
given the developments that seem most likely in commodity 
prices and marketing costs there is not likely to be much increase 
in average prices of food at grocery stores in the third and fourth 
quarter of 1990 he said 
also at the seminar 
finding ways to reduce and recycle solid waste will become 
increasingly important for an industry in which profit margins 
already are less than a penny on the dollar and in a society in 
landfill space is shrinking rapidly said thirman l milner 
director of government affairs for first national supermarkets inc 
of windsor locks conn 
microwaveable foods have grown from a category that wasnt 
much in existence five years ago to a 25 billion business said 
nicholas j dagostino jr chief executive of dagostino 
supermarkets inc a new york area chain 
seventytwo percent of shoppers surveyed said they look at food 
labels but only 36 percent said they looked beyond expiration 
dates to ingredient lists or nutrition information 
only 8 percent of shoppers said manufacturers health claims 
are very believable but 52 percent said they were somewhat 
believable 
supermarket takeout food is increasingly important not 
cooking is becoming a substitute for eating out for baby boom 
generation families now raising children and strapped for time 
hammonds said 
convenience foods no longer carry a tinge of guilt 
convenience foods let you spend more quality time with your 
family hammonds said this attachment to convenience foods 
however is offset somewhat by a willingness to prepare fresh 
produce

elderly people remember as well as young people 
to do tasks like stopping to buy milk on the way home says a new 
study that surprised memory experts 
the result appeared in two laboratory tests of prospective 
memory which involves remembering to carry out a task at the right 
time 
prospective memory is important for older adults who must 
remember to take medications and show up for medical appointments 
but research has not clearly shown whether it declines with age 
coauthors of the new study wrote 
the new results were unexpected because some other kinds of 
memory worsen with age and some of the prominent theories in the 
area suggest that this kind of memory ought to be especially 
difficult for the elderly said study coauthor gilles einstein 
einstein a psychology professor at furman university in 
greenville sc and mark mcdaniel of purdue university report the 
federally funded research in the july issue of the journal of 
experimental psychology learning memory and cognition 
a prominent memory expert who proposed that aging leads to 
declines in prospective memory said the new results surprised him 
the study was well done but im not convinced that its the 
whole and final truth said psychology professor fergus craik of 
the university of toronto maybe age differences appear under some 
conditions but not others he suggested 
einstein agreed noting that a recent unpublished experiment 
found an age difference in a more difficult memory test but the 
published work still suggests no agerelated decline in relatively 
simple cases of remembering to do a task at the right time he said 
one of the new experiments involved 24 people ages 65 or older 
and 24 college students ages 17 to 24 participants sat in front of 
a computer in what they thought was an experiment in improving 
shortterm memory 
they were told that they would see a list of words on the 
computer screen and that immediately afterward they would be asked 
to recall the words they saw this would be done 42 times with 
different lists they were told 
in addition if they saw the word rake they were supposed to 
press a particular key on the computer keyboard half the 
participants in each age group were allowed to choose a memory aid 
such as writing the cue word on a piece of paper 
participants were kept busy on unrelated tests for 15 minutes to 
encourage them to forget about the word rake finally the 
wordlist exercise began without any reminder about reacting to 
that word which appeared three times in the course of the exercise 
results showed that for participants with no memory aid the 
young and the old groups remembered to push the key equally often 
47 percent of the time rake appeared 
performance was better for those using a memory aid but age 
still had no effect nor did any age effect appear in a second 
experiment with 48 different participants

in the midst of furious negotiations at the 
sevennation houston summit the europeans balked at us pressure 
to yield on farm subsidies the white house negotiators finessed 
the moment and it passed 
the europeans were being critical but in fact they were 
complimenting president bush they kept saying that this is the 
least pushy of the white house administrations in many years 
said a canadian official who recounted the moment 
bush is exactly suited to bridging the gap by persuasion 
the official said 
at the houston meeting this ability proved crucial 
the us president met this week with the leaders of the other 
major industrialized democracies in radically changed circumstances 
the cold war which for decades kept the militarily mighty 
united states as the undisputed leader of the west is over 
and gone too is americas once unquestioned economic dominance 
for bush it amounted to a unique challenge would the others 
still accord the united states a preeminent role and would they 
still feel they need washington in quite the same way 
at the end of threeday meeting with the leaders of canada 
japan west germany france britain and italy the answer appeared 
to be an unqualified yes despite the subtly changing dynamics 
the europeans apart from britains unswervingly proamerican 
margaret thatcher are often prickly about us muscle but they 
were full of praise this time 
west germany whose dominance in europe is soon to be enhanced 
in a united germany bowed gracefully to us rejection of its 
urgings for direct financial assistance now to the soviet union 
george bush continues to be the most reliable friend the 
germans have said hans klein spokesman for west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
but someone like helmut kohl understands that his actions 
sometimes have to be guided by different considerations from ours 
and japan which has already replaced the united states as the 
worlds largest creditor country said bush showed at houston that 
america can lead by persuasion 
he is showing himself to be very very competent and has an 
ability to be very considerate to the feelings of other nations 
said japanese foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
the potential of the united states is still greater than it 
has shown in actual achievements it still attracts people from 
our country who are looking for the best atmosphere in which 
innovative activities can be pursued 
the summit had its sticky moments there was tough talking to 
find a compromise between american demands for a real commitment to 
cut agricultural subsidies and european resistance 
west germany wanted to go a lot farther than the united states 
on environmental measures and while britain japan and canada 
lined up with the united states on the soviet aid issue west 
germany france and italy had strong opposing views 
there were real breakthroughs that i wouldnt have thought 
possible a week ago said the canadian official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
and much of this was due to george bush he gives the 
impression of being an erudite ivy league professor he is very 
wellbriefed seldom speaks from notes and uses logic and 
argument not strongarm 
the summit the second time bush had met the european leaders in 
two weeks including a north atlantic treaty organization summit in 
london also appeared to have been genuinely friendly despite the 
differences 
george bushs chairmanship was very relaxed said british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd its been very clearheaded and 
conciliatory 
in the british view us leadership is now more not less 
vital because of what mrs thatcher sees as the danger of the 
transatlantic relationship weakening in the postcold war era 
however british officials acknowledge the personal chemistry 
between bush and mrs thatcher isnt the same as the exceptionally 
close relationship the british leader had with ronald reagan 
but the intellectual chemistry with bush is better said a 
thatcher aide speaking on condition of anonymity hes not the 
same intense arguer and debater that she is hes a much more 
relaxed chap who talks it through but at least they can discuss 
there was real debate here

chester atkins congressional district in 
massachusetts is a long way from cambodia but the convoluted 
politics of the southeast asian nation are complicating his 
reelection race 
the threeterm democrat a congressional expert on cambodian 
affairs is being criticized on two fronts 
first his republican opponent state rep jack macgovern 
charges that atkins opened the floodgates for a surge of cambodian 
immigrants to the district putting a drain on local resources 
the districts largest city lowell has roughly 20000 
cambodian immigrants second in the united states only to long 
beach calif 
at the same time atkins is drawing fire from cambodian refugees 
because he has tried to block any aid from going to cambodia a 
group of about 100 cambodians recently staged a protest outside 
atkins lowell office 
atkins 42 is known for helping refugees escape to the united 
states he opposes sending financial assistance to cambodia because 
he fears it may end up helping the khmer rouge one of the 
guerrilla groups fighting for control of phnom penh 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge were responsible for the 
genocidal killing of nearly 1 million cambodians when they ruled 
the country in the 1970s 
last month atkins led an unsuccessful floor fight to block 7 
million in nonlethal aid to cambodian revolutionary forces 
atkins is getting hit by both sides up in this city said 
macgovern 38 you cannot be surprised when you have certain 
hostilities arise when all that noncambodians see is the burden 
side of it and the fact that they have to hire teachers who speak 
cambodian 
atkins bitterly accuses macgovern of waving the flag of racism 
and fostering resentment of the cambodian immigrants 
macgovern has falen in with people who have really played 
to the very darkest instincts and fears that people have the 
congressman said 
he also accuses macgoverns allies of helping arrange the 
protest by cambodian refugees 
atkins denies that he has encouraged cambodians to come to 
lowell saying that they were attracted by jobs in the 
workingclass city once the citys cambodian community was 
established it served as a magnet to other immigrants he said 
he defends his interest in foreign policy particularly his 
efforts to encourage cambodians to find a peaceful solution to 
their political problems if cambodia is stable many refugees from 
lowell could return to their homeland he says 
part of what im trying to do with my efforts at peace is to 
create the sort of environment so that they can go back he said 
macgovern says hes prolowell not anticambodian 
a lot of people feel that the city has been left alone and has 
not received enough help macgovern said my position is there 
ought to be federal impact aid for a city like lowell 
atkins acknowledges widespread anger and resentment to the 
cambodian population in lowell but he insists he has made sure the 
city received 17 million in extra federal help in the last 18 
months 
were now getting frequent and significant federal grants 
particularly for the schools so that the southeast asian kids 
dont take resources away from the other kids he said 
despite sensitivity over the cambodian issues macgovern is a 
long shot to unseat atkins 
with fewer than 2000 of lowells cambodians registered to vote 
they will have little say in deciding the election 
theyre a political factor certainly atkins said 
theyre not a force

republicans stung by democratic attacks over the 
savings and loan crisis are promising to get their party back on 
the offense even when it comes to discussing president bushs 
reversal on taxes 
dont get defensive gop pollster bob teeter told the 
republican national committee on thursday it is the single 
greatest mistake i think we could make 
teeter voicing publicly what many gop leaders are mumbling 
about privately said bushs decision to ditch his no new taxes 
pledge could hurt republicans in the short term 
but he told the party leaders that bush had to make the 
concession to win a promise of spending cuts from the democrats 
controlling congress and that the gop will quickly rebound if 
bush negotiates a significant deficit reduction plan 
a good economy is good politics teeter said there is no 
worse politics than a recession 
democrats have been tweaking the republicans by blaming bush and 
the gop for the burgeoning savings and loan crisis tying in bushs 
switch on taxes by saying he wants to use the increased revenues to 
bail out failed thrifts 
the democrats borrowing a page from gop political handbooks 
got out front in the sampl political debate and republicans spent 
much of thursday trying to mount a counteroffensive 
the gop strategists sought to frame the next round of the tax 
debate saying bushs concession on taxes was a tough but bold move 
that democrats should acknowledge by supporting cuts in programs 
like social security and other entitlements long favored by 
democrats 
now is the time to turn the focus of the american people to 
the democrats teeter said 
he also tried to allay the fears of republicans who believe that 
including any income tax increase in a deficit reduction plan would 
be devastating to the gop 
privately the senior republican officials are telling the rnc 
members the white house will oppose any attempt to raise income 
taxes teeter was less specific in his public comments but he said 
bush will not support he will not sign he will not agree to any 
deal that is not a good deal for our country and for our economy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
vice president dan quayle today made the same assurance in 
prepared remarks for a luncheon speech to the rnc 
his bushs position is simple quayle said a good deal 
or no deal at all 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
it was clear that gop strategists came to this twoday meeting 
aiming to get the party back on the attack this falls elections 
are vital to gop hopes of eroding the democratic majority in 
congress and boosting their influence in postcensus redistricting 
we have a tremendous opportunity as a party if we dont go on 
the defensive said ed rollins chairman of the national 
republican congressional committee 
most of his lengthy speech was aimed at blunting the democratic 
attacks on over the sampl crisis which now often include references 
to the troubles of bushs son neil who is under investigation for 
his role as a director of a failed colorado thrift 
rollins said democrats in congress resisted early reagan and 
bush administration efforts to clean up the troubled industry 
because of the financial support they were getting from sampl 
interests 
for a few million dollars in campaign contributions the 
democrats sold out the taxpayers rollins said 
rollins did not say so but many of the sampl executives he 
identified as big democratic donors also gave heavily to republican 
causes including one who gave 100000 to the gops 1988 
presidential campaign 
rollins speech was barely over when the democrats countered in 
what has became an escalating rhetorical war over blame for the 
300 billionplus debacle in democratic chairman ron browns 
words the greatest ripoff in american history 
said brown were not surprised that casino economy 
republicans who gambled us into this whole mess are whining and 
scapegoating every step of the way 
meanwhile republican national chairman lee atwater who has 
been battling a lifethreatening brain tumor for the past four 
months was quoted in todays washington post as saying he has been 
urging party leaders and the white house to go on the offensive 
and be more aggressive in challenging democrats on issues such as 
the sampl scandal 
atwater remained in washington during the party meeting

discovery of the gene linked to the elephant 
mans disease may be too late to help porter colley but the 
massachusetts woman whose tumorcovered face is a mark of the 
disease says that at last there is hope 
ms colley speaking thursday at a news conference with 
researchers who have isolated the disease gene said the most 
wrenching part of being one of 100000 americans with 
neurofibromatosis was the bleak sense that nothing could be done 
the discovery of the neurofibromatosis or nf gene changes all 
that and raises for the first time the possibility that the 
untreatable disorder may eventually be understood and controlled 
the most painful feeling has been that there was no hope for 
progress in nf research she said television lights glinting off 
the globular masses scarring her face it was almost as if people 
with nf had been singled out for a particularly cruel life 
with the isolation of the nf gene she said now there is real 
hope 
it may not change the tumors i have said ms colley her 
voice unsteady but to know along with others with nf that we 
have reason to hope is to know that we are full participants in the 
human experience 
research teams from the university of michigan and the 
university of utah discovered the nf gene virtually at the same 
time and both are publishing their results today in journals 
dr francis collins head of the michigan research team said it 
may be years before the gene discovery leads to new therapy for the 
disease which affects one in every 4000 newborns but he said 
tests may be developed fairly soon to genetically identify 
youngsters with the disease or couples who may give birth to nf 
children 
we have pried open the black box of neurofibromatosis and are 
peering inside collins said 
the codiscoverer of the gene was a utah team led by raymond 
white 
collins published his study in science the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science and whites 
report was in the magazine cell 
for collins it was the second major gene discovery in 11 months 
he was a codiscoverer of the cystic fibrosis gene last august 
for twothirds of nf patients the symptoms are mild skin 
discoloration for the rest the disease causes tumors that can pop 
up anywhere in the body but always on nerve tissue the tumor 
growth can raise large globular masses on the face trunk or limbs 
and can distort growing bones causing crippling or misalignment of 
the skull 
symptoms often appear in early childhood although many cases 
dont become known until the patient is in puberty 
ms colley said she has undergone numerous operations for 
removal of tumors including one in her neck the size of a turkey 
egg that almost killed her 
nf was once inaccurately known as the elephant mans disease 
because it was believed to be the cause of the deformities on john 
merrick a 19th century englishman whose life was portrayed in a 
play and a movie experts have since determined however that 
merrick had another disorder proteus syndrome 
but ms colley said many nf patients suffer the same social 
isolation that affected the elephant man 
ive been called the elephant man and ive been called mrs 
merrick she said the movie on the elephant man did help in 
public understanding and i am grateful to john merrick for that 
collins said finding the nf gene can be compared to locating a 
house somewhere in the united states after starting out without an 
address or even a hint of the right state 
earlier researchers he said mapped the nf gene to chromosome 
17 which was like finding the right state but that still left 
thousands of possible locations 
wed still be slogging around if it hadnt been for the 
identification of two crucial patients who have nf said collins 
they were found to have breaks in chromosome 17 at the same place 
and in an area where the other work had narrowed the search 
those translocations chromosome breaks actually interrupted 
the gene itself and therefore provided crucial landmarks he 
said the gene interruption meant that there was a mutation that 
could be related to nf 
collins said all normal human cells have the nf gene and the 
disease occurs only when the gene is mutated in some way this 
mutation may be passed from parent to child with a 5050 chance of 
inheritance but just as frequently the mutation occurs 
spontaneously

except when asked about his son neils 
business problems or his own relaxed view of global warming 
president bush is rarely as agitated as when he is challenged on 
his policy toward china 
having served a oneyear stint as head of the us liaison 
office before there were formal diplomatic relations and 
fullfledged ambassadors bush fancies himself an expert on the 
complex land that has perplexed westerners for centuries 
he doesnt appreciate being questioned about his moves on china 
and especially resents the widely held notion that he is soft on 
beijing 
they are wrong was bushs answer this week to those who 
detected a double standard in supporting loans to china but 
opposing more than technical assistance to the soviet union 
the pressure is still on he said during the houston 
economic summit 
yet when it comes to china bush is feeling his way lurching 
from respectful deference to the leaders of the worlds most 
populous country to criticism of their record on human rights 
universal disgust with the brutal treatment of prodemocracy 
forces in beijing in june 1989 drove bush into sanctions that he 
was reluctant to impose 
he then joined leaders of the seven industrial democracies who 
in july 1989 adopted a declaration freezing most loans to china and 
offering extended visas to chinese students 
but that same month without any sign of change in china bush 
undercut his own sanctions by secretly dispatching brent scowcroft 
his national security adviser and lawrence eagleburger the deputy 
secretary of state to beijing for highlevel talks 
that trip and another in december by the two officials assured 
chinese leaders that whatever their record on human rights the 
united states under bush would not seek to isolate them after the 
uprising thousands of political prisoners were jailed in china 
most without specific charges 
at the houston summit bush joined in giving japan a free hand 
to resume a 56 billion loan program to china also the seven 
democracies authorized the world bank to consider other loans 
at a news conference bush said those actions did not mean the 
sanctions imposed in paris had been lifted the loans the world 
bank will consider deal with the environment and with promoting 
reform in china he said 
we have offered the hope that if they take further steps in 
the human rights field more can be done the president said 
he said he wants china to move forward and i want to see 
restored good relations with china but we are not there yet 
hundreds of political prisoners have been released but hundreds 
of others remain in jail it is hard to tell how many said alan 
romberg senior fellow for asia at the private council on foreign 
relations in new york because the chinese do not keep lists of 
their prisoners 
last month the bestknown dissident fang lizhi and his wife 
li shuxian were allowed to leave china after spending more than a 
year sheltered in the us embassy in beijing 
romberg said thursday that there are signs the chinese will 
release pretty near everyone else in the near future 
romberg a former state department official credited bush with 
a policy that overall has been correct but also is far from 
perfect in execution 
he faulted bush for the way he handled visas for chinese 
students the president first vetoed legislation to permit the 
students to remain in the united states then used his executive 
powers to allow them to remain 
but romberg praised bush and the other leaders for maintaining a 
firm line against most bank loans to china he said the decision in 
houston to let the world bank consider loans that promote economic 
reform was a modest step forward and not what the chinese want 
the chinese wanted last years summit ban on loans lifted 
bushs next test on china will come in congress 
in may responding to urgent appeals from beijing he extended 
for a year what is called mostfavorednation status that means 
imports from china are not priced out of the market with 
artificially high us tariffs 
congress has until aug 31 to pass a resolution disapproving the 
decision at stake is 18 billion a year in uschina trade 
meanwhile the house appropriations and banking committees have 
passed legislation to deduct the us share of any world bank loans 
to china that are not made on the basis of basic human needs 
the outcome will depend on whether congress can figure out where 
bush stands on china and if that stand is considered tough enough

the nations wheat crop this year is a 
whopper despite floods in some areas and drought in others the 
agriculture department says 
all told the crop may be about 27 billion bushels a sixyear 
high and 33 percent more than last years harvest the department 
said thursday 
this would be the largest crop since 1982 and the third 
largest on record the department said in a report 
it will be a nearrecord production at that records show the 
biggest us wheat crops were backtoback in 1981 with 279 
billion bushels and 1982 with 277 billion 
and if winter wheat yields had improved in june instead of 
deteriorating it would have been even closer 
new production estimates for the first time this season included 
durum and other springplanted wheat in addition to winter wheat 
planted last fall 
the departments agricultural statistics board said the average 
yield based on indications as of july 1 was estimated at 386 
bushels per acre compared with 328 bushels last year 
farmers are expected to harvest about 70 million acres of wheat 
this year also the most since 1982 the 1989 crop was from 621 
million harvested acres 
the departments first official estimate of 1990 corn soybeans 
and some other major springplanted crops will be issued aug 9 
along with an updated estimate of wheat production 
winter wheat production was estimated at 204 billion bushels 
down 3 percent from the june forecast but up 40 percent from the 
1989 harvest winter wheat makes up about threefourths of the us 
total 
yields in many of the winter wheat states are down from the june 
forecast especially in illinois and missouri the report said the 
huge kansas crop at 4602 million bushels was unchanged from last 
month 
durum wheat production was estimated at 114 million bushels up 
24 percent from last year and other spring wheat was indicated at 
549 million bushels up 12 percent from 1989 
north dakota the biggest durum producer was estimated at 976 
million bushels compared with 66 million bushels last year the 
states production of other spring wheat also the largest was 
estimated at 2544 million bushels up from 174 million in 1989 
government crop watchers said earlier this week that the 
nations wheat harvest was 71 percent completed by july 8 slightly 
ahead of the fiveyear average for this time 
the july report also estimated barley production at 414 million 
bushels up 3 percent from last year yields were indicated at 534 
bushels per acre up 49 bushels from 1989 
oat production was estimated at 375 million bushels virtually 
the same as last year with average yields at 602 bushels per 
acre compared with last seasons 544 bushels 
fluecured tobacco production was forecast at 856 million 
pounds up 6 percent from last year reflecting a larger acreage 
in a related supplyanddemand report highly tentative 
projections of 1990 production of corn showed the fall harvest 
might total 785 billion bushels 
that would be down from the 81 billion bushels projected in 
june but still larger than the 1989 harvest of 753 billion 
bushels 
soybean production also was projected down 186 billion 
bushels against 193 billion projected in june last years output 
was about 193 billion bushels about what had been projected in 
june for 1990 
the analysis showed wheat prices at the farm in 199091 may 
average in the range of 280 to 320 per bushel down 10 cents 
from the june forecast last season wheat prices averaged 372 
per bushel 
corn prices reflecting tighter supplies were projected to 
average 250 to 290 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year up 
15 cents from june they are expected to be in the range of 235 
to 240 in 198990 
soybean prices were projected at 550 to 675 per bushel a 
50cent increase from the range last month the 198990 price was 
estimated at 570 per bushel 
cotton production was projected at 15 million bales down 1 
million bales from the june outlook primarily because of 
extremely hot dry conditions which have reduced prospective 
harvested acreage and trimmed potential yields in texas the 
report said 
no price information was projected for 199091 cotton

the agriculture department has scheduled an 
extended public hearing on the governments milk pricing apparatus 
this fall in six cities 
john e frydenlund deputy assistant secretary for marketing and 
inspection services said thursday the hearing will focus on issues 
that are national in scope 
the hearing will be held between sept 5 and oct 15 in eau 
claire wis minneapolis minn st cloud minn syracuse ny 
tallahassee fla and irving texas 
department officials on march 29 invited public comments and 
suggestions on what the hearing agenda should include frydenlund 
said more than 130 proposals were received by the may 31 deadline 
the hearing will involve the milk pricing provisions used in all 
federal marketing orders the system used to set minimum prices for 
milk that dealers must pay farmers 
although the marketing orders do not set retail milk prices the 
minimums specified at the farm level are felt through the marketing 
chain 
on the hearing agenda he said are proposals for establishing 
prices for class i drinking milk and class ii milk used to make 
soft products such as cottage cheese yogurt and ice cream 
the proposals call for establishing a uniform system of 
classifying milk by its uses and for changing regulations on 
reconstituted milk milk that has had its water removed in one of 
several ways and to which water is added later

what the justice department calls fairly 
routine the american civil liberties union calls a violation of 
the first amendment rights of a group lobbying for an end to 
military aid to el salvador 
the department wrote the national agenda for peace in el 
salvador in june asking it to describe the nature of its 
activities for or in the interests of the salvadoran leftist 
rebel group farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln and 
whether its activities were financed or directed by a foreign 
organization 
the departments letter said a newspaper advertisement in may 
sponsored by national agenda indicates that you are engaged in 
publicity activities on behalf of the fmln 
the ad called on congress to end military aid to el salvador as 
a way to force a political solution to the decadeold civil war and 
to push for action against whoever was responsible for the murder 
late last year of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter 
the head of the threemember washington staff of national 
agenda geoffrey thale told a news conference thursday our view 
clearly is that were not foreign agents and not subject to the 
act asked if national agenda receives money from anyone in el 
salvador thale replied no and if you could see our office 
youd know we dont get enough money from anybody 
the department has no statutory authority to ask such questions 
morton halperin director of the washington office of the aclu 
said even if it did he said we believe it would be a violation 
of the first amendment rights of americans to petition the 
government for a redress of grievances 
at the justice department spokesman doug tillett said it 
sounds to me like an overreaction on their part 
the request itself is fairly routine he added 
the aclu released a letter from two house subcommittee chairmen 
to attorney general dick thornburgh asking for information about 
the inquiry 
there is nothing in the ad to indicate that the group is 
engaged in activities on behalf of any foreign principal said 
the letter from reps robert w kastenmeier dwis and don 
edwards dcalif 
they noted the only two references to the fmln in the ad were 
coupled with references to the el salvador government in a 
discussion of the fitful peace negotiations between the two sides 
it would seem equally logical to conclude that national agenda is 
engaged in publicity activities on behalf of the government of el 
salvador the congressmen wrote 
in the house judiciary committee kastenmeier chairs the 
subcommittee on courts intellectual property and the 
administration of justice and edwards chairs the subcommittee on 
civil and constitutional rights 
national agenda was formed at the 1988 democratic national 
convention in atlanta by a group of delegates seeking to bring 
visibility to the issue

the sandinistaled strike forced 
concessions that left the governments freeenterprise plan 
bleeding the business community says but the sandinistas 
celebrated what they called a preservation of the gains of their 
revolution 
the crippling strike was settled thursday with an accord that 
grants hefty wage hikes to government workers and puts some key 
elements of the new administrations plan to return nicaragua to a 
freemarket economy on hold 
the accord also calls for suspension of a decree to return land 
confiscated in the 1979 sandinista revolution to the original 
owners former president daniel ortega says sandinista land reform 
was a basic conquest of the revolution 
president violeta barrios de chamorro and her aides have said 
the settlement prevented more bloodshed and unrest and made it 
possible for nicaragua to get back down to business 
during the last six days of the strike street fighting broke 
out between strike supporters and opponents claiming at least four 
lives and turning the capital into a maze of bonfires and 
barricades 
ortega unseated by mrs chamorros usbacked united national 
opposition coalition in feb 25 elections said the strike showed 
the sandinistas still wield considerable power in nicaragua 
but the nations business leaders were busy counting up the 
costs 
the government lost the sandinistas lost the people lost 
said gilberto cuadra president of the nations leading business 
group the superior council of private enterprise 
the business council known by its spanish acronym cosep 
described the walkouts by public employees an attempt to 
destabilize the government a charge ortega denied 
it wasnt a strike it was mob action cuadra said in an 
interview thursday 
he said cosep estimates economic damage at between 35 million 
and 50 million in lost business property damage and diminished 
crops 
central bank president francisco mayorga had earlier said the 
strike was costing about 2 million a day 
about 95000 workers mostly from federal offices and staterun 
farms walked off their jobs demanding more participation in 
economic policy making and job security sandinista union leaders 
said 
the strike hit during the planting season and cuadra said the 
cotton crop crucial to this agricultural nation may be 30 percent 
less than expected 
a sharp rise in agricultural exports is a key factor in the new 
administrations economic recovery program 
mrs chamorro who inherited a bankrupt government and a 
crippled economy has promised to reverse more than a decade of 
leftist sandinista rule with measures such as privatization and 
trimming a bloated public payroll 
the sandinistas who held power for more than a decade after the 
uprising that ousted dictator anastasio somoza have waged a 
campaign of labor unrest since mrs chamorros april 25 
inauguration 
cosep condemned the government for giving in to what it called 
sandinista blackmail after the strike turned violent over the 
weekend 
ortega and the nicaraguan human rights commission said at least 
four people died and at least a score were injured in armed 
confrontations between strikers and government supporters union 
leaders claimed at least six people were killed in the fighting 
the transmission tower of the private radio corporacion was 
bombed vehicles were burned and thousands of paving stones ripped 
up to build barricades 
the government settled the strike which it had declared 
illegal with an accord giving 65000 government workers a 43 
percent raise this month and another unspecified raise in august 
it also agreed to put on hold plans to return some confiscated 
farms to prerevolutionary owners and opened the door to some 
degree of powersharing with workers 
cuadra said the agreement had left the economic recovery plan 
bleeding and thrown cold water on hopes that investors 
would put money into postrevolutionary nicaragua 
but ortega said thursday that the sandinistas dont welcome any 
investors who hope to reclaim land or businesses confiscated after 
the 1979 revolution he portrayed the strike as a sandinista 
victory that had preserved fundamental revolutionary gains 
cosep says the strike accord diluted mrs chamorros authority 
shes lost confidence and power cuadra said 
but mrs chamorro says the fact that the sandinistadominated 
army and obeyed her orders constituted a vote of confidence

bomb building in the 1940s could have been exposed to large doses 
of radioactive iodine 
for a few infants the doses were as high as 2900 rad over 
three years one rad is the amount of radiation a body organ would 
absorb from about a dozen chest xrays 
sen john glenn dohio said the findings underscore the need 
for the energy department to make public its secret records of 
health risks at all doe sites nationwide he said he was 
surprised and disturbed by the results of the dose 
reconstruction study at hanford 
the study suggests that the hanford residents may have been 
exposed to more radioactive iodine than from any industrial nuclear 
facility in the world he said 
sen brock adams dwash said the energy department should 
launch a major campaign to help locate people who may have been 
exposed to the radiation 
the number of curries released over all these years are 
comparable to the levels released in chernobyl in the soviet 
union the missing link is where are the people who were 
exposed adams said 
if we find these people around the country and if there has 
been injury then the government should compensate them for it 
adams said 
rep norm dicks dwash said if it can be proven that people 
were injured as a result of the emissions it would be only fair 
to compensate them 
sen mark hatfield rore said the high doses of radiation 
exposure during the 1940s suggests a study into thyroid disease 
should begin immediately 
however he added radioactive materials have leaked from 
existing storage tanks at hanford as recently as last month i 
fear the public is left with the impression that the only threat at 
hanford existed 30 years ago 
some members of congress are pushing to remove the energy 
departments oversight authority of health and environmental safety 
at nuclear weapons plants 
rep ron wyden dore and sen tim wirth dcolo have 
proposed bills to establish independent oversight of does weapons 
facilities through the department of health and human services 
i think that because the federal government has misled the 
people of the pacific northwest that unless there are truly 
independent decisions being made on health and safety the citizens 
of the northwest are going to doubt the departments credibility 
wyden said 
energy secretary james watkins said his department is preparing 
to enter an interagency agreement that would transfer some 
radiation research activities from doe to hhs

marijuana laws will remain a low 
priority in this city of 60s loveins and leftist politics after 
antipot activists failed in a try at stiffening enforcement 
black leaders and others this week didnt gather enough 
signatures for a november ballot measure that would let voters 
repeal a 1979 law directing police to make marijuana busts their 
lowest priority 
opponents of that law argued that it sends youngsters the wrong 
message about drugs proponents contended marijuana does not 
necessarily lead to harder drugs 
i think this shows the depth of indifference to any 
antimarijuana movement said dale grierginger california 
coordinator of the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws or norml 
originally the ordinance was sort of a declaration of 
principle that marijuana use was no big deal he said 
enforcing marijuana laws is certainly not a priority with the 
public and certainly not in berkeley 
jim smith president of the black property owners association 
which led the drive to repeal the law said he plans another try in 
1992 
drugs have become a very devastating problem here he said 
we dont feel we can tell our kids say no to some drugs but 
not to others 
smith and his followers did not make the tuesday deadline for 
submitting the required 2304 signatures to put the initiative on 
the ballot in this community of 106000 residents the city clerks 
office said the petition drive fell 222 signatures short 
the 1979 law makes enforcement of marijuana laws the lowest 
priority for police it also commits the city to work for 
legalization and legal private cultivation of the drug 
about 70 percent of the citys voters approved the ordinance 
which grew out of the freewheeling age of aquarius typified by 
berkeley a site of antiwar student protests loveins leftist 
politics and flower power 
berkeley was the hallmark of progressive movement in the 
nation city manager michael brown said i think what has 
happened though is some young liberals have become old 
conservatives 
charles henderson program director at first step foundation a 
berkeley drug treatment center said the ordinance sends mixed 
signals to children 
they hear adults in authority talk about this and it creates 
confusion he said 
grierginger said marijuana does not necessarily lead to harder 
drugs the history of the last decade shows precisely the 
opposite ten years ago a lot more people smoked marijuana but 
there was less drug abuse he said 
mayor loni hancock did not take a stand on the initiative 
saying it was a nonissue 
the ordinance was passed by voters at a period when there was 
great citizen concern that police were spending an inordinate 
amount of time pursuing marijuana offenses rather than other 
crimes said hancock spokeswoman peggy sullivan our main drug 
crisis is crack now and thats the police focus 
police capt waymon jenkins said the department did not take a 
position on repeal because the law doesnt affect how officers work 
most of the time 
when it comes to small amounts for personal use we just dont 
bother jenkins said but its still considered a drug and if 
someone is selling it or has large quantities of it well enforce 
the law

house and senate conferees erased a major 
obstacle to passage of oil spill protection legislation with 
agreement on a compromise to phase out most singlehull oil tankers 
over the next 20 years 
congressional leaders hoped to finish action on the bill which 
creates a 1 billion emergency oil spill response fund before the 
august recess the bill also calls for establishment of regional 
strike forces to battle oil spills 
the doublehull issue has been among the thorniest facing 
negotiators trying to resolve differences between bills passed by 
the house and senate the house had sought a phaseout of 
singlehull tankers by 2005 while the senate called only for a 
study of the issue 
but the compromise agreement reached late thursday would require 
that all new oil tankers be built with double hulls and that most 
existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or taken out of 
service between 1995 and 2010 a small number of singlehull 
tankers would be allowed to operate until 2015 
the legislation was prompted by the devastating oil spill from 
the tanker exxon valdez that in march 1989 contaminated miles of 
alaskas waters and shoreline much of the coastline has yet to be 
completely cleared of oil despite a cleanup effort that already has 
cost 2 billion according to exxon and government estimates 
approval of the compromise timetable for requiring doublehull 
tankers came in voice votes by both the house and senate members of 
the conference committee with virtually no debate 
environmental groups in a letter to the conferees earlier this 
week called a requirement for doublehull tankers the single 
most important step congress can take to prevent oil spills 
double hulls provide added protection if a tanker runs aground 
or collides with another ship a coast guard study of 30 tanker 
groundings between 1969 and 1973 determined that spills would have 
been averted in 96 percent of the cases if the vessels had double 
hulls there have been conflicting studies on what effect a double 
hull might have had on the exxon valdez spill 
environmental groups had called for a faster phaseout with all 
doublehull tankers gone by 2005 because of the longer timetable 
clifton curtis of friends of the earth characterized the 
housesenate compromise a kiss on the cheek followed by a slap 
in the face 
the bill calls for a 1 billion emergency response fund to deal 
with oil spill cleanup and establishes liability levels for spills 
the fund will comes from a 50centabarrel levy on petroleum that 
already has begun to be collected 
in addition the bill would create regional emergency response 
teams to deal with oil spills and make it easier for the government 
to take over cleanup efforts it also establishes liability levels 
for spills and toughens licensing requirements for tanker crew 
members 
congressional sources said with the doublehull issue resolved 
the longdebated legislation is likely to be approved before 
congress begins its summer recess aug 3 
sen ted stevens ralaska said the timetable likely will see 
43 percent of the tankers with double hulls by the end of the 
decade and 80 percent by the year 2005 with few exceptions all 
tankers will have to be double hulled by the year 2010 tankers 
that offload oil 60 miles outside us waters and tankers that 
already have double bottoms or sides have until 2015 to comply 
there are more than 1300 tankers of various sizes that 
transport oil in and out of the united states and between us 
ports according to congressional estimates tankers under 5000 
tons are not subject to the doublehull requirement

when the organization of african 
unity was born 27 years ago many nations on the continent were 
ruled by european powers today the countries are selfruled but 
unity peace and prosperity still elude them 
african heads of state and government who gathered this week for 
the oaus 26th summit pointed to the democratic movements that have 
swept eastern europe and expressed hopes for political reform on 
their own continent 
we recommit ourselves to the full democratization of our 
societies and to the consolidation of democratic institutions in 
our countries taking into account the realities of each of our 
countries views the leaders said in a communique wednesday at 
the end of their threeday gathering in the ethiopian capital of 
addis ababa 
but in the cases of some african leaders the pledge to 
democratize seemed like little more than lip service 
most of africas 550 million people are governed by dictators or 
live in oneparty states popular upheavals and civil wars are 
convulsing the continent and force is the most common response by 
african governments 
some african leaders were feeling too beleaguered to attend the 
oau summit 
liberian president samuel doe under siege in monrovia from 
rebels seeking to seize control did not attend the conference 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia still recovering from riots 
against food price hikes that left 26 people dead last month 
stayed away for the first time since he led his country to 
independence in 1964 
and kenyan president daniel arap moi cut short his visit and 
flew home on the first day after a weekend of rioting sparked by 
demands for a multiparty democracy in his oneparty state 
the absent leaders might have been mindful that leaving their 
own capitals could give their opponents an opening to act 
yakubu gowan of nigeria was toppled in a 1975 coup while he was 
attending an oau summit and milton obote of uganda was overthrown 
during the 1971 british commonwealth summit in singapore 
the oaus original charter pledged action to improve the living 
standards of all africans to defend sovereignity territorial 
integrity and independence and to rid the continent of all traces 
of colonialism 
the colonial powers have departed but other dreams remained 
unfulfilled 
living standards have plunged and wars rage in liberia uganda 
angola ethiopia somalia and sudan 
a common market proposed in 1980 has yet to be formed a move to 
militarily confront whiteruled south africa never materialized 
and leaders are still striving for continental unity 
of the 30 heads of state who signed the oau charter on may 25 
1963 only seven were still in power in 1980 of the others seven 
were assassinated by their own troops 17 were ousted in coups two 
died of natural causes and one bowed out of office 
some leaders conceded they felt left out of the sweeping changes 
elsewhere in the world 
it was we africans who raised high the banner of unity well 
before many regions of the world ethiopian president mengistu 
haile mairam told this weeks gathering 
but viewed against the current trend of rapid changes in the 
international scene and the movement towards harmony and unity 
among countries in various regions of the world the pace of 
progress we are making to achieve continental unity has indeed been 
very slow he said 
julius nyerere former president of tanzania lamented that 
african leaders had not followed northern industrialized nations in 
burying differences in order to improve trade and their economies 
one bright spot at the summit was the presence of nelson 
mandela the black south african nationalist leader who was in 
prison when the oau was created for many of those present 
mandelas release in february was symbolic of moves toward reform 
in south africa 
but south africas system of racial segregation has at least 
provided a rallying point for the oau states if apartheid is 
eventually dismantled some observers said the oau might not find 
much else to agree on

a bill that earmarks 27 billion for roads 
bridges airports railroads and commuter rails next year cruised 
through the house only to face a potential pothole budget talks 
we may not be able to keep this one after the budget summit 
rep lawrence coughlin rpa said thursday before the house 
passed the spending bill 38531 
the overall bill for the transportation department and related 
agencies totals 31 billion with the bulk covering money for 
various projects 
although intended to relieve crowded aging highways and 
airports the bill also contains millions for local projects in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 
rep william lehman the florida democrat whose appropriations 
subcommittee prepared the bill said the delays caused by a 
decaying transportation system cost the nation billions of 
dollars in lost working hours and in economic production 
because of ongoing negotiations between the congress and the 
white house to reduce the budget deficit the spending levels could 
change the senate has not yet taken up the bill 
under an amendment approved 33188 states would lose 2 percent 
of their federal highway dollars unless they enact laws to suspend 
or revoke for at least six months the drivers license of any 
person convicted of a drug offense 
the bill as now written gives the bush administration 107 
million less than it had sought for aviation but 1 billion more 
than was appropriated for this year 
the overall spending for transportation and related agencies 
would be 28 billion higher than this years level 
the biggest chunk goes for highways nearly 15 billion 
reflecting lehmans contention that the highway system accounts for 
nearly 90 percent of passenger miles traveled the amount is 27 
billion more than requested by the administration which lehman 
criticized for trying to shortchange rails and highways in favor of 
air transportation 
the 81 billion for the federal aviation administration 
includes a 24 percent increase over the current years level for 
facilities and equipment including doppler weather radar and 10 
million for expansion of the dallasfort worth regional airport 
the bill also provides 71 million to replace air traffic 
control facilities at chicagos ohare and midway airports and at 
helena mont kansas city mo los angeles montgomery ala 
newark nj san diego calif and st louis 
the radar funds are for columbus ohio chicagos midway 
indianapolis milwaukee san juan puerto rico oklahoma city and 
wichita kan 
the rail money 7365 million is 667 million higher than what 
the administration requested and 30 million over this years 
level it includes 482 million in subsidies for amtrak and 12 
million to study the prospects of developing a magnetic levitation 
system which would use magnets to lift and propel trains 
the 32 billion set for mass transit is more than 900 million 
above the administrations request and 156 million over this 
years level 
among the projects are 440 million in new rail systems 
including 150 million for construction in los angeles 66 million 
for st louis 45 million for san francisco 30 million for metro 
transit in houston 20 million for lightrail development in 
dallas 22 million for a skyway project in jacksonville fla and 
10 million for engineering and design of a lightrail system in 
honolulu 
an existing project the washington dc subway system would 
get 108 million

budget negotiators from the white house and 
congress expect to begin trading offers by early next week on about 
25 billion in tax boosts for next year 
bargainers from both political parties asking to remain 
anonymous said republicans could send democrats the first package 
of levies by monday it would be the first serious effort in the 
2monthold talks to tackle the most politically delicate issue 
negotiators face whose taxes will be raised and by how much 
we expect to have it in hand by early next week a democrat 
said the group will then evaluate it 
republicans said no final decisions have been made on what taxes 
the plan will include 
but one gop bargainer said it will probably contain boosts in 
excise taxes perhaps on alcohol and tobacco products as well as a 
cut in the capital gains tax rate it is unlikely to contain a 
boost in income tax rates which many republicans have adamantly 
opposed the official said 
in recent days participants in the talks and lobbyists have 
said that broad energy taxes also stand a good chance of emerging 
from the negotiations 
budget summit sessions today and thursday were canceled so 
bargainers from the two parties could meet separately to formulate 
strategies negotiators are searching for at least 50 billion in 
spending cuts and tax boosts for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
in an effort to shrink a budget shortfall that will otherwise hit 
at least 160 billion 
on thursday republicans discussed a list of 70 to 80 possible 
tax increases but made no decisions on which should be included in 
any package said sen bob packwood rore one of the negotiators 
packwood said the republicans talked about taxes on sales of 
stocks and on tobacco alcohol energy and luxury items 
also thursday house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia 
said it was arrogant and outrageous for senate democratic 
leader george mitchell to demand higher income tax rates for 
wealthy americans in exchange for a gopsought cut in the capital 
gains levy 
gingrich the no 2 house republican leader said mitchells 
stance threatens the budget talks 
mitchell dmaine said wednesday that if president bush refused 
to accept a boost in the income tax rates paid by the nations 
richest wageearners there would be no deal to cut the capital 
gains tax rate 
bush has sought a reduction in the capital gains tax since his 
presidential campaign the tax is paid on the profits from the 
sales of property such as real estate and stocks 
republicans say reducing the tax will encourage property sales 
and thus allow the government to collect additional money 
democrats say the idea would increase tax collections immediately 
but be a longrange moneyloser 
on the house floor and at a later news conference gingrich said 
budget bargainers had agreed that everything would be negotiable 
i think it was a stupid mistake he said of mitchells 
demand i think it is arrogant and outrageous i think he should 
withdraw it 
gingrich who is one of the budget negotiators added if 
thats his nonnegotiable position i dont see any reason to walk 
into a room with him 
asked if he would boycott the talks gingrich said i dont 
know well have to wait and see how irrationally obstructive 
george mitchell wants to be 
mitchell declined to respond to gingrich a spokesman said 
the senator will continue to discuss the substance of issues but 
will not engage in a namecalling contest with someone like rep 
gingrich

a prosecution witness at marion barrys trial 
says he doesnt think cocaine possession is a crime while another 
told the jury the mayor was a victim of entrapment 
the statements came thursday from two longtime friends of the 
mayor who were testifying reluctantly for the government 
both men said they had possessed cocaine and distributed it to 
barry they arent being charged because of their assistance to the 
government 
i thought use of cocaine was a personal matter said jeffrey 
mitchell an advertising executive who worked on barrys mayoral 
campaigns 
mitchell testified that he and the mayor snorted cocaine on at 
least 10 occasions from 1985 to 1987 in most instances mitchell 
said he was the one who supplied the cocaine 
you dont feel you committed a crime mitchell was asked 
under the circumstances that went down no mitchell replied 
mitchell said he thought distribution of cocaine was a crime 
but didnt think his own actions necessarily constituted 
distribution 
but barrys chief lawyer r kenneth mundy pointed out that 
mitchell gave cocaine to his friends and that is a crime 
i guess technically yeah mitchell conceded 
mitchell testified that barry was taking drugs and drinking 
heavily before he was rushed to a hospital by ambulance during a 
super bowl party in los angeles in 1987 
mitchell said he found barry collapsed on a living room chair 
complaining that he was having trouble breathing 
the mayor was making sniffing noises as he had done in the past 
after using cocaine said mitchell 
he and the mayor had smoked a marijuana cigarette the day of the 
party and barry drank four bottles of champagne a fifth of cognac 
and some wine said mitchell 
after an ambulance rushed barry to the hospital and oxygen was 
administered barry felt better and said he didnt want any 
tests mitchell testified he said the mayor then left the 
emergency room 
mitchell said he refused to give cocaine to the mayor when he 
had city duties to perform i love marion barry he said 
darrell sabbs testified that he and barry snorted cocaine four 
times 
sabbs said he worked for barry on different city assignments 
over the years and had developed almost a fatherson 
relationship with the mayor 
sabbs came to washington on jan 19 to be on hand for barrys 
planned announcement that he would seek reelection 
the announcement was never made because barry was arrested in an 
fbi sting operation the previous night 18 and charged with cocaine 
possession 
by the time sabbs got to washington there had been this 
entrap sting or whatever he told the jury 
the spectators in the courtroom chuckled over sabbs reference 
to entrapment the defense barry is using in seeking acquittal on 
the fbi sting the mayor was videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
he is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession one count of 
conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury 
meanwhile thursday another us district court jury acquitted 
david rivers former head of the citys human services department 
on bribery and conspiracy charges in connection with the awarding 
of 2 million in city contracts 
rivers had been charged with steering contracts to the firms of 
friends or companies headed by his codefendant and barry 
associate developer john b clyburn the jury reported it was 
still deliberating charges against clyburn 
in the barry trial a witness alleged that rivers and the mayor 
used cocaine together

two million older sheep will be killed 
in controlled shootings around the country to thin out the 
countrys sheep population estimated at a record 175 million head 
officials said today 
farmers said they will begin the mass shootings as early as next 
week because many old ewes held over when wool prices were higher 
are now being sold for as little as 10 cents each 
its sad but some of the sheep arent worth as much as a 
bullet said one farmer who was not identified earth movers will 
likely be used to dig trenches to bury the sheep other farmers 
said 
more than a million of the sheep will be killed in western 
australia state while several hundred thousand are expected to be 
shot in new south wales state and the remainder in other areas of 
the country 
rob sewell spokesman for the new south wales farmers 
association says most of the sheep to be killed are over the age 
of 7 theyve outlived their breeding purposes and are too old 
for commercial production either for their wool or mutton sewell 
said 
this really is the only humane way out of the problem now 
said dr hugh wirth president of australias royal society for the 
prevention of cruelty to animals who said he will urge tight 
government controls over the shootings 
he said the sheep population crisis which had been forecast 
several years ago had intensified recently when the floor price of 
australian wool was lowered and when live sheep trade to the middle 
east was disrupted due to diseased shipments 
there were a record 175 million head of sheep in australia as of 
march of this year a spokesman for australian bureau of statistics 
said today 
there are a lot of old sheep around many of them that cannot 
be shorn anymore said bureau spokesperson elisabeth davis she 
said the last reported mass killings of sheep for which no figures 
are available occurred in 197273 when stocks were again too large 
wirth who said recent bids at sales had only received from 10 
to 20 cents a head said australias rural community had not paid 
enough attention to the sheep problem 
weve been warning them for years he said it seems there 
really isnt any other alternative but the bullet although we 
believe the industry must urgently explore alternatives 
kevin sheil executivedirector of the sheepmeat council of 
australia said the industry had been looking at ways of avoiding 
the problem by promoting mutton sales overseas but those sales are 
also down including a 12 million us shipment due to be sent 
to the soviet union in two weeks that was canceled by moscow 
we understand that the public may be distressed to hear that 
sheep may have to be destroyed said sheil but the public must 
understand that the farmers are also disturbed at the possibility 
of shooting their own sheep

evan mecham can run for governor again this fall 
despite being impeached and removed from the office in 1988 
arizonas supreme court ruled 
voters not the courts should decide whether the former 
governor is worthy of holding public office again the states 
highest court ruled thursday in unanimously rejecting a challenge 
to mechams comeback bid 
impeachment essentially a political process is not subject 
to judicial review the justices said any appeal from the 
impeachment conviction lies in the electoral process 
mecham was convicted by the state senate of misusing about 
80000 given him by supporters and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat against an aide 
he is one of five candidates seeking the republican nomination 
in the sept 11 primary 
mecham has a small but extremely loyal following and could win 
the primary if the turnout is low and the other republicans 
splinter the vote a pollster said 
i dont think hes a leader in the race right now but hes 
still a contender said earl de berge of the behavior research 
center in phoenix his hard core is hard core and everything 
depends on turnout 
but de barge said mecham almost certainly would lose the general 
election 
a retired arizona highway patrol officer dennis ingram had 
challenged mechams right to hold office again saying the state 
constitution automatically barred him from doing so because of his 
impeachment and ouster 
mecham 66 contended the ban was not automatic he noted that 
the senate specifically failed to prohibit him from running again 
the justices said the constitution was not clear on that point 
and election the ultimate weapon of democracy is favored where 
any doubt exists 
mecham campaigning in yuma thursday evening was jubilant 
the court made the only decision that we could see that they 
could make he said 
we appreciate that and now lets get on with the election and 
let the people do the choosing of who their next governors going 
to be and get on with solving the critical problems of the state 
ingram said through his lawyer michael meehan that he was 
disappointed in the 50 decision 
mecham has said he believes a political opponent was behind 
ingrams challange meehan denied it ingram has declined to 
discuss his motivation for filing the challenge 
mecham won the governorship on his fifth try in 1986 while in 
office the former auto dealer offended blacks hispanics jews and 
women with inflammatory remarks but he remained popular with many 
conservatives 
gov rose mofford a democrat who as secretary of state 
automatically succeeded mecham upon his removal is stepping down 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard is the only major democratic 
candidate 
the senate convicted mecham by a twothirds vote but came up 
three votes short of a twothirds majority when it considered a 
dracula clause that would have banned him from holding public 
office 
vice chief justice stanley feldman writing for the court said 
the constitution left it unclear whether the separate vote on the 
dracula clause was even needed or whether the conviction vote 
automatically meant mecham could never hold office again 
given the uncertainty he wrote it is best to leave it to the 
will of the people

angry over government plans to revamp 
the nations broadcast system four opposition lawmakers quit 
hundreds of broadcast workers walked out and radical students 
clashed with police 
the lawmakers resignations capped a week of controversy over 
governmentsponsored bills which restructure the nations broadcast 
industry and the militarys operational command 
opposition groups claim the government of president roh taewoo 
is railroading the bills through the legislature 
broadcast union leaders claim the bills are timed to strengthen 
the governments grip on broadcasting prior to next years national 
elections 
they say the bills will effectively allow the government to 
control ownership and censor programming of broadcast networks 
the government claims the bills are aimed at rejuvenating south 
koreas broadcast industry introducing new programming and 
allowing the formation of new privately owned stations and cable 
television 
in the provincial capital of kwangju about 200 radical students 
hurling firebombs at a government building today were dispersed by 
riot police firing tear gas said the joongang daily news 
evil laws students shouted according to the reprot 
hundreds of broadcast workers shouting antigovernment slogans 
walked off the job today at munwha broadcast corp television 
also a strike vote was being taken among 5000 union workers at 
the staterun korean broadcasting system co the largest of the 
countrys three networks 
most of mbcs news programs were shortened or canceled and 
senior management officials took over programming jobs the network 
said 
a statement released by the four lawmakers charged that the 
assembly has become a rubberstamping body to pass undemocratic 
administrationsponsored law bills 
they said it was the result of a merger of president rohs 
governing party with two conservative opposition parties in 
february the merger gave the new party control of 218 of the total 
299 votes 
opposition lawmakers dissidents and radical students have 
called the merger a political coup 
under the law lawmakers resignations are subject to consent 
through plenary session voting when the assembly is in session the 
assembly was not expected to vote before its current session ends 
monday 
when the broadcasting bills were passed by committee on 
wednesday governing party members ignored procedural norms and 
used a quick standing vote a scuffle broke out and one lawmaker 
was injured 
many koreans eager for more choice in programs watch japanese 
satellite television and the american military television the 
government views both as cultural erosion 
south korean media came under strict government control in 1980 
after disgraced former president chun doohwan seized power chun 
closed private networks and placed virtually all radio and 
television stations under state management 
roh succeeded chun in 1988 and has introduced press freedom and 
other reforms networks have aired news reports critical of the 
government 
in april about 5000 kbs workers staged a strike to challenge 
the head of the network who had been appointed by roh they 
demanded a more reformminded figure run the network riot police 
were used to squelch the 19day strike

many cancer patients in the united states are 
increasingly likely to survive but for about 30000 hit by throat 
and mouth cancer every year the chances are roughly 5050 and not 
getting any better 
oral and pharynx cancers killed 9742 americans in 1987 the 
latest year for which statistics are available the national 
centers for disease control reported thursday 
that fatality rate 36 deaths per 100000 people is 
unchanged from 1973 said cdc dental health specialist linda 
crossett 
but the survival rate hasnt changed much since then either the 
atlantabased disease center said 
only 52 percent of oral cancer patients survive five years or 
more thats in contrast to the survival rates for breast prostate 
and colorectal cancers which are improving officials said 
survival rates are lowest for blacks and getting worse 
statistics for 1981 through 1986 showed that just 31 percent of 
black patients survived oral cancer compared with 35 percent in 
197476 
for white patients the survival rates have remained more 
constant 53 percent from 1981 through 1986 down from 55 percent 
during 197476 
were not making a lot of progress crossett said adding 
that about 30000 new cases a year are diagnosed in the united 
states 
major risk factors for oral cancer include use of tobacco 
either smoked or smokeless and drinking 
the combined risks from tobacco and alcohol use appear to be 
substantially greater than those from tobacco or alcohol alone 
the cdc said in its weekly report 
the increased use of tobacco among women adolescents and 
children as compared to a decline in smoking overall is 
likely to elevate death rates for these cancers in the next several 
decades the report said 
another major reason for oral cancer deaths is the fact that 
there has not been any improvement in early detection crossett 
said most are only detected after theyve grown pretty 
large so advanced that its obvious 
dentists traditionally have been most likely to perform 
extensive oral exams but the cdc documented in 1986 that people at 
highest risk for oral cancer seek the services of a physician four 
times more often than a dentist 
and many people going to their physician may not get a 
thorough oral head and neck exam crossett said

albanian refugees who escaped 
europes last stronghold of communism hope that even in their tiny 
country the days of oneparty rule are numbered 
a group of 51 albanians who had sought refuge in the 
czechoslovak embassy in the albanian capital tirana were 
transported to prague early monday on czechoslovak president vaclav 
havels plane 
they were the first of about 4500 asylumseekers sheltering in 
foreign embassies allowed to leave their country they speculate 
that the exodus could be the harbinger of the demise of communism 
in their abandoned country 
hundreds more refugees arrived in italy by ship today 
i give communism in my country one or two years said kola 
a 36yearold construction worker who is housed together with the 
other refugees in a workers barracks on the outskirts of prague 
like others he declined to give his full name out of fear of 
possible reprisals against his family at home 
it was intolerable we all dreaded the isolation kola said 
in fairly fluent italian he was one of the few who spoke anything 
but albanian 
kola claimed he spent five years in jail for publicly 
criticizing the late albanian leader enver hoxha 
some people spent up to 40 years in jail for similar 
offenses he added 
during his 40 years of leadership hoxha steered his country 
into increasing isolation internationally and suppressed dissent to 
maintain absolute rule of the communists 
the countrys current leader ramiz alia who took over after 
hoxhas death in 1985 has opened his country considerably to the 
outside world and initiated some modest reforms mostly in the 
economy but he has rejected any farreaching political changes 
other refugees confirmed that the leadership continues to 
exercise a tight grip on its peoples freedoms 
residents of tirana are not permitted to travel further than 25 
miles out of town without a special permit they said and the 
omnipresent secret police known as sigurimi kept a close watch 
over their private lives 
the romanian securitate was like the salvation army compared 
to them kola said he was referring to the hated secret police 
of romanias ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who was 
executed after his overthrow by a bloody revolution 
the reference to the romanian securitate indicated that kola and 
other albanians were able to keep themselves informed of what was 
happening in the world despite the tight reigns on the 
communistrun press in albania 
kola said his knowledge of havel garnered from foreign 
broadcasts that can be received in tirana was one reason for his 
choosing the czechoslovak embassy to seek refuge 
everybody listens to italian and yugoslav radio in tirana and 
we knew very well what happened in czechoslovakia he said 
but he admitted his reasons were not merely political quite 
frankly the fence around the czechoslovak embassy was one of the 
lowest too he laughed 
when the albanian refugees arrived at the ruzyne airport in 
prague monday many of them carried pictures of havel and chants of 
long live havel were still heard from the jubilant arrivals as 
a bus was taking them off to their quarters 
czechoslovak authorities provided each of them with about 1700 
worth of basic clothing medical help and a little pocket money 
all of the refugees were said to be in good health 
it is just too bad we do not have such intellectuals and 
dissidents in our country kola said of havel a former dissident 
playwright turned statesmen in the wake of czechoslovakias 
peaceful revolution last year that ousted communists from power 
most of them are corrupted kola said of intellectuals in 
his country 
kola said he had not yet decided where he wanted to settle but 
indicated that he did not plan to stay in czechoslovakia id 
like to go to the us he said 
but kola made clear that ideally he would like to consider his 
homeland an option as well 
certainly i hope the communist rule ends soon and we can all 
be free like you he concluded

legally barred from suing the government 
people whose health may have suffered because of huge radiation 
releases from hanford nuclear reservation began considering other 
ways to get compensation 
scientists today were to start trying to determine just how much 
radiation people who lived downwind from hanford were exposed to by 
releases into the air in the 1940s and into the columbia river in 
the 1960s 
the federal government disclosed the magnitude of radiation 
releases thursday revealing for the first time that people and 
farmland were exposed to significant levels of potentially 
cancercausing nuclear contamination 
we really believe were getting the truth now said tom 
bailie a farmer and spokesman for people living east of the 
southern washington reservation 
residents are legally barred from suing the government for 
damages suffered by radiation exposure but could win compensation 
through congressional action bailie said 
pending legislation in congress would pay uranium miners for 
radiationrelated illnesses though they also are blocked from 
suing the government by the socalled doctrine of sovereign 
immunity he said 
the federal government owes something if folks have been 
harmed by these early releases of radiation rep sid morrison a 
republican whose district includes the reservation said in 
washington dc 
while these estimates are preliminary and they will change 
the potential for harmful side effects is with us to stay he 
said 
an independent panel of scientists was scheduled to meet here 
today to begin the second phase of a fiveyear study they will try 
to determine individual radiation exposure and health risks for 
those who lived downwind from the 560squaremile site 
the first phase studied airborne radioactive iodine emissions 
from 1944 to 1947 and radioactive cooling water poured into the 
columbia river from 196467 
the fiveyear 15 million study is being paid for but not 
directed by the us department of energy which operates the 
reservation 
hanford was established late in world war ii as part of the 
manhattan project to build atomic bombs 
fuel rods irradiated in as many as nine nuclear reactors at the 
site were taken to several topsecret plants where plutonium and 
uranimum were extracted to fuel nuclear bombs 
the iodine and other radioactive materials was released into the 
air through unfiltered stacks officials said 
a few infants were hit hardest with doses as high as 2900 rad 
over three years one rad is the amount of radiation a body organ 
would absorb from about a dozen chest xrays 
the panel concluded that most people living near the hanford 
site from 1944 to 1947 were exposed to low doses of radiation the 
study covered 270000 people living in 10 washington and oregon 
counties 
in releasing the first phase report john till a south carolina 
scientist and nuclear consultant cautioned that the results should 
not be used to make health risk estimates 
but as many as 13500 people or 5 percent of the population 
may have received doses of more than 33 rad in milk after cows 
grazed in contaminated pastures he said 
about 1400 infants and children living in the area received 15 
to 650 rad with only a small number suffering the 2900rad doses 
till said 
when it concentrates in the thyroid gland radioactive 
iodine131 can cause cancer and other diseases 
scientists hope that within a year they will be able to tell 
people who lived in the area what their highest potential radiation 
doses likely were 
such information would greatly help doctors treat affected 
residents dr george laramore professor of radiological oncology 
at the university of washington school of medicine in seattle 
bailie led an impromptu press conference of downwind residents 
angered by the report that came decades after radiation was 
routinely released in the rural agricultural area 
i feel like they used us for guinea pigs and i dont feel 
like they cared one iota what happened to us either or our 
families said betty perkes a farmer in pasco

step on a crack in a block of cement 
circle a tombstone 
open an umbrella indoors 
kiss a moose 
hop on one foot while counting backwards from 13 
karol admits he doesnt really believe in the allegedly unlucky 
day so the truly superstitious might not want to try his cure 
then again karol says why not 
anything is worth a try and if you can do it especially on 
friday the 13th it should cure triskaidekaphobia which is only in 
the mind anyway 
its long been held that the best way to get rid of anxieties 
and frustration is through laughter and fun he said its 
important to look at our fears and put them in perspective then 
one realizes that most superstitious fears are figments of our 
imagination

a police dragnet based on astrological research 
failed to turn up the zodiac killer and cost the city as much as 
30000 in overtime for undercover officers sent out as decoy prey 
maybe he read in the papers that we were beefing up chief 
of detectives joseph borrelli said thursday after the allnight 
hunt 
im happy he didnt shoot anyone im not happy we havent 
caught him yet police commissioner lee p brown said 
investigators activated operation watchdog because they 
feared the gunman would strike according to a 21day thursday 
pattern he has followed over four months in attacks on four people 
in another prominent new york crime spree police arrested a 
33yearold man with a history of psychiatric problems as a suspect 
in the dartman dartblowing attacks 
in the past few weeks 55 welldressed women have reported being 
jabbed by homemade darts in the buttocks legs and arms as they 
walked down streets mostly in midtown manhattan 
of the night of the zodiac borrelli refused to say how many 
officers scoured the city in search of the gunman who said in 
letters to police and news organizations that he chooses his 
victims by their astrological signs 
all four of the zodiacs victims including one who died were 
shot on thursday nights between midnight and dawn 
the 21day cycle of shootings started march 8 with other 
shootings on march 29 may 31 and june 21 the time between the 
second and third shootings was 63 days a multiple of 21 
the gunman vowed in letters to police and news media to shoot 12 
people one for each sign of the zodiac 
at least two men who resembled a sketch of zodiac were picked up 
by detectives questioned and released during the dragnet borrelli 
estimated the operation cost the city as much as 30000 in 
overtime for officers 
borrelli said the absence of a zodiac shooting early thursday 
is not inconsistent with him because there was that period of 
63 days between the second and third shootings 
in the dartman case authorities said jerome wright 33 of the 
bronx a messenger with a criminal record and admitted psychiatric 
problems was charged thursday in the firing of darts made from 
straight pins sewing needles and paper 
wright was identified in a lineup by three women wednesday night 
and was charged with three counts each of reckless endangerment 
criminal possession of a weapon and harassment 
we believe he is our darter said manhattan chief of 
detectives joseph demartino

the army and navy have launched a 
major offensive against the rebel tamil tigers killing more than 
70 insurgents capturing two camps and blowing up six boats 
military officials said today 
the government operation began thursday in the trincomalee 
district about 140 miles northeast of colombo according to the 
military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a total of 130 tigers and government troops have been killed 
since wednesday night according to government tallies 
there was no independent confirmation of the reports contact 
with the tigers has been tapering off because of the fighting and 
also due to poor communications 
the tigers have been fighting seven years for a separate 
homeland for their ethnic minority in northeastern sri lanka 
claiming they need to protect tamils from discrimination by the 
sinhalese majority 
the government claimed the tigers lost 40 men when the 
government attacked two guerrilla camps near the deepwater port 
city at least 33 more tigers were killed when navy gunboats 
destroyed six rebel boats in a lagoon the officials said 
they said 45 soldiers were killed when the tigers overran a camp 
at kokkavil about 180 miles northeast of colombo a survivor was 
quoted as saying the rebels used armorplated bulldozers to mount 
the assault 
government troops fanned out to look for more survivors 
officials said a search party early today killed eight rebels at 
mankulam 12 miles south of kokkavil 
in the far north a tiger sniper killed one soldier at the 
200yearold dutch colonial fort the only governmentheld post in 
jaffna town the town has been a rebel stronghold since the tigers 
launched their offensive in 1983 
three other soldiers were killed in the northwestern town of 
mannar and in the northeast the government said no breakdown was 
given 
about 2400 combatants have been reported killed since july 11 
when the tigers overran a chain of police stations shattering a 
13monthold ceasefire many civilians also have died but no 
figures were available 
the mainly hindu tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people and say they have been denied equality in jobs and 
education the predominantly buddhist sinhalese account for 75 
percent of the population and have run the indian ocean island 
since it became independent from britain in 1948 
more than 17000 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
confrontation

today seeking further information on whether kidnapped irish 
teacher brian keenan will soon be freed after four years captivity 
the envoy adrian mcdaid arrived in beirut thursday five days 
after irans official islamic republic news agency said in a brief 
dispatch from beirut that proiranian shiite moslem groups might 
release one of 16 westerners missing in lebanon 
im here to collect information about the possible release of 
brian keenan said mcdaid the first secretary at the irish 
embassy in baghdad which is also responsible for lebanon 
irna did not say which hostage could be freed but said he would 
probably be one of 10 missing europeans sources close to the 
syrian army headquarters in beirut have speculated that keenan 
would be the one freed 
we dont have official confirmation that it will be him but 
were hopeful that it will be him mcdaid said 
apart from keenan four britons two west germans two swiss and 
an italian are missing in lebanon along with six americans the 
longest held is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press kidnapped march 16 1985 
keenan a 39yearold english language teacher from belfast was 
kidnapped in west beirut april 11 1986 as he walked to work at 
the american university of beirut

release 
former hostage frank reed an american educator freed april 30 
said he saw keenan two days before his release which was announced 
by a group calling itself islamic dawn

hartford states attorney john m bailey ruled out that theory 
thursday 
we found no motive concerning the deceaseds activities at 
wesleyan university and there was absolutely no racial motive in 
this case bailey said 
found in haddads car was a cache of weapons including an uzi 
semiautomatic police said 
police lt frederick lewis theorized that lightner and 
viswanathan were to buy and sell drugs purchased with money 
supplied by haddad who was to receive a percentage of the profits 
the two men plotted haddads slaying because they lost or 
misspent an undisclosed large sum of his money lewis said 
haddad a lebaneseamerican from red hook ny was coeditor 
of a the student publication the afrikan nation he and nine 
other students went on a nineday hunger strike in may following 
the discovery of racist graffiti on a black student dormitory 
activists said the graffiti was the product of a climate of 
racial intolerance at the elite private school with an enrollment 
of 2700 
in another episode black students complained that police had 
unfairly singled out haddad and several other minoritygroup 
members as suspects in two april firebombings on campus

the military junta today told the 
opposition that scored a landslide election win six weeks ago not 
to try to declare a government 
maj gen khin nyunt the head of military intelligence said 
the junta would not yield to international demands that it transfer 
power to the national league for democracy and release the 
opposition groups general secretary aung san suu kyi 
ms suu kyi the daughter of burmas foremost independence hero 
has been under house arrest for nearly a year since last july 20 
the junta is a military government ruling the country under 
martial law no attempt for a unilateral declaration of government 
will be tolerated khin nyunt told the weekly government news 
briefing in rangoon 
he acknowledged international pressure to transfer power and 
free ms suu kyi but we do not care at all about such threats 
the pressure amounted to undue interference in the internal 
affairs of our country khin nyunt said 
the junta took power in 1988 brutally crushing a national 
uprising for democracy it allowed the nations first free election 
in 30 years to be held may 27 the national league trounced the 
miltiary winning 396 of 485 parliamentary seats 
the military government says the newly elected parliament must 
approve a constitution before it can govern in the past it had 
said the parliament could choose between two previous constitutions 
or draw up a new one 
the national league has said it wishes to adapt the constitution 
of 1947 used after burma gained independence from britain the 
following year 
but khin nyunt said both the 1947 and 1974 constitutions are 
no longer adaptable to the countrys present situation adding 
hence an entirely new constitution which would not entail legal 
problems arising out of its shortcomings must be drawn 
the military would be willing to hold talks with political 
leaders only when all election expenses and objections had been 
cleared by the elections commission khin nyunt said 
he said ms suu kyi was being detained according to the law 
and that she had been treated with lenience 
though she is restricted to her home all facilities are being 
provided for he said khin nyunt said she was able to receive 
gift parcels from her british husband through the british embassy 
he said ms suu kyi would be allowed to hold a religious 
ceremony on july 19 to commemorate the anniversary of the 
assassination of her father aung san 43 years ago 
the junta detained ms suu kyi after she vowed to lead a mass 
antigovernment rally to commemorate the last anniversary of her 
fathers death

soviet authorities today permitted a dozen north 
koreanflagged fishing vessels and their mainly japanese crews to 
leave a soviet port where they had been held for alleged poaching 
japanese officials said 
but the ships were bound for north korea and it was uncertain 
when the japanese crewmen would be brought home 
shigeo takenaka acting japanese foreign ministry spokesman 
told foreign journalists the north koreans said they would return 
the fishermen to japan without delay after arrival at the port 
of hungnam in north korea 
the ministry said earlier the crewmen were wary of going to 
north korea 
japans consul general in the soviet far east port of nakhodka 
strongly protested that the crewmen were not being brought directly 
to japan and japanese coast guard vessels were dispatched to try 
to monitor the voyage 
the incident which started in midmay was a threeway dispute 
between the soviet union north korea and japan over fishing in 
salmonrich waters off the soviet coast 
the seized vessels flew north korean flags and had north korean 
officers but they had been leased from japanese companies and 
about threequarters of the crew was japanese 
soviet authorities directed their complaints about the alleged 
poaching to their ally north korea while japanese authorities 
scrambled to try to get the crew released japan and communist 
north korea have no diplomatic relations the japanese foreign 
ministry said north korea would pay compensation to the soviets for 
the illegal fishing but no amount was announced 
north korea has no fishing agreement with the soviet union and 
north korean boats had been permitted to fish for salmon experts 
said 
it was speculated that such informal arrangements enticed 
japanese operators to put their vessels under north korean flag and 
take more salmon than what was permitted in the japanesesoviet 
agreement 
but japanese authorities said it was illegal to lease fishing 
vessels to north korea without permission which had not been given 
the japanese crews fears were proably raised by the fact that 
two japanese fishermen were imprisoned in north korea after they 
allowed a north korean to stow away on their boat and defect to 
japan 
the two went back to north korea to fish after the incident and 
were arrested tried for espionage and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison 
north korea has suggested they would be released in exchange for 
the defector but japan has refused

more than 100 vietnamese are expected 
to return to their homeland in the first voluntary repatriation of 
vietnamese refugees from thailand since 1975 a un official said 
today 
sixty other boat people will return home sunday from malaysia 
the united nations said that would bring to 167 the number of boat 
people who have returned from malaysian camps voluntarily since the 
beginning of 1989 
southeast asian countries burdened by thousands of vietnamese 
who fled their communist homeland have threatened to forcibly 
repatriate refugees unless the united states and other countries 
help resettle them 
fiftynine refugees are awaiting authorization from vietnam to 
return while another 130 have indicated they want to go back the 
un statement said 
in the departures from thailand an official of the un high 
commissioner for refugees said 113 refugees from the phanat nikhom 
refugee camp had volunteered to return to vietnam and would be 
interviewed by vietnamese immigration officials in thailand early 
next week 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
expected the refugees would return to vietnam within one or two 
months 
there are now some 14000 vietnamese refugees in thailand less 
than 2000 are currently eligible for thirdcountry resettlement 
all vietnamese who arrived in thailand after march 14 1989 must 
be screened to determine their eligibility for resettlement most 
of the vietnamese refugees now in thailand arrived after that 
cutoff date 
the group of 113 had not yet been screened the official said 
it appeared they were returning due to the lengthy screening 
process and because they were pessimistic about the prospect for 
eventual resettlement another relief official said 
the un official said the number of vietnamese arriving in 
thailand had increased in the first five months of this year to an 
average of about 1000 he said it appeared the vietnamese now 
perceived thailand to be more receptive to them than countries 
malaysia and hong kong 
there are about 17500 vietnamese refugees in malaysian camps 
of these 14000 arrived after the march 1989 cutoff date 
vietnamese began fleeing their homeland after the communist 
victory over usbacked forces in south vietnam in 1975

lawmakers voted today to sell off polands 
stateowned industries a major step in the solidarityled 
governments 7monthold radical reform program 
more than 80 percent of the countrys industry is 
governmentowned including steel mills coal mines and factories 
government officials said no sectors of the economy would be 
offlimits to privatization 
the sejm or the lower house of parliament passed the 
legislation 3282 with 39 abstentions the vote came one day after 
the longdelayed measure reached the floor 
the privatization measure still needs senate approval but with 
99 of 100 senators elected from the noncommunist solidarity 
movement it was not expected to have any difficulty 
companies in the best financial shape would be put on the 
auction block first 
i think this is the most fundamental bill ever passed by the 
polish parliament said deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz 
this is a foundation of the new economic system in poland 
introducing the bills a day earlier balcerowicz told lawmakers 
that the ownership changes must come quickly 
without a decisive change in the ownership of the economy 
further progress of the reforms is not possible he said 
poland whose communist regime was replaced by the solidarity 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki in august embarked 
in january on a radical economic reform program the first goal was 
to stabilize runaway inflation 
the program whittled inflation down to 34 percent in june 
compared to 600 percent to 1000 percent inflation in 1989 but the 
social cost has been high real incomes have dropped by 30 percent 
the privatization measure bogged down for some time because of 
disputes over how to proceed many people feared foreign investors 
or the former communist elite would be the only ones with the 
capital to buy state property but the government promised that 
privatization coupons which can be used toward purchase of 
stateowned property would be issued to all citizens 
in this way the idea of citizens stock ownership will be put 
into practice said balcerowicz 
he also promised that polish citizens would be allowed to buy 
shares on an installment basis and in some cases on favorable 
credit terms 
employees of enterprises would be allowed to buy up to 20 
percent of the shares of their companies on preferential terms 
foreign investment will be at the discretion of the government 
agency overseeing the transactions 
although the government wants to sell off state companies as 
quickly as possible it will take time 
krzysztof lis who heads the privatization office estimates 
that even after three years less than 50 percent of polands 7600 
enterprises will be in private hands

vietnamese experts told us officials 
that joint searches for us servicemen who were listed as missing 
in action during the vietnam war should be held soon the voice of 
vietnam reported today 
us and vietnamese officials met in hanoi from july 1012 the 
radio said in a report monitored in bangkok 
the two sides frankly exchanged ideas on the issue it said 
it gave no additional information on the vietnamese proposal for 
joint searches 
vietnam has said that since april the united states has twice 
suspended meetings between mia specialists from the two countries 
at the beginning of this month richard solomon us assistant 
secretary of state for east asian affairs complained of a 
relative lack of serious cooperation over the past several months 
on the mia issue 
washington lists about 2300 americans missing from the 
indochina war about 1700 of them in vietnam and the rest in 
laos cambodia and chinese coastal waters 
the us defense intelligence agency last month said it had 
confirmed a decadeold report that vietnam had the remains of 400 
or more us servicemen stored in a warehouse 
the radio report said that during the hanoi meeting the 
vietnamese side rejected as illintentioned fabrications both 
this report and another which said us servicemen were still being 
held in vietnam 
cooperation on the mia issue is hampered by a lack of diplomatic 
ties between the united states and vietnam 
hanoi has eagerly sought diplomatic relations but washington 
has first demanded a peace settlement in cambodia where 
usbacked guerrillas are fighting the government vietnam 
installed after a 1978 invasion

naacp leaders agreed to meet with jewish 
groups angered by a statement that claimed jewish racism had 
kept blacks from being treated fairly in the entertainment industry 
while distancing themselves from the remarks made during a 
panel session at the naacp convention here leaders reasserted 
their view that blacks are victims of racism in hollywood 
we do not agree with the statement but we do not exercise 
thought control i would not invite a panelist here and then say 
you cannot say this or that said naacp executive director 
benjamin l hooks 
we do have a position that there has been racism in hollywood 
thats proven hooks told reporters thursday 
we dont want to separate it into italian americans or jewish 
americans or greek americans theyre all white folk as far as 
were concerned and weve got to sit down and reason together as 
brothers and sisters hooks said 
the time and place for a meeting will be determined by an naacp 
committee assigned to work out the details hooks said 
the organization also issued a call on thursday the concluding 
day of its convention to the movie and recording industry for an 
agreement to bring more blacks women and other minorities into the 
entertainment field 
hollywood studios have been reluctant to talk about any aspect 
of the issue a telephone poll on wednesday produced refusals to 
comment from the major studios with one executive calling it a 
nowin situation 
jewish organizations contacted thursday said they were satisfied 
with the move by the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
leaders said they agreed with the naacp stance about racism in 
the entertainment industry but said it was negative and 
misguided to point at jews as its source 
an official for the antidefamation league of bnai brith said 
any meeting with his group on the issue would only concern the 
remarks of an naacp delegate regarding jews 
were not the right address for dealing with hollywood said 
bnai brith regional director david lehrer if they wish to 
discuss the motion picture industry they should meet with them we 
dont represent that diverse industry 
marla gibbs a producer and star of the nbc sitcom 227 said 
during a tuesday workshop session at the convention i think 
were all talking about film distribution and marketing based on 
how the jewish people and the other people set it up it was not 
set up for us so we have a problem

a plo official said in an interview published 
today that his organization approved in advance the first major 
meeting between local palestinians and a cabinet minister in the 
new israeli government 
the meeting between defense minister moshe arens and three west 
bank palestinian mayors came after the new rightwing government 
said it hoped to reach a middle east peace settlement by talking 
only to palestinians not linked to the palestine liberation 
organization 
israels refusal to give the plo even an indirect role in peace 
talks was one reason us efforts to mediate a peace settlement 
have stalled 
abdullah hourani a member of the plos executive committee 
said in an interview with the jerusalem arabic weekly alnadwa that 
the plo knew of the meeting ahead of time and received reports on 
it afterward 
the plo endorsed a meeting as a chance for palestinian 
national figures to notify the israeli official that the plo is the 
legitimate representative for the palestinian people hourani 
was quoted as saying 
mayor farah araj of beit jala one of those who met with arens 
on june 27 verified the account given by hourani 
the content of our talks with arens that the plo is the only 
representative is also correct he told the associated press 
today 
mayor elias freij of bethlehem who also attended the meeting 
said hourani has the right to say this when asked about the plo 
officials comments 
freij who is regarded as among the most moderate palestinians 
had said after the june meeting that the officials told arens that 
only the plo could negotiate with israel 
the third mayor who attended hanna atrash of beit sahour was 
not available for comment 
after prime minister yitzhak shamir formed the new rightwing 
government on june 11 officials immediately reiterated the stand 
that the government would not negotiate with the plo which israel 
considers a terrorist organization 
officials said later that the governments peace effort would 
focus on trying to open talks with palestinians who are not part of 
the plo a tactic that has repeatedly failed in the past 
we are going to make a determined effort to convince our 
palestinians here that the plo option is not available said 
yossi benaharon a top policy adviser to shamir 
secretary of state james a baker iii said last month that any 
peace talks with israel need the acquiescence of the plo without 
plo consent baker said there wont be any dialogue for israel

the senate gave final congressional approval 
today to legislation guaranteeing a full range of civil rights for 
disabled americans the measure now goes to president bush who is 
expected to sign it next week 
the senate passed the bill 916 a day after the house approved 
it 37728 culminating two years of legislative efforts 
the measure guarantees the nations estimated 43 million 
disabled people access to jobs transportation telephone service 
and stores restaurants shopping malls and other public 
accommodations 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration welcomed the final congressional passage of the 
measure 
we congratulate the congress for joining us in this landmark 
legislation fitzwater said he said there would likely be a 
white house signing ceremony next week 
when the president proposed this legislation he said disabled 
americans must become full partners in americas opportunity 
society we consider passage of this important civil righrts 
legislation to be among the most important accomplishments of the 
administration fitzwater said 
bush earlier this year urged congress to speed passage of the 
bill which has been called the most significant piece of civil 
rights legislation since the 1964 act that guaranteed rights for 
blacks and other racial minorities 
voting against the legislation were sens christopher s bond 
rmo sens jake garn rutah jesse helms rnc gordon 
humphrey rnh steve symms ridaho and malcolm wallop rwyo 
not voting were sens jay rockefeller dwva james a 
mcclure ridaho and alan k simpson rwyo 
the vote followed a brief debate that included a speech in sign 
language by sen tom harkin diowa the chief senate sponsor of 
the bill 
harkin paid he silent tribute to his deaf brother harkin later 
explained i wanted to say to my brother frank that today was my 
proudest day in 16 years in congress 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the bill ensures that 
millions of men and women and children can look forward to the day 
when they will be judged by the strength of their abilities not 
misconceptions about their disabilities 
it is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will have a 
dramatic impact not only on the disabled but on the consciousness 
of america as well said rep steny h hoyer dmd the lead 
house sponsor of the bill said after the house vote 
hoyer added that bush will be ecstatic to sign this bill with 
the largest possible crowd he can invite 
bush has vetoed other major domestic legislation minimum wage 
and family medical leave a special commission under former 
president reagan had urged a disabilities bill however 
a key supporter has been james s brady the former white house 
press secretary who suffered a disabling head injury when shot in 
the 1981 assassination attempt on reagan 
business transportation systems and local governments will bear 
most of the costs of the bill supporters say businesses will 
ultimately benefit by the increased participation of disabled 
people in the economy and the federal government will pay less for 
welfare and special support 
the house on thursday accepted a compromise provision that helps 
protect the jobs of aidsinfected workers in food industries 
including restaurants 
under the legislation the health and human services department 
must determine which diseases are transmitted by food handling hhs 
secretary louis w sullivan a physician has told lawmakers that 
aids cannot be transmitted by handling food 
the bill phases in its requirements and exempts businesses with 
fewer than 15 employees from its hiring requirements small 
businesses would have more time than larger ones to make their 
premises accessible to disabled customers but no change would be 
required that would cause a financial hardship to companies 
transportation requirements including making all new buses 
accessible to people with wheelchairs would occur over years 
amtrak and commuter rail lines will be covered 
the cost to supply relay services for hearing and 
speechimpaired telephone users would be spread out among all 
telephone users adding little to average phone bills supporters 
said 
the bill does not list disabilities that are covered saying 
rather that anyone is disabled who has a mental or physical 
impairment that limits a person in some major life function it 
also includes anyone perceived as being disabled such as someone 
with a disfiguring scar 
the bill specifically excludes however active drug users and 
people with mental disorders such as pyromania or kleptomania that 
could lead to criminal behavior although the bill protects people 
who suffer from aids large numbers of them homosexuals it does 
not protect homosexuals per se 
still critics of the bill say the language is so vague that 
only lawyers can understand it the bill will create a firestorm 
of litigation said rep dan burton rind who voted against it 
businesses that repeatedly violate the public accommodations 
provisions could be fined 50000 for the first finding of 
violation and 100000 for the second the justice department could 
also seek compensation but not punitive damages for victims of 
discrimination 
sanctions for violating the employment provision are tied to the 
1964 civil rights act meaning a person who is discriminated 
against may seek a court order back pay and lawyers fees

thousands of exhausted grimy albanians 
reached this adriatic port today on board a flotilla of ferries 
that evacuated about 4500 asylumseekers from embassies in the 
hardline communist state 
the first ship the espresso grecia arrived this morning after 
a journey of about seven hours as it docked a red cross nun in a 
starched white uniform dashed off clutching a newborn baby in an 
orange blanket 
i feel so many emotions so much liberty said a beaming 
young woman as she disembarked police whisked her away before she 
could give her name 
albanians lining the decks of three more ships broke into chants 
of italia italia and we shall win as they arrived this 
afternoon 
five ships chartered by west germany italy and france cruised 
to albania on thursday to pick up thousands of refugees who have 
packed western embassies in the capital tirana in the last two 
weeks 
the ship chartered by the french the orient star was cruising 
directly to marseille french officials said 
the evacuation was expected to defuse one of the worst crises 
facing albanias hardline communist government in decades 
many of the albanians leaving the ships in brindisi looked 
stunned one man crossed himself as he got off the appia on the 
espresso grecia a man swung a baby in a white sweater up and down 
in glee 
many of the albanians boarded trains for west germany after a 
quick breakfast of hot milk and croissants provided by the local 
government 
everyone off to freedom a refugee cried to his cheering 
countrymen waving from the windows of a departing train 
the arrivals many of them single men or young families were 
sweaty and their clothes were grimy after crowding together for two 
weeks or more in the small embassies 
we are all feeling glad said a mining engineer named 
muharrem clutching a foilwrapped packet of italian armyissue 
crackers we are going in the west toward freedom all the world 
is going west he said grinning 
we want freedom said arjan xhaferi 32 carrying his 
5yearold daughter arrisa on his shoulders i have sacrificed 
everything even my life 
he said he and his family entered the west german embassy in 
tirana by scaling the wall in the middle of the night 
a few people were carried off the ferry on stretchers with foot 
injuries apparently suffered when they entered the embassies 
albanian police fired at some of the asylumseekers 
the five ships were bringing out about 3200 people who had 
crowded into the west german embassy more than 800 from the 
italian embassy and about 540 from the french embassy 
the albanians were transported by bus from the embassies 20 
miles west to the port of durres where they boarded the ferries 
they said police ringed the dock to prevent anyone else from 
jumping aboard crew members said 
durres is about 85 miles from brindisi 
the albanians from the italian embassy will be transferred to a 
temporary shelter outside the town west germany sent three trains 
to the dock to pick up the albanians authorities would not 
disclose their destination 
until today only 51 of the 5000 or more asylumseekers had 
left albania the small group was permitted to leave the 
czechoslovak embassy and take a plane to prague on tuesday 
hungarys official news agency reported that 40 albanians who 
sought refuge in the hungarian mission in tirana would be put 
aboard a special flight tonight for budapest 
the assault on the embassies and several accompanying 
demonstrations presented the biggest challenge in decades to the 
albanian government 
the situation was reminiscent of a rush on foreign embassies in 
east germany last year which contributed to the collapse of that 
countrys communist system 
the albanian government of communist leader ramiz alia agreed to 
let the refugees leave the embassy compounds after supplies of food 
and medicine ran low and hygienic conditions deteriorated 
the west german foreign ministry in bonn said its embassy in 
tirana had been closed for renovations 
the embassy is in an inconceivable state said spokesman 
juergen chrobog he said renovations would last a long time 
and he did not know when the embassy would officially reopen 
foreign ministry officials have said the resolution worked out 
for the albanians who left today included an agreement that seeking 
refuge in embassies could not become an accepted route for 
emigration 
alia introduced limited reforms this year including some 
religious freedom and travel abroad which albanians have not been 
able to do for 45 years 
the crisis in albania has caused a shakeup in the leadership 
but the government has vowed to maintain its communist line

mental health advocates are hailing a new drug 
for acute schizophrenia but criticizing its pricetag 750 per 
month per patient 
groups attending a weeklong convention on psychiatric treatment 
want sandoz pharmaceuticals corp to provide more information on 
clozapines cost they also urged state hospitals to buy more 
the national alliance for the mentally ill has adopted the same 
position 
were hearing what sound like testimonials at church revivals 
on the effects of the drug said j benedict centifanti deputy 
director of pennsylvania protection and advocacy inc a support 
group for psychiatric patients 
clozapine reduces emotional disturbances and thought disorders 
in schizophrenics who havent responded to conventional treatment 
said sandoz which introduced it in february 
in some cases recovery is quite dramatic said barbara 
gordon research director for the state office of mental health 
in others its not so dramatic but even they are showing 
improvement 
unlike other drugs prescribed for schizophrenia such as 
thorazine and prolixin clozapine doesnt cause involuntary facial 
tremors known as tardive dyskinesia an irreversible condition in 
some cases 
when you take one of those drugs you are rolling the dice 
said dr janice guidotti who held a workshop thursday at duquesne 
university 
the workshop was part of a fiveday convention attended by 1000 
current and former mental patients and their advocates whose goals 
include getting rid of a perceived stigma associated with 
psychiatric treatment and advancing a nationwide civil rights 
movement for mental patients 
sandoz pharmaceuticals of east hanover nj said part of the 
reason for clozapines high cost is the need for patients to 
undergo weekly blood tests to check for a potentially deadly side 
effect a reduction in white blood cell count 
the company estimates 5000 patients in public and private 
hospitals in the united states take clozapine sandoz 
pharmaceuticals estimated up to 2 percent of patients taking the 
drug could develop the side effect 
the price of the drug should drop when more psychiatrists 
prescribe it said dr gilbert honigfeld a sandoz spokesman 
at a workshop thursday centifanti cited the case of james 
angliss a patient at western state hospital in steilacoom wash 
who sued for the right to take clozapine administrators withheld 
it because of cost and potential liability 
the case is believed to be the first in the united states 
involving clozapine centifanti said 
a jury awarded angliss 600000 and his mother 60000 after he 
was forced to take another drug and developed tardive dyskinesia 
the hospital has appealed the case 
pennsylvania will spend 2 million this fiscal year to treat 
schizophrenics with clozapine in state hospitals enough for about 
220 patients gordon said there are 4500 schizophrenics among 
7000 state hospital patients

the bush administration will do everything a 
government can do to learn the fate of american servicemen 
missing in action vice president dan quayle said today but he 
said more cooperation is needed from vietnam 
quayle spoke to the 3650member national league of familes of 
american prisoners and missing in southeast asia which is holding 
its 21st annual meeting in washington this weekend 
the fullest possible accounting will continue to be a matter 
of highest national priority until we achieve success quayle 
told the group we will do everything a government can do to 
recover your loved ones and if we discover proof of captivitiy 
action will be taken to bring our men home 
however he said increased activities on the powmia issue 
can be fully productive only if vietnam makes the political 
decision truly to cooperate with us 
vietnam can provide the information historical records and 
cooperation necessary to resolve the contradictions and unanswered 
questions which still exist the vice president said 
why they dont recognize that doing so is in their own best 
interest remains a mystery i again appeal to the government of 
vietnam to make the fundamental decisions necessary to resolve this 
issue 
quayle ended his speech on what he called a personal note 
referring to a controversy that arose during the 1988 presidential 
campaign critics said he avoided campaign duty during the vietnam 
war by joining the indiana national guard 
i did not serve in vietnam he said and while i have not 
apologized and never will for my national guard service i 
recognize that the members of my generation who served in vietnam 
made a sacrifice for their country that was far far greater than 
mine 
another group the newly formed national alliance of families 
for the return of american servicemen was holding a forum later in 
the day on its believe that as many as 5000 prisoners of war from 
the korean war may have remained behind in chinese and soviet labor 
camps and some could still be alive 
on the groups agenda was a report on the case of bill sowles of 
edmonds wash who believes one of the men shown in a film 
recovered from north korea 37 years ago may be his father who 
vanished on a korean battlefield in 1951 
their claims are rejected by the defense department the state 
department and the national league of families 
to the best of our knowledge there is no verifiable evidence 
that has surfaced to support these claims state department 
spokesman richard boucher says we dont believe that there are 
us pows in the soviet union 
lt cmdr ned lundquist a defense department spokesman said 
the department has documents in its files about such allegations 
but there is no evidence today that leads us to conclude that any 
of those reports were true 
the leagues public relations director betsy cox said there 
is absolutely no intelligence to back up such assertions 
sowles 47 was attending an american legion meeting in 
bellingham wash when he saw a film recovered from the north 
koreans by us intelligence agents in 1953 and unearthed more 
recently by a seattle television station it purportedly showed a 
group of prisoners with their communist captors one frowning 
figure caught sowles eye 
my first thought was gee that fellow looks like my son 
and then it just hit me that that was my dad sowles said he 
said his son lewis william sowles iv 24 is the spitting image 
of his grandfather 
sowles said dr michael charney of colorado state university an 
expert on identifying vietnam area remains studied the film and 
told him the man in the picture is his father 
willy sowles then 32 a medic who had also served in world war 
ii disappeared when communist chinese army forces overwhelmed the 
us 2nd infantry division in 1951 at the battle of kunuri in what 
is now north korea he was never seen again and became one of the 
8000 americans listed as missing in action as a result of the 
19501953 conflict 
the reporter who unearthed the film mark sauter of kirotv in 
seattle has said that declassified us military intelligence 
reports show that us officials were told by french intelligence 
in 1951 that 3000 american prisoners had been shipped to the 
manchurian border with korea he said cia reports in 1951 
established the location of secret pow camps in china 
col delk simpson a retired air force officer who lives in palm 
beach fla said that when he was us military attache in hong 
kong in 1954 a refugee gave him a detailed account of american 
prisoners being transferred from a chinese to a soviet train at the 
chinesesiberian border town of manchouli 
facing skepticism about their stories alliance members are 
seeking public disclosure of information in government files 
concerning powmia personnel from world war ii the korean war or 
vietnam the bill they support would exempt information that would 
compromise national security by disclosing sources and methods of 
intelligence 
the league of families opposes this legislation saying it could 
jeopardize americans who might still be held noel woolsley 
legislative director of amvets said that organization also is 
expected to oppose the bill at its convention next month

ethiopian leader mengistu mariam haile is 
denying 10000 jews permission to emigrate to israel as a way to 
get military supplies from the jewish state a leader of the 
ethiopian community here said today 
the accusation comes amid reports that mengistus hardline 
marxist government is teetering as secessionist rebels gain ground 
in their battle to topple him 
an israeli government spokesman said the claim was untrue 
rahamim elazar chairman of the public council for ethiopian 
affairs in israel said mengistu was demanding arms from israel in 
exchange for allowing more jews to leave his country for israel 
mengistu is trying to use them for military aid he said 
israel has sought to bring out all of ethiopias jews since 
immigration was cut off in 1984 when a secret airlift campaign 
known as operation moses was halted after the ethiopian government 
learned of it 
about 8000 ethiopian jews were brought to israel in the 
ussupported threemonth operation about 15000 jews are 
believed to remain in the north african country 
elazar told the associated press that 10000 ethiopian jews were 
encamped in addis ababa after leaving villages in the province of 
gondar in hope of eventually emigrating to israel 
the jews went to the ethiopian capital after israel and 
mengistus government resumed diplomatic relations in october 
elazar said he said his information came from jews who managed to 
leave ethiopia 
on wednesday the chairman of the us house subcommittee on 
african affairs charged that mengistu was trying to pressure israel 
into supplying ethiopia with 1000 cluster bombs 
rep howard wolpe a michigan democrat was quoted by the 
newspaper washington jewish week as warning mengistu not to use 
ethiopian jews to pressure israel 
avi pazner a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir denied that mengistu asked israel to supply him with 
weapons he also denied that ethiopia was placing obstacles in the 
way of jews wanting to leave 
the situation there is so complicated there is a war there 
confusion famine said pazner this is the reason they are 
being held up 
an italian newspaper reported saturday that mengistu made a 
secret visit to israel on july 3 to meet israeli leaders israeli 
officials denied the report 
in january the new york times quoted unidentified us 
officials as saying they strongly suspected israel had supplied 
ethiopia with cluster bombs for it war against the rebels other 
reports said israel also supplied mengistu with military advisers 
ammunition and spare parts 
israel has denied it supplied cluster bombs to ethiopia it has 
refused to confirm or deny reports of other supposed arms sales 
under its standing policy of not discussing any weapons deals 
a recent article in the independent hebrew daily haaretz written 
by zeev schiff a respected military analyst said us officials 
were trying to damage israels image by fabricating the reports of 
cluster bomb sales 
the united states has criticized israeli support for ethiopia 
the us government objects to sale of cluster bombs without 
washingtons permission since the weapons were developed with us

nasa officials said today the flaw that gives 
the hubble space telescope a fuzzy view of the universe could have 
been detected in simple lowcost tests that were not performed 
before launch 
lennard fisk the chief scientist for the national aeronautics 
and space administration said the perscription error in the two 
main mirrors of the 15 billion hubble is so precise that it had 
to have happened during manufacturing 
it is an error he said that could have been detected and 
corrected while the mirrors were being made or after they were 
assembled into a telescope 
the error is very large therefore some simple lowcost 
norisk test that could have been done could have detected the 
flaw fisk said in testimony before the house committee on 
science space and technology 
asked why the test was not performed if it was so lowcost and 
simple fisk said were asking those same questions 
nasa officials had said in earlier statements that tests to 
detect the focusing flaw that has disabled hubble would have 
required up to 300 million and the construction of a special 
facility 
but fisk said today that may not have been the case he said 
such a facility would have been required for a test of the fully 
assembled telescope but that there could have been other cheaper 
tests performed that were not done 
you could have performed tests on the mirrors individually 
that could have detected this flaw he said 
failure to conduct such tests said fisk was a technical 
decision and not a financial decision 
hubble was built in the early 1980s and was launched on april 25 
of this year it was only after it had been in orbit for more than 
two months that engineers discovered there was a flaw in either the 
94inch primary mirror or the 12inch secondary mirror that collect 
and concentrate starlight 
the lack of focus has cut the possible research by the telescope 
by about half according to most estimates 
fisk said the focus problem will be corrected for the main 
hubble camera in 1993 when a replacement camera is flown up to the 
telescope by the space shuttle and spacewalking astronauts switch 
out instruments but that mission will correct the focus for only 
one of the five instruments on board hubble other corrections will 
have to wait until 1996 and later 
hubble is designed to operate for 15 years and fisk said that 
with the replacement instruments the telescope will recoup work 
lost by the focusing error 
hubble is not a dud he said hubble will be capable over 
its 15year lifetime to accomplish all the science that is 
expected 
richard truly administrator of nasa said that an investigation 
committee is now studying records on hubble and eventually will 
determine where the mistake was made that allowed a flawed 
telescope to be launched

a group that promotes concerts threatened 
today to cancel its new orleans convention this fall if the 
governor approves a bill that requires labels for explicit records 
it was the latest complaint about the bill passed by the 
legislature and sent to the gov buddy roemer for either his 
signature or his veto 
under the bill which would be the first state law of its type 
records with lyrics some consider obscene would be labeled and kept 
from minors 
carl freed director of the north american concert promoters 
association said in a statement from new york if this bill 
becomes law concert promoters recording artists and community 
retailers will be driven out of business they are being made 
scapegoats by soap box politicians 
freed said the association would cancel its convention 
scheduled for oct 5 if record labeling becomes a law 
on thursday members of the music industry in louisiana 
suggested a program of voluntary labeling to head off the 
governors signature of the mandatory labeling bill 
our plan is to have every record dealer in the state 
voluntarily sign a pledge that they will not sell records with 
explicit lyrics to minors said shea dixon backer of a proposed 
grammy hall of fame for new orleans thats pretty much whats 
being done now this just formalizes it 
the record industry association of america labeling system 
which took effect july 1 effectively singles out explicit records 
said freddie szilagi manager of tower records in new orleans 
according to the pledge to be sent to the governor record 
dealers agree not to sell any recording to any minor that either 
bears the riaa warning or any other manufacturerimposed warning 
or one that they find should be so labeled 
roemer has until july 29 to decide the fate of the record 
labeling bill if he does not sign it or veto it the bill 
automatically becomes law

mohawk indians have opened talks with the 
quebec government after a police officer died in a gunfight over 
plans for a golf course addition on land the tribe claims 
but the mohawks in this town near montreal swore to keep their 
barricades up until police leave and they get immunity from 
prosecution 
quebecs native affairs minister john ciaccia said the two 
sides held talks late thursday and agreed to more talks today 
weve had a very positive meeting ciacca said he said 
thursdays talks were halted to respect the mohawk tradition of 
not continuing this type of a meeting after sunset 
the dispute centers on plans by the oka town government to build 
a golf course addition the indians say encroaches on their 
ancestral land 
police brought in reinforcements thursday bringing to about 
1000 the number of officers in the area 
the mohawks dug trenches and strengthened their concreteblock 
and barbedwire barriers with crushed police cars as they prepared 
for a possible showdown 
dozens of police wearing flak jackets and carrying shotguns were 
seen patrolling their new sandbagged positions reinforced with 
concrete blocks 
all day thursday the two sides faced each other across their 
barricades about 200 mohawks at the top of a hill on the highway 
that goes through this picturesque town 18 miles west of montreal 
and the police at the bottom of the hill 
the police have to retreat completely from the area before we 
can ever work out a deal with ciaccia mohawk spokeswoman ellen 
gabriel said 
a ciaccia aide said earlier the minister was negotiating with 
members of the mohawk band council and their warriors society 
trying to resolve the dispute 
mohawks wearing camouflage and carrying revolvers hunting 
rifles and assault rifles raised the yellow and red warrior 
society flag over the golf courses immaculate lawns they 
commandeered a fleet of golf carts to ferry leaders and messages 
between encampments 
the mohawks claim title to a small pine forest oka wants to cut 
down so the golf course can add nine holes police intervened at 
the request of okas mayor after mohawks refused to tear down a 
small barricade they built four months ago 
early wednesday a raiding force of about 100 quebec police 
attacked the barricade they retreated after cpl marcel lemay 31 
was shot police said they were not certain whether he was shot by 
mohawks or fellow police 
according to a newspaper report today ballistics tests 
indicated the bullet was not from lemays weapon or from the weapon 
used by his colleagues 
le journal de montreal also said the bullet that killed him 
pierced his lungs and heart and was found under his right shoulder 
blade it said lemay was wearing a bullet proof vest but the bullet 
slipped through a small opening under his right arm 
initial reports said he was shot in the face 
montreal police declined to comment on the report angele joyal 
a police spokesman said there would be no comment until the 
investigation was completed he also declined to say when the 
autopsy report would be ready 
jocelyn turcotte president of the quebec provincial police 
association came to the lines to talk to his union members 
we dont want to send our members back in to assault this 
barricade again because the mohawks are heavily armed and it would 
not be a safe action at this time he said one policeman has 
already been killed and we dont want another death

nasa partly filled atlantis 
external tank with liquid hydrogen today in an attempt to locate a 
leak that has grounded the spacecraft and has all shuttle missions 
on hold 
a leak reoccurred during the testing around a valve in a pipe 
that carries fuel from the external tank to the main engines 
engineers planned to spend the rest of the day analyzing the data 
and try to pinpoint the source of the leak 
theres no speculation on exactly how much was leaking or 
exactly where the leak was coming from whether it was the orbiter 
side or the tank side said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
during the testing supercold volatile fuel was pumped into the 
tank a small amount of hydrogen escaped into a bag around a 
17inchdiameter valve when the flow was increase more hydrogen 
leaked in the valve area 
extra sensors had been placed next to valves pipes and seals 
suspected of leaking with plastic bags covering the components 
the contents of the bags will be analyzed in an attempt to pinpoint 
the leak 
were going to a lot of trouble to add numerous points of data 
collection said david winterhalter director of systems 
engineering and analysis for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
a less vigorous test was conducted june 29 during which 
hydrogen escaped from atlantis extensive plumbing system the 
shuttles classified defense department flight in midjuly 
consequently was put on hold 
in late may a hydrogen leak was detected in columbia while the 
shuttle was being fueled for an astronomy mission columbia was 
returned to the hangar for repairs atlantis remains at the launch 
pad 
the leaks have prompted nasa to ground the threeshuttle fleet 
it was the first time the fleet has been grounded since shuttle 
challenger exploded in january 1986 killing seven crew members no 
shuttle flew for twoandahalf years after that 
rockwell international the shuttle builder has identified 
columbias leak in laboratory tests in california but has not yet 
found the source in the group of pipes and valves linking the 
orbiter with the external tank 
the space agency encountered more trouble with leaks wednesday 
when hydrogen escaped from an unmanned atascentaur rocket during a 
simulated countdown the problem quickly was fixed and was 
considered so minor it would not have delayed tuesdays launch with 
a nasa scientific satellite said agency spokesman bruce buckingham 
that launch was postponed one to two weeks however after 
problems were discovered thursday with one of the satellites two 
black boxes the socalled command decoder units receive ground 
commands and plug them into the spacecrafts system 
all they know at this point is its not returning any 
information or indicating its even receiving any information 
buckingham said its just kind of staring back at us 
the combined release and radiation effects satellite or crres 
will study the invisible magnetic and electric fields in space and 
measure space radiation and its effects on microelectronics it is 
a joint program of nasa and the defense department

the senate armed services committee early 
today approved a 289 billion defense bill that cuts troop strength 
in europe by 50000 and reduces the budget request for the 
strategic defense initiative by nearly 1 billion 
in a session that began early thursday and ended shortly after 1 
am today the panel agreed to an overall budget that is 18 
billion less than president bush proposed in january 
the committee as expected agreed to the total its chairman 
sen sam nunn dga had called for in military spending 
this is a responsible and manageable glidepath toward a major 
restructuring of the military establishment and the way it does 
business nunn told reporters at a news conference announcing 
completion of the bill 
the full senate is expected to take up the bill just prior to 
the august recess and sen john warner of virginia ranking 
republican on panel predicted fights over the level of spending 
for sdi and an air force satellite 
weve postponed the battle to the floor warner said of the 
sdi issue 
in a surprise move the panel adopted a measure that reduces 
armed forces in europe an issue left unresolved by us and soviet 
negotiators after stalled talks on cutting conventional forces 
the panel agreed to a total 100000person reduction in military 
personnel 
nunn has told the committee to draw up legislation around two 
numbers his preferred budget level of 289 billion and the budget 
committeeapproved level of 286 billion 
bush proposed 307 billion in defense spending for fiscal 1991 
but it has been assumed that congress would cut the budget 
as expected the committee agreed to limit money for the two 
landbased nuclear missiles the mx and midgetman to only 
research and development funds 
the administration requested more than 22 billion for the two 
missiles but the committee earmarked 548 million for the mx and 
202 million for the midgetman said the sources who requested 
anonymity 
defense secretary dick cheney also proposed canceling the v22 
osprey the tiltrotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter 
and flies like a plane but the armed services panel agreed to more 
than 200 million in research and development funds for the 
aircraft 
in a politically divisive issue the panel agreed to eliminate 
about 1 billion for the milstar program an air force navigation 
and communications satellite the vote in the full committee was 
119 along party lines the sources said 
the committee significantly reduced funds for the c17 transport 
plane and the navys a12 attack plane an aircraft that has been 
at the center of controversy ever since the service said it was a 
year behind schedule 
the decision to cut the c17 program came despite cheneys 
revised proposal for the aircraft that called for cutting the 
purchase from 210 to 120 the defense secretary made that 
announcement in april 
the reduction in sdi to about 37 billion cuts the programs 
budget to about the level congress approved last year for the 
antimissile shield 
the 1990 reduction marked the first time since former president 
reagan presented the plan seven years ago that the requested 
funding had been cut 
the armed services panel also approved a plan that eliminates 
advanced procurement money for the trident submarine a decision 
that largely limits the program to 18 submarines 
cheney faced with a diminishing soviet threat and budget 
constraints revised his request for the b2 bomber to two planes 
in fiscal 1991 and 75 planes in total 
the panel agreed to the secretarys proposal

a big burst in department store sales last 
month helped push retail sales up 05 percent the first increase 
since january the government said friday 
its a welcome sign for a beleaguered sector of the economy 
it offers a good deal of hope that the economy will keep on 
expanding said allen sinai chief economist at the boston co 
other analysts however cautioned against reading too much into 
the turnaround they noted that the june increase followed three 
months of declines in retail sales a period of weakness unseen 
since 1981 
the question is whether its a onetime reversal of a string 
of weakness or the start of something new sinai said 
retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 14782 billion last 
month up 784 million from the may sales level the commerce 
department said 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of total 
economic activity prolonged weakness in this area raises fears 
that the economy could be headed for a downturn 
junes upturn in retail sales was probably due in part to 
consumers making up for lost ground in april and may analysts said 
cooler temperatures in may probably resulted in americans 
holding off on buying summer clothing air conditioning and other 
seasonal items analysts said they probably made those purchases 
in june when the weather warmed up analysts said 
david wyss of drimcgraw hill called the june increase just a 
rebound from the softness we saw in may 
were up only 24 percent from a year ago thats not even 
keeping up with inflation wyss said 
americans continue to demonstrate signs of cautious spending 
said robert dederick chief economist at the northern trust co of 
chicago 
the consumer did not turn tail in the spring but nonetheless 
is behaving in a rather restrained way dederick said 
the 05 percent increase in june was the first rise since a big 
28 percent jump in january after that gain retail sales showed 
no change in february and then fell 04 percent in march 1 percent 
in april and 06 percent in may 
last months increase was led by a 28 percent rise in spending 
at department stores reflecting a rebound after a big 22 percent 
drop in may 
analysts attributed part of the dramatic increase in department 
store sales which had fallen for three months to price cuts 
intended to encourage purchases of slowmoving summer clothes 
auto sales edged up a tiny 01 percent in june after being down 
02 percent in may weakness in auto sales has been a major factor 
contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this 
year 
sales at building material and hardware stores rose 13 percent 
after falling 02 percent in april 
bucking the upward trend in june sales at furniture and home 
furnishings stores plunged 19 percent they had been up a slight 
04 percent in may 
sales at grocery stores were up 03 percent while sales at 
gasoline stations climbed 05 percent sales at drug stores were up 
12 percent but spending at bars and restaurants fell 06 percent

an extremist islamic group today claimed 
reponsibility for an explosion at a texas chemical plant july 5 
that killed 17 people 
arco chemical co of north america said from its headquarters in 
newtown square pa that it had not heard of the claim and did not 
know whether it was valid 
the cause of the blast is under investigation and no signs of 
sabotage at the plant have been reported 
a spokesman for the islamic liberation front told the associated 
press the arco plant in channelview texas was attacked because 
the united states supports israel despite its killings and 
terrorism against our palestinian families in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
washington ignores the human rights of our palestinian 
people said the official who met with an ap reporter and spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
we want washington to taste the pain of the deaths of its 
people the same way we feel the pain of the killings of our 
palestinian families at the hands of the zionist criminals he 
said 
there was no way independently to verify the claim of 
responsibility the islamic liberation front threatened two weeks 
ago to attack us and israeli interests worldwide to avenge the 
may 20 massacre of seven palestinian laborers in a tel aviv suburb 
by an exisraeli soldier 
the front is a relatively large group based in the west bank and 
gaza it has followers in jordan and several other arab countries 
it advocates armed struggle against neighboring israel and calls 
for the elimination of the jewish state 
the front has opposed palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat since 1983 over his moves toward reaching a 
settlement with israel and hundreds of guerrillas broke away from 
the plo 
the front was responsible for an attack on an israeli army 
patrol may 17 near the west bank city of hebron in which an israeli 
soldier was wounded 
this factory was providing the us army with chemical 
equipment although it was publicly operating as a factory 
manufacturing supplies for civilians the fronts spokesman 
claimed 
one of our unit commanders operating in the united states of 
america informed our headquarters in the occupied territories last 
friday that our commrades had set ablaze a texas chemical factory 
and that the mission was successfully accomplished he said 
he refused to give any further details for security reasons 
the arco plant 15 miles east of houston was wrecked by the 
explosions and fire which leveled an area the size of a city block 
arco spokeswoman sallie anderson said from the companys 
headquarters today that the cause of the explosion had not been 
determined she also said she was unaware of any recent threats 
against the company 
we have no knowledge of any warnings she said there were 
no warnings from that group that they were planning to blow up the 
plant 
asked if the company knew why it would be singled out as a 
target by the group anderson said we have no idea 
she said the company had no dealings with israel and she 
disputed the fronts claim that the plant was providing the us 
army with chemical equipment 
i think their statement from what i understand says that we 
make chemical weapons for the army and we do not ms anderson 
said 
plant manager earl mccaleb said last week it was believed that 
some kind of work was being done on a device that compresses 
gases before they enter tanks containing flammable hydrocarbons he 
did not elaborate 
the plant produced propylene oxide used to make foam for seat 
cushions and bedding the substance also is used in cleaning 
compounds 
it also produced styrene monomer used for insulation foam 
drinking cups packaging materials and automotive parts another 
product was methyl tertiary butyl ether a high octane blending 
component used as a replacement for lead in gasoline

former rep thomas ashley a longtime friend 
of president bush confirmed today that hes been giving advice to 
neil bush since last winter on the controversy surrounding the 
president sons role in the collapse of a denver savings and loan 
but ashley a banking lobbyist denied that bush had asked him 
to contact his son 
that is absolutely inaccurate ashley said in an interview 
im to smart to do that 
the denver post reported in todays editions that ashley a 
college classmate of george bushs from yale had talked to the 
younger bush at the presidents behest before neil bush was 
questioned by federal banking regulators 
the newspaper attributed the report to comments by neil bush 
himself contained in a deposition taken by the office of thrift 
supervision 
if neil thinks his father called me hes mistaken ashley 
said 
ashley 67 a democrat is a former congressman from ohio he is 
currently president of the association of bank holding companies a 
banking lobbying organization based in washington 
neil bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal 
regulators in september on his role as a director of the bankrupt 
silverado banking savings and loan 
ashley said that he contacted neil bush on his own last winter 
after reading about his troubles in the paper 
since then ive seen neil a half dozen times we talk about 
it ashley said 
he said that although president bush didnt ask him to contact 
neil bush the president is aware that he has been counselling the 
son 
bush has pledged not to get personally involved in the 
investigation of his son 
ashley said i dont think the president has any problem with 
the fact that he has involved himself in the matter what he 
feels is im a longtime friend of neils 
is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay 
away from neil ashley asked 
president bush doesnt go along with that he rejects that 
ashley said 
ive talked to the president about the situation on a couple 
of social occasions when were alone including once at camp 
david ashley said i talk about the kids neils one of the 
kids 
ashley said that neil has made his own decisions in the matter 
what we do is talk about the consequences of one course or 
another ashley said 
ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank 
regulation make him a good source for advice for neil bush 
the situation is such that he cant go to his father and talk 
to him ashley said 
its not a partisan matter or he wouldnt be coming to a 
democrat ashley added its just a situation where somebody 
hes known for a long time is available and has experience in 
matters involving regulatory matters 
im a good sounding board ashley added 
ashley said that neil bush decided on his own not to take the 
easy way out and that hes been the victim of a little 
selective treatment from federal regulators 
but ashley said he hasnt whined or complained about that 
he said that neil bush was concerned that when the office of 
thrift supervision decided to go public about the case it 
only presented its side of the matter a thousand pages it didnt 
include neils defense 
ashley and bush have remained close friends since they were both 
members of the secret society skull and bones while they were 
undergraduates at yale university in the late 1940s

scores of east german factories agreed friday 
to raise wages and preserve jobs for 350000 metalworkers but said 
the labor contract may actually speed the collapse of some plants 
the oneyear pact was reached after a series of strikes by 
hundreds of thousands of metalworkers around berlin it is the 
biggest labor agreement since east germany became a free market on 
july 1 
the contract at least temporarily ends one of many 
confrontations between former government enterprises facing new 
western competition and workers demanding better pay to cope with 
suddenly higher food prices 
but while one labor dispute was settled another arose almost 
immediately about 60000 retail industry workers held 
demonstrations in a halfdozen cities friday to protest plans to 
dissolve the governmentrun retail chains 
east germany meanwhile said it is facing a huge drop in income 
because of declining production and would need more money from west 
germany 
finance minister walter romberg told parliament that east 
germany would have nearly 387 billion in expenditures through the 
second half of this year but only 175 billion in income 
east germany merged its economy with west germanys on july 1 in 
a prelude to the full unification expected later this year 
it is now in the early stages of converting its moribund 
centrally planned economy to a market economy prices have risen 
dramatically and east german companies already are feeling the 
effects of western competition 
many east german factories are expected to fail causing wide 
unemployment in the coming months workers in several industries 
have staged warning strikes to press their demands for job 
protection and better wages 
the metalworkers contract ends a bitter confrontation 
the contract was negotiated by the powerful west german labor 
union ig metall and its east german affiliate and covers 350000 
workers at 164 factories in an area around berlin 
management said the pact may hasten the closing of enterprises 
already struggling to meet their payrolls 
this extensive compromise package is not economically 
justifiable lothar heinzmann head of the employers group said 
in a statement carried by the east german news agency adn 
he called it an advance payment for an uncertain future 
in a statement the union said the agreement keeps the burden of 
moving to a free market from being placed fully on the workers 
the contract is expected to set a pattern for other labor 
agreements currently being negotiated 
it must be feared that factories will close because of this 
contract said christoph borchelt spokesman for the employer 
association the association of metal and electronics industries of 
berlin and brandenburg 
the agreement raises the annual monthly salary of 666 to 850 
through october then to 880 through april 1 when the wage 
portion of the contract expires 
the jobguarantee section runs through june 1991 after which 
workers can be laid off 
the contract also increases the factories participation in a 
government program aimed at heading off layoffs 
under the program financed largely by west germany workers 
targeted for layoffs receive 63 percent of their salaries while 
remaining in the plants where they receive training for other jobs 
the contract will increase factory participation in the program 
raising the salaries of workers targeted by layoffs to 85 percent 
of their former wages 
about 220000 east german workers nationwide are in such 
programs and another 240000 are expected to be added shortly the 
government said about 162000 workers are unemployed 
negotiations are continuing in other parts of metalworking and 
electronics industries a sector that employs 16 million of the 
nations 8 million workers

the house and senate opened talks on clean air 
legislation today as a white house aide reiterated president bushs 
opposition to giving financial aid to workers who lose their jobs 
because of tougher pollution controls 
the congressional talks lasted only an hour today and are 
expected to drag on for weeks 
separate clean air bills passed by the house and senate last 
spring call for tougher pollution controls on factories 
automobiles and electric power plants breezed through both the 
house and senate last spring their aim is to curb urban smog cut 
toxic industrial releases and acid rain pollution by the end of the 
decade 
but scores of differences will have to be resolved in the coming 
weeks 
a major issue will involved job protection for workers who 
become unemployed by the tougher pollution controls the house bill 
contains a threeyear 250 million assistance program for such 
workers and the senate version does not 
after todays housesenate session roger porter president 
bushs chief domestic policy adviser who will sit in on the talks 
said the administration remains fundamentally opposed to any 
jobs protection provision and that he would recommend the president 
veto legislation containing such a program 
it sets a precedence that were uncomfortable with said 
porter in an interview 
even though no substantive agreements were reached in the first 
session senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
remained hopeful and certain that a compromise bill can be 
worked out with the house before congress is scheduled to adjourn 
in early october 
many members of congress would like to wrap up action on clean 
air before the november election in view of polls that indicate the 
environment and clean air are important voter concerns 
environmentalists on thursday expressed concern that the tight 
congressional schedule may jeopardize a strong clean air bill 
especially if it is held over for final action in a possible 
lameduck session after the november election 
the time for approving a good bill is running out richard 
ayres chairman of the national clean air coalition said he noted 
that in 1976 a clean air bill won approval by both the house and 
senate and cleared a conference committee only to die in the final 
days of a session because of a senate filibuster 
the issue of job protection has dogged both the senate and house 
bills 
in the senate an aid package for coal miners lost by only a 
single vote after an emotional appeal by veteran sen robert c 
byrd dwva the house approved a less ambitious assistance 
measure which calls for spending 250 million over three years in 
extended unemployment compensation for workers in all industries 
who lose their jobs to pollution controls 
lobbying by industry as well as environmental groups also is 
expected to intensify during the talks as both sides see the 
conference as a last chance to influence the final law 
neither side completely likes either the house or senate version 
the auto industry is expected to fight the alternativefuel 
provision in the house bill under it the industry this decade 
would have to build 300000 vehicles that use a fuel other than 
gasoline as part of a pilot program in california 
but a house provision on automobile tailpipe emission controls 
is preferred by automakers over a similar version in the senate 
bill requirements in both bills for cleaner fuels in cities with 
the worst smog problems is strongly opposed by the oil companies as 
well as the white house because it allegedly favors an ethanol 
blend over other fuels 
environmentalists will push to retain tougher toxic industrial 
emission controls enacted by the house because they cover a broader 
range of small polluters than the senate bill industry argues the 
house version will drive many small companies out of business 
the administration meanwhile is expected to seek changes in 
the house bill that call for new pollution controls for national 
parks and for specific phaseout requirements for various chemicals 
that harm the ozone layer

house speaker thomas s foley accused a 
republican party leader today of trying to politicize the growing 
savings and loan scandals with unrestrained and totally raw 
partisanship 
democrats on the house judiciary committee meanwhile signed a 
letter seeking a special prosecutors investigation of a failed 
colorado savings and loan where president bushs son neil was a 
director 
foley dwash responded sharply to comments a day earlier by 
ed rollins chairman of the republican congressional campaign 
committee who urged party leaders to get on the offensive and 
blame democrats for the sampl scandals 
in his speech rollins said for a few million dollars in 
campaign contributions the democrats sold out the taxpayers 
foley said rollins sounded like he was in a panic and has 
demonstrated he is an out of control person 
the fact is hes a political operative a hired gun foley 
said hes there to spread whatever mischief he can 
certainly hes not the most composed rational and fair minded man 
in town in either party 
he called rollinss remarks a wild statement and 
unrestrained and totally raw partisanship 
foleys broadside came as 12 house judiciary committee democrats 
signed a letter asking attorney general dick thornburgh to appoint 
a special prosecutor to investigate the 1 billion failure of 
silverado banking savings and loan association 
republican house whip newt gingrich of georgia charged the move 
was politically motivated i am sick of the stench of corruption 
and hypocrisy which permeates the democratic party on capitol 
hill he said thursday 
but thornburgh said he would consider the request and respond 
within 30 days as the law requires 
in another development thursday involving silverado rep frank 
annunzio dill suggested that a 10000 donation to the 
republicans by developer ken good could have been hush money to 
block an investigation of the denver thrift 
annunzio who has accused the bush administration of not 
prosecuting savings and loan fraud vigorously didnt provide 
specific evidence to back up his allegation concerning the nov 2 
1988 donation 
good a business partner of neil bush and a former shareholder 
in silverado accused annunzio of spreading vicious false 
accusations in the public arena without any basis 
no government agency at any level has accused me of any 
wrongdoing good said in a statement issued by his attorney he 
said the donation was made two yars after he ended his relationship 
with silverado 
neil bush has denied any wrongdoing and the president has 
defended the honor and integrity of his son at news 
conferences neil bushs attorney james nesland said his client 
would have no comment thursday 
the democrats on the house judiciary committee said the 
involvement of the presidents son good and other political 
contributors poses a conflict of interest in a justice department 
investigation of silverado 
its a clearcut case for a special prosecutor said rep 
john bryant dtexas a member of the judiciary committee who 
signed the letter 
but gingrich said the democrats were being hypocrites who 
pretend they care about ethics and then exploit the presidents son 
for their own narrow partisan reasons 
if the democrats move forward with their request gingrich said 
he would press for special prosecutors to explore the role of seven 
current and former democratic lawmakers in the thrift crisis 
annunzio said officials of the office of thrift supervision made 
five criminal referrals concerning silverado to the justice 
department but the thrift office has refused to give him the names 
or dates of those referrals he speculated that one of the 
referrals could have involved good 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said the names of any 
people who might be involved wouldnt be made public since they 
would be part of a pending investigation he wouldnt confirm 
whether silverado referrals had been made to the department 
good donated more than 90000 to republican candidates in the 
198788 period including 5750 for george bushs presidential 
bid the federal election commission said about 85000 was given 
to candidates other than bush in november 1988 just before the 
elections 
records show good contributed 750 in august 1986 and 5000 in 
october 1987 to the bush presidential campaign said fec spokesman 
scott moxley 
during neil bushs tenure on its board silverado loaned good 
around 30 million that was never repaid federal regulators have 
ordered the presidents son to answer allegations of conflict of 
interest in his role as a director of the thrift 
among others the regulators allege that he failed to adequately 
disclose his ties to good

attorneys 
gov michael s dukakis said thursday he wants the legislature 
to include 1 million for timothy shepards family in a deficiency

december claiming that brutal inhumane and lifethreatening 
training practices killed her 25yearold husband 
other defendants in the suit included the criminal justice 
training council training academy officials and state police 
training officers 
shepard and 15 other recruits in the 50member class became ill 
during the first day of training a hot day in september 1988 at 
the agawam training academy shepard died two months later 
the incident led to changes in the way the state trains police

an irish envoy waited in vain friday for 
word whether kidnapped irish teacher brian keenan would be the 
european hostage irans official news agency says will likely be 
freed 
hopes of a weekend release diminished as syrian president hafez 
assad and foreign minister farouk alsharaa a key figure in 
arranging previous hostage releases prepared to fly to cairo 
saturday for a twoday visit 
the summit with egyptian president hosni mubarak will be the 
final chapter in a reconciliation between syria and egypt that 
ended a 12year rift caused by egypts 1979 peace treaty with 
israel 
adrian mcdaid first secretary of the irish embassy in baghdad 
which also oversees irish affairs in lebanon flew to beirut 
thursday to verify that mr keenan will be the european hostage 
released 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported last 
sunday that proiranian shiite moslem extremists might release a 
hostage it did not say who would be freed but said it probably 
would be one of the 10 european hostages 
mcdaid visited irnas beirut office on friday and met with the 
agencys resident correspondent mussayeb naimih 
we stressed that our sources are reliable and we explained to 
mr mcdaid that the hostage to be released will probably be a 
european national naimih told the associated press 
he asked us about the reports that said keenan will be 
released and we explained to him that our report did not name the 
hostage naimih said 
before visiting irna mcdaid had spent the day at the irish 
consulate in moslem west beirut waiting for the kidnappers or 
other moslem leaders to contact him but consulate sources said no 
one did 
im here to collect information about the possible release of 
mr brian keenan we dont have official confirmation that it will 
be him but we are hopeful that it will be him mcdaid said 
sources close to the headquarters of the syrian army in lebanon 
said there were no indications that the release of any of the 16 
western captives was imminent 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said brig gen 
ghazi kenaan commander of syrian military intelligence in lebanon 
was in syria which indicates that nothing major is cooking for 
the time being 
kenaan has always been in beirut for previous releases when 
hostages are usually handed over to syrian intelligence and driven 
to damascus to be repatriated 
sources close to syrian army command in beirut have speculated 
that keenan will be freed 
keenan a 39yearold english language teacher from belfast was 
kidnapped in west beirut april 11 1986 as he walked to the 
american university of beirut where he worked 
the other western captives are six americans four britons two 
west germans two swiss and an italian the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
officials and diplomats in damascus noted thursday that a 
hostage release was not likely before assad and sharaa return 
mcdaid said the duration of his stay in lebanon depends on 
developments 
no group has claimed to hold keenan or made any demands for his 
release 
but former hostage frank reed an american educator who was 
freed april 30 said he saw keenan two days before his release 
he said he had spent almost three years in the same house or 
room with him and kidnapped british journalist john mccarthy

the last time a trolley lumbered from los 
angeles to long beach was in 1961 when the pacific electric red 
car line died of neglect by carcrazed southern californians 
the red cars first rolled on july 4 1902 when thousands jammed 
the trolleys for an inaugural ride through scenic countryside and 
farming communities like compton 
clean beaches with lively waves an enormous heated saltwater 
bathhouse and a growing amusement zone known as the pike awaited 
them in long beach accommodations ranged from fancy hotels to tent 
camps 
in the decades since nothing at the start the middle or the 
end of the 22 miles of track has remained the same only the route 
of the new blue line trains beginning service this weekend is 
identical 
barely a city a century ago los angeles has become the 
countrys second largest metropolis traffic is terrible and the 
air can be dirty police battle street gangs its infrastructure is 
aging and nearing the breaking point 
despite its problems los angeles continues to attract new waves 
of immigrants 
long beach has turned from tourism to become a topranked 
seaport oil producer and business center but the city also had 
the states largest crime increase last year much of includes kojak 
the rockford files 
baretta and cbs old latenight night heat with the 
onehour top cops hes entering what is known as reality 
tv 
in each show three real police officers recount the most 
memorable experiences of their careers as each of their stories is 
recreated with actors playing the cops 
the premiere includes the tale of paul ragonese of the new york 
police departments bomb squad and how he felt when helping disarm 
a particularly complex bomb containing 15 sticks of dynamite 
the bomb was found in middecember 1986 in an empty abortion 
clinic in manhattan it had been put there by a madman whose target 
was the bomb squad 
the man later surrendered got a threeyear prison term and was 
out in two grosso says 
im really trying to let people understand what its like to 
be a cop he says and that those streets out there are telling 
us every day something aint working pal 
despite 14 years in the entertainment business grossos heart 
as you might expect remains with cops 
one thing you have going in the police department is that any 
cop no matter who he is can get a call man with a gun or 
family dispute and be right in the middle his life on the 
line he says 
whereas so many people in this business never take a chance 
never go out on a limb and never understand the camaraderie never 
understand what it means to get along with people you work with 
because youre dependent upon them for your safety

the gunslinger of the old west may be 
poised for a comeback in mississippi because of a loophole in a 
new gun law 
on july 1 the states new gun permit law went into effect and 
to the chagrin of the governor lawmakers and law enforcement 
officials it allows most mississippians to tote concealed handguns 
almost anywhere including sports events bars and even the state 
capitol 
an 11thhour attempt to fix the flawed legislation failed in a 
special legislative session last month and law enforcement 
officials fear its looseness will allow the wrong people to be 
armed and in the wrong places 
its the law and weve got to live with it said sharkey 
county sheriff joe ford president of the mississippi sheriffs 
association 
the law allows mississippians over age 21 willing to pay 100 
for a threeyear permit to carry a concealed weapon the only 
exceptions are convicted felons fugitives drug and alcohol 
abusers the mentally incompetent illegal aliens those 
dishonorably discharged from the military those who renounce their 
citizenship or those who falsify permit applications 
applicants must undergo background checks be fingerprinted and 
photographed but the background check requirement is indicative of 
what critics say is the sloppiness of the law 
it says that applications are to be issued within 30 days but 
the state department of public safety says such checks with the fbi 
take about six weeks its also not clear when the 30day period is 
intended to start 
and law enforcement officials complain theres no provision for 
revoking the permits which are automatically renewable 
the law began as a state senate bill to allow judges to carry 
handguns but it evolved in the house into a bill to loosen up an 
old law that defined a weapon as concealed if any part of it was 
not open to view 
lawmakers have since admitted they made a mistake but they 
failed to pass a cleanup bill at last months special session 
unless gov ray mabus calls a special session for which there 
are no plans the law stays on the books until the legislature can 
act when it meets in regular session in early january 
the mississippi rifle and pistol association an affliate of the 
national rifle association lobbied for the passage of the law but 
with the understanding that the glitches would be ironed out said 
group president david hawkins 
hawkins said he was disappointed that the cleanup bill was not 
passed it was a very good compromise a bill we all liked and 
something we could live with thats what we wanted passed he 
said 
state and law enforcement officials in mississippi are still 
assessing what has happened and what can be done said cliff 
treyens a spokesman for mabus 
officials hope to have a solution by the end of the month 
possibly before the first of the permits are issued 
applications are accepted only on wednesday beginning with this 
week on the first day 426 people sought permits 
in 1987 florida also had to fix a flaw in a new concealed 
weapons law after lawmakers inadvertently repealed a provision that 
prohibited people from carrying firearms openly in public 
once the glitch was discovered lawmakers came back into session 
to repeal it and are now satisified with the amended law said 
robin hassler staff director of the florida house of 
representativess committee on criminal justice 
lawmakers say mississippis law once it is amended will be 
similar to floridas

an organization of protestant roman catholic 
and eastern orthodox publications has strongly protested 
restrictive moves on the southern baptist news agency and ouster 
orders against its top editors 
we are alarmed that responsible and respected journalists have 
been penalized and dismissed for their proper reporting of the 
news officers of the associated church press said in a letter 
sent to officials of the southern baptist convention 
the organization represents 195 periodicals of various 
denominations and independent religious publications 
the letter dated tuesday was sent to the rev morris h 
chapman new president of the southern baptists who are now 
controlled by a fundamentalist wing and to its executive committee 
that committee has scheduled a special meeting in nashville 
tenn next tuesday to deal with the chief editors of baptist 
press al shackleford and dan martin who have been put under an 
ultimatum to resign or be fired 
the agency which serves 38 weeklies of the 149millionmember 
denomination and also about 400 other news outlets has been 
prohibited in the meantime from carrying news of the affair 
declaring the steps adversely affects the credibility of 
religious journalism in north america donald f hetzler 
executive director of the transdenominational press group and its 
president mary lou redding wrote 
what makes this situation especially regrettable is that 
southern baptist press has earned a high degree of credibility and 
trust among secular press agencies for its open balanced reporting 
of controversial matters 
chapman has declined comment on actions against the news agency 
editors but said the feeling has surfaced that there seemed 
to be a bias that leaned toward the moderate perspective in the 
convention 
the letter came as various others including editors of baptist 
weeklies across the country decried the crackdown on the news 
agency that was launched by officers of the denominations now 
ruling fundamentalist officers 
television journalist bill moyers defending the journalistic 
integrity of shackleford and martin said a key fundamentalist 
strategist houston judge paul pressler had shamelessly 
engineered the action against them 
in a letter to editors of baptist newspapers moyers urged them 
to rise to challenge this vindictive act and the bully who is 
responsibile he rules the southern baptist convention like a 
swaggerring caesar breaking good men when it pleases him 
pressler reported out of the country and unavailable for 
comment is vice chairman of the denominations executive 
committee and has frequently criticized baptist press 
moyers a lifelong southern baptist said the two longtime 
editors were being dumped on the street because they refused 
to dishonor their calling and refused to be lackeys for paul 
pressler 
meanwhile nashville attorney frank ingraham a southern baptist 
opponent of fundamentalist tactics appealed to its executive 
committee for a fair hearing for the editors 
in a letter to the committee chairman the rev sam w pace of 
lawton okla ingraham protested indications that it would 
arbitrarily act tuesday on a motion to terminate shackleford 
and martin without discussion 
pleading for a chance to defend them ingraham asked if the 
committee was going to deny southern baptists the opportunity to 
judge the reasonableness of your actions or make a display of 
raw power 
certainly baptists in the pews of the churches of our 
convention will call you to account for these arbitrary displays of 
raw power ingraham wrote they will ferret out those 
responsible and deal with them appropriately

senior soviet military officers on friday welcomed 
the visit of nato leader manfred woerner as an important step in 
resolving differences between the western alliance and the warsaw 
pact 
before we could not even imagine such a visit but now things 
are changing so rapidly that even this is possible said army 
gen valentin varennikov chief of soviet ground forces 
i expect this visit concretely to bring our points of view 
closer together he said 
woerner is the first nato general secretary to visit the soviet 
union 
he arrived friday evening and said the aim of his visit was to 
convey a message of peace and friendship to the soviet union from 
the north atlantic treaty organization the tass news agency 
reported 
woerner was greeted at moscows vnukovo2 airport by soviet 
deputy foreign ministers yuli kvitsinsky and viktor karpov as well 
as ambassadors and charges daffaires of nato countries 
only highranking officers all delegates to the 28th communist 
party congress appeared willing to discuss the trip 
this is a positive step lt gen yuri alexeievich said 
during a break in the congress only hours before woerner arrived 
it will help stimulate relations between the two blocs and we 
think these relations should be stronger and stronger 
varennikov linked woerners visit to the invitation extended to 
president mikhail s gorbachev to address nato members at the 
alliances headquarters in brussels 
these are historical steps that can bring our alliances closer 
together he said 
less than a year ago nato and the warsaw pact were defending 
the cold war but events in eastern europe have led military 
leaders to rethink the role of their alliances 
i never thought this would happen we were enemies and 
suddenly there is a friendly visit of a general secretary of nato 
coming to moscow said lt gen david dorogonsky 
the medalladen officer said he thought woerners visit would 
help pave the way for the alliances to work as partners 
gradually the role of the warsaw pact and nato must be 
transformed into political organs dorogonsky said i would 
like to see the warsaw pact and nato be partners not in war but 
in peace and i expect our two sides will be able to take a big 
step toward better understanding 
added lt gen alexeievich the more that people from 
different countries meet and talk the more they will be able to 
solve their problems i am expecting an improvement in the 
political climate of europe

hungarys former communist regime 
apparently allowed the international terrorist carlos to use the 
country as a base while he carried out attacks in austria and west 
germany officials said friday 
east german officials recently announced that carlos also had 
found safe haven in their country under the communist government 
toppled late last year 
carlos also known as the jackal has already been blamed 
for an attack on opec ministers in vienna in dec 21 1975 that 
left three people dead 
the chief public prosecutors office in budapest disclosed 
friday that carlos also is believed responsible for the 1981 
bombing of radio free europe headquarters in munich in which four 
people were seriously injured 
the usfunded organization broadcasts reports to the countries 
of eastern europe many of which were ruled by hardline communist 
governments until prodemocracy revolutions swept the region last 
year 
asked about the prosecutors office statement which was carried 
by the official mti news agency a radio free europe spokeswoman 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said no group had been linked 
to the attack before 
the hungarian statement was the latest in a series of 
revelations that the moscoweducated terrorist had operated from at 
least two former soviet bloc capitals while terrorizing western 
europe carlos a venezuelan remains at large 
east german officials recently announced that carlos also had 
found safe haven in their country under the communist government 
toppled late last year 
the first indication that he had been welcome in hungary 
surfaced june 27 at that time interior minister balazs horvath 
said that former communist party officials provided shelter and 
training facilities for carlos whose real name is ilich ramirez 
sanchez 
one of the documents produced by horvath to back up the 
allegations was a letter allegedly written by carlos to late 
communist party leader janos kadar in 1980 from our base in 
hungary we have developed our international ties getting in 
contact with the revolutions of every nation without any hindrance 
on the part of the hungarian authorities the letter purportedly 
said 
state television a week ago showed what it termed the first film 
footage of carlos in which intelligence agents tried to persuade 
him to leave hungary 
besides alleging that carlos masterminded the radio free europe 
attack and the opec attack while operating from hungary the 
prosecutors office also said he was suspected of piling up an 
arsenal of weapons explosives and ammunition while in budapest 
between 1979 and 1985 
there is wellfounded suspicion that hungarian officials 
and others provided active support for committing these crimes or 
were accomplices the chief public prosecutor said therefore 
investigations have been ordered 
carlos the son of a wealthy communist lawyer also has been 
linked with a bombing dec 31 1984 in marseille that killed five 
people and wounded 41 
he is also accused of plotting the 1975 hijacking of an air 
france jetliner to uganda that ended with the israeli commando raid 
at entebbe airport

six months after he squeaked into office mayor 
david dinkins is taking steady steps toward national political 
prominence 
attacked in the election as indecisive and fiscally incompetent 
dinkins has netted a string of successes that indicate otherwise 
he has balanced a painful budget salved racial wounds gracefully 
escorted nelson mandela 
and this week came his latest coup winning the 1992 democratic 
national convention for the city a prize worth 100 million to the 
economy and uncountable sums in boosting new yorks sometimes 
beleaguered image 
he has done excellently theres nothing about his 
performance that i dont like right now gov mario cuomo said in 
an interview hes a leader now hes a national voice right 
now 
he is doing very well and i applaud him for it said former 
mayor edward i koch whom dinkins toppled after 12 years in 
office there were people who worried about his ability to make 
decisions on the budget he has demolished that fear 
dinkins is the first black to serve as mayor of the nations 
most populous city he often cites his marines service as a 
formative experience in his life unlike the voluble and sometimes 
abrasive koch he is a quiet conciliator a negotiator and a 
champion of tolerance 
ed koch was a confrontational mayor a verbally provocative 
mayor said mitchell moss director of the urban research center 
at new york university dinkins verbal skills have been to allay 
racial fears and urge restraint this is a great change after 
koch 
political analysts say some of dinkins attraction has simply 
been the change of tone and he may have been aided by low 
expectations 
people voted for him with hope but not with much 
confidence said david garth kochs longtime political media 
adviser when dinkins won novembers election by only 40000 votes 
said garth there was great suspicion of his strength 
the expectations of david dinkins werent as high as they 
should have been hes benefited from that said cuomo 
but he has earned his accolades confronted with a huge budget 
gap dinkins responded with 850 million in spending cuts and 850 
million in tax increases mainly income and property taxes 
verdict as good as koch if not better said charles 
brecher research director of the citizens budget commission a 
watchdog group he handled the budget extremely well said 
felix rohatyn the financier who engineered the citys recovery 
from its 1970s fiscal crisis 
next came race relations faced with tensions surrounding the 
bensonhurst racial killing trial and a black boycott of a korean 
grocery dinkins asked for prime time on local television he used 
it for an impassioned speech urging racial harmony 
it was well received as a spiritual leader he put the black 
middle class in the forefront rather than the street radicals 
said moss 
at times the speech seemed a lecture on civility david in a 
way is a kindly father figure he has basically said to the city 
you have to be in by 11 said political consultant norman adler 
mandelas visit last month was another success 
no way in the world mandela would have spent one night in 
gracie mansion with ed koch said moss but mandela spent three 
nights as dinkins guest at the mayors residence the mandela 
visit gave david dinkins an opportunity to position himself as a 
national and international urban leader moss added 
what hes starting to build is a certain kind of respect 
said garth in the beginning it was begrudging now its serious 
respect if he can get through the next year that kind of respect 
can grow into a national image

chancellor helmut kohl travels to 
moscow this weekend in another effort to soothe soviet concerns 
about german unification and win approval for a united germanys 
membership in nato 
traveling with kohl are foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
and finance minister theo waigel whose presence has fueled rumors 
that kohl will propose some form of financial aid to the soviets 
sources in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity said no new 
financial aid was in the offing 
west germany has already backed a 3 billion west german bank 
credit to the soviet union to help its economy develop toward an 
open market bonn has also agreed to pay 780 million toward the 
upkeep of soviet soldiers in east germany in the second half of 
this year 
at this weeks summit of the worlds leading democratic 
financial powers in houston leaders rejected a bid by west 
germany france and italy to put together a 15 billion aid plan to 
help the moribund soviet economy 
west german government spokesman hans klein briefing reporters 
friday on kohls visit said the visit was in support of 
progressing the twoplusfour talks on the way to achieving a 
united germany in the western alliance 
the twoplusfour talks bring together the foreign ministers 
of the two germanys and the world war ii victors the united 
states soviet union france and britain to work out the 
international ramifications of german unification expected by the 
end of this year 
during his visit kohl will meet with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and has been invited to stop sunday in stavropol 
gorbachevs hometown 
klein said west germany considered the invitation to stavropol 
an especially personal gesture and a good omen 
the germanys have already merged their economies and social 
welfare systems and are working on resolving legal and 
constitutional issues so that allgerman elections and full german 
unification can take place by december 
one of the major obstacles to international approval for german 
unification has been the soviets rejection of membership in the 
north atlantic treaty organization for a united germany east 
germany was the soviets first line of defense against the west 
and moscow has about 380000 of its top troops stationed there 
klein said kohl would emphasize especially clearly that our 
politics are embedded in the area of the north atlantic alliance 
and the european community 
kohls moscow trip also follows the nato summit in london where 
leaders pledged to reduce both nuclear and conventional defenses in 
europe and said they had no aggressive intentions toward the 
soviet union they also said nato would not in any circumstance 
be the first to use force 
during the nato summit the germans also promised to announce by 
the fall their plans for troop cutbacks in a united germany

vice president dan quayle told families of 
missing servicemen friday that hell never apologize for his 
vietnamera service in the national guard but that those who 
fought made a far far greater sacrifice than he 
quayle noted his national guard service which became an issue 
in the 1988 presidential campaign in a speech opening the 21st 
annual meeting of the 3650member national league of families of 
american prisoners and missing in southeast asia 
as you know during the vietnam era i served in the indiana 
national guard he said and while i have not apologized and 
never will for my national guard service i recognize that the 
members of my generation who served in vietnam made a sacrifice for 
their country that was far far greater than mine 
the men and women who served in vietnam were heroes not just 
because of their deeds of valor but because they served at a time 
when words like duty honor and country had lost their meaning for 
many quayle said for the rest of my life i will live in 
admiration of their courage 
quayle was given a standing ovation at the conclusion of his 
remarks 
as george bushs running mate quayle was dogged by accusations 
that he avoided combat duty by joining the national guard 
the issue surfaced again may 9 when some members of the american 
legion of paris boycotted a ceremony commemorating the late 
president eisenhowers world war ii service as supreme allied 
commander the vice president spoke at the ceremony in the french 
capital 
quayle who was to speak later friday to the republican national 
committee in chicago also told the powmia group that the 
fullest possible accounting of missing servicemen will 
continue to be a matter of highest national priority until we 
achieve success 
we will do everything a government can do to recover your 
loved ones he aid and if we discover proof of captivity 
action will be taken to bring our men home 
he added however that us efforts can be fully productive 
only if vietnam makes the political decision truly to cooperate 
with us 
the vietnamese government must realize that cooperation now 
to clear up this issue of tremendous national concern can remove 
the last vestige of the war and lay the groundwork for improved 
relations in the context of a comprehensive settlement in 
cambodia he said 
another group the newly formed national alliance of families 
for the return of american servicemen was holding a forum later in 
the day on its belief that as many as 5000 prisoners of war from 
the korean war may have remained in chinese and soviet labor camps 
and some could still be alive 
however betsy cox public relations director of the larger 
group said there was absolutely no intelligence to back up such 
assertions 
state department and defense department officials also have said 
there is no verifiable evidence to support such claims 
sig harbak of seattle an organizer of the smaller alliance 
said the defense department declined an invitation to attend that 
groups meeting 
alliance members want public disclosure of information in 
government files concerning powmia personnel from world war ii 
the korean war and vietnam the bill they support would exempt 
information that would compromise national security by disclosing 
sources and methods of intelligence 
the league of families opposes that legislation saying it could 
jeopardize americans who might still be held

magic have gathered in this city to amaze be amazed surprise be 
surprised and to share the latest secrets of nowyousee it and 
nowyou dont 
dealers in magic paraphernalia offer up modern miracles ranging 
in price from a few bucks for devices to make silk handkerchiefs 
disappear to thousands of dollars to make lovely women appear out 
of small cages 
and in nearly every nook and cranny of the convention site one 
can see 20foot flames spring from bare hands cards and coins 
levitate or you can pick a card any card and its certain to 
turn up in the most unexpected places in the most unexpected way 
dailey a performer in her own right is married to past

tells wives of performers if you fall in love with a magician 
the magic will never go out of your life 
her installation as president became official friday the 13th a 
date that holds no fear for dailey she and frank were married on a 
friday the 13th in june 1969 
the field of magic has gone and is undergoing a subtle 
metamorphosis the trusty old rabbit in the hat has given way to 
high tech wonders where solid safety pins link and unlink where

age but is a mother of three daughters and grandmother to 11 
there are the superstars who are society members such as david 
copperfield and harry blackstone jr but most members according 
to dailey are people from all walks of life who have an interest 
in magic 
typical of the new breed of magician is sister carol ann a nun 
from stamford who is also an honorary assistant coach for the new 
york giants 
sister carol ann said she has entertained the giants before big 
games with magic including a special effect that involved burning 
a 100 bill and restoring it without divine intervention 
they enjoyed that so much they did the wave for me she

lawmakers friday voted to sell off 
polands state industries a major step in the solidarityled 
governments 7monthold program of radical economic reforms 
designed to build a market economy 
the author of those reforms deputy prime minister leszek 
balcerowicz described the legislation as the most fundamental 
bill ever passed by the polish parliament 
the government owns 80 percent of industry in poland including 
steel mills coal mines and factories none of the 7600 state 
enterprises would be offlimits to privatization officials said 
all citizens will be given privatization bonds that can be 
redeemed for company stocks allowing the estimated 65 percent of 
polish families with no savings to become shareholders 
the sejm or the lower house of parliament passed the 
legislation 3282 with 39 abstentions the vote came one day after 
the longdelayed bill reached the floor 
a separate bill creating a ministry to oversee the changes 
passed 2660 with 22 abstentions 
the legislation must still be ratified by the senate on july 19 
but with 99 of 100 senators elected from the noncommunist 
solidarity movement it was not expected to encounter any 
difficulty 
this is a foundation of the new economic system in poland 
balcerowicz said after the vote 
the finance ministry official in charge of privatization 
krzysztof lis said there would be problems putting the bill into 
practice such as assembling the new ministry and creating a stock 
market 
but wide consensus has been created for privatization and 
this is the most important thing lis said 
before introducing the vote on thursday balcerowicz said the 
ownership changes must be completed more quickly than in any 
country that has attempted it before us 
companies in the best financial shape would be sold first those 
judged unsalvageable will be liquidated and their assets sold off 
still officials estimated that only a dozen major factories 
would be privatized in the first year and even after three years 
fewer than half would be in private hands 
meanwhile selling or leasing state stores boutiques 
restaurants and services to individuals socalled small 
privatization is already under way and is expected to be 
completed by late 1991 
hungary and czechoslovakia are moving toward selling off their 
state industries 
in hungary the new centrist government has sold some 
enterprises but is taking a cautious approach hoping to minimize 
the negative consequences such as unemployment and higher prices 
in czechoslovakia the government intends to issue coupons this 
fall that would allow workers to buy their own companies the main 
privatization laws are expected next year 
poland whose communist regime was replaced by the solidarity 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki in august in 
january embarked on a radical economic reform program the first 
goal was to stabilize runaway inflation 
the program whittled inflation down to 34 percent in june 
compared with 600 percent to 1000 percent inflation in 1989 but 
the social cost has been high real incomes have dropped by 30 
percent 
but the privatization measure was stalled for months because of 
disputes over how to proceed many people feared privatization 
would benefit only foreign investors or the former communist elite 
who alone would have capital to buy state property 
but the government promised to issue all citizens 
privatization bonds which can be used toward the purchase of 
stateowned property 
it also promised citizens would be allowed to buy shares on an 
installment basis and in some cases on favorable credit terms 
in this way the idea of citizens stock ownership will be put 
into practice balcerowicz said 
in a nod to workers who under communist rule came to think of 
factories as their property employees can buy up to 20 percent of 
shares in their own companies on preferential terms 
foreign investment will be at the discretion of the minister 
responsible for privatization officials said 
the first step in the process will be to convert all stateowned 
enterprises into jointstock companies owned in full by the state 
treasury they said

elsewhere in europe the reductions would be achieved within the 
time frame of a conventional forces treaty but negotiations 
between the two superpowers have stalled 
the committee also included a provision that would allow bush to 
refuse to reduce troops in europe if he believes the cut isnt in 
the nations security interests 
the panel approved a total personnel cut of 100000 more than 
three times the 38000 the pentagon proposed for 1991 and set a 
fiscal 1995 target of 16 military personnel a reduction of nearly 
475000 from current levels 
faced with increasing demands on the money usually earmarked for 
defense the committee cut 972 million from the administrations 
request of 47 billion for the strategic defense initiative 
commonly known as star wars 
last year congress approved the first reduction in the program 
since president reagan introduced the antimissile shield seven 
years ago 
amendments to change the sdi figure are certain once the bill 
reaches the full senate just before the august recess lawmakers 
said 
even if its technically feasible no one has a chart 
showing how you pay for it nunn said about star wars 
responding to recent signals from the air force that the b2 
stealth bomber is its top priority the committee approved the 
pentagons revised proposal for two of the radarevading aircraft 
in fiscal 1991 
but clashes over the bomber now estimated at a cost of 860 
million apiece are expected on the senate floor 
while approving the b2 money the committee slashed more than 
16 billion from a plan to move mx landbased nuclear missiles 
from fixed silos to railroad cars 
the panel earmarked only 548 million in research and 
development money for the program and 202 million for the 
singlewarhead midgetman missile 
a floor battle also is expected over the committees decision to 
kill the milstar program by eliminating the administrations budget 
request of 13 billion the air force program of a communications 
satellite was to be the us command and control system for a 
nuclear war 
the committee also 
deferred procurement of the c17 transport plane because of 
development and testing delays for a savings of 18 billion 
trimmed 150 million from the more than 400 million request 
for the lh helicopter and directed the army to postpone fullscale 
development and fly a prototype first 
eliminated procurement funds for the a12 aircraft for a 
savings of 15 billion 
approved 238 million in research and development money for the 
v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft bush proposed canceling 
deleted all new funds for chemical weapons production

the head of nasas investigation of the hubble 
space telescopes blurred vision said friday it may take more than 
six months to pinpoint the error but that the probe should reveal 
what went wrong and who was responsible 
dr lew allen chairman of the nasa review panel told a house 
panel the results of the investigation could prove very 
embarrassing to those responsible for the flaw 
we are confident we have the ability to find the error and 
determine responsibility he said 
allen making his first congressional appearance since the probe 
began testified before the house committee on science space and 
technology 
the most likely problem allen said is an error in the 
curvature of the telescopes primary 94inch mirror that makes it 
impossible to properly focus the 15 billion observatory 
the margin of error is microscopic to the human eye but enough 
to make the telescopes vision no better than quality observatories 
on the ground the mistake makes it impossible to focus light from 
all parts of the mirror onto one point 
dr lennard a fisk a nasa associate administrator said the 
focus problem will be corrected for the main hubble camera in 1993 
when a replacement camera is flown up to the telescope by the space 
shuttle and spacewalking astronauts switch instruments 
but that mission will correct the focus for only one of the five 
instruments on board hubble other corrections will have to wait 
until 1996 and later 
the error is very large said fisk therefore some simple 
lowcost norisk test could have been done that could have 
detected the flaw 
asked why such tests before the telescope was assemble were not 
performed fisk said were asking those same questions 
allen said the instrument used to measure the mirrors when they 
were constructed nearly a decade ago a null corrector has been 
untouched since it was used and was impounded by the review 
panel 
if there was an error in the corrector it would cause the 
primary mirror to be configured wrong he said 
committee chairman robert a roe dnj said allens probe 
could be too narrow and not lead to broad changes in the way nasa 
manages complicated programs and tests complex equipment 
but fisk the chief scientist for the national aeronautics and 
space administration said if we stop at the findings of dr 
allens panel then we will not have done our job we wont stop at 
that 
fisk said he would determine if any management changes should be 
made and would agree to having another panel of outside experts 
examine the agencys management system but only after allens 
review panel concluded its work 
allen said the null corrector that measured the primary mirror 
also was used to measure a 60inch demonstration mirror for the 
telescope project that allows investigators to test the measuring 
instrument to see whether the corrector caused the problem 
but all of these tests will be timeconsuming allen said and 
he told the committee the probe will take perhaps six months or 
more 
we know the most likely outcome from our investigation he 
said will be findings that are very embarrassing to someone or 
some group 
members peppered fisk with questions on why the mirrors werent 
tested after the entire telescope was built 
although fisk cited technical reasons for the decision nasa 
officials had said in earlier statements that such testing would 
have required up to 300 million and the construction of a special 
facility 
the testing fisk said would have been extremely complicated 
it was questionable whether it would yield the information we 
wanted and it ran serious risk of contaminating the mirrors for 
measuring ultra violet rays a function that was not affected by 
the focus flaw

nassau county must pay a 180000 fine for 
failing to meet deadlines for ending ocean dumping of sludge the 
us environmental protection agency said friday 
the county under a court agreement had been required to award 
two sets of contracts by may 15 one to acquire sludge dewatering 
equipment and a second to build sludge dewatering facilities 
failure to award the contracts triggered penalties that 
accumulated at a rate of 2000 a day from may 15 through june 13 
then 10000 a day from june 14 through june 25 the epa said 
nassau has paid the 180000 into an escrow account 
had the county begun building its sludge dewatering plant by 
june 30 the penalties would have been forgiven 
epa regional administrator constantine sidamoneristoff said the 
penalties will continue building and will reach 420000 on july 25 
nassau is one of nine areas in new york and new jersey that dump 
more than 8 million tons of sewage yearly into an atlantic ocean 
site 115 miles off new jersey the eight other authorities are on 
or close to schedule for ending their ocean dumping the epa said

house speaker thomas s foley responded 
sharply friday to republican official ed rollins attempt to blame 
democrats for the savings and loan mess calling him a panicked 
out of control person 
rollins chairman of the republican congressional campaign 
committee told the republican national committee in chicago a day 
earlier democrats sold out the taxpayers he urged the party 
to get on the offensive about the sampl disaster which could cost 
american taxpayers 300 billion or more by some estimates 
foley dwash called the remarks mr rollins emotional 
ravings and added it sounded like he was in a panic it 
was sort of a running doggerel of political invective 
he said rollins had made a wild statement and unrestrained 
and totally raw partisan accusation 
foleys strong words were in contrast to his normally reserved 
demeanor 
he noted that rollins milliondollar contract with the party to 
head its congressional campaign committee has been controversial 
among republicans he said rollins demonstrated he was sort of an 
out of control person by earlier statements that he would 
continue to attack democratic congressmen on taxes even though 
president bush has called for a tax increase to reduce the budget 
deficit 
the fact is hes a political operative a hired gun foley 
said hes there to spread whatever mischief he can 
certainly hes not the most composed rational and fair minded 
man in town in either party he said 
rollins in his remarks in chicago said he was responding to 
democratic attacks concerning the sampl situation and frequent 
mention of bushs son neil who is under investigation for his role 
as a director of the failed silverado banking savings and loan in 
denver 
rollins said democrats in congress resisted early reagan and 
bush administration efforts to clean up the troubled industry 
because of the financial support they were getting from sampl 
interests 
foley in his response said he could think of no attack by 
democrats on the issue that compared in partisanship to rollinss 
remarks

one successful military invasion deserves 
another or so say officials planning a second attack on panama 
to celebrate mcchord air force bases 50th anniversary 
the highlight of saturdays daylong show of military might is a 
reenactment of the december invasion the event is billed as a 
joint services air power demonstration complete with 
explosions and strafing runs paratroopers dropping from the sky 
and planes zooming in from overhead 
we in this office never intended to call it the panama 
reenactment but a lot of the planes and some troops that are 
jumping did actually participate in the real invasion said maj 
art dearing an anniversary coordinator 
its the same general attack scenario we used in world war ii 
in vietnam in panama and in grenada dearing said friday 
still an earlier press release promised the most spectacular 
event of anniversary celebrations would be a reenactment of 
the invasion of panama with the actual aircraft aircrews and 
soldiers who were there participating 
the action at the base south of tacoma begins with a simulated 
bomb run by an a10 thunderbolt followed by a fake strafing run by 
a canadian air force ct33 charges will be planted in the ground 
for the explosions dearing said 
after the area is cleared of the enemy an air force combat 
controller team will jump from 6000 feet but not open their 
parachutes until 1000 feet above the ground 
that will be followed by more simulated bombing and a drop of 
simulated heavy equipment and ammunition and more control team 
members 
the finale is when c141 transports drop 150 army rangers from 
nearby fort lewis onto the field the rangers belong to a unit that 
went to panama where they jumped from only 500 feet in seizing the 
rio hato military airfield dearing said 
but there will be some major differences between panama ii 
and the original no one will be standing in for gen manuel 
noriega who as a result of the real attack is in custody in 
florida on drugsmuggling charges 
nor will the attackers be shielded by the cloak of night 
from the enemy the event begins in midafternoon there wont be 
an enemy either just onlookers on what is expected to be a clear 
sunny day 
the base expects around 100000 people to attend the simulated 
attack dearing said 
i would say the controversy over panama or panama ii has 
increased interest he said and its free 
about 625 rangers from fort lewis flew out of mcchord to 
participate in the real thing two were killed and 36 injured in 
the dec 20 predawn assault and subsequent action

a leading dissident under house arrest 
since last july will not be released next week as scheduled the 
military indicated friday and warned her party not to try to 
declare a government despite its landslide election victory 
maj gen khin nyunt head of military intelligence said the 
junta would not yield to international pressure for the release of 
aung san suu kyi and a transfer of power to her national league for 
democracy 
suu kyi the charismatic daughter of burmas foremost 
independence hero was placed under house arrest july 20 1989 for 
one year the junta said then that the sentence could be renewed 
khin nyunt said suu kyi would be allowed to hold a religious 
ceremony at her home on july 19 indicating she would remain in 
detention the day her intial sentence is to expire 
july 19 is martyrs day the 43rd anniversary of the 
assassination of suu kyis father aung san the junta detained suu 
kyi after she said she would lead an antigovernment rally to 
commemorate her fathers death 
she has never been formally charged 
the pressure to release her and threat of economic sanctions 
amounted to undue interference in the internal affairs of our 
country khin nyunt said 
we do not care at all about such threats he said 
in the election the national league trounced the main 
promilitary party winning 396 of 485 parliamentary seats but the 
junta has said the national league must approve a constitution 
before it can govern 
the junta is a military government ruling the country under 
martial law no attempt for a unilateral declaration of government 
will be tolerated khin nyunt said 
the junta suspended the constitution when it seized power by 
brutally crushing a national uprising for democracy in 1988 
in the past it has said the new parliament could choose between 
two previous constitutions or draw up a new one 
the national league has said it wishes to adapt the constitution 
of 1947 that constitution was adopted when burma gained 
independence from britain a year later 
but khin nyunt said both the 1947 and 1974 constitutions are 
no longer adaptable to the countrys present situation 
hence an entirely new constitution which would not entail 
legal problems arising out of its shortcomings must be drawn he 
said 
western diplomats in rangoon say the insistence on the 
constitution is a ploy to cling to power 
khin nyunt said the junta would hold talks with political 
leaders only when all election expenses and objections had been 
cleared by the elections commission 
he said suu kyi was being detained according to the law and 
that she had been treated leniently 
though she is restricted to her home all facilities are being 
provided for he said she has been allowed to receive parcels 
from her british husband through the british embassy khin nyunt 
said

president bush said friday chances of reaching 
a compromise with democrats on legislation to combat job bias look 
encouraging and his optimism was echoed by sponsors of the bill 
as i leave here for the weekend i hope im right in saying it 
looks like we can work something out on that bush said as he 
boarded a helicopter for his camp david md retreat 
sponsors say the measure is needed to redress setbacks handed to 
the civil rights movement by the increasingly conservative supreme 
court 
but the bill has drawn fire from the business community for a 
provision that would make employers end disparate or lopsided 
hiring practices or prove in court that they were justified by 
business necessity 
much of the negotiations have focused on the definition of the 
business necessity that would be required 
business critics and the bush administration say the provision 
would prompt companies to hire on the basis of minority quotas to 
insulate themselves from lawsuits 
bushs comments came as reports swept capitol hill that white 
house chief of staff john sununu and sen edward m kennedy 
dmass had reached agreement in weeklong bargaining over terms of 
a bill to combat job discrimination 
kennedy stopped short of confirming a deal existed but said he 
expected one next week senate democratic leader george mitchell 
dmaine said unless a compromise materialized by tuesday he would 
try to cut short debate and push the bill through over white house 
objections 
some conservative republicans remained cool to the latest 
proposals according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity sen orrin hatch rutah a leading critic said again 
friday the bill would amount to a bonanza for litigators and 
said it would have to be modified considerably 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the job to a 
process for imposing punitive damages in discrimination cases a 
feature business dislikes 
bush stopped to take a few questions on his way to the 
helicopter en route to camp david 
he said that sununu was back today and had a fairly i would 
say reasonably optimistic proposal 
my position on that one remains clear bush said i want 
to sign a civil rights bill i will not sign a quota bill and 
thats about where we are but i think its looking encouraging 
bush said he saw ted kennedy down here yesterday and had a 
chance to share my views with him once again 
and hes been working i would say quite cooperatively with 
us the republican side bush said 
kennedy told a news conference he believed we can successfully 
conclude an agreement next week because of the involvement of 
the administration and bipartisan efforts substantial movement has 
been achieved were dramatically closer

a dance group is suing the national endowment 
for the arts because of its requirement that grant recipients 
promise not to create obscene works 
the bella lewitzky dance foundation filed a lawsuit in us 
district court on thursday claiming the restriction is 
unconstitutional 
in may the new school for social research filed a similar 
lawsuit in new york 
the nea has now taken on the role of art censor and thats 
precisely the wrong role for goverment choreographer bella 
lewitzky said in a statement 
lewitzky last month rejected a 72000 nea grant which would 
have accounted for about 85 percent of the 12member modern dance 
troupes budget said spokesman allen wallace 
in new york a hearing has been scheduled july 31 for the new 
schools challenge which questions the constitutionality of 
loyalty oaths 
the school is a parent of the otisparsons art institute 
the nea declined comment on the latest lawsuit 
the uproar over funding erupted in congress last year after 
conservative groups protested federal support of art shows 
containing photographs they considered obscene 
in the 1990 funding bill for the nea and the national endowment 
of the humanities congress banned support for work judged obscene 
that did not meet high artistic or scholarly standards 
the nea responded to the bills provision by requiring grant 
recipients to sign a statement promising not to create obscene 
works 
of more than 2000 grant offers sent out requiring the 
statement about 700 have been returned the nea said thursday

a federal appeals court ordered a district 
judge on friday to reconsider his denial of a request by nynex 
corp that it be allowed to distribute telecommunications equipment 
to other companies 
the ruling by a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals 
for the district of columbia marks another turning point in the 
battle by the seven regional bell telephone companies to escape 
restrictions placed on them in the 1984 breakup of the old bell 
system 
the appeals court said us district judge harold greene who 
continues to oversee the consent decree that effected the bell 
breakup failed to properly address the competitive issues raised 
by new yorkbased nynexs possible entry into the 
telecommunications distribution business 
the 1982 consent decree under which nynex and the other regional 
bell companies were created prohibited them from engaging in the 
longdistance equipment manufacturing and distribution businesses 
among other restrictions 
nynex in 1985 asked greene for a waiver to allow its wholly 
owned purchasing unit nynex materiel enterprises co to 
distribute telecommunications products to customers unaffiliated 
with nynex greene denied the request 
nynex appealed to the higher court american telephone amp 
telegraph co along with a host of other telecommunications 
equipment manufacturers filed briefs with the appeals court 
arguing against nynex 
the appeals court friday left little doubt that it looked 
favorably on nynexs waiver request 
under our reading of the decree which differed in some 
important particulars from that of the district court it may well 
be that nynex is entitled to the relief it seeks in this case 
circuit judge laurence h silberman wrote 
the basis of the consent decree restrictions is the fear that 
the bell companies may use their positions as monopoly local phone 
service providers to impede competition or that they may make their 
captive local phone customers foot the bill for new ventures 
the appeals court said it saw significant merit in nynexs 
argument that since thousands of companies are competing in the 
telecommunications distribution market that its entry therefore 
would be competitively benign 
nynex this year has been hit with a federal indictment for 
allegedly violating the consent decrees restrictions on providing 
computerized information services the federal communications 
commission also fined nynex a record 14 million for allegedly 
overcharging customers through its materiel enterprises division 
nynex has denied any wrongdoing 
the wall street journal reported this week that nynex also is 
being investigated for allegations that suppliers for nynexs new 
york telephone helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at 
annual conventions involving materiel enterprises employees 
greene previously has lifted some of the restrictions on the 
bells provision of information services and nontelecommunications 
products and services but he has refused to ease other 
lineofbusiness restrictions 
the bell companies currently are waging an intense campaign in 
congress to get some of the remaining restrictions eliminated 
the senate could vote on lifting the manufacturing restrictions 
this year

wayne lacy manager of brookwood mobile home community has

second

from drivers too many complaints from the tenants there just 
wont be any more pizza deliveries 
mark pitner a counselor with consumer affairs association said 
some brookwood residents have complained about the ban but the ban 
appears to be legal because leases at the park carry a 30day limit 
because its a monthtomonth lease and all hes doing is 
terminating the lease and not evicting residents he can do that 
pitner said thats something wed like to see changed in the 
kansas landlordtenant act but its legal

chances of settling the 12year war in 
afghanistan have slipped because the soviet union has not come 
through on its promise of new proposals on the future of president 
najibullah the bush administration said friday 
the issue is the main sticking point in peace negotiations 
otherwise the united states and the soviets are in basic agreement 
to hold elections and take other steps to end fighting between 
najibullahs forces and moslem guerrillas 
the soviets who had troops in afghanistan from december 1979 
until february 1989 are reluctant to undercut najibullah the bush 
administration supports the guerrillas in trying to get him to 
yield power promptly while elections are held to form a new 
government 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze agreed last month in a meeting in 
berlin to try to work out a compromise solution 
the soviets were supposed to send experts on afghanistan to 
washington for talks before bakers meeting next week in paris with 
shevardnadze 
but the kremlin did not send the experts here and baker leaves 
on monday for the french capital 
us officials said the soviets their senior policymakers 
preoccupied with the 28th communist party congress apparently had 
not decided what to do about najibulah 
theyll be turning their attention back to those kinds of 
issues now said a senior us official who demanded anonymity 
he said baker would try to get an answer from shevardnadze at 
their meeting next week 
the main purpose of bakers trip to paris is to hold talks on 
german unification with shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of 
britain france west germany east germany and poland 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev failed 
to resolve major differences over afghanistan at their summit 
meeting in washington in early june 
but the two sides made headway since then baker told the house 
foreign affairs committee on june 14 that the one thing that 
continues to separate them is whether najibullah would preside over 
the government in kabul during a transition period that would 
include elections 
the bush administration argues that elections held while 
najibullah is still in charge would not be accepted by the afghan 
people 
during the final years of the soviet occupation of afghanistan 
us officials expressed confidence that najibullah and the afghan 
army would collapse once the red army departed 
that forecast turned out to be way off the mark the soviets 
left massive arsenals behind and are providing 4 billion in 
military aid and 1 billion in economic aid 
marshal sergei akhromeyev senior military adviser to gorbachev 
said during the summit that the united states now fully understood 
that najibullah would not be defeated militarily 
last february baker persuaded the soviets to agree that 
elections should be part of an overall settlement to the war in 
afghanistan

a state official meanwhile said the bill would even outlaw iud 
birth control devices 
ive gone from three options to two i will either veto the 
bill or allow it to become law without my signature roemer said 
in a statement 
he has until july 29 to decide whether to veto it 
roemer said that although the bill provides exceptions for 
pregnancies resulting from rape and incest he was not happy with 
provisions of the legislation and the way the legislature passed it 
during the closing days of its session 
roemer who originally requested a 30day period in which a 
woman would be allowed to report a rape and have an abortion later 
said he was not happy with the bills sevenday provision 
he also said he believed the bill did not do enough to protect a 
womans mental health 
its an issue that gives me great concern he said its 
part of the discussion of how complex this is at the very minimum 
the mothers physical health has to be taken care of mental health 
of the mother is a legitimate point of discussion and has always 
been a concern to me 
the bill calls for up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 
100000 for doctors who perform abortions 
roemer vetoed a measure that allowed exceptions only to protect 
the life of a mother the legislature hastily assembled and passed 
the measure that roemer now says he wont sign 
the governor prochoice advocates and some lawmakers have 
expressed doubts whether the bill would pass court muster the 
measure sent to roemer originally was a bill calling for a maximum 
25 fine for people who assault flag burners the senate stripped 
of those provisions and amended it into an antiabortion bill 
louisiana attorney general william guste said thursday he sees 
nothing wrong with the antiabortion measure 
if in fact there were any procedural irregularities which we 
do not concede then these were certainly cured by the adoption of 
the bill by more than a twothirds majority in each house he 
said 
an assistant state attorney general jennifer schaye said the 
bill would prohibit the use of intrauterine devices or iuds the 
metal or plastic devices are implanted by a physician in the uterus 
to prevent a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the uterine 
wall 
guste agreed saying technically this would be a violation 
because the premise is that life begins at conception and the law 
says any instrument or device used on a female constitutes the 
simple battery of abortion

the house voted friday to freeze spending on 
office expenses of former presidents amid complaints they are 
millionaires who already receive generous pensions 
with this government tottering on the financial brink of 
disaster taxpayers in this country might wonder about the sanity 
of forcing them to give a half a million dollars each to four 
wealthy men who are already collecting 107000 each in pensions 
said rep andy jacobs dind 
the action came on amendments to a 207 billion appropriations 
bill for fiscal 1991 spending by the treasury department postal 
service the office of the president and independent agencies 
the bill provides new authority for the us secret service to 
join the fbi in investigating savingsandloan fraud 
it authorizes 300 new secret service agents a 50 percent 
increase for the agency to join the 600 fbi agents at work in the 
sampl scandals 
the secret service while known for protecting the president 
has long been responsible for investigating counterfeiting and 
securities credit card and computer fraud 
the bill approved on a 30072 vote goes to the senate 
jacobs a frequent critic of taxpayer spending on former 
presidents tried to amend the bill by slashing all office expenses 
for former presidents totaling nearly 16 million 
but the house voted 30091 to amend jacobs amendment so that it 
freezes the office expenditure at 1990 levels that represents a 
cut of 8 percent 156000 in the total spending on former 
presidents including their 107300 a year pensions 
richard nixon gerald ford jimmy carter and ronald reagan 
receive pensions and benefits 
rep edward r roybal dcalif floor manager for the 
appropriations bill opposed jacobs attempt to slash the 
presidential spending but supported the freeze 
it sends a message were looking at this thing very 
carefully he said they should be prudent in the expenditure 
of funds 
the bill contains other provisions that send that message too 
it orders the treasury department to report to congress on how 
to reduce federal spending on travel by former presidents and their 
spouses when they are being paid to give speeches including 
whether the government should seek reimbursement it authorizes the 
secret service to accept private contributions to offset the cost 
of protecting former presidents when they make paid appearances or 
speeches something it cant accept now 
the action came among expressions of dismay over payments to 
former presidents while they use their status to rake in large 
amounts of money 
rep byron dorgan dnd said some former presidents look 
more like retired royalty than retired presidents 
weve got plenty of needs for money that we dont have to pile 
extra benefits on top of benefits her for people that dont need 
them he said 
the bills overall spending amounts to an increase of 23 
billion over 1990 levels and 78 million over what president bush 
sought in his budget proposal

twelve northkorean flagged japaneseowned fishing 
vessels and their crewmen left a soviet port friday where they had 
been held for two months for poaching soviet salmon the foreign 
ministry said friday 
the soviets released the boats after demanding north korea take 
measures to prevent future fishing violations the japanese foreign 
ministry said 
the boats were heading toward the north korean port of hungnam 
where they would be examined by soviet inspectors to determine how 
much compensation the north koreans would have to pay for the 
illegal fishing 
tass said north korea guaranteed payment of 3 million in bail 
pending discussion of the incident 
in moscow the official soviet news agency tass said the ships 
captains estimated their ships were carrying 500 tons of fish 
worth about 8 million 
the ships have north korean officers but about threequarters 
of their crews are japanese the kyodo news service reported in 
late may that 10 north korean ships were seized may 1922 with 202 
crew members 140 of whom were japanese 
the japanese fishermen had been held since midmay by the 
soviets on shikotan a small island in the kurile chain just off 
the northern japanese island of hokkaido 
it is unclear when the vessels will be allowed to sail for japan 
japans consul general in the soviet port of nakhodka strongly 
protested that the vessels were headed for north korea and not 
japan 
the foreign ministry had said earlier crewmen were afraid of 
going to north korea and wanted to return directly to japan 
japanese coast guard vessels were dispatched to the area to try to 
monitor the voyage 
acting foreign ministry spokesman shigeo takenaka said north 
korea promised to return the 169 japanese fishermen without 
delay after they arrived in hungnam 
the seizure of the boats led to an unusual tugofwar between 
the soviet union north korea and japan over fishing in salmonrich 
waters off the soviet coast 
it also accentuated tensions between moscow and communist north 
korea those ties have been strained by a recent thaw in soviet 
relations with prowestern south korea 
japan has a fishing agreement with the soviet union and there is 
a quota of salmon japanese vessels can take from soviet waters 
north korea has no fishing quota agreement with the soviet union 
but its fishing vessels were sometimes permitted to fish for salmon 
in soviet waters experts said the informal arrangement enticed 
japanese operators to put their vessels under the north korean flag 
and take more salmon than permitted under the japansoviet 
agreement 
japan and north korea have no diplomatic relations and japanese 
authorities are examining the ties between japanese and north 
korean fishing operations 
officials at one of the companies that leased boats to the north 
koreans said they were optimistic the vessels would soon return to 
japan 
but a relative of kazuo yoshida chief engineer aboard one of 
the boats said i cannot help but remember the case of the 
fujisan maru 
in 1983 two japanese fishermen were arrested tried for 
espionage and sentenced to 15 years in prison in north korea after 
japan permitted the defection of a north korean who had stowed away 
on their boat the fujisan maru

the food and drug administration is 
considering barring all new us immigrants from giving blood for a 
time after their arrival to further protect the nations blood 
supply from aids an official said friday 
the ban is one of several proposals the fda is considering to 
replace a policy that prohibits blood donations indefinitely by 
immigrants from haiti or subsaharan africa which have high 
aidsinfection rates 
haitian and black african immigrants have criticized the current 
policy as discriminatory because it singles them out an fda 
advisory committee recently recommended the agency change the 
policy 
our intent was never discrimination said paul parkman 
director of the fdas center for biologics evaluation and research 
the advisory committee said we shouldnt use national origin 
as a criteria so one of the ways we can do that is not to single 
out people from a geographic region but impose a blanket 
deferral parkman said 
the proposal would be less restrictive than the current policy 
since haitians and subsaharan africans would be able to donate 
blood after the deferral period 
the length of a possible deferral period has not been 
determined but he said we have kicked around a couple of 
years 
it needs to be long enough to cover that period of time during 
which a person infected with the aids virus still tests negative 
that window is believed to be about six months

skirts claimed innocence and said the real dartman came from an 
island where provocatively dressed women are tossed into volcanoes 
a prosecutor said friday 
jerome wright 33 was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation 
by criminal court judge harold b beeler after police at a hearing 
disclosed the rambling incoherent statement he made after being 
arrested for the attacks 
the evaluation will take place at bellevue hospital wright who 
did not enter a plea at the hearing is due back in court aug 8 
at least 55 women reported being attacked in midtown manhattan 
by a man who blew darts at their backsides not all the darts hit 
their mark and none of the women were seriously hurt 
wright was arraigned on two counts of criminal possession of a 
weapon two counts of reckless endangerment and two counts of 
harassment he could face up to seven years in prison if convicted 
on all charges

president bush kept mum friday on where he 
stands in the congressional negotiations over 25 billion in tax 
hikes to help shrink the massive budget deficit 
i see a lot of speculation and a lot of people saying what we 
will or wont do or what they will or wont do republicans and 
democrats and look i understand that bush said 
however the president said he has promised not to discuss 
details of the budget negotiations while they are underway and 
that he would not violate that pledge 
and at some point bush said i may have to go out and 
say look this is all we can do or heres where we go but 
im not going to do that now 
budget negotiators from the white house and congress expect to 
begin trading offers by early next week on about 25 billion in tax 
increases for next year 
republicans could send democrats the first package of proposed 
tax hikes by monday sources said 
one gop negotiator said the plan probably will contain boosts in 
excise taxes perhaps on alcohol and tobacco products as well as a 
cut in the capital gains tax rate 
it is unlikely to contain a boost in income tax rates which 
many republicans have adamantly opposed the official said 
negotiators are searching for at least 50 billion in spending 
cuts and tax boosts for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 to shrink 
a budget shortfall that will otherwise hit at least 160 billion 
bush spoke with reporters as he headed for his helicopter on the 
white house south lawn to go to camp david for the weekend 
he stopped to read a statement urging the house in a vote on 
tuesday to approve a constitutional amendment eventually requiring 
a balanced budget 
bush said house passage of the measure would send a good 
signal to the budget negotiators 
he said the balanced budget amendment would halt the steady 
buildup of the national debt i think it will bring muchneeded 
discipline to the process discipline on the executive branch 
discipline on the legislative branch on the congress of the united

this seaside colony whose charms have 
attracted many artists has found itself fighting a court battle 
with the smithsonian institution over a bequest in a millionaire 
sculptors will 
franz denghausen the sculptor and poet who lived in rockport 
for 36 years left 1 million town upon his death to replace the 
towns small turnofthecentury carnegie library 
but the smithsonian which also benefitted from denghausens 
will contends the money can only be used to operate the new 
library after the town uses its own money to build it 
the existing onestory library building is overcrowded with 
books and lacks space for additional collections granted in memory 
of denghausens wife luisita so the town wants to use 
denghausens bequest to convert a former elementary school into a 
new library 
the town library trustees contend the smithsonian is attempting 
to block the building of the library so it can obtain the towns 1 
million the smithsonian already is expected to receive 4 million 
to 5 million from the denghausen estate it also received 38 
million from luisita denghausens estate after she died on jan 19 
1986 
the issue is now before an essex county probate court 
denghausen who was childless died oct 17 1987 
the smithsonian and town library trustees disagree over the 
interpretation of a passage from denghausens will that said the 
money is intended for the purpose of providing an adequate 
replacement for the now obsolete carnegie library 
the will said the money would be granted provided that the 
town contribute the land upon which such a library is to be erected 
or provide the funds for the renovation of some building now owned 
by the town 
residents at the december 1988 town meeting voted to give a 
former elementary school land and building to the trustees for 
conversion to a library residents also voted to spend 15000 on 
plans for the new library 
town officials said that without the 1 million from denghausen 
the town cannot afford a new library 
at this point the smithsonian is vigorously trying to prevent 
the town of rockport from being able to accept this gift said 
ted reed chairman of the rockport library trustees 
but elaine johnston the institutions assistant general 
counsel defended the smithsonians action 
the actions proposed by the town seem inconsistent with the 
terms imposed by mr denghausen and the smithsonian feels a 
responsibility to ensure that his wishes are carried out she 
said 
the state attorney generals public charities division supports 
the town 
the overall purpose of the gift is to provide a replacement 
for the now obsolete library not for subsequent operating 
expenses the office of attorney general james shannon wrote 
frankly we do not understand why the smithsonian has chosen 
to take such an adversarial position it does not seem right that 
such a large federally supported national institution is trying 
to prevent a small town from upgrading its public library said 
reed 
the smithsonians annual budget is 225 million from the federal 
government and 91 million from trust funds the rockport librarys 
annual budget is 147000

preservationists are unhappy over plans by 
richmond newspapers inc to dismantle and move a 19thcentury 
farmhouse that is standing in the way of the companys 195 million 
production plant 
if that decision is carried out it will prove to be a very 
unpopular one said robert b giles an official with one of 12 
richmondarea historical groups battling the company over the 
houses fate 
rni announced thursday that lockwood the suburban hanover 
county farmhouse that was confederate gen robert e lees field 
headquarters for four days in 1864 will be dismantled and moved to 
a new site 12 miles north 
the house built in the early 1800s stands within 50 feet of 
where rni is building its new production plant 
rni and its parent company media general inc said the house 
will be given to a richmond couple who have signed an agreement to 
reconstruct it 
the estimated cost of the project is more than 50000 rni will 
provide a grant up to 50000 once the reconstruction begins said 
j stewart bryan iii publisher of the richmond timesdispatch and 
the richmond news leader 
this will ensure the continuity of a family owning and living 
in this house said bryan who also is chairman president and 
chief executive officer of media general we think its location 
is the right location 
thats not satisfactory to giles vice president of the william 
byrd branch of the association for the preservation of virginia 
antiquities 
as long as the house is still standing we will carry on what 
we envision to be our role to enlighten the public as to the 
importance of the house giles said it is a concern to a great 
many people 
lee stayed at the house recuperating from dysentery while 
planning the battle of cold harbor 
bryan said the heritage of the house if in fact it has a 
heritage is not so much as a place where general lee was sick for 
four days but its heritage is that of a country farm house we are 
much gratified that its future will also be just that a house 
that will be lived in

five prominent conservatives on friday accused 
president bush of abandoning his conservative electoral base and 
urged him to return to the fold lest he weaken the republican party 
and its candidates 
if he doesnt bush will face an almost certain challenge 
from a conservative candidate in the 1992 primaries one of them 
warned 
another richard a viguerie said bush took a sharp turn to 
the left shortly after his election it is the conservatives in 
the republican party that have produced the money the workers and 
the votes all these years said viguerie president of the united 
conservatives of america 
whenever theres a close presidential race and the republican 
nominee abandons his conservative voters they lose viguerie 
said he cited as examples the races of 1948 when new york gov 
thomas a dewey lost to president truman 1960 when richard nixon 
lost to john kennedy and 1976 when president ford lost to jimmy 
carter 
viguerie and four other leaders of the conservative movement 
joined together at a news conference to cite issue after issue as 
grounds for their concern topics ranged from trade concessions for 
china to support for governmentfinanced art that may be considered 
obscene but it was clear their biggest complaint was with the 
presidents abandonment of his no new taxes pledge 
politicians may change their minds but when a politician does 
that on a core defining issue he used to get elected he sells out 
not just his followers but he weakens the system said david a 
keene chairman of the american conservative union 
bush has dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility 
keene said 
the conservatives news conference was timed to coincide with a 
meeting of the republican national committee in chicago rnc 
spokeswoman leslie goodman in chicago said she was unfamiliar with 
the conservatives comments and declined to respond 
the five conservatives released a letter to party chairman lee 
atwater protesting that the administration had showed that it 
does not intend to honor the commitments made to the american 
people in the 1988 presidential campaign 
the conservative leaders showed some differences among 
themselves viguerie said he thought bush had sailed under a 
false flag of conservatism in 1988 and now was reverting to 
the bigbusiness countryclub kind of republican he was in the 
60s and the 70s 
keene however said bush did not sail under any false flags 
but rather had been seduced by high poll ratings the president 
appears not to know that success in the polls has a history of 
breeding failure he said 
howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus said it 
is too early to tell what any of us is going to do but phillips 
said that if bush stays in his present course he will be 
challenged in 1992 almost certainly in the republican primaries 
and certainly in the general election 
also participating in the news conference were l brent bozell 
iii executive director of the conservative victory committee and 
john cregan president of the us business and industrial council

a team of federal investigators is being sent to 
chicago to examine alleged irregularities in local census 
datagathering efforts a commerce department official said friday 
elizabeth barlowe deputy counsel to the commerce departments 
inspector general declined to say what spurred the investigation 
by her agency which oversees the census bureau 
the chicago tribune reported thursday that about 200 valid 
census questionnaires may have been destroyed in a north side 
chicago census office 
workers in that office may have falsified information because of 
confusion over a nationwide census bureau policy of marking a house 
vacant when workers cant reach anyone inside the newspaper 
said 
we do have an investigation into some allegations of 
irregularities ms barlowe said in a telephone interview from 
washington thats really all i can say 
ms barlowe said federal investigators would arrive monday she 
said investigators also were looking into census operations in 
atlanta she did not elaborate on the problems there 
the tribune reported that a manager in the north side chicago 
office once asked a colleague for a shredder so he could destroy a 
stack of census forms the manager admitted asking for the shredder 
but denies destroying the documents the newspaper said 
in addition the tribune said other workers in that office said 
the manager ordered data gatherers not to report a residence as 
vacant if people were believed to be living there but could not be 
reached 
the newspaper said the manager instead ordered workers to record 
those residences as having one resident because he believed the 
city would lose money if occupied homes were recorded as vacant

an extremist islamic group claimed 
responsibility friday for the july 5 explosion at a texas chemical 
plant that killed 17 people but us officials and a company 
spokesman dismissed the claim 
a spokesman for the islamic liberation front told the associated 
press that the arco chemical co plant in channelview texas was 
attacked because the united states supports israel despite its 
killings and terrorism against our palestinian families in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he refused to give any details of the alleged operation for 
security reasons 
arco chemical co of north america said from its headquarters in 
newtown square pa they were surprised by the claim because 
federal investigators say theyve found no signs of sabotage in the 
explosion 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said there was no reason to believe the explosion at the chemical 
plant was the result of terrorists 
the occupational safety and health administration which is 
investigating the blast said in a statement released in washington 
that there is absolutely no information to substantiate this 
reputed claim 
the arco plant 15 miles east of houston was wrecked by the 
explosions and fire which leveled an area the size of a city block 
arco spokeswoman sallie anderson said friday from the companys 
headquarters that the cause of the explosion had not been 
determined she also said she was unaware of any recent threats 
against the company and that the company had no dealings with 
israel 
an islamic liberation front spokesman who identified himself as 
bassam walid said one of our unit commanders operating in the 
united states of america informed our headquarters in the occupied 
territories last friday that our comrades had set ablaze a texas 
chemical factory and that the mission was successfully 
accomplished 
walid appeared in person at the ap office to make his statement 
in a telephone call several hours after he appeared in the ap 
office walid said many more attacks will be launched against 
us targets inside america and around the world 
he said attacks would also be made against the us military 
but no attacks would be carried out against civilians 
the front is a relatively large group based in the west bank and 
gaza strip it has followers in jordan and several other arab 
countries 
it advocates the elimination of the jewish state

like steeplechase park and ebbets field new 
yorkers will soon be wistfully recalling the 25cent staten island 
ferry ride 
the roundtrip ride past the statue of liberty referred to by 
many as the best bargain in town is being doubled to 50 cents aug 
1 to ease the citys budget crunch 
despite protests from commuters in the citys least populated 
borough mayor david dinkins made it a done deal thursday when he 
signed the fare increase into law 
it is only the second official price hike in the history of the 
ferry which was taken over by the city from the bampo railroad in 
1905 
the ferry cost a nickel each way when edna st vincent millay 
wrote we were very tired we were very merry we had gone back 
and forth all night on the ferry 
but the famous nickel ride was fudged in 1972 when it became a 
10cent round trip collected in manhattan it was altogether 
obliterated when the fare went to a quarter in 1975 at the height 
of the citys fiscal troubles 
new fiscal woes have caused dinkins to raise the fare again the 
mayor facing a 18 billion deficit says the increase will add 2 
million to city coffers 
the staten island ferry which glides past but does not stop at 
the statue of liberty carries 30000 commuters daily and is one of 
the cheapest tourist attractions in new york 
the sevenmile trip across new york harbor is called a tourist 
mecca of great delight by the architects guide to new york and 
americas biggest bargain by geoffrey moorhouse in his book 
imperial new york 
those who deal in the sightseer trade doubt that doubling the 
fare will have any appreciable effect on tourists 
at a quarter or 50 cents in our judgment its still the 
greatest travel bargain anywhere in the world said marshall 
murdaugh president of the new york visitors and convention bureau 
i dont think a half a buck is going to upset anyone said 
manny strumpf a spokesman for the national park service which 
operates the statue of liberty 
by comparison the circle line ferry service which drops 
passengers off at the statue costs 4 
but dont mention the increase to staten islanders already put 
upon by new laws limiting their voice in city government 
to them the hike is another nail in the coffin as one 
councilmans aide put it and all the more reason for the island 
and its population of about 400000 to secede from the city 
the oftheard secession battle cry was rejuvenated last year 
after the us supreme court abolished the city board of estimate 
and the core of staten islands political powerbase 
this kind of action creates the atmosphere for secession 
michael christiano an aide to staten island borough president guy 
v molinari said before the mayor made the ferry hike history 
the entire population of staten island is utterly incensed 
said walter kramer chief aide to city councilman jerome odonovan 
he said many feel they are being treated unfairly because staten 
island is the only borough where commuters must pay a fee to get to 
the rest of the city and often as many as three commuting fees to 
get to work

vice president dan quayle on friday tried to calm 
gop fears about the political impact of president bushs reversal 
on taxes and demanded that democrats make the next move by 
proposing sensitive spending cuts 
quayle told the republican national committee that bush put 
taxes on the negotiating table to spur deficit reduction talks but 
would not accept any deal that would hurt the economy or the 
republican party 
he will not accept a bad deal quayle said in a speech to 
gop leaders from across the country his position is simple a 
good deal or no deal at all 
many of the republicans gathered in chicago for the partys 
twoday meeting believe that bushs decision to abandon his 
campaign pledge of no new taxes will hurt gop candidates this 
fall 
but with election day four months away and the gop already 
fending off democratic attacks over the savings and loan crisis 
quayle and other republican leaders were out to put the party on 
the offensive on the tax issue 
the president is willing to go the extra mile in seeking to 
forge a budget agreement that would be good for america quayle 
said but he said the politically charged budget talks are not a 
oneway street and tried to shift the focus from taxes to 
spending 
today i call on the congressional democrats to come forth with 
their proposed spending cuts quayle said their silence on 
this issue as usual is deafening 
quayles speech led a gop effort to paint bushs tax switch as a 
sign of bold leadership democrats have tried to paint a different 
picture saying bush is abandoning his notax pledge only because 
of the soaring costs of an sampl debacle they blame on the reagan and 
bush administrations 
fridays focus on taxes and the budget talks came one day after 
gop leaders counterpunched the democratic attacks on the savings 
and loan crisis ed rollins chairman of the republican 
congressional campaign committee tried to place blame for the sampl 
bailout on the democrats charging they had sold out the 
taxpayers 
house speaker thomas foley dwash on friday called the 
remarks mr rollins emotional ravings and added it sounded 
like he was in a panic it was sort of a running doggerel of 
political invective 
the presidents decision on taxes has brought him heat even 
within his own party but senior republicans tried friday to rally 
support for bush 
it is the obligation of republicans i believe to stand up 
for the president when the president is willing to take the 
political heat to stand up for the nation said republican 
illinois gov james thompson 
party cochairwoman jeanie austin sounded a similar theme 
saying of bush it is a measure of his leadership and his courage 
that hes making the tough decisions today 
back in washington five leading conservatives held a news 
conference to accuse bush of abandoning his conservative electoral 
base and to urge him to return to the fold bushs shift on taxes 
was one of their chief complaints 
the five released a letter to party chairman lee atwater 
protesting that the bush administration has indicated it does not 
intend to honor the commitments made to the american people in the 
1988 presidential campaign 
atwater was hospitalized in washington as part of his treatment 
for a brain tumor but gop leaders in chicago were following his 
recent admonition to adopt a more aggressive stance particularly 
in the partisan fights over taxes and sampls 
peggy noonan a former speechwriter to both presidents reagan 
and bush told the group bush showed statesmanlike leadership in 
putting taxes on the table for the budget talks 
but she said bush should walk away from the talks if democrats 
will not agree to substantial spending cuts and reforms in the 
budgetwriting process otherwise she said bush will get the 
blame for raising taxes and democrats the credit for spending the 
extra money on social programs 
we must not lose the tax issue she said there is no more 
potent issue than this 
the republicans continued their sampl offensive on friday by 
endorsing a resolution applauding bushs handling of the crisis and 
blaming the 300 billionplus mess on the democrats 
while democrats have been pointing fingers of blame president 
bush has been rolling up his sleeves to make good on his promise to 
settle the problem the resolution said

about 100000 albanians rallied friday in 
support of their communist leaders according to albanias state 
ata news agency officials were reported to have condemned those 
fleeing abroad and to have urged demonstrators to be united like 
a fist around the party 
the rally was staged in skanderbeg square in tirana near the 
row of foreign embassies used as safe haven by about 6000 
albanians seeking to emigrate according to the ata report 
monitored in vienna 
about 4500 of the albanians in the embassies left albania by 
ship early friday and arrived in italy hours later most of those 
remaining are slated to make their own way to freedom within days 
the rally appeared to be an attempt by albanian leadership to 
demonstrate the majority of citizens in that country of 31 million 
residents supported the hardline communist government that has 
recently introduced modest reforms but continues to reject 
political pluralism 
stung by the threat posed to communist rule by the 
asylumseekers the leadership has depicted them as social 
undesirables and comments to the rally by xhelil gjoni a member 
of the partys policymaking politburo were in the same vein 
gjoni was quoted by ata as telling the crowd of at least 100000 
that those who are leaving do not represent albania they do not 
represent the people 
in difficult moments be united like a fist round the 
communist party he was quoted as saying he suggested without 
elaboration that yugoslavia where harsh serbian control of ethnic 
albanians is increasing is to blame for the unrest of the past 
weeks 
gjoni reiterated modest economic reforms decided on last week 
such as sanctioning private enterprise limited to individuals or 
families a form of unemployment insurance wage increases and the 
introduction of a form of unemployment insurance 
the changes represent one of the clearest manifestations of 
the continuous care of the party and state for the life of our 
working people and their families he was quoted as saying 
the rush on the embassies was partially predicated by 
dissatisfaction with shortages and low living standards and hopes 
of a better existence in the west 
the reforms were clearly meant to relieve discontent along with 
the replacement of several ministers with economic portfolios 
albania for decades the hermit of europe because of its 
isolationist course embarked on cautious liberalization several 
months ago it has among other things signalled its willingness 
to resume relations with the superpowers 
the leadership also decreed that the people long denied any 
travel had the right to passports abolished the death penalty for 
those caught fleeing the country and decriminalized religion 
gjoni acknowledged the existence of hardships but said only 
albanians could improve their lives 
we still do not have the economy and the standard of living we 
would like to he said we know these realities and make all 
efforts to solve them ourselves they cannot be solved by 
foreigners but by us

called for keeping all nuclear weapons out of europe in a meeting 
friday with secretary of state james a baker iii 
that would include the new surfacetoair missile known as tasm 
which the bush administration wants to deploy 
we feel we do not need them at all on european soil or on 
german soil meckel said of nuclear weapons

the east meckel told reporters after seeing baker 
the two will meet again next week in paris when baker meckel 
and the foreign ministers of the soviet union britain france 
west germany and poland discuss germanys future

between germany and the soviet union during world war ii both west 
and east germany have told the poles that a reunified germany would 
not expand 
meckel said both the merger of germany and the border treaty 
should be completed about the same time probably in january i 
could not envisage a problem on what poland requires the east 
german minister said 
the united states agreed with its 15 allies at a north atlantic 
treaty organization summit last week in london to remove 1470 us 
nucleartipped artillery shells once all soviet troops are 
withdrawn from eastern and central europe 
president bush in may at the behest of west germany decided 
not to deploy new shortrange lance missiles although 700 older 
us nucleartipped lances are in western europe 
also 1560 us battlefield nuclear weapons are based in west 
germany and six other nato countries and the bush administration 
plans to deploy the more potent tasm missiles now being developed 
meckel said that in his meeting with baker we discussed 
nuclear weapons in general but not the new missile specifically 
he said germans favor the zero option meaning the 
elimination of all shortrange nuclear weapons a ussoviet 
treaty in 1987 banned all mediumrange nuclear missiles 
it is our strong interest to have all nuclear weapons go

a white suburban family can continue its foster 
care for a black baby while the childs mother and social workers 
try to settle a dispute over her childrens placement a judge 
ruled friday 
social workers have tried to move the womans two children ages 
5 months and 14 months to black foster homes in the inner city to 
keep them in the same socioeconomic environment as their mother 
while the younger child is staying with the white suburban 
family the 14monthold is at a black foster mothers home 
the children were taken from their mother earlier this year 
after social workers determined the woman was unable to maintain a 
proper home for them said jeff aikin a spokesman for the 
milwaukee county department of health and social services 
the 30yearold woman who has not been named in court to 
protect her childrens identities has not contested that her 
children should be taken from her but she has petitioned the court 
to overrule the social workers and allow both children be placed 
with the white couple beverly and david cox 
milwaukee county childrens court judge ronald s goldberger was 
to rule on the mothers request friday but adjourned the hearing 
until aug 16 after lawyers met for 3 hours and indicated the case 
may be settled out of court 
until aug 16 the younger child will remain with the coxes 
while the older one will remain in the inner city foster home the 
judge ruled 
the coxes had originally joined the childrens mother in 
protesting the social workers decision arguing race should have 
no affect on foster placement decisions 
but goldberger ruled last month the couple had no legal standing 
in the case and only the childrens mother could appeal the 
placement

the house appropriations committee on friday 
approved 504 billion for agriculture spending in fiscal 1991 but 
angered house agriculture committee leaders by virtually 
eliminating crop insurance 
rep glenn english dokla whose agriculture subcommittee has 
been working on improvements to the crop insurance program said an 
amendment to restore funding would be offered during full house 
debate if the program is not reinstated sooner 
abolishing the program while major improvements are under 
consideration creates a situation whereby those improvements cannot 
be put into effect in an orderly manner agriculture committee 
chairman kika de la garza said in a letter to appropriations 
chairman jamie whitten 
the letter also was signed by english rep edward madigan 
rill and rep thomas coleman rmo 
madigan is ranking republican on the full agriculture committee 
and coleman the ranking gop member on englishs subcommittee 
meanwhile congressional leaders said the senate expects to 
start debate next week on the 1990 farm bill with budget 
constraints as the guiding force in determining the agriculture 
policy for the next five years 
aside from the factor of time the bottom line for acceptance 
and passage of this legislation must be the budget said senate 
republican leader bob dole in a news release 
the house version of the farm bill will be taken up next week by 
the house rules committee which will decide on the rules for 
debating the measure on the house floor 
the appropriations measure the house panel approved friday 
provides funding for all agriculture department agencies except the 
forest service it includes funds for the food and drug 
administration and the commodity futures trading commission and 
puts limits on funds for the farm credit administration and the 
farm credit system assistance board 
the overall appropriation for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
is 5 billion greater than fiscal 1990 
the boost is reflected in higher allocations for administrative 
salaries payments to landgrant colleges research grants food 
safety and inspection marketing services and rural development 
the popular food program for poor pregnant and nursing mothers 
and their infants known as wic was allocated 235 billion an 
increase of 195 million from this year and 109 million more than 
the bush administration requested 
whitten dmiss a longtime opponent of crop insurance favors 
a system through which the government appropriates money to pay 
farmers each time there is a substantial crop loss 
the measure passed by whittens committee allows for 262 
million to be spent next year on crop insurance administrative 
phaseout costs and to make payments on any policies sold before 
oct 1 
the bush administration which also wants the program abolished 
has said 601 million would be needed in 1991 to operate crop 
insurance at its current level spending for 1990 has been 400 
million 
a straightout disaster program would be as expensive 
english said 
only about 40 percent of eligible farmers buy crop insurance 
farmers say they avoid the program because the premiums are too 
high yields are inadequate or because the price forecasting for 
certain crops by the insurance companies is inaccurate 
farmers may buy insurance from either the government or private 
companies thirty percent of all costs are paid by the federal 
government

an aide to attorney general dick thornburgh 
confirmed friday that his security clearance was revoked for 
failing to provide full background information for 18 months 
associate deputy attorney general barry h stern who turned in 
his resignation this week said he ignored repeated requests for 
what he termed minor information 
stern also confirmed that until last week he hadnt signed an 
oath that he had given truthful answers on the background 
questionnaire he filed last year 
if i didnt sign it it was a pure oversight said stern 
adding that signed the oath after belatedly providing the 
information sought by security officials he also said he signed a 
statement last year authorizing the fbi to conduct a background 
investigation 
stern a 43yearold lawyer said his security clearance was 
revoked last month because he had failed to provide information 
that involved addresses of some references and some job history 
information 
stern who oversaw the justice departments program for seizing 
the assets of drug dealers organized crime figures and other 
convicted criminals said his duties did not require him to have 
access to classified information 
the revocation of sterns security clearance is the latest 
personnel problem for thornburgh who reassigned two of his closest 
aides after it was disclosed they showed deception on lie 
detector tests during an fbi investigation of an unauthorized news 
leak 
the may reassignments of chief of staff robert s ross jr and 
press spokesman david runkel were portrayed by officials as part of 
an effort to dispel the perception that thornburgh was surrounded 
by political cronies 
stern is one of a group of aides to the attorney general who 
served under thornburgh when he was governor of pennsylvania he 
will join a philadelphiaarea publishing company lrp press 
stern received a temporary security clearance when he joined the 
justice department in september 1988 while the fbi completed a 
background check 
such temporary clearances usually lasting 14 months allow top 
officials to function in sensitive positions pending final approval 
of permanent access to classified information officials said 
a justice department official familiar with the case said 
sterns delay in filing the information was unprecedented and 
angered department security officials aides in sterns position 
normally file the requested information within several weeks of 
taking office so the fbi can begin its work 
the justice departments security office asked stern in november 
to provide several answers to questions that he had not completed 
including the addresses of references 
stern said he put off returning the form with the completed 
answers over the christmas holidays and continued to procrastinate 
for six months despite intermittent requests

more than 100 tons of a chemical that is 
vital for the solid fuel in space shuttle boosters went up in 
flames at a kerrmcgee corp plant near a similar plant that blew 
up two years ago 
no injuries were reported in thursday nights fire which was 
extinguished in about 45 minutes 
damage was originally estimated at 200000 but was revised 
downward friday to 135000 said kerrmcgee spokesman myron 
cunningham 
the cause of the accident was under investigation cunningham 
said 
the fire destroyed 1065 tons of ammonium perchlorate an 
oxidizer which provides oxygen for the burning of solid rocket 
fuel kerrmcgee produces about 1500 tons of the material per 
month according to rick stater plant operations manager 
stater and fire officials credited new fire safety regulations 
with averting a disaster similar to one on may 4 1988 when 
ammonium perchlorate exploded and destroyed the pacific engineering 
co or pepcon plant a mile from the kerrmcgee plant 
kerrmcgee and pacific engineering were the only companies in 
the united states producing the critical oxidizer which is also 
used for some military rockets and the loss of the plant left us 
officials facing a possible shortage 
pacific engineering since has built a new plant in cedar city 
utah 
the earlier blast killed two people and injured more than 300 
the blast rocked the las vegas valley and caused more than 74 
million in property damage primarily in this community of 55000 
some 25 miles southeast of las vegas 
following that blast clark county fire officials imposed strict 
new fire safety codes at the kerrmcgee plant included was a 
provision that the ammonium perchlorate not be stored in one pile 
but be divided up for storage on individual pads separated by 
concrete walls 
stater and fire department spokesman bob leinbach said the 
safety walls prevented the spread of the fire and possible 
explosion 
leinbach said he did not know why the kerrmcgee fire did not 
produce an explosion similar to the pacific engineering blast 
that may be one of the mysteries of life leinbach said 
pepcon was not supposed to explode 
kerrmcgee is building a new plant in a remote area northwest of 
las vegas for production of ammonium perchlorate

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
received only limited support friday following her appeal for a 
national dialogue to avoid a repeat of the sandinistainspired 
labor unrest that crippled the country 
five splinter centrist parties and a nonsandinista labor 
federation declared they would take part in such a national 
dialogue after meeting with mrs chamorro 
but both the leftist sandinistas now the countrys largest 
opposition group and the 14party coalition that backed mrs 
chamorro when she mounted her presidential campaign did not 
immediately indicate whether they would support her call for 
negotiations 
in announcing the strike settlement thursday mrs chamorro 
called for wideranging negotiations aimed at reaching a social 
accord involving the new usbacked government the private sector 
and the sandinistas that ruled from 1979 until they left office on 
april 25 
the 10day sandinistaled strike was settled with an accord that 
grants hefty wage hikes to government workers pledges no mass 
firings of public sector workers and puts some key elements of the 
new administrations plan to return nicaragua to a freemarket 
economy on hold 
the accord also calls for suspension of a decree to return land 
confiscated in the 1979 sandinista revolution to the original 
owners 
mrs chamorro and her aides have said the settlement prevented 
more bloodshed and unrest and made it possible for nicaragua to 
get back down to business 
but the business community and some leaders of the governing 
coalition have complained the settlement resulted in concessions 
that were a victory for the sandinistas and a defeat for the 
administrations plan to restore a freemarket economy 
in a joint statement friday the leaders of the five small 
centrist parties declared their readiness to participate in the 
dialogue the five parties the popular social christian social 
christian revolutionary unity movement liberal for national 
unification and conservative democratic support mrs chamorro but 
are not members of the governing coalition 
the dialogue must serve to force the sandinistas to commit 
themselves not to use violence again to obtain political and labor 
conquests the party leaders said they told mrs chamorro 
equilibrium and social peace can only be achieved through 
unity and national identity the statement said 
the permanent labor congress a federation of unions linked to 
mrs chamorros coalition also announced it would support her call 
for dialogue 
dona violetas idea is a good one because the country needs 
to know the opinion of all nicaraguans in order to strive for 
peace nilo salazar a labor congress leader told reporters 
the sandinistas have not yet formally reacted to mrs chamorros 
proposal 
former president daniel ortega unseated by mrs chamorros 
united national opposition coalition in the feb 25 elections told 
reporters wednesday night that an understanding must be reached 
with the sandinistas and their revolution to contribute to the 
countrys stability 
the governing coalition whose fractious members range from 
communists to hardline conservatives appeared to be divided over 
its response to the settlement and mrs chamorros appeal for 
dialogue 
after the announcement of the settlement the 14 parties 
established a committee for national solidarity headed by vice 
president virgilio godoy but it was unclear what action the 
committee would take 
godoy a conservative who has frequently criticized mrs 
chamorro has termed the settlement a success for the sandinistas 
claiming it has nullified the governments efforts to assert 
control 
the nations leading business group the superior council of 
private enterprise criticized the government for giving in to what 
it called sandinista blackmail 
gilberto cuadra the business groups president said the 
settlement had left the governments economic recovery program 
bleeding and dampened hopes of attracting foreign investment 
he said the business group estimates the strike caused 35 
million to 50 million in lost business property damage and 
diminished crops 
the strike posed the most serious threat yet to mrs chamorros 
new government 
during the last six days of the strike street fighting broke 
out between strike supporters and opponents claiming at least four 
lives

congressional talks on a final clean air bill 
began friday as a white house aide said the president remains 
strongly opposed to giving financial aid to workers who lose jobs 
because of tougher pollution requirements 
the housesenate negotiations over the first strengthening of 
federal air pollution laws in 13 years are expected to take weeks 
as numerous differences in the complex house and senate bills are 
worked out 
rep john dingell dmich head of the house delegation to the 
talks made clear that he will not be rushed we have an enormous 
amount of work ahead of us he said 
dingell rejected pleas by senators at the hourlong session for 
a quick response to two initial senate proposals on two relatively 
obscure parts of the legislation 
sen max baucus dmont conference chairman said we have to 
work quickly if a compromise bill is to be completed before 
congress adjourns in early october 
no date was set for the next session of the house and senate 
conferees 
bills passed last spring by wide margins in both the house and 
senate call for tougher pollution controls on factories 
automobiles and electric power plants to reduce urban smog toxic 
industrial releases and acid rain by the end of the decade 
but scores of differences remain between the two bills 
a major issue is job protection for workers who lose jobs 
because of tougher pollution controls the house bill contains a 
threeyear 250 million assistance program for such workers but 
the senate version does not 
roger porter president bushs chief domestic policy adviser 
who will sit in on the talks said the administration remains 
fundamentally opposed to a jobloss assistance provision he 
said he would recommend the president veto the bill if it contains 
such aid 
supporters of the assistance contend bush would be hard pressed 
to scuttle the massive package solely because it provides money for 
the unemployed they argue that the 250 million cost of the 
program is relatively small over three years 
but administration officials have argued there is no way to 
control the costs of mandated assistance it sets a precedent 
that were uncomfortable with said porter 
although no substantive agreements were reached in the first 
negotiating session senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said he remained hopeful and certain a compromise 
clean air bill can be worked out before congress is scheduled to 
adjourn in october 
but some senators and environmentalists expressed concern this 
week that the tight congressional schedule may jeopardize strong 
legislation especially if it is held over for final action in a 
possible lameduck session after the november election 
sen john chafee rri said after the meeting that he was 
plenty worried because we dont have much time 
chafee and other senators offered two recommendations to resolve 
differences on permit requirements and on dealing with 
ozonedestroying chemicals but dingell said only that the house 
would refer the matters to staff members for analysis 
other areas likely to raise controversy are a house requirement 
for automakers to build alternative fuel cars as a pilot program in 
california a requirement strongly opposed by oil companies that 
ethanolblend fuels be used in some smogplagued cities whether to 
require small industrial polluters to comply with new smog 
controls and whether to retain a house provision that calls for 
pollution controls over national parks

university of florida researchers 
announced friday the first clinical trials of a drug they hope will 
prevent juvenile diabetes the most deadly strain of the disease 
the study is being led by diabetes specialists at the 
universitys health science center it involves giving daily doses 
of an immunosuppressant drug called imuran to people likely to be 
afflicted 
also known as type 1 or insulindependent diabetes juvenile 
diabetes affects 1 million people and kills 300000 americans each 
year said dr noel maclaren a uf pathologist 
the medical centers involved in the study will offer free 
screening to close relatives of people who have type 1 diabetes 
the national institutes of health granted 35 million to pay 
for the screening of about 10000 people while about 80 who have 
indications of diabetes would receive the new drug 
besides the university of florida participating centers include 
the joslin diabetes center at harvard medical school the barbara 
davis foundation and denver childrens hospital in denver and the 
university of washington in seattle 
the study is the result of research by maclaren and mark 
atkinson who discovered antibodies that precede the onset of 
juvenile diabetes 
in the june issue of the british medical journal lancet 
atkinson reported that an antibody he isolated can be detected up 
to seven years before symptoms of diabetes appear 
peggy polopolus of gainesville who has been taking the drug 
since 1984 has not developed diabetes despite having type 1 
antibodies 
were convinced the medication has prevented the disease 
said dr william riley who is directing the nationwide clinical 
trials 
the drug keeps the bodys immune system from destroying cells in 
the pancreas while it produces insulin a hormone essential to the 
bodys storage and use of sugars for energy riley said 
several patients who received imuran after being diagnosed with 
type 1 diabetes were able to stay off insulin for up to two years

the hydrogen leaks crippling space 
shuttles atlantis and columbia appear to be in different places 
ruling out the possibility that the problems are related nasa said 
friday 
the things that we know leak on one we know arent leaking on 
the other said william lenoir head of nasas space flight 
program 
a common problem with the shuttles fuel system would have been 
much more difficult to deal with said shuttle director robert 
crippen 
early indications following an elaborate test of atlantis fuel 
system friday are that hydrogen escaped from a flange on the 
external tank side of a 17inchdiameter valve lenoir said the 
valve is in a pipe that carries fuel from the tank to the main 
engines 
no leaks were found in that area on the plumbing from columbia 
that was sent for laboratory testing to shuttle builder rockwell 
international corp in downey calif lenoir said 
rockwell engineers believe columbias problem lies in a small 
teflon shaft seal on the orbiter side of the valve lenoir said 
but further tests are needed before concluding there are no 
leaks on the two shaft seals on the side of the external tank he 
said 
earlier this week nasa officials said the main suspect appeared 
to be a ushaped teflon seal in the 17inch pipe on the orbiter 
side later that proved to be fine 
lenoir said the problem with columbia has been corrected since 
new plumbing was installed in the faulty area the new components 
were taken from the shuttle endeavour under construction in 
california 
its too soon to say how nasa will deal with atlantis leak 
lenoir said 
the solution may be as simple as tightening the seal which 
could be done at the launch pad putting in a new seal would 
require a return to the hangar he said 
about all we can do at the pad is tighten up the bolts 
lenoir said 
nasa wants to launch at least one shuttle before discoverys 
scheduled flight with the sunexploring ulysses satellite in 
october crippen said the most likely candidate is atlantis on a 
classified defense department mission 
discovery has until oct 23 to lift off with ulysses because of 
the alignment of earth the sun and jupiter otherwise the flight 
must be delayed for 13 months 
lenoir said there is no reason to believe discovery has a leak 
its uncertain whether that shuttle will undergo a tanking test 
prior to launch he said the space agency wants to avoid making 
such tests routine he said 
columbias leak was discovered during fueling for a may 30 
launch attempt a test a week later duplicated the leak and the 
shuttle was returned to the hangar for repairs 
as a precaution nasa conducted a similar test on atlantis on 
june 29 as the shuttle awaited a midjuly liftoff a leak was 
detected and the agency grounded the threeshuttle fleet 
it was the first time all of the shuttles had been grounded 
since the 1986 challenger explosion the next shuttle did not fly 
until 1988

salcido accused of killing his wife two daughters and four 
others was delayed for a week friday 
san mateo superior court judge phrasel shelton granted the 
request of defense attorney marteen miller who said his wife has 
malaria and needs his care 
assistant district attorney peter bumerts who fought earlier 
delay attempts did not object at the emergency afternoon court 
session held in redwood city where salcidos trial is now 
scheduled to begin july 23 
jury selection had been scheduled to begin monday 
on thursday the 1st district court of appeal refused to grant a 
twomonth delay which miller had sought saying he needed time to 
convince mexican authorities to hand over extradition papers that 
could prevent the prosecution from seeking the death penalty 
however prosecutors say miller is stalling and that a 
usmexico treaty does not bar the death penalty 
salcido 29 is accused of killing his wife two daughters his 
motherinlaw her two daughters and a coworker 15 months ago 
a third daughter 2 years old at the time of the attack had her 
throat slit but survived and lives with a foster family 
after the attacks salcido fled to mexico where he was arrested 
and gave a full confession

would argue against the death penalty by showing that salcido was 
drunk and high on cocaine and suffered other mental impairments 
during the attacks 
san mateo superior court judge reginald littrell a visiting 
sierra county judge who will preside over the trial said jury 
selection should take about six weeks with the trial to last at 
least another month 
the trial was moved from sonoma county the area north of san 
francisco where the murders occurred to san mateo south of the 
city because of pretrial publicity

when a young sailor wrote a letter to his 
parents during the vietnam war he forgot to include the zip code 
that might have made it a little late but doesnt account for 
all 23 years the us postal service says 
bert budai wrote his parents a 2page letter filled with 
typical adventures of a young sailor during the war he returned 
home in 1969 and his parents later died 
but the post office delivered the letter tuesday to budais 
former home in ravenna just across the road from where he now 
lives 
i was quite shocked said budai now 44 married and 
stepfather of two children my sister lives in my fathers house 
now and it came to that address and she brought it over to me 
the letter is postmarked oct 17 1966 the same day budai 
penned it aboard the uss valley forge a helicopter carrier 
stationed off the philippines 
stamped with an 8cent air mail stamp the envelope included 
budais shipboard return address in care of the san francisco post 
office the mailing address lacked the ravenna zip code but joseph 
l johnson communications manager for the grand rapids division of 
the postal service doesnt think that made much difference 
it you dont include a zip code it might delay it a couple of 
days but certainly not 23 years johnson said of course we 
apologize for the late delivery

about 20000 demonstrators marched 
friday to demand the release of a jailed activist who had been 
savagely beaten by vigilante miners loyal to president ion iliescu 
shortly after the orderly demonstration iliescu went on state 
television to appeal for national trust and criticized those who 
seek to teach romania lessons of democracy 
the march was among the largest street gatherings in bucharest 
since the december revolution overthrew communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu ceausescu and his wife elena were executed dec 25 
iliescu implored romanians to do away with the atmosphere of 
suspicion and called on the police to crack down on corrupt 
bureaucrats and black marketeers who he blamed for the shortages 
now plaguing the country 
demonstrators marched on the government building in victory 
square and demanded the release of jailed student leader marian 
munteanu they shouted antiiliescu slogans and carried signs 
equating iliescus national salvation front with the defunct 
romanian communist party 
munteanu was a leader of the 53day opposition rally that 
blocked central bucharest until june 13 when police tried to put 
it down the resulting violence killed at least six people 
munteanu was badly beaten by progovernment miners whom iliescu 
urged to come to the capital to impose order the miners 
subsequently terrorized the capital and munteanu was arrested in 
connection with the antigovernment violence several days later 
while he was still hospitalized 
iliescu a former communist official won free elections in may 
but opponents demanded he step down because of his hardline past 
he was harshly criticized by the world community for the miners 
rampage a and the united states and other nations cut off millions 
of dollars in nonhumanitarian aid to romania 
in an indirect slap at the united states iliescu criticized 
those among our friends who now treat us with lack of faith 
who coquetted with ceausescus regime and now want to give us 
lessons on democracy for years washington maintained fairly 
close ties with ceausescu who it viewed as relatively independent 
of moscow 
asking romanians to settle into a more constructive climate 
iliescu said lets overcome our climate of suspicion lets 
overcome partisan interests and create a climate of cooperation and 
quiet work 
turning to the huge economic problems iliescu attacked the 
phenomenon of corruption in romanias stillpowerful bureaucracy 
on thursday prime minister petre roman also attacked the 
managerial incompetence brought on by decades of communism 
he called for more police action against black marketeers who 
deplete stores by bribing officials and vendors and then sell 
products at higher prices 
for some the idea of free initiative means accumulating 
personal wealth without work a parasitic way of life he 
declared honest free initiative means amplification of 
production and services not recycling of the insufficient supply 
iliescu avoided the issue of munteanu or the other 
antigovernment activists who have been charged with various 
offenses and imprisoned 
the demonstrators were blocked from approaching the government 
building in victory square by several hundred police after 
converging on the government building shouting down with 
communism the 20000 marchers accompanied by police circled 
back and retraced their route to the starting point at opera square 
the crowd shouted try the miners and try the one who 
called them in reference to iliescu 
halfway down their route the marchers stopped at the justice 
ministry and a delegation left a petition calling for the release 
of all jailed activists 
the arrests are an outrage said 37yearold photographer 
cristian duma 
the national liberal youth league on friday also appealed for 
munteanus release but assailed the attacks on government 
buildings by antigovernment demonstrators on june 13 it was 
during these attacks that most of the fatalities reportedly occured 
the ecological movement meanwhile accused the government of 
totalitarian inclinations the charge was made at a friday news 
conference called to protest this weeks refusal by the education 
ministrys to recognize new private universities among them is the 
ecologists university in the former communist party building

two more cubans have taken refuge at the 
spanish embassy in havana bringing to 17 the number of 
asylumseekers at foreign embassies in cubas capital according to 
official reports friday 
in a related development five other cubans seeking asylum 
briefly held a czechoslovak diplomat hostage in his havana 
apartment the official czchoslovak news agency ctk reported friday 
the report came as czechoslovakia urged cuba to provide free 
passage to the cubans who had sought shelter earlier this week at 
pragues embassy in havana and said it would not hand them over to 
cuban authorities 
the cubans apparently followed the example of thousands of 
albanians who recently flooded foreign embassies in their capital 
tirana to seek asylum and received permission to leave their 
communist homeland 
cuba and albania remain among the last hardline communist 
countries in the world and have resisted the democratic reforms 
sweeping eastern europe and the soviet union 
in madrid spain a spanish foreign ministry spokesman said two 
more cubans entered the spanish embassy in havana on friday 
afternoon joining another asylumseeker there 
the mexican government news agency notimex also reported that 
three cubans were seeking refuge in the spanish embassy in a 
report from havana monitored in mexico city notimex said two young 
men went to the consular section at the spanish embassy on friday 
and declared that nobody could make them leave 
we have given them protection while we study the situation 
said spanish foreign ministry spokesman juan lena he said the 
spanish government was seeking permission from cuban authorities to 
send the asylumseekers to a third country 
the spanish ambassador to cuba antonio serrano de haro cut 
short a vacation in madrid to return to havana on friday 
lena said he did not know the identities of the two new 
refugees the first cuban identified as 27yearold luis 
monteagudo rodriguez sought refuge in the spanish embassy on 
wednesday in an effort to escape the hardline communist government 
monteagudo was jailed from 1985 to 1988 after he tried to seek 
asylum at the us interests section which operates out of the 
swiss embassy in havana the spanish news agency efe said citing 
diplomatic sources in havana 
in prague ctk quoted the czechoslovak foreign ministry as 
saying five cubans forced their way into the downtown havana 
apartment of czechoslovak charge daffaires jan doemoek on thursday 
doemoek was held hostage for several hours the statement said 
the five demanded to join the cubans in pragues havana embassy 
the foreign ministry said 
doemoek eventually escaped using a trick and immediately 
informed cuban authorities of the incident emphasizing that prague 
would not provide refuge to these five violent instigators the 
statement added 
the ministrys statement did not specify what had happened to 
the five but it denied what it said were cuban reports that there 
were now 19 asylumseekers inside the czechoslovak embassy 
czechoslovakias deputy foreign minister lubos dobrovsky was 
quoted by ctk as saying it was in the interest of both 
countries for cuba to allow safe passage as soon as possible 
he later met senior soviet west german and italian diplomats to 
ask their help in resolving the situation ctk said it did not 
elaborate 
czechoslovak officials say at least nine of the cubans in the 
embassy have requested political asylum 
tension has grown between cuba and czechoslovakia two former 
allies since czechoslovakias democratic revolution last year 
cubas foreign ministry in a tough statement reported by efe 
from havana accused czechoslovakia late thursday of provoking the 
asylumseeking by cubans it described as habitual bums 
dobrovsky told the cuban ambassador the refugees sought shelter 
in the embassy without any czechoslovak participation ctk said 
in april 1980 thousands of disaffected cubans jammed the 
peruvian embassy in havana shortly thereafter many joined what 
became the mariel boatlift which eventually took 125000 cubans to 
florida

the mayors of moscow and leningrad joined boris n 
yeltsin in quitting the communist party on friday putting the 
countrys two largest cities as well as its heartland republic in 
the hands of noncommunists 
it was not immediately clear how the resignations of the three 
leading reformers would affect their party organizations 
yeltsin began the exodus thursday and it gathered steam as the 
partys 28th congress drew to a close leaders of the democratic 
platform reform group said they would cap their departures by 
founding their own noncommunist party this fall 
mikhail s gorbachev the president and party leader said in an 
interview with cbs news that he had contempt for those who left 
the party 
he told the congress in a closing address that those who 
demand party repentance and the settling of accounts and brand the 
party as almost a criminal organization are simply out to remove it 
from the political scene and thereby deal a blow to the entire 
cause of revolutionary renewal 
moscow mayor gavriil popov and leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak 
said in a statement that the twoweek congress showed the 
complete inability of the party to offer the country a real program 
of transition to a new society 
popov an economist and sobchak a lawyer were elected this 
spring as reformminded candidates swept to power in local 
councils under their leadership the two city councils have been 
trying to break the control of local communist party organizations 
they have been active in the same reform circles of soviet 
politics as yeltsin 
moscow has about 9 million people and leningrad has 5 million 
they are by far the largest cities in the soviet union 
in his closing speech gorbachev said the party intended to 
drastically change its attitude to elected governing councils 
renounce attempts at substituting for them make every effort to 
assist them to stand up firmly on their feet and help deputies 
deal with problems involved in meeting vital popular needs 
yeltsin elected in may as president of the huge russian 
federation told the congress thursday he was quitting the party 
as president of the russian republic which has threequarters of 
the soviet unions territory and 52 percent of its people he must 
listen to all political parties and cannot obey only the communist 
party he said moscow and leningrad both lie within the russian 
republic 
the tass news agency quoted yeltsin as telling the russian 
parliament on friday that he made the decision with a heavy 
heart at the party congress delegates voted to strip him of his 
congress credentials 
an aide to popov who is traveling outside the soviet union 
read the statement from the moscow and leningrad mayors to 
reporters in moscows city hall 
aware of our responsibility before the people and history we 
have decided to withdraw from the communist party to help create a 
multiparty system and to have the possibility to more effectively 
lead the councils we head the statement said 
leaders of democratic platform made a declaration after 
yeltsins speech thursday that they also were quitting the party 
they said they would struggle to gain a fraction of the partys 
vast wealth in proportion to the percentage of the 18 million 
communist party members who join their new party 
at a news conference they said they would hold a founding 
congress for a new noncommunist party in october and that they 
believed many party members would follow them 
people see that the vicious circle has been broken said 
democratic platform leader vladimir lysenko of moscow 
gorbachev doesnt understand the size of the movement that 
started yesterday added stepan sulakhin of the siberian city of 
tomsk 
while democratic platform does not expect yeltsin to join 
boris yeltsin remains the leader of the entire democratic 
movement he said 
but sulakhin and other democratic platform leaders said it was 
too early to say exactly how many members of their own 
organization and of the party itself would join 
the new party also will have to work out its programs in the 
coming months they said 
our party will not be a communist party but it will not be a 
party of confrontation said vyacheslav shostakovsky who has 
been the rector of higher party school in moscow it will be a 
party of social progress 
shostakovsky said the new party would accept both market 
economics and private property in a new economic system but that 
the approach must be wellthought out 
shostakovsky estimated months ago that democratic platform had 
500000 to 600000 supporters among communist party members 
surveys by the group indicate that about 40 percent of the 18 
million members of the communist party are sympathizers

mikhail s gorbachev closed the communist partys 
28th congress friday by saying he would welcome western aid without 
political strings and warning of a gap between the party and 
the people 
the congress elected a new 412member central committee that 
appeared to be packed with moderate reformers of the gorbachev 
mold and gorbachev ousted hardliner yegor k ligachev from the 
central committee and the politburo 
the nearly 4700 delegates to the congress closed their 
tumultuous twoweek session by giving themselves a standing ovation 
and singing the internationale the socialist anthem 
the congress was the stormiest in the kremlin since 1921 when 
bolshevik revolutionaries faced violent uprisings among workers and 
sailors 
it also marked a major political victory for gorbachev and 
cemented his hold over the party it will be a different party 
however with the exodus of maverick boris n yeltsin and other 
reformers 
the congress opened july 2 with a demand from a miner that 
gorbachev and the entire leadership resign the meeting hit its 
emotional peak on thursday when yeltsin announced his resignation 
from the 18million member organization 
at the close of the congress delegates applauded gorbachevs 
statement that this is the end of the cold war and that doors 
were opening to the west 
the decision of leaders of seven industrialized nations to 
consider offering the soviet union economic aid he said showed 
the success of his governments effort to overcome selfisolation 
and become an integral part of the world economy 
western leaders meeting this week in houston texas resolved 
to study giving economic aid to moscow as advocated by west 
germany and france 
president bush said wednesday he would look more favorably on 
helping the soviet government if it would cut defense spending 
gorbachev told delegates we are ready to cooperate and will 
be grateful for assistance being not just seekers but partners who 
are not going to take anything free 
i want to emphasize that i exclude all attempts to stipulate 
any political conditions for such cooperation gorbachev said 
it can and it must develop on an equal and mutually beneficial 
grounds 
his comments were the highestlevel soviet response to the 
houston summit 
in a surprise development the largely traditionalist party 
congress approved gorbachevs plan to nearly double the size of the 
politburo to 23 members and give seats to the party leaders of the 
15 soviet republics 
the central committee met late friday night to choose politburo 
members but no decision was made by early saturday the politburo 
the partys highest body was redesigned to ensure a moderate cast 
and help reduce the ethnic tension that is ripping the country 
apart 
restructuring the politburo also marked a triumph in gorbachevs 
drive to shift power from the party to the government which he 
also heads the politburo appeared unlikely to meet frequently or 
to seek control matters not dealing directly with the party 
gorbachev smiling relaxed and very much in control warned the 
delegates in his sixminute closing remarks of a gap between the 
party committees and workers peasants and intellectuals 
he denounced those who like yeltsin demand repentence from 
the party settling scores those who declare it even a criminal 
organization those who attempt by doing this to remove the party 
from the political life of the country 
gorbachev in an interview with cbs news said he didnt see 
anything frightening in the prospect of a multiparty system 
emerging in the soviet union 
summing up the results of the congress gorbachev said it did 
not mark as some thought the death of the party but rather the 
rebirth and renewal of the communist party 
in spite of all the criticism all the delegates feel 
certain that were on the right course and that reforms should 
advance in all directions he told cbs news 
yeltsins theatrical announcement that he was quitting the 
party and statements by other reformers that they two were 
leaving signaled the first split in the party since factions were 
formally banned in 1921 
besides yeltsin the reformist mayors of moscow and leningrad 
gavriil popov and anatoly sobchak also announced they were 
quitting the party along with leaders of the radical democratic 
platform 
equally worrisome from gorbachevs perspective was a nationwide 
warning strike wednesday by miners who demanded that 
nationalization of all party assets and a mass exodus of workers 
from the party 
yeltsin sobchak and popov have also indicated they would use 
their government positions to divest the party of its billions of 
rubles worth of publishing houses office buildings cars and 
vacation resorts 
thousands of people have quit the party in recent months and 
the departure of the reform leaders and the rising anger of miners 
and other workers appeared likely to accelerate that process the 
precise impact could not immediately be determined although it 
cracked the unity among reformers that gorbachev has been urging

jordans foreign minister on friday blamed 
israel for the slump in the us drive to open mideast neogtiations 
marwan alqasim also said after talking to secretary of state 
james a baker iii that he hoped the united states would be dealing 
with the palestine liberation organization again 
i hope that the suspension of the dialogue will not last too 
long the arab official said 
the bush administration last month suspended its talks with the 
plo after chairman yasser arafat took no action against abul abbas 
a member of the plo executive council who was accused of plotting a 
terrorist attack against israel 
meanwhile diplomatic sources said baker hopes doctors will 
permit israeli foreign minister david levy who is recovering from 
surgery to come here for talks early next month 
the us drive came to a halt in march when israels cabinet 
collapsed over bakers formula for israelipalestinian talks 
alqasim blaming israel said the efforts by the american 
administration were derailed by israel 
we hope there will be reconsideration and have everyone 
indulge in a meaningful dialgoue that would lead to the 
comprehensive peace we need he added 
jordan after failing to persuade israel to relinquish the west 
bank decided two years ago to leave the areas future to the 
palestinians but the foreign minister said jordan always has been 
interested in achieving a durable and just peace 
we never went out of the circle and we continue to be in 
that he said 
jordan like all arab states considers the plo the sole 
representative of palestinians 
we are trying to inject every possible idea that would keep 
the peace process going and reengage the palestinians alqasim 
said

the nations top welfare official on 
friday commended a wisconsin experiment tying welfare benefits to 
school attendance but cautioned officials to resolve the programs 
administrative problems 
us health and social services secretary louis sullivan said 
his office would continue to monitor the learnfare program for 
improvement but had already found the programs goals quite 
laudable 
we feel that the data thus far merit continued investment in 
the program sullivan said at a news conference 
learnfare started in 1987 trims aid to families with dependent 
children benefits to families whose teenagers skip school it has 
been touted as an incentive for teenagers to continue their 
education and chances of employment but harshly criticized by 
welfare advocates 
the program was ordered suspended in milwaukee schools this week 
by us district judge terence evans who cited poor attendance 
records that have resulted in some families being wrongly penalized 
a lawsuit filed against the program said one family was evicted 
from its home and others had to turn to food pantries for food 
evans injunction applies only to the 3200 teenagers attending 
milwaukee public schools who have lost or are in danger of losing 
afdc benefits under learnfare the program continues in other parts 
of the state 
penalties under learnfare average about 100 a month for an 
average family receiving 517 a month in benefits 
sullivan who was in marshfield to dedicate a new 61 million 
research center at marshfield clinic said he was not concerned by 
the judges action 
obviously with any program that is new there are always a 
number of glitches or problems that might need to be addressed 
he said clearly the administrative issues must be addressed 
despite criticism that learnfare is a cruel and unsuccessful 
antitruancy tool the federal government in june approved 
wisconsins request to expand the program to include elementary 
children 
we have a number of problems that will be addressed by our 
society if we can improve our education approach sullivan said 
dropout rates are as high as 50 percent in some innercity 
schools he said

the mohawk indians said friday that quebec 
has offered concessions to end their armed confrontation with 
police the dispute spread across canada to british columbia where 
indians blocked roads to show support 
quebecs native affairs minister john ciaccia arrived at the 
barricades in a chauffeurdriven limousine friday for the second 
day of talks behind mohawk lines he told reporters thursdays 
talks ended on a positive note 
on wednesday an officer was killed in a gun battle between 
mohawks and provincial police wednesday arising from planned 
construction of a golf course addition on what mohawks say is 
ancestral land an investigation was to determine which side fired 
the fatal bullet 
the standoff and tight police security created problems on both 
sides 
after three days of living in a town under siege residents 
grumbled that this community of 3000 people was running out of 
supplies 
mohawks complained that police restricted access to indian 
territory and food medicine and water were in short supply 
access to oka 18 miles west of montreal was so restricted that 
even a truck delivering morning papers was turned back 
ciaccia said friday i think we have some basis for 
negotiations and discussions and we will pursue them we are taking 
these negotiations one day at a time and its too early to give 
details on progress 
other mohawks on the kahnawake reserve south of montreal 
blocked the mercier bridge in solidarity with their oka brethren 
the span links the populous south shore of the st lawrence river 
with the island of montreal 
ellen gabriel mohawk spokeswoman in oka said she warned 
ciaccia by phone that natives would blow up the bridge if police 
attack 
the dispute started four months ago when mohawks built a 
roadblock to prevent oka from building an extension to a ninehole 
golf course on land the mohawks say belongs to them 
early wednesday a provincial police raiding squad stormed the 
barricade setting off the gun battle that killed cpl marcel 
lemay 31 
members of the militant warrior societies from kahnawake and 
from the akwesasne reserve south of cornwall ontario then 
filtered into oka to reinforce the mohawk position police sent 
reinforcements and now total about 1000 here 
about 200 mohawks stared down at police from the top of a hill 
the police have to retreat completely from the area before we 
can ever work out a deal with ciaccia ms gabriel said 
she said that on thursday mr ciaccia gave us a message and 
some details about some of the bargains that the governments want 
to make with us 
she said ciaccia discussed a possible guarantee that natives 
involved in the occupation would not be prosecuted another mohawk 
peacemaking condition 
just outside the town young indians drove cars and trucks at 
high speed along a nativecontrolled stretch of highway 344 
conveying news of police movements to other mohawks and to 
journalists 
the union of british columbia indian chiefs asked all native 
bands in canadas westernmost province to block roads and bridges 
in their territories 
three roads were blocked for a time an indian chief marvin bob 
of the pavilion band was arrested charged with public mischief 
and released 
le journal de montreal said friday that ballistics tests show 
the bullet that killed lemay was not the same type as those from 
his service weapon or from the weapons of his colleagues montreal 
police declined to comment 
ms gabriel said ciaccia asked the natives to cooperate in the 
police investigation of lemays death 
we said yes she said we know were innocent we did not 
cause the death 
a spokesman for prime minister brian mulroney said the federal 
government is monitoring the standoff at oka but considers it a 
provincial dispute for now

the north american concert promoters 
association announced friday it would cancel its new orleans 
convention this fall if the governor signs into law a bill 
requiring labels on explicit records 
under the bill which if signed by gov buddy roemer would be 
the first state law of its type records with lyrics some consider 
offensive or obscene would be labelled and kept from minors 
carl freed director of the concert promotion group said in a 
statement from new york if this bill becomes law concert 
promoters recording artists and community retailers will be driven 
out of business they are being made scapegoats by soap box 
politicians 
the bill now awaiting action from roemer would require the 
labeling of any recording that promotes or has as its central theme 
illegal use of drugs and alcohol violence ritualistic acts or 
certain kinds of sexual behavior 
on thursday members of the music industry in louisiana 
suggested a voluntary labeling program to head off roemers 
signature of the bill 
our plan is to have every record dealer in the state 
voluntarily sign a pledge that they will not sell records with 
explicit lyrics to minors said shea dixon backer of a proposed 
grammy hall of fame for new orleans thats pretty much whats 
being done now this just formalizes it 
record dealers said they have a standing policy of not selling 
records that deal with sex drugs or violence to minors 
state sen william jefferson a democrat said the bill awaiting 
roemers action is unconstitutional dealers said its simply too 
confusing to live with 
the record industry association of america labeling system 
which took effect july 1 effectively singles out records with 
explicit lyrics said freddie szilagi manager of tower records in 
new orleans

choose to hunt live game arnett said 
theyve been known to walk down the street in a village going 
after dogs and such he said 
the zoo plans to limit their menu to goat chicken and the 
occasional rodent left over from feeding snakes 
its very hard to give them a rotted carcass its disgusting 
to the public and its disgusting to me arnett said

a grand jury friday indicted a jailed 
rapist on murder charges in the slayings of at least six young 
women and teenagers whose bodies were found in the desert three 
years ago 
but while some relatives of the victims were pleased others 
thought authorities might be just finding a scapegoat 
david leonard wood of el paso was charged after new evidence was 
presented to a grand jury although prosecutors would not 
elaborate he is serving a 50year prison term for a 1987 rape 
the decayed remains of the victims 14 to 23 years old were 
found in the desert about 18 miles northeast of el paso between 
sept 4 1987 and march 14 1988 
each of the victims had been missing at least two months before 
the body was discovered all were buried in shallow graves within a 
halfmile of each other three people are still missing 
the discovery led to an intensive investigation and the 
formation of a special task force that has dwindled to two members 
this investigation has gone on practically three years and a 
lot of my staffs been involved and a great number of officers and 
other agencies have been involved said district attorney steve 
simmons were certainly relieved that in a crime like this the 
subject can be brought to justice

indicted david had nothing to do with it maybe he knows 
something but he had nothing to do with it mrs dismukes said 
mona dismukes the missing womans sisterinlaw also was 
angry they dont know who else to blame she said 
wood knew cheryl lynn and at least one of the confirmed victims 
the dismukes family has conducted its own investigations into the 
murders and disappearances and believes wood is innocent erika 
dismukes said 
the indictment says one victim was stabbed several times with a 
sharp instrument and the others were killed by some means 
instrument or weapon unknown to the grand jury 
under texas serial murder law wood faces life in prison or 
execution by injection if hes convicted 
some of the victims were runaways or prostitutes and police 
were criticized for not responding more quickly to reports of their 
disappearances 
wood who was convicted in march 1988 of the rape had been 
mentioned before as a suspect last year he filed a 205 million 
lawsuit against police chief john scagno claiming police schemed 
to implicate him because they could not solve the case

portauprince haiti ap a judge dismissed a warrant for the 
arrest of roger lafontant a former high official of the duvalier 
dictatorship whose return from exile prompted a nationwide protest 
strike radio stations said friday 
magistrate justin fougere acted after government prosecutor 
bayard vincent showed up in court thursday to defend the warrant 
but left before the judge arrived after waiting for him for more 
than an hour independent radio haiti inter reported 
fougere declared the arrest warrant null and void because of 
vincednts absence the report said 
in an interview friday with radio antilles another independent 
station vincent protested fougeres decision and accused the 
justice department and police of complicity in obstructing justice 
vincent issued an arrest warrant for lafontant last saturday 
the day lafontant returned after more than four years in exile in 
the neighboring dominican republic 
the return from exile of lafontant and retired maj gen 
williams regala was widely regarded as an attempt by duvalier 
loyalists to disrupt general elections scheduled for nov 4 
foreign minister kesler clermont told a news conference at the 
united nations that the haitian government was seeking about 345 
un observers to ensure free and fair elections in november but 
he admitted a consensus by the 15member security council was 
unlikely and the issue was expected to be taken up by the general 
assembly on july 23 
past elections in haiti have been marred by bloodshed and 
violence but the strife has been entirely domestic 
opponents of security council involvement say un intervention 
could set an unfortunate precedent for handling other domestic 
disputes 
political and union leaders organized a nationwide oneday 
protest strike here wednesday after president ertha 
pascaltrouillot failed to meet its demand to arrest lafontant and 
regala who returned separately from exile last week

a scent squad has been unleashed in 
bartlesville to trace and identify an elusive odor that has plagued 
residents in the western part of town for months 
the 19member bartlesville odor mitigation task force will 
distribute about a halfdozen devices to trap the smell which then 
will be sniffed and characterized by select noses at a chicago 
research company officials say 
the iit research institute will try to match the descriptions 
with a smell that could be produced in the bartlesville area said 
demetrio moschandreas of the chicagobased institute 
the city has received 60 calls since jan 1 about the smells 
but has been unable to determine the cause said barbara hachmuth

neighborhoods in this city of 35000 about 40 miles north of tulsa 
in northeastern oklahoma and volunteers will snag samples to be 
shipped to chicago 
you press a button and it will suck in the air and put it in a 
hermetically sealed bag ms mcgrew said of the devices 
in chicago panel members will take a whiff of the contents and 
describe what they smell moschandreas said the panel has a list of 
144 words or phrases to describe the smell such as fried chicken 
leather alcohol chemicals soap and sour milk 
scientists at the institute will review the descriptions to see 
if they match any odors that could be produced in the area

about 5000 teachers jeered gov booth gardner 
outside a hotel friday where he was elected chairman of a national 
education reform group 
gardner who bills himself as the education governor said 
he was neither embarrassed nor moved by protest which wasnt 
audible inside the westin hotel where the education commission of 
the states held its annual meeting 
its their show and this is my show were both doing what we 
have to do he said 
gardner has been at loggerheads with the teachers since 
february when they staged a oneday walkout to protest his refusal 
to use part of a 750 million state revenue windfall to boost 
teachers pay hikes 
gardner was speaking friday before about 800 people from the 
commission a reform group that includes governors lawmakers and 
education leaders from every state but montana 
we need to rethink public education from the ground up he 
said whats missing is a clear vision of how our nations entire 
educational system from head start to harvard can be redirected 
to serve the needs of the future rather than the needs of the 
past 
gardner has promoted innovative teaching programs in the state 
and free preschool for disadvantaged 4yearolds he has promised 
to sponsor acrosstheboard pay boosts for teachers next winter but 
wants some of the pay package to be linked to performance which 
the teachers union opposes 
the protest march friday was one the larger ones in recent 
memory in seattle 
the throng was estimated by police at between 5000 and 6000 
at 12000 by national education association president keith geiger 
the teachers complained that congress and state legislators werent 
committing their checkbooks to education 
the protest theme no more hot air was emblazoned across 
the front of a huge hot air balloon 
washington education association president carla nuxoll a 
teacher from the spokane area said gardner is heralded as an 
educational leader everywhere but in his home state 
a true education governor must do more than just puff about 
his commitment to education nuxoll said i can assure you that 
there is far more hot air inside this hotel than we have outside 
right now 
hed get an a in speechmaking but an f when the 
assignment comes due said katrina dohn a fifth grade teacher in 
tukwila south of seattle 
washingtons class sizes are the fifth largest in the nation 
textbook and perpupil spending are below the national average and 
teacher salaries have dropped from fourth in the nation to 23rd in 
the past decade nuxoll said 
the education commissions outgoing chairman is new mexico gov 
garrey carruthers maine gov john mckernan was tapped as

haitian exile leaders on friday called 
for investigations into the drownings of 39 haitians whose 
overloaded sailboat capsized while being towed by bahamian 
authorities 
exiles also questioned the bahamian governments decision to 
bury the dead in a mass grave on an uninhabited key 
the circumstances surrounding the drownings seem quite 
questionable and demands an official explanation into whether 
officers of the bahamian defense force were negligent in the 
accident said eliezer regnier a lawyer and human rights activist 
in the bahamas 
the fact that the deaths occurred while these people were in 
official custody of the defense force all the more warrants more 
explanation than what was given by the official press release of 
the government regnier said 
another 67 haitians pitched into the sea when the sailboat 
rolled over wednesday were rescued by those aboard the bahamas 
defense force patrol boat 
no one should treat his or his own brothers and sisters this 
way said the rev gerard jeanjuste a haitian exile leader in 
miami who also urged an investigation this is shameful 
the bodies of 30 men and nine women were buried in a mass grave 
wednesday at uninhabited bitter guana cay in the exumas about 80 
miles from nassau according to the government 
although the people are poor and may have been trespassing in 
another jurisdiction there ought to have been some dignity given 
them there need not have been a mass burial said regnier a 
haitianborn bahamian 
the statement said the boat was chased by the bahamian defense 
force vessel yellow elder after it was spotted off staniel cay 
about 200 miles southeast of the southern tip of florida near great 
exuma island 
the sloop tried to enter shallow waters before it was overtaken 
and put under tow by the yellow elder the government said during 
the tow back to staniel cay the sloop capsized 
the survivors were brought wednesday to nassau in almost all 
cases haitians intercepted while fleeing their homeland for the 
united states are returned home 
us coast guard lt jeff karonis said friday that 537 haitians 
have been picked up so far this year in the waters off florida as 
they attempt to leave their caribbean island earlier this week 
193 haitians were picked up from a 40foot boot 
theres always the potential for a tragedy he said about 
the dangerous crossing in vessels that may be overloaded or 
unseaworthy

thousands of weary albanians trudged from 
ferry boats onto italian shores friday realizing a dream that had 
led them to besiege foreign embassies in europes last citadel of 
hardline communism 
we shall win refugees on one ferry chanted in italian as 
they approached the port of brindisi 
albanias state ata news agency meanwhile reported that about 
100000 albanians rallied on friday in skanderbeg square near 
tiranas diplomatic quarter in support of the countrys communist 
leadership 
xhelil gjoni a member of the partys policymaking politburo 
told the rally that albania and its peoples power are unshaken 
by degenerate people who abandon their homeland or by anyone 
else said a tirana radio broadcast monitored in london 
the four ships chartered by the west german and italian 
governments picked up about 4500 albanians in durres early friday 
under an agreement worked out with united nations mediation 
after journeys of about seven hours the ferries disgorged 
crowds of ragged sweaty albanians onto the brindisi docks where 
they were met by red cross workers and soldiers serving warm milk 
and cold soda 
i am very very happy to come here said artano harizai 25 
as he and three friends examined plastic relief bags filled with 
new socks and shirts 
here and in europe theres freedom in albania theres not 
his friends one without shoes and another shirtless nodded 
vigorously and gave thumbsdown signs for the albanian police 
fifteen albanians were admitted to brindisis hospital 
including two women expected to give birth soon said red cross 
spokesman ricardo moro several other people were suffering from 
wounds suffered when albanian police fired at people trying to 
scamble into western embassies 
a baby was born on one ship the espresso grecia after it left 
albania a red cross spokesman said 
about 3200 refugees were from west germanys embassy and they 
boarded trains at the dock to continue to that country 
everyone off to freedom a refugee cried to other albanians 
waving from a departing train 
a fifth ferry chartered by the french government took on 545 
albanians for a voyage from durres directly to marseille 
about 800 albanians from italys embassy were taken by bus to a 
temporary camp outside brindisi and 29 refugees from greeces 
embassy took a plane from brindisi to athens said clara minerva 
assistant director of the local interior ministry office 
the evacuation eased a crisis that prompted dismissals from the 
albanian government and damaged its efforts to soften its 
isolationist foreign policy 
albanian leader ramiz alia introduced limited reforms this year 
including some religious freedom and travel abroad 
but that was not enough for the thousands of albanians who 
sought refuge in foreign embassies in tirana 
many predicted albanias communist government would fall just 
as the east german government did last year after thousands of its 
citizens crowded foreign embassies to flee to the west 
many people are unhappy in albania they are with us said a 
mining engineer who identified himself as muharrem 
several people put on chains with crosses given to them by 
italians at the dock until recently religious observances were 
forbidden in albania 
several albanians admitted to having had trouble with the 
government either because of criticizing it or having relatives who 
tried to escape from the country 
others said they had always dreamed of freedom or wanted a 
better life 
we havent a need for food muharrem said in broken english 
we have the need for freedom of ideas 
many people said they hoped to eventually make it to the united 
states where as 21yearold voltan rexhepi said life is good 
rexhepi said he spent the last five days squeezed into the west 
german embassy albanian authorities frequently cut off the water 
and toilets became unusable but the diplomats struggled to provide 
food for all 3200 he and others said 
the albanians were transported by bus late thursday from tirana 
to durres where they boarded the ferries they said police ringed 
the dock to prevent anyone else from jumping aboard ferry crew 
members said 
durres is about 85 miles from brindisi 
until friday only 51 of the asylumseekers crammed into 
embassies had left albania the small group flew to prague 
czechoslovakia on tuesday 
arrangements were made to fly 40 albanians who had taken refuge 
in the hungarian embassy to budapest 
as some albanians left the ferries at brindisi they gaily waved 
their new red passports their ticket to a new life 
the albanian government agreed to let the refugees leave after 
supplies of food and medicine in the embassies ran low and hygienic 
conditions deteriorated 
the foreign ministry in bonn said its embassy had been closed 
for renovations 
the embassy is in an inconceivable state said spokesman 
juergen chrobog

britains beleaguered trade secretary nicholas 
ridley came home friday night from a trade visit to hungary and 
expectations were he will resign after his charge that west germany 
wanted to take over a united europe 
his comments in a magazine interview which he later retracted 
provoked crossparty calls for his resignation and were denounced 
in germany france and other european countries 
prime minister margaret thatcher refused friday to answer 
questions about ridleys political future reportedly leaving the 
first move up to him 
but even rankandfile members of her conservative party who 
applaud his warning of german supremacy over a united europe said 
he will have to go sir marcus fox vice chairman of the 1922 
committee of tory lawmakers told bbc radio 4 that ridleys 
position was now very bad 
mrs thatcher told the house of commons on thursday that ridley 
was not reflecting government policy nor her own views but she 
rejected demands for his dismissal 
ridley 61 the outspoken and controversial son of viscount 
ridley is considered mrs thatchers closest ideological ally in 
the cabinet political commentators said his departure would be a 
blow to her 
in the interview with the conservative weekly the spectator 
ridley said the west german governments support for european 
monetary union is all a german racket designed to take over the 
whole of europe it has to be thwarted 
this rushed takeover by the germans on the worst possible 
basis with the french behaving like poodles to the germans is 
absolutely intolerable 
ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12nation 
european community which he said was run by 17 unelected reject 
politicians he said you might just as well give it to adolf 
hitler frankly 
earlier friday night foreign secretary douglas hurd made the 
governments first move to repair the damage to angloeuropean 
relations 
speaking at the angloamerican conference center near oxford 
hurd said our alliance our partnership and our friendship with 
france and germany lie at the heart of modern british foreign 
policy 
lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from 
strengthening month by month the practical proofs of that 
friendship 
irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with 
the fellow members and institutions of the european community of 
which the prime minister spoke after the dublin eec summit last 
month 
nothing will now put these processes in doubt 
paddy ashdown leader of the centrist liberal democratic party 
said the issue has now become not mr ridleys folly but mrs 
thatchers judgment by refusing to sack him she is multiplying 
the insult of his outrageous views 
gordon brown the opposition labor partys trade spokesman said 
she was guilty of a dismal failure of leadership for leaving 
the decision about ridleys future in his hands 
with this indecision following on top of the ridley insults 
her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of 
responsibility that will make britain the subject of at best 
ridicule and at worst hostility throughout europe he said

a federal judge on friday ordered a man who 
has been the focus of a probe into fatal mail bombings held without 
bail until his trial on unrelated charges of witness tampering 
judge wilbur d owens jr set a tentative trial date of sept 17 
for walter leroy moody jr 56 he also ruled that moodys wife 
susan mcbride moody 28 could be released on a 250000 property 
bond 
the moodys were arrested tuesday and charged in a 13count 
federal indictment with conspiracy obstruction of justice 
subornation of perjury bribery of a witness and tampering with a 
witness 
the charges arose from moodys attempts to erase a 1972 
conviction for possession of a pipe bomb in macon the bomb injured 
his thenwife hazel 
thursdays session of the bail hearing featured secretly 
videotaped meetings in march and april between the moodys and julie 
linn west of atlanta the government contends she was one of two 
women the moodys bribed and intimidated into providing moody with a 
concocted alibi for the bombing 
the materials used in the pipe bomb explosion reportedly were 
similar to those found in four december mail bombs two of which 
killed a federal judge and a lawyer in december 
at one point friday owens closed the hearing after a 
prosecutors mentioned the mail bombings that killed 11th circuit 
court judge robert s vance and savannah lawyer robert robinson 
the other bombs went to the 11th circuit courthouse and to the 
jacksonville fla office of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
letters that claimed responsibility for the mail bombs 
attributed them to a racist hate group 
bruce harvey moodys attorney has claimed that the indictment 
was a consolation prize for prosecutors who have been unable to 
indict moody in the mail bombings despite six months of 
investigation 
after an hourlong close hearing with harvey and prosecutors 
owen returned to open court and ruled that attorneys in the moodys 
current trial could not discuss potential evidence in the mail 
bombings case 
the charges in this court do not involve the bombings the 
government has mentioned owens said noting neither moody nor 
his wife has been indicted in the bombings when and if they are 
indicted that is a matter that will be taken up

ms colley speaking thursday at a news conference with 
researchers who have isolated the disease gene said the most 
wrenching part of being one of 100000 americans with 
neurofibromatosis was the bleak sense that nothing could be done 
the discovery of the neurofibromatosis or nf gene changes all 
that and raises for the first time the possibility that the 
untreatable disorder may eventually be understood and controlled 
the most painful feeling has been that there was no hope for 
progress in nf research she said television lights glinting off

fundamentalists have won a round 
against secularism slipping a bill on islamic law through the 
senate while the government wasnt looking and liberal pakistanis 
worry about what lies ahead 
critics of prime minister benazir bhutto say she was 
outmaneouvered the few senators belonging to her leftofcenter 
pakistan peoples party including her law minister were absent 
when the bill passed unanimously in may 
her government the first in a modern islamic nation led by a 
woman is expected to stall until the senate elections of march 
1991 in hopes of winning control of the chamber the pakistan 
peoples party controls the national assembly where the real power 
lies 
its depressed me immensely amna piracha a friend of ms 
bhutto and a national assembly member said of the senate action 
she added however there are many ways we can tackle it 
opponents of the sharia bill fear the power it will give islamic 
clerics who would interpret law according to their reading of the 
koran the moslem holy book sharia is the term used for islamic 
law 
women have been particularly vocal concerned about losing what 
little ground they have gained in recent years by islamic law and 
tradition women are subservient to men 
ms piracha and sher afgan former minister of state for 
parliamentary affairs spoke of several options mostly designed to 
stall the bill in the national assembly 
it must be introduced in the assembly within 90 days of senate 
passage ms bhuttos 19monthold government is expected to refer 
it either to a committee or the islamic ideology council which her 
predecessor gen mohammed zia ulhaq established to debate 
theological questions 
ms bhutto often has agreed to a form of islamic law on 
condition pakistans religious leaders reach a consensus which 
many in her party consider unlikely 
supporters and critics alike say ms bhutto must take care with 
islamic fundamentalists whose violent riots in 1977 eventually 
brought down her father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
he was convicted of conspiring to murder a political foe who 
was not killed and was hanged in 1979 gen zia who overthrew 
him held power until his death in a plane crash in august 1988 
politically they cannot afford to throw the bill out 
khurshed ahmed said of the governing party they would be 
sounding their death knell 
ahmed leads the small but powerful jamaatiislami or party of 
god which is said to have organized the rioting in 1977 he told 
the associated press history could be repeated if ms bhuttos 
government tried to kill the legislation 
we may call for midterm elections ahmed said or we may 
even call for a mass movement against the pakistan peoples party 
the prime minister who wears the traditional islamic head 
covering and is seldom seen without a voluminous shawl has been 
criticized by women activists for what they call her attempt to be 
more religious than the mullahs or islamic clerics 
fundamentalist islamic scholars dismiss ms bhuttos 
conservative conduct ahmed said she represents a secular trend 
whatever islamic windowdressing she puts on 
he said women who opposed islamic law westernized alienated 
and had no knowledge of islam 
women wearing billowing shawls that covered them from head to 
foot protested two years ago when zia proposed that sharia be 
adopted in his quest to islamize this nation of 110 million he 
died before the legislation could be passed 
islamic law would supersede the pakistans moslem family law 
which guarantees equal inheritance rights and governs child 
custody shariah gives the father the right to the children and 
inheritance favors sons 
under the proposed legislation commissions would be established 
to islamize the media education and finance clerics would 
have the power to interpret law and pass judgment 
mullahs are not fanatics ahmed said they have just as 
much right to judge this is not a test we are moslem but were 
for simple islam not for the mullahs islam

his previous films included nightmare on elm 
street iv and a political thriller banned in finland but the way 
renny harlin sees it he was more than ready to direct a hollywood 
blockbuster such as die hard 2 
i was one of those annoying kids who was always in charge when 
kids get together recalled harlin a native of helsinki 
i would write little plays and tell people what to do i was 
always the one who ended up with the biggest responsibility like 
the prom in high school there had to be a great program and a show 
and a play everybody else goes and has fun and theres always 
somebody left alone who has to worry about everything 
i was also crazy about films but the traditional american 
storytelling was something that really appealed to me i have to 
confess i loved american movies more than the european movies 
harlin 31 soon discovered that directing die hard 2 was 
like running the biggest prom in history with a lot more to worry 
about than finding a good band 
weather was the main culprit a christmas blizzard had to be 
filmed in a los angeles studio after unseasonably warm temperatures 
and rain ruined location shooting in denver moses lake wash and 
alpena mich bitter winds plagued filming in mead colo just 
outside of denver 
also officials at the metropolitan washington airports 
authority objected to the movies story of rightwing former 
military officials taking control of a major airport in the 
nations capital the authoritys legal counsel edward s faggen 
complained the script reflects a reckless disregard for the truth 
or the reality of the airport and airport operations 
so harlin had plenty of chances for nervous pacing give him 
credit for a big crowdpleaser having bruce willis ejected out of 
an airplane like a rock from a slingshot but how about when the 
star makes a call from washington dre running themselves 
into the ground just to keep even 
the stories of all work no play have a familiar ring to 
them most of us know that we work harder nowadays to maintain the 
standard of living our parents enjoyed and its sad to see people 
working so hard for so little 
technophobia the second segment is the weakest keith 
morrison reports that videocassette recorders are in 68 million 
us households but 80 percent of the people cannot program their 
machines to record 
morrison says real life asked 125 americans to record a 
onehour program twothirds of them he reports either gave up 
or screwed up 
its a clever story idea because americans hate to read their 
owners manuals and vcr makers dont know how to write them or how 
to make a simple timedelay recording system but thats as far as 
it goes 
but morrisons narration is cloyingly cute delivered with the 
kind of oily awfolksisntthisclever voiceover that will have 
you screaming by the time it ends seven minutes 30 seconds later 
the segment betty uses family photographs home movies and 
old videotape to create a touching portrait of an emotionally 
disturbed woman who gave birth to a daughter and ended her life 
homeless on the streets of new york city 
the best segment however is extoday staffer boyd 
mattsons droll coasttocoast road trip to a variety roadside 
attractions available in the typical 48night american vacation 
he visits reptiland rock city the black madonna shrine and 
grotto in the ozarks the linoleumfloored meramec caverns in

after countless centuries of lumbering 
through fields and chewing cud bovines have moseyed into the art 
world 
the cow a pastoral fixture since ancient times and more 
recently the model for such kitsch items as tshirts and salt 
shakers is now the subject of a traveling art exhibit 
the cow in photograph and folktale displaying 39 
photographs of cows bulls and heifers opened last month at the 
new york state museum in downtown albany for the purpose of 
exploring the richness of bovine culture 
the show features photographs dating from the 19th century to 
today illustrating the cow in just about every imaginable 
circumstance and then some there are closeup cows cows in 
fields cows being milked cows in thistle and even a shot of a 
giant fiberglass cow 
for centuries the common image of the cow has inspired and 
intrigued artists working in all mediums in such simple and 
elegant views the beauty of the beast wrote caralee aber in the 
exhibits program notes 
aber put the show together two years ago while working at the 
george eastman house in rochester aber has since died but said in 
an interview at the time that she became piqued by the aesthetic 
potential of the cow when she came across an old black and white 
cow portrait from 1908 
she decided the cow merited an exhibit 
it took very quiet subtle cajoling to get it going she 
said the first response was cows why cows people would 
giggle 
but aber persisted and gathered the finest photos of cows she 
could find with some cow poetry proverbs trivia and even a cow 
video to produce her own particular ode to bovines 
theres a tremendous culture connected to the cow aber said 
thats no understatement europe the birthing ground of western 
culture is said to be named after the great white mooncow and to 
this day cows wander impoverished streets of india protected by 
an aura of sacredness 
the cows devotional heyday though probably came in ancient 
times when the animal was often thought to be the great creator 
ancient egyptians revered mother hathor as the heavenly cow 
whose udder produced the milky way whose body was the firmament 
and who daily gave birth to the sun according to barbara g walker 
in the womens encyclopedia of myths and secrets 
in old india a creation myth went that the universe was 
literally curdled into shape from milk of a great lunar cow 
some ancients in the near east believed that the human race itself 
was curdled from the goddess milk to them we are nothing but 
curds 
thus the cow was honored as a wet nurse of humanity and her 
image is still inadvertently invoked to this day as an expletive 
holy cow or a pejorative sacred cow concludes walker 
heady stuff but lately the cow has come down from the altar to 
show up in most unlikely places such items as packages of premium 
ice cream tshirts and jewelry all began sporting the stark black 
and white bovine image in the 1980s 
holy cow inc a mailorder business based in middlebury vt 
offers the usual cow shirts mugs and creamers along with more 
esoteric cow stuff such as holstein timepieces cow golf balls 
4foot high cow cut outs and even a tshirt of chairman moo one 
billion cows cant be wrong reads the catalog 
woody jacksonfounder of holy cow said his cowculture items 
including his painted cowlandscapes grossed about 15 million 
last year 
i think it makes people nostalgic said jackson trying to 
explain cow magnetism it reminds people of a simpler time plus 
everyone grows up on milk 
the exhibit itself explores the relation between man and cow 
with both humorous and more serious images an old print by lewis 
hines of a farmer and his son milking a cow is complimented by 
boris and the worlds largest cow a shot of a dog admiring a 
giant fiberglass cow 
other pictures such as rancher with her prize cattle by 
june van cleef shows just what cows can mean to people 
van cleef said her picture of a texas woman beaming proudly next 
to her animal shows how consummately important cows and cattle are 
to a whole segment of our culture 
the cattle are everything to her van cleef said

the public concession by the federal reserve 
chairman that a credit crunch might exist confirms what a lot of 
smallbusiness people have been saying for months without getting 
much of a hearing 
the fact they didnt receive a hearing suggests something might 
be wrong with the way regulators and some important business 
institutions gather and assimilate information 
cries of distress from the smallbusiness and beginningbusiness 
sectors were at first dismissed as 
anecdotal why the explanation went everyone knows of a good 
little business that got a raw deal from the bank but dramatic as 
such stories might sound it was said the numbers didnt add up to 
a trend 
geographically limited such as to new england 
limited to industries related to building and real estate 
which already were overextended 
in response to the clamor from some small businesses that 
bankers were denying them credit the conference boards chief 
economist gail fosler observed there is no evidence of a credit 
crisis managed or otherwise 
the national federation of independent business which regularly 
surveys more than 500000 independent business members said it 
found no evidence of credit tightening nationally 
all this seemed in contradiction to the cries coming from other 
directions 
the small business association of new england asked 60 business 
people at a meeting if a crunch existed fortyeight said yes 
hardly a day passed in any area of the country larger than a few 
square miles that some smallbusiness person didnt complain about 
some sort of financial restrictions by local banks 
the national association of home builders surveyed 1142 members 
and declared that builders are being indiscriminately cut off 
from the credit markets production is dropping people are losing 
their jobs and businesses 
the fed retreated from its earlier position it surveyed some 
members banks and found more than half had tightened lending 
standards for small and mediumsize companies 
now six weeks later chairman alan greenspan says the fed is 
prepared to take modest offsetting action against a crunch 
the episode provokes questions why did it take so long to 
recognize why were the smallbusiness complaints so readily 
dismissed what is wrong with the ways business and regulators 
determine if a crunch exists 
some possibilities 
tight money is measured by what happens to the nations largest 
companies rather than to small companies or beginning companies 
evidence is statistical it does not measure banker attitudes 
in this regard it is significant that the credit crunch didnt 
originate so much with a tightmoney policy by the fed as from 
voluntary restraints by bankers some overreacting to their 
previous easylending policies 
in a sense the money was there but the banks didnt lend it 
typically many of the smaller businesses in such groups at the 
national federation of independent business rely on internal 
financing rather than on credit lines from the bank moreover they 
are established businesses 
the worst of the credit restraints seem to have affected very 
small businesses entrepreneurial ventures and businesses seeking 
to take what bankers might consider imprudent risks 
more often than some regulators statisticians academics and 
economists might like to concede national statistics often 
overlook this category the numbers they gather and analyze usually 
are bigbusiness numbers 
in defense of the tightmoney situation some observers have 
commented that it served the purpose of discouraging new and risky 
ventures such as real estate developments in areas already 
overbuilt cant quibble with that 
what some smallbusiness people feel angry and disturbed about 
however is that it is their ideas their innovations their 
dedication their risktaking that creates new enterprises new 
jobs new competition 
in short they say it is new businesses that seed economic 
change and development and it isnt fair to them or to the country 
that good ideas and good small businesses should be financially 
starved and then ignored

guadalupe lechuga has spent most of his 
52 years traveling around the country picking other peoples crops 
in fields many tainted with toxic agricultural chemicals 
this year was different he didnt board up the doors and 
windows of his home in the southern tip of texas to travel north 
tired of the chemicals and of working for los patrones the 
bosses lechuga and a group of 30 migrant farm workers families 
formed a cooperative to grow and market their own organic 
vegetables 
lechuga foreman of the new san juan farm workers cooperative 
said the coops small plots of tomatoes peppers eggplant squash 
and other vegetables represent the first time he can call a crop 
his own 
i think it will be good lechuga said all my life ive 
had bosses 
like other migrants his children year after year had to leave 
school in april or may to follow the work north they typically 
didnt return until november and spent their lives barely getting 
by 
many migrant children never catch up in school so they drop 
out its a way of life that keeps the lower rio grande valley 
with its tens of thousands of farm workers consistently among the 
poorest areas of the united states 
the coops goal is to pull them out of the cycle by setting 
them up as independent small farmers theyre also cashing in on 
the growing demand for organically grown produce 
coop members are trained in organic farming under a project 
sponsored by the texas department of agriculture which also 
certifies the land is organic buyers of organic produce usually 
require certification by a third party such as a state agency to 
ensure it was grown without artificial chemicals 
with the training coop members eventually should be able to 
operate from their own plots of two to five acres said neal 
warnes the project manager who has helped develop other organic 
farms 
were trying to get people into a line they can try to make 
some money at warnes said 
us retail sales of organic foods reached an alltime high of 
572 million in 1989 government figures show the texas department 
of agriculture reported 11 million in retail organic food sales in 
the state last year and estimated it could increase as much as 
tenfold this year 
organic produce supplies tend to fall short of demand at the 
wholesale level in texas said arthur beaudet produce buyer for 
texas health distributors a subsidiary of austinbased whole foods 
inc one of the largest organicproduce retailers in the united 
states california organics producers are the most advanced he 
said 
healthfood restaurants and grocery coops in the austin area 
have bought the bulk of the san juan coops early crops warnes 
said 
the farm workers were stunned when a buyer paid them 1 a pound 
for organic tomatoes recently more than twice the going local 
price warnes said 
theres a health food store that would take a thousand pounds 
a week if we had them he said 
the coop plans to produce 28 crops in a yearround rotation 
plans also include more families joining and establishing their own 
farms 
while they probably wont get rich warnes reckoned some could 
make up to 30000 a year more than double what many farm workers 
earn 
some of the 30 families in the coop had to go out of state 
again this summer to find work because the operation remains small 
on seven acres owned by the united farm workers union in san juan 
the coop has access to more land when it is ready to expand 
warnes said 
maria gomez 42 said she stayed behind this summer to help the 
coop get started to see if we can become independent to see if 
we can have our own crops 
ms gomez said she has seen many farm workers fall ill from 
working among pesticides and chemical fertilizers or from handling 
treated crops she remembers one man whose skin on the hands and 
feet peeled off like leather and thats on the outside who 
knows whats happening on the inside 
instead of chemical pesticides the coop uses natural 
substances such as rotenone an odorless crystalline derivative of 
some kinds of plant roots the coops natural fertilizers include 
seaweed and fish emulsion 
thick walls of sunflowers surround the coops vegetable plots 
serving as buffer zones to filter out airborne chemicals from 
nonorganic operations in the heavily farmed valley 
the coops small family farm tracts and organic methods are 
the type promoted by environmentalists agribusiness proponents 
however have written off such operations as outdated and 
inefficient compared to farms with hundreds or thousands of acres 
nonetheless the prospect of sustaining themselves with their 
own crops means much to people like ms gomez who is enthusiastic 
about everybody working together for a better way of living 
theyre going to have their own land and theyre going to be 
able to sell their own tomatoes cucumbers and other crops 
lechuga said 
and he said children will be able to finish an entire year of 
school

wall street will try to break a jinx of sorts as 
hundreds of corporations issue midyear earnings reports over the 
next couple of weeks 
in each of the past three quarterly peak reporting periods in 
april january and last october the stock market has suffered a 
setback as profits fell short of expectations 
on the basis of the early evidence a good many earnings 
disappointments are in store again for the second quarter which 
ended june 30 but hopes have built up that the market can ride out 
the storm this time given its steady rise of late to new highs 
the situation spotlights a dichotomy that has been confronting 
market participants for almost a year now 
overall statistics on the economy have been painting a picture 
of an ideal combination of modest and noninflationary growth 
in the words of edward kerschner analyst at painewebber inc but 
corporate earnings figures project the contrasting image of a 
profit recession 
as a result kerschner says the market has been dancing a new 
threestep steady to up in the two months when the macroeconomic 
data are encouraging then falling in the month when earnings are 
reported 
only at the end of the quarter when profit reports are 
disappointing does the stock market come under pressure 
this behavior spotlights a question as old as the market itself 
what precisely is the relationship between business earnings and 
stock prices 
nobody disputes that profits are a basic building block in the 
structure of stock values since they represent the flow of money 
available for dividend payments to shareholders and for 
reinvestment in future growth 
but the correlation between the two can sometimes seem very 
tenuous this year when stocks have jumped ahead while earnings 
slumped has been one of those times 
investors have always believed that corporate earnings are a 
principal if not the key ingredient in determining the direction 
of stock prices says the investment management firm jw 
seligman amp co in a recent report on the subject 
as profits increase stock prices reflect this improvement 
when they contract prices are expected to fall while this truism 
appears quite obvious in theory unfortunately it is not clear in 
actual practice 
a check of market history over the last four decades provides a 
good illustration of this inconsistent relationship seligman 
analysts say 
there is a clear correlation between longterm earnings growth 
and stock appreciation thus the basic premise is valid over long 
time frames they observe 
but deviations from the norm can test the faith of even the most 
patient investor 
in the 1970s for example profits of the companies in standard 
amp poors industrial stock index increased 170 percent by one 
measure but the index itself gained just 56 percent over the 
decade in a market buffeted by worries about such matters as 
accelerating inflation and the energy crisis 
in a given year the divergence can be even greater 
analysts say investors must bear in mind that stock prices 
reflect expectations about future earnings more than any response 
to past results thus the current strength in the stock market 
despite earnings weakness over the last several quarters can be 
interpreted as a forecast of improved profits in the 
nottoodistant future 
seligman concludes if business continues to weaken and 
profits slide further it seems likely that the current rally will 
prove to have been a false one 
we believe however that probabilities favor market price 
action being an accurate forecasting mechanism as it has been so 
often in the past profits should improve as yeartoyear 
comparisons become more favorable in the third and fourth 
quarters

kartar singh has a recurring nightmare 
hes driving home from his machine tool factory sikh militants 
in turbans of iridescent orange surround his car and police are too 
frightened to help 
i see the nozzles of the guns and they fire and everything 
goes red he said 
these days in punjab singhs nightmare is often a reality and 
being a sikh does not exempt him from the terror 
sikh militants have killed about 1400 people so far this year 
in their fight for a separate nation called khalistan or land of 
the pure security forces have killed nearly 250 of the extremists 
and some innocent bystanders 
government officials fear 1990 will be the deadliest year since 
the separatist violence began nine years ago 
a seemingly endless spiral of harsh police crackdowns rising 
crime unemployment and the introduction of advanced weapons by the 
militants has thrown this rich agricultural state into chaos 
the increasing violence threatens the position of prime minister 
vp singh who has partially staked his prestige on being able to 
solve the problem 
punjabs geography adds complications it adjoins both pakistan 
indias longtime antagonist and jammukashmir state where a 
movement within the states moslem majority seeks independence from 
india 
sikh militants in punjab are believed to be one source of 
weapons for kashmirs separatists and india has accused pakistan 
of providing arms and training to rebels in both states pakistan 
denies it 
we are facing a war said narinderpal singh police chief of 
punjabs tarn taran district it seems like it will go on 
forever 
singh which means lion is part of every sikh name but also 
has become a common surname for hindus prime minister singh is a 
hindu 
the fields of punjab are green and lined with trees the 
northwestern state is indias breadbasket producing 60 percent of 
the countrys rice and wheat 
terror dominates the lush countryside hindus once the main 
target of sikh militants have abandoned dozens of villages around 
the sikh holy city of amritsar an agricultural center 250 miles 
northwest of new delhi 
fellow sikhs like kartar singh now bear the brunt of the 
separatists wrath 
they either say were police informants or we dont love 
khalistan enough he said 
in tarn taran 121 of the 137 civilians killed so far this year 
were sikhs 
even a barking dog makes me afraid now said gurmit kaur a 
20yearold sikh woman in harike village 30 miles south of 
amritsar everything sounds like gunshots 
last april ms kaur watched as militants dragged her father 
from their farmhouse and killed him under an oak tree they accused 
him of being a police informer 
no one turns to the government for help 
police and other security forces have been blamed for hundreds 
of deaths officials acknowledge security forces have tortured sikh 
prisoners and killed suspected militants in fake encounters 
we are stopping that now virendra verma governor of 
punjab said in an interview we are trying to win back the 
hearts of the people 
verma recently announced creation of 10000 police and 
paramilitary jobs for unemployed sikhs critics say the program 
will help the militants by giving thousands of sikhs access to 
weapons 
many punjabis say police brutality continues 
in rajchauck village half a mile from pakistan residents say 
police beat 20yearold baljit singh to death in early june after 
singh was arrested villagers went to the police station to plead 
for his release saying he was not a militant the police said he 
had committed suicide 
federal authorities recently sent the national security guard 
an antiterrorist force known as the black cats back into 
punjab the action appears destined to stir up more enmity even 
among law enforcement officers 
the black cats predominantly hindu generally have been used 
only in extreme situations such as sieges to dislodge militants 
from the golden temple in amritsar the holiest shrine of sikhism 
last year they came to our village and killed a bootlegger and 
two laborers none of them militants said jagdeep singh a 
sikh police chief in harike village this year theyll do 
worse 
his comment highlights a growing gulf between hindus and sikhs 
in the state 
a decade ago the two communities frequently intermarried and 
hindu families adopted a tradition of raising one son as a sikh 
that tradition died as the ethnic conflict grew 
sikhism began in the 15th century as an alternative to the rival 
hindu and moslem faiths combining hindu rituals with islams 
belief in one god 
it became a warrior faith after moslem moguls beheaded a sikh 
prophet in the late 17th century his son ordered all sikh men to 
become soldiers of the faith and take the name singh 
sikh religious law requires men to wear a knife and prohibits 
them from cutting their hair or beards which are considered signs 
of virility 
in 1981 sikh radicals began the campaign for khalistan to save 
what they described as their dying culture 
militants attacked hindus in punjab where about 60 percent of 
the people are sikhs in india as a whole sikhs make up only 2 
percent of the 880 million people and hindus are 82 percent 
separatists stored weapons in the golden temple on june 3 
1984 the army attacked the temple in operation bluestar which 
sikhs say defiled the shrine more than 1200 people were killed 
most of them sikhs 
six months later two sikh bodyguards assassinated prime 
minister indira gandhi hindu mobs rampaged in northern india 
killing more than 3000 sikhs 
in 1988 the government again besieged the golden temple 
killing 46 people plainclothes security agents now patrol the 
grounds and armed guards search visitors 
sikh militants fled to the mand a snakeinfested mixture of 
badlands and swamp at the confluence of the satlug and beas rivers 
which run through the heart of punjab 
authorities say the area is impossible to patrol the only way 
to really beat the terrorists is to release lions into that 
swamp said ashok kumar who commands a company of the border 
security force responsible for the mand 
he said the sikhs are the bestarmed militants in india with 
night vision devices plastic explosives automatic rifles 
rocketpropelled grenades and shoulderlaunched rockets 
police said the separatists had stolen about 1 million from 
punjab banks in the past three months they have kidnapped hundreds 
of people for ransoms totaling another 1 million 
india must accept khalistan or there will be total anarchy 
said rajinder singh mehta head of the sikh students federation 
one of about 10 sikh militant groups 
even farming punjabs lifeline has come under attack 
militants have killed 24 members of the rice millers association 
this year including 10 sikhs and held 100 for ransom said ashok 
sachdeva a hindu who heads the association and seldom leaves his 
home in amritsar 
what is life if there is no freedom he asked all of us 
in punjab are like caged birds

ten sikh militants burst into 
shingra singhs house and kidnapped the successful merchant who 
has sold household appliances for a decade in this village 
surrounded by rice paddies and cornfields 
the abduction and payment of 12000 ransom were arranged by his 
son mekla 17 
ive spent my life bargaining said singh a 37yearold 
sikh sitting in the shade near his shop but who would have 
thought that id bargain for my life and do it with my son 
the separatist battle for an independent sikh homeland pits 
father against son and brother against brother 
mekla singh on the bench beside his father said he was ordered 
to arrange the kidnapping 
i believe in khalistan he said if i am ordered by my 
leaders i will obey 
singh did not press charges against his son who he said 
arranged very tasty food during the 10 days of captivity 
he is sending mekla to work at the family hotel near new delhi 
and the boy is happy to go 
there is no future in punjab mekla said we all want 
khalistan but we know we wont get it there are only guns and 
death here 
singh said he would stay in punjab to look after the business 
but after that experience all i want to do is die my family is 
everything to me and this trouble has hurt my family

the rollsroyce and jaguar showrooms on 
william street will open in a couple of hours before they do a

welcome to the edge of kings cross a stretch of nightclubs 
restaurants and strip joints where virtually anything is for sale 
this is the sex and drug center for the whole country said 
dr sigrid van beek director of the kirketon road center which 
offers help and medical care from midnight to 6 am if youre 
looking for prostitution or drugs its easy to score around here 
prostitution is either legal or largely tolerated in australia 
depending on the state so sydney police concentrate on controlling 
the abuse of drugs and alcohol 
the narcotics problem is growing but is far short of the 
magnitude in the united states crack cocaine and ice for 
instance have yet to arrive in significant quantities 
seizures of cocaine at ports and airports rose from 42 pounds in 
the 198889 fiscal year to nearly 155 pounds in 198990 officials 
said 
marijuana comes from southeast asia and other prime growing 
areas and from domestic farming operations that sometimes include 
huge irrigated tracts with security systems 
heroin is smuggled from abroad in increasing quantities the raw 
materials for amphetamines are smuggled in but the drugs are made 
here 
customs and the australian federal police said in a joint 
statement that most amphetamines are produced through backyard 
manufacture in clandestine laboratories 
a survey in 1988 which provides the latest figures available 
indicated there were 30000 to 50000 drug addicts and 60000 
occasional users among the 12 million australians aged 14 and 
older it said 12 million to 14 million acknowledged using 
marijuana in the previous year and 240000 said they had used 
amphetamines 
police suspect that in an attempt to get around strict 
inspection of people and goods arriving from known drug areas 
dealers are using other south pacific countries as way stations 
in february us officials seized a 6600pound shipment of 
marijuana from thailand that had been shipped first to new zealand 
where it was concealed in a shipping container of carpets and 
woolens 
tasmania an island state off the south coast is one of the few 
places in the world where opium poppies are grown legally from the 
poppy resin pharmaceutical companies produce morphine and codeine 
phosphate for export 
security at the 17000 acres of poppy fields was tightened 
recently after 500 grams of resin was found in victoria state and 
traced to tasmania 
sedatives like rohypnol and serepax are popular with young 
people and pharmacists have been accused of selling the drugs at 
reduced prices to attract customers mixing them with heroin has 
become a deadly practice 
of the 54 heroin deaths examined by the institute in the past 
year 32 tested positive for benzos sedatives like rohypnol 
said stephen cordner of the victoria state institute of forensic 
pathology 
the combination recently killed four teenage girls in a group 
of seven who grew up in redfern an aboriginal neighborhood in 
sydney and were confined together in the reiby detention center 
for juveniles 
a fifth 18yearold stephanie jones was hospitalized with 
broken legs and a broken arm after jumping from a police station 
window another was under guard at reiby classified as out of 
control and her sister the seventh in the group was to be 
released into a drugrehabilitation program 
the deaths have made me heaps scared but i want to get off 
drugs stephanie said from her hospital bed i dont want to 
die like that 
stephanie said she used heroin because she felt left out 
some officials have begun to talk of keeping the drug problem 
under control rather than eliminating it 
australian democrats a small political party has recommended a 
governmentrun distribution service to take drugs away from 
organized crime 
mike elliott a party representative in south australia state 
said in june that tough laws had not halted the drug trade and 
experience showed it would continue growing he said drug use 
should be treated as a public health problem not a crime 
elliot said a distribution service with tight controls would not 
lead to commercialization of drugs 
dr van beeks kirketon road center was established three years 
ago to fight the spread of aids among intravenous drug users and 
gives out 15000 needles a month needlesharing by drug users is 
one of the main ways the deadly disease is spread 
luckily we were very fast in setting up the needleexchange 
program dr van beek told an interviewer 
its too late in the united states where 80 percent of 
intravenous drug users are infected with the aids virus she said 
but its only 3 to 5 percent here 
asked about concern that distributing needles might encourage 
drug use she said thank god we havent run into that attitude 
here no study in the world shows that you encourage drug use by 
providing clean needles would you use drugs just because a 
needle was available

jean lennane sees the results of drugs 
every day and says the biggest threat is alcohol particularly to 
the young 
drinking is almost a way of life in australia where the pub is 
a favorite meeting place 
it dates back to the foundation of the colony here 200 years 
ago when the currency for a while was rum said ms lennane 
director of drug and alcohol services at sydneys rozelle hospital 
since 1980 
there was a temperance movement for a while but since world 
war ii the amount of alcohol consumed in australia has shot up 
she said 
its much worse than in the united states people are just 
killing themselves with it 
health officials estimate 10 percent of australians drink the 
equivalent of about 14 ounces of pure alcohol a day enough to 
lead eventually to brain damage heart problems cirrhosis of the 
liver or other diseases 
the australian medical association recommended this month that 
taxes on alcohol be raised 40 percent which it estimated would 
reduce consumption by 20 percent 
of people going into the hospital for treatment of some 
ailment statistics show about one in five is alcoholrelated 
ms lennane said its about two in five for psychiatric 
hospitals 
in a campaign against drunk driving nearly all australian 
states have lowered the bloodalcohol level at which people are 
considered intoxicated to 005 percent that is half the 010 
percent used by new york state 
alcoholrelated deaths involving only vehicles have decreased 
but the number of pedestrians killed has risen dr david hill 
director of the trauma unit at st vincents hospital in sydney 
said 80 percent to 90 percent of injured pedestrians treated there 
were intoxicated 
more than 4000 pedestrians were killed or injured last year in 
new south wales state of which sydney is the capital 
ms lennane is primarily concerned with two kinds of brain 
damage to which longterm drinking contributes 
one is caused by a combination of heavy drinking and poor diet 
that results in thiamin depletion and loss of shortterm memory 
among other problems 
we have far more of this than any other country she said 
the difficulty with the australian diet as compared with that in 
the united states and the united kingdom is that we dont add 
thiamin to our bread if that happens i believe we will have 
less of this problem 
the other problem is frontallobe damage which affects the 
abilities to plan organize form concepts structure information 
and learn from mistakes this can result from heavy regular 
drinking even with a good diet 
rozelle hospital has a 55bed ward for patients with 
alcoholrelated brain damage that treats about 250 people a year 
royal prince alfred hospital in sydney has a neuropsychology ward 
that treats 400 people a year for brain damage resulting from 
alcohol 
some of it gets better if they stay sober especially if 
theyre young but if you have people whove been drunk during most 
of their adolescence and havent done any maturing then they can 
have a lot of emotional and social problems ms lennane said 
we havent had much luck in rehabilitating them 
one of the things that alarms me is the way the average age of 
our patients has started to decline since i started here in 1980 
the youngest person being treated then was 38 and that was quite 
exceptional now we get people in their early 30s even in their 
20s

the precisioncropped hair is mostly gray but 
those famous blue eyes remain clear his skin unlined and his body 
trim 
at 64 academy awardwinning actor paul newman races on 
juggling success in three high pressure demanding professions 
acting the food business and auto racing and his passions run 
high in all 
when hes not directing acting or promoting his line of 
newmans own food products he takes to the track with his 
latest movie mr and mrs bridge ready for release this fall 
newmans ready to race 
this season hes driving a limited schedule on the sccas 
transam circuit as the teammate of 22yearold scott sharp the 
son of bob sharp coowner of newmansharp racing newman has 
watched the younger driver improve almost daily and laments one 
small part of aging 
a young driver like scott whos got a great gift just keeps 
going faster and faster newman said during an interview before 
finishing 16th in a recent transam race in cleveland 
young kids like scott think about winning i think about 
whether im going to have a pulse he joked 
when you get older and older you start slowing down 
everything is off one50th of 1 percent your eyes are a little 
off your reflexes touch everything you multiply that by just a 
factor of 1 percent thats two or three seconds a lap 
but newman whose interest in auto racing was generated on the 
set of winning in 1968 doesnt regret his late start in the 
sport he now loves 
i started at the right time i had the right kind of 
equipment he said i dont regret anything it came at the 
right time i was getting bored acting 
asked if racing revived his interest in other things he joked 
that his wife actress joanne woodward says it saved their 
marriage woodward costars in mr and mrs bridge a chronicle 
of a middleclass american family 
turning serious again newman said you become passionate 
about one thing it leads back into something else if you can gain 
a sense of passion and commitment in your life in one arena its 
bound to bleed back into other arenas 
newman who has earned four national amateur driving titles and 
two transam victories since beginning his racing career in 1972 
says he never gave driving a race car much thought until he played 
an indycar driver in winning 
what was it that attracted him to the sport 
i dont know he said it was just out there like 
anything else to be learned i started off very slowly very 
cautious as i start off everything 
since he has been successful at so much people tend to believe 
things come easily to newman he insists the opposite is true 
the light that you think you emanate is not necessarily the 
light that other people see he said you think of yourself as 
a shy retiring whatever it is and some other people will see you 
in an entirely different way 
i had always seen tennis star ivan lendl as a guy with such 
a gift the gift came before the work but not according to lendl 
he says if he lays off for three weeks hes garbage 
you have to constantly learn obviously you have to start 
with some kind of gift but people dont understand that i 
dont have a gift for anything ive only had a gift of pursuit 
thats certainly true in acting i cant look at the work i 
did 20 years ago i cant even watch it 
in all the things i started to attack football tennis i 
had no gift for it at all i had no gift for racing either its 
just something that i really wanted to do 
scott sharp sitting nearby said aw paul you look good at 
everything you do 
come watch my tennis game sometime newman said laughing 
i really did want to play tennis really badly i was awful 
i quit playing tennis then i went back to it in about a year 
i served the ball and the other guy hit it back to me i jiggled 
my feet and it sounded like a typewriter all these feet running 
around looking for a position of assurance there were two feet 
down there and it sounded like a stampede or like i was tap 
dancing it was uncertainty you dont understand that until you 
see yourself doing it 
im not a natural at things for instance im a terrible 
dancer i have no gift for dancing i like to dance with joanne 
but shes the only one that will tolerate me 
his schedule is jetset but more because of the multiple 
careers he is juggling than any need for glamour or celebrity 
i was never able to delegate responsibility and i do have a 
full plate newman said the thing you dont realize is 
somebody sends you a script as a friend and all of a sudden 
youre devoting five days and taking 20 pages of notes there goes 
the whole damn week 
ive got a script now that the chances of my doing are 
probably one in 20 but you spend the time 
will newman who remains in shape by running and working out on 
a stationary bike stay around racing for a while 
i have never made a plan about anything in my life and i dont 
see it starting to happen now he said i still enjoy racing 
i dont enjoy going as slow as im going but i still enjoy the 
competition 
among the people that newman has introduced to his adopted sport 
is tom cruise his costar in the 1987 film the color of money 
cruise became so enamored of auto racing he initiated and starred 
in days of thunder a movie about stock car racing 
newman politely refused to critique the movie but he did say 
i think it will be very good for racing 
asked if he thinks a great movie has yet been made about auto 
racing newman replied im not one to honk my own horn but 
winning it seems to me may have been the best movie about 
racing 
not because the racing footage was the best or anything but 
because the people integrated into the racing and usually you 
find that people are inserted or transplanted on top of or glued 
to the story 
great movies ultimately have to be about people

july 19 1989 30 minutes before crash radio call from sioux 
city iowa air traffic control to united airlines pilot united 
232 say souls on board and fuel remaining 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
capt alfred c haynes his doomed jetliner wallowing all over 
the iowa sky responded to an air traffic controller in the 
timehonored jargon of his aviation fraternity there were 296 
souls on board including his own 
at 359 cdt on a sweltering wednesday afternoon last july 19 
they all rode a 168ton flying brick down into a cornfield at 200 
miles an hour in the flame and dust unleashed when the dc10 
cartwheeled out of control 112 of the souls on board united 
airlines flight 232 were lost 
but 184 survived and as they prepare to return to sioux city 
for a memorial service thursday they struggle with unanswerable 
questions about life and death guilt nightmares physical 
injuries that may never heal strained relationships with people 
they love and memories that deny them a single good nights sleep 
they shake at some of lifes simplest events afraid that a 
highway bridge might fall on them frightened by the sound and 
smoky smell of a childs cap gun convinced that a washing machine 
has an electrical short that will cause a fire 
mary kahl couldnt feel comfortable at work for six months paul 
olivier like many other survivors wont fly on a dc10 william 
robertson drew up a list of accomplishments and things he wants to 
do in life jerry schemmel quit his job too many reminders rod 
vetter fears driving into downtown chicago what if a car jumps a 
guardrail into his lane 
my life is never going to be the same says upton rehnberg 
53 
they question why they lived when so many others died they 
meet in groups to grieve they call each other at 3 am to sob 
they savor a unique joy with the coming of new mornings the sight 
of sunsets their very survival is a shared miracle 
on the plane as we were going down it didnt matter how rich 
or how poor you were what color you were or what your religion 
was where you came from or where you were going says garry 
priest 24 of denver we all drew strength from each other we 
were all in it together as the plane crashed everybody was 
special 
the dc10 was headed to chicago from denver when it attempted an 
emergency landing at the sioux gateway airport the jet flipped 
once and burst into flames fortyfive minutes before impact the 
crew had lost all steering control when the tail engine shattered 
spewing out titanium fan blades and chunks of metal that severed 
hydraulic lines 
many victims were trapped in the charred fuselage some dazed 
and burned walked or crawled to safety others were found in 
4foothigh corn still buckled in seat belts 
dozens of survivors will gather thursday to pay tribute to 
haynes crew and to the rescuers and townsfolk who opened their 
hearts and their homes to them 
though each has a unique memory of that terrible day that bonded 
them for life theyre all amazed they are alive and wonder why

rod vetter a 40yearold former navy flyer who logged more than 
300000 miles with united before the crash now hesitates before 
commiting to a business trip even everyday trips downtown can be a 
strain 
i have a fear of things falling and things happening that are 
out of my control he says 
i never had the fear driving on the interstate of a bridge 
collapsing when i was driving underneath it i have a fear driving 
into downtown chicago wondering what if a car jumps the 
guardrail and goes into my lane just weird things like that 
vetter still thinks of that day frequently 
theres a lot of things that key in the thought of the crash 
whether its black smoke loud noise screeching brakes the smell 
of burning plastic says vetter who owns an importexport 
electronics company in the chicago suburb of arlington heights 
some people are saying they are not letting it out of their 
minds maybe one years time is not enough time maybe it will 
take 10 years to get back to a rational view of life its not

couldnt breathe thats the worst it has been i have to force 
myself to get on a plane 
olivier was thrown out of flight 232 on impact and though he 
remembers almost nothing between then and the hospital the moments 
before the crash remain hauntingly vivid

my job says mrs kahl a teacher who with her husband james 
and son jimmy 15 all survived they live in north huntingdon pa 
her son refuses to talk about the crash 
i still think we have some problems looming here she says 
she too has had trouble discussing it 
its hard to go back and think about what happened to all 
those people we are the lucky ones we dont have the physical 
scars to deal with there are a lot of people out there with a lot 
more pain than what were suffering 
every time i hear about a plane crashing or a plane in trouble

despite a modest rebound in business last month analysts say 
retailers felt squeezed because consumers have been losing 
confidence in their financial wellbeing and have grown more 
cautious about spending 
several of the nations largest retailers on thursday reported 
better june sales than mays disappointing tallies price markdowns 
boosted buying at some stores but sluggish economic conditions 
continued to restrain overall retail sales growth 
people no longer whip out their plastic cards for anything 
that catches their fancy said kurt barnard a consultant and 
publisher of a retail industry newsletter 
jeffrey edelman of the investment house barclays dezoete wedd 
agreed saying i think we are witnessing a gradual slowing in 
the consumer sector 
weakness in employment and income growth combined with heavy 
debt loads have made shoppers reluctant to spend freely 
especially when considering purchases of expensive longlasting 
merchandise 
in an indication that the federal reserve board is worried about 
the economys prospects chairman alan greenspan suggested thursday 
the central bank might nudge interest rates lower 
greenspan told the senate banking committee that slow money 
supply growth and increasing commercial interest rates indicate 
that credit conditions may be tightening independent of central 
bank action 
if that is in fact the case it could have undesirable effects 
on the economy that the federal reserve would have to consider 
offsetting using monetary policy he said 
an index compiled by barclays dezoete wedd measuring sales at 
stores open at least a year owned by 22 nationwide retailers rose 
75 percent in june up from 5 percent in may 
but edelman explained that the percentage change overstated the 
actual improvement 
a pickup in sales at sears roebuck and co the nations 
biggest retailer heavily influenced the index which is weighted 
after a barely perceptible 09 percent increase in samestore sales 
in may sears posted a june gain of 35 percent the june figure 
was still unimpressive however 
samestore gains comparing only sales at stores open a year or 
longer give a more accurate reading of a retailers performance 
new stores typically attract extra shoppers who dont return month 
after month 
retailers who slashed prices to unload slowmoving summer 
clothes also lifted the industry average 
the promotional activity and markdowns which reduce the amount 
of money retailers receive for goods are expected to impair the 
industrys profitability 
second quarter profits are going to be under pressure said 
edelman were not looking at disaster but were looking at some 
deterioration 
most retailers havent had to slash prices drastically or resort 
to unplanned acrosstheboard clearances because they were carrying 
fairly lean inventories of summer goods but markdowns have been 
more prevalent than the industry anticipated when the season began 
analysts said 
several discounters did much better than the industry average 
to some degree lower price discount operators such as 
target walmart and k mart are doing better than the general 
industry indicative of an extremely costconscious consumer 
said jeffrey feiner of merrill lynch amp co 
walmart stores inc a bentonville arkbased nationwide chain 
that is the countrys thirdlargest retailer said its june sales 
soared 28 percent sales at walmarts open a year or longer grew 14 
percent 
target the discount store division of minneapolisbased 
retailer dayton hudson corp posted a 14 percent gain in total 
sales and an 8 percent gain in its samestore sales 
in a comparision that illustrates the uneven performance among 
retailers dayton hudsons department stores had a samestore sales 
increase of only 1 percent 
among the big general merchandisers reporting thursday 
sears said its sales in the five weeks ended july 7 rose 37 
percent sales at chicagobased sears stores open at least a year 
edged up 35 percent 
k mart corp the second largest retailer with headquarters in 
troy mich said its sales in the five weeks ended july 4 rose 
137 percent while its samestore sales grew 43 percent 
among big department store operators 
jc penney co based in dallas said its june sales rose 53 
percent on a comparable store basis sales were up 41 percent 
may department stores co based in st louis reported a total 
june sales gain of 8 percent while comparable store sales rose 32 
percent gain 
among nationwide apparel chains 
the limited inc based in columbus ohio posted a 15 percent 
increase in total june sales samestore sales rose 5 percent 
the gap inc based in san francisco said its total june sales 
surged 31 percent while its samestore sales increased 24 percent

treasury secretary nicholas brady says he will 
oppose further reductions of the commodity futures trading 
commissions powers if congress passes legislation stripping the 
agencys authority over stockindex futures 
brady offered the olive branch at a senate committee hearing 
thursday on the bush administrations plan to transfer control over 
stockindex futures to the rival securities and exchange commission 
one futures industry official said he saw bradys remarks as an 
indication that the secretary thinks hes losing in the race to 
win senate approval 
i will oppose more sweeping changes to the cftc authority if 
the administrations bill passes in its present form brady told 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee 
but outside the hearing when asked what he would do if congress 
doesnt pass the bill brady said i think it will pass 
a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange andrew yemma 
declined comment but noted that in the past the merc has favored 
merging the sec and cftc over stripping the futures regulator of 
some of its authority 
at the chicago board of trade spokesman michael oconnell also 
declined comment on the specifics of bradys proposal but restated 
the bots position that we are against the proposed legislation 
and stand by the cftc as the regulatory body that should oversee 
all futures markets 
we are opposed to anything that weakens the cftc said john 
damgard president of the washingtonbased futures industry 
association 
although he hadnt seen bradys statement damgard who was in 
chicago to give a speech noted i think theres a sense on 
bradys part that hes losing if this went to a vote right now 
were pretty confident we would take the day on an up or down 
vote 
stockindex futures often used in program trading strategies by 
large institutional investors such as pension funds allow 
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without 
having to buy the underlying stocks 
the cftc and the futures industry oppose the administration 
bill saying it would cripple the agencys ability to regulate 
other futures products while drying up market liquidity and driving 
business out of the country 
but the sec and the treasury department argue the move is 
necessary to curb wild price swings in the stock markets arising 
out of price differences between the futures and securities markets 
stocks and stockindex futures are one market linked together 
by electronics said brady who first advanced that opinion while 
heading a presidential task force that investigated the 1987 stock 
market crash 
he noted that in the 42 years between 1940 and 1982 when stock 
index futures first began trading there were only three instances 
when the dow jones industrial average declined by more than 6 
percent while there have been four instances since the 1987 crash 
in an apparent attempt to allay concerns that the bill is the 
first step toward a complete dismantling of the cftc which oversees 
the futures industry brady said the administrations proposal is 
not the proverbial camels nose under the tent 
the way the markets are now functioning makes no further 
shifts in regulatory jurisdiction necessary not treasury bond 
futures to the sec not a full merger of the sec and cftc he 
said 
he urged passage of the bill to prevent further market 
disruptions 
noting that debate on the bill would lead to a political 
bloodletting sen christopher dodd dconn complained that 
the administration should have settled the dispute 
instead we find ourselves acting as a referee between the sec 
and the cftc which he described as two agencies acting like 
children

federal securities regulators are exploring 
plans for a financial warning system to head off potential troubles 
at big brokerage firms like those that sank drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
the securities and exchange commission voted thursday to seek 
public comment on proposed changes in the net capital rule 
that rule requires brokerdealers to maintain minimum amounts of 
cash and assets easily converted into cash to offset the risk of 
the securities they trade 
this is not part of a process in which the commission is 
seeking to micromanage or secondguess the management of a either 
brokerdealer or its parent sec chairman richard c breeden said 
this is more in the nature of what i would characterize as a 
smoke alarm a smoke detector he said this is more or less a 
corporate equivalent of that 
last februarys sudden collapse of the parent company of junk 
bond giant drexel has raised concerns that regulators arent 
getting enough advance notice when the parents of wall street firms 
withdraw large amounts from capital reserves 
while financially sound itself drexels brokerage business was 
a victim of money woes at its parent drexel burnham lambert group 
inc dbl group filed for bankruptcy court protection after 
defaulting on 100 million in shortterm debt the sec and the new 
york stock exchange refused to allow it to draw down cash from the 
brokerage to repay its debt 
breeden said the intent of the rule change to give us a chance 
to make a quick review of whether a sudden and really enormous in 
proportion to total capital movement of capital is due to 
something thats a planned event or due to striking an iceberg 
richard g ketchum director of the secs market regulation 
division said there are legitimate reasons like a restructuring 
for a parent company to withdraw large amounts of capital 
the rule change he said is in reaction to situations like 
drexel where the parent company was having major financing 
problems 
he and other sec officials said their task would be easier by 
pending legislation that would give them access to the financial 
health of the parent holding companies of broker dealers 
the proposed rules changes must be reviewed and possibly 
reworked before the commission can vote on fial passage 
the proposal would require brokerdealers to give the sec two 
days notice before withdrawing net capital beyond a prescribed 
amount in excess of 20 percent over a 30day period or 30 percent 
within a 90day period 
current rules do not set a time limit for firms to report 
capital problems to the sec although they must file periodic 
disclosure statements firms are required to maintain net capital 
equalling at least 5 percent of customerrelated receivables and 
below 2 percent they must cease operations 
the proposed rule change also would give the sec authority to 
stop further capital transfers if it determines the result would 
put the firm in financial jeopardy said ketchum 
in addition the change would upgrade the standard for limiting 
capital withdrawals the standard now is tied to the value of 
customer obligations

judging from its folksy radio ads and cutrate 
conveniences motel 6 might be the last place to expect to find the 
french 
parisbased accor sa said thursday it had agreed to pay 13 
billion in cash for motel 6 lp in a deal that would make accor the 
worlds budget motel leader 
analysts said the timing of the proposal was somewhat 
surprising given the generally weak environment for both real 
estate and financing but accor said it already has arranged 
financing for the buyout 
securities analyst william s fellows of montgomery securities 
in san francisco noted that budget chains often benefit during 
economic downturns as travelers try to cut costs by choosing less 
expensive lodging 
motel 6 might lose some customers but you have other people 
trading down from midpriced levels he said 
accor already owns more than 850 hotels and 3000 restaurants in 
60 countries including the growing 120hotel formula 1 budget 
chain in europe its target has been to own 2000 budget hotels 
and buying motel 6 with 554 motels would be a big step toward that 
goal 
motel 6 has carved out a profitable market niche for itself by 
emphasizing its low cost rooms average about 27 a night and 
nofrills ambience its radio ads end with the signature well 
leave the light on for you 
the company estimated it would have operating income of 220 
million on revenue of 475 million this year 
the deal appears to signal another hefty return for the buyout 
specialists kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which led a group that 
bought the motel 6 chain for about 880 million in 1985 and kept a 
controlling interest after the company went public a year later 
under the terms of the proposal accor said it had agreed to 
begin a tender offer of 2250 per share in cash for the more than 
55 million outstanding motel 6 partnership units payments for 
preferred stock make up the balance 
an affiliate of kohlberg kravis owns more than 50 percent of 
motel 6 and the companies said it has agreed to tender its holdings 
under the offer 
the deal was announced after the stock market closed motel 6 
units rose 262 a share to 1925 on volume of 15 million shares 
in trading on the new york stock exchange 
paul dubrule and gerard pelisson cochairmen of accor said the 
deal will help their company become the worlds preeminent budget 
hotel company they said motel 6 chief executive joseph w mccarthy 
and his management team would stay on and motel 6 headquarters 
would remain in dallas 
the founding partners of kohlberg kravis henry r kravis and 
george r roberts said the deal made sense for both sides 
it is appropriate at this time five years after we began the 
process of transforming motel 6 into a dynamic modernized and 
aggressive economy lodging company that it become part of a global 
lodging company with even greater resources and potential they 
said in a statement 
kohlberg kravis and its partners acquired motel 6 from city 
investing co in 1985 the company was converted into a publicly 
traded limited master partnership in 1986 with units offered at 
1350 a share 
a source close to the firm said investors who bought shares at 
that time will have received over 27 per unit for their investment 
by the time the accor deal closes a 215 percernt compounded 
annual rate of return counting both the amount of the tender and 
the 463 a share in cash dividends already paid 
the source said those who invested in the original buyout did 
even better a 38 percent compounded annual rate of return on a 
125 million equity investment 
when kohlberg bought it in 1985 motel 6 had 378 motels with 
42279 rooms and 7000 employees the chain has since grown to 554 
motels 63765 rooms and more than 11500 employees 
accor said the deal will makke it the worlds largest owner and 
operator of hotel rooms with more than 160000 rooms worldwide 
its properties include sofitel a luxury chain novotel and 
mercure aimed at business travelers and ibisurbis moderately 
priced chains 
accor estimated it will earn nearly 150 million this year on 
sales of more than 4 billion

in an unusual case testing whether federal 
labor laws apply to us subsidiaries overseas a south korean 
union is suing an american manufacturer of cable television 
components for more than 1 million in back wages 
a south korean union sued pico products inc in us district 
court on thursday alleging breach of contract for shutting down 
its south korean factory and withholding more than 1 million in 
wages from workers 
an attorney for the union said the lawsuit was the first in 
federal court by foreign workers seeking to settle a labor 
disagreement 
the lawsuit accuses pico based in liverpool ny of suddenly 
closing its pico korea ltd factory in buchun city in february 1989 
to avoid compliance with a collective bargaining agreement 
the union is seeking back wages and severance it claims are owed 
to 294 workers employed by pico korea a wholly owned subsidiary of 
pico 
frank e deale legal director of the center for constitutional 
rights in new york city which is representing the south korean 
union said the lawsuit was filed on the basis of two federal laws 
they are the labor management relations act which gives federal 
courts jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements and 
the 1988 worker adjustment retraining and notification act which 
entitles all workers employed by american corporations to 60day 
notice of plant closings 
deale said the lawsuit would test whether that law can apply to 
employees of a us corporation who work abroad 
pico chairman bernard hitchcock repeated claims that union 
representatives are terrorists who kidnapped a company 
management team ransacked the factory and seized its contents and 
extorted unreasonable contract concessions 
they ripped us off for 2 million and stole the company im 
through with these people were now in court and im happy with 
that hitchcock said 
during their threemonth stay in the united states the union 
leaders and a growing number of supporters have picketed picos 
headquarters regularly 
last weekend they protested outside hitchcocks home in 
syracuse hitchcock responded by standing on his roof and dousing 
the demonstrators with water from a garden hose 
jum soon yoo president of the south korean union and a dozen 
other supporters ended a weeklong hunger strike with the filing of 
the lawsuit 
yoo and two other union leaders came to the united states in 
april to get hitchcock to negotiate a settlement after failing to 
resolve the dispute in their homeland hitchcock has refused to 
negotiate with the union 
yoo said the union brought the lawsuit because the south korean 
and american governments were ignoring the crimes of 
multinational firms against third world workers 
the union charged that pico korea took advantage of its status 
as a foreign firm and enjoyed tax breaks and other benefits offered 
by the south korean government 
the company grew rapidly after it opened in march 1983 the 
workers mobilized in june 1988 to form a union in response to what 
they called unsafe working conditions and subminimum wages 
the union and company reached a labor accord in november 1988 
that excluded the issue of wages which was to be settled through 
future talks according to the lawsuit 
but before those talks could begin hitchcock fired pico koreas 
top officers and ordered the plant shut down the lawsuit alleged 
union members admitted seizing the plant on feb 28 1989 and 
refusing to allow shipment of finished products but said they did 
so to force negotiations

industrialist armand hammer methodically 
defrauded his wife frances by deceiving her about her rights to 
property amassed during 33 years of marriage her sole heir 
contends in a 700 million damages lawsuit 
frances hammer died in december leaving her estate to her 
niece joan weiss mrs weiss husband robert weiss was named 
executor and brought the lawsuit which also seeks unspecified 
punitive damages 
among other things the lawsuit says mrs hammer was tricked 
into signing away her interest of at least 50 percent in hammers 
art collection hammer is building a new museum to house the 
collection estimated to be worth up to 450 million 
but the lawsuit seeks to have mrs hammers portion of the art 
returned and a freeze put on other contested property until its 
ownership can be sorted out in court 
hammer 92 the occidental petroleum corp chairman known for 
private world peace crusades and contributions to cancer research 
declined to comment on the lawsuit through a spokesman 
but interviewed by reporters in april after the companys annual 
meeting hammer said his third wife the former frances tolman 
always wanted to keep her estate separate from me 
but he seemed to foresee that a lawsuit would be filed it is 
a matter that will be litigated i suppose hammer said 
by challenging his sole ownership of the art the complaint 
further clouds the future of hammers museum being built beside 
occidentals los angeles headquarters lawsuits filed by 
shareholders already contend hammer is squandering 100 million in 
occidental funds on a project designed for his own glory 
the lawsuit filed in state court in los angeles says frances 
hammer was a multimillionaire widow when the couple married in 
1956 by contrast hammers art gallery and distilling businesses 
were struggling and his income from them was less than his alimony 
to two former wives it says 
the lawsuit claims that using his wifes fortune as a bankroll 
hammer invested in occidental building it from a company with less 
than 80000 in assets to one of the biggest oil concerns in the 
country 
it says much of hammers vast fortune also was built from money 
his wife brought to the marriage hammer borrowed funds at 2 
percent for speculative ventures and often failed to make interest 
payments to her it says when he did repay her it was with money 
that was their joint property the lawsuit contends 
hammer allowed his wife no control over their property most of 
which should have been jointly held under california law according 
to the lawsuit 
for example almost all of the occidental stock acquired by 
the hammers was held in armand hammers name the document says 
similarly armand hammer exercised complete control over the 
many millions of dollars in salary and dividends paid to him by 
occidental using that money for his own selfish interests and 
purposes including acquiring a vast art collection and making 
numerous gifts of community property that were intended primarily 
for his selfaggrandizement it says 
hammer tricked his wife into signing over her interests in the 
art collection occidental stock and other property according to 
the lawsuit it seeks to nullify those agreements 
it also claims mrs hammer was due at least a half interest in 
much of the property hammer has contended his wife understood 
clearly what she was doing willingly signing the agreements to 
demonstrate there was no community property 
the 18count suit filed wednesday alleges fraud legal 
malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty it accuses the chicago 
law firm of lewis overbeck and furman of failing to provide 
adequate financial advice to mrs hammer a longtime client 
david j creagan jr a partner in the law firm which also is 
named as a defendant said he hadnt seen the complaint and 
couldnt comment on its specifics but he denied wrongdoing in 
dealing with mrs hammer 
all i can say is that we fairly represented her interests 
during the time we had the privilege of doing so creagan said 
also named as defendants are occidental the armand hammer 
foundation and the armand hammer museum of art and cultural 
center where hammers art collection is to be housed 
occidental spokesman roger gillott said neither hammer nor 
officials of the trust and museum would have any comment on the 
lawsuit 
of the 700 million in damages a total of 400 million is 
sought from hammer and the law firm and another 300 million from 
the foundation museum and oil company combined

a federal jury believed the testimony of ivan 
boesky at least in part against former stock speculator john a 
mulheren jr despite courtoom attacks on the admitted inside 
trader securities experts said 
jurors in federal court in manhattan convicted mulheren of four 
counts of conspiracy and stock manipulation stemming from dealings 
with boesky in 1985 but failed to reached a verdict on 26 other 
counts 
us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum dismissed the panel 
and declared a mistrial on the undecided charges thursday after 
nine days of deliberations failed to yield a verdict 
the conviction of the flamboyant mulheren on the four counts 
returned tuesday marked another victory for the government 
juries have returned guilty verdicts against the principal 
defendants in all but one of about a dozen cases in prosecutors 
fouryear crackdown on wall street fraud many defendants have 
pleaded guilty rather than face trial 
mulherens conviction also followed another pattern securities 
experts said in that the jury convicted on charges that contained 
a clear victim of fraud in this case involving the manipulation of 
gulf amp western inc stock 
they appeared stymied however on more technical allegations of 
stock parking a violation that before the recent wave of cases 
typically was prosecuted as a civil rather than criminal violation 
prosecutors had charged mulheren bought 75000 gulf amp western 
shares at boeskys behest driving the stock to 45 a share the 
price at which boesky wanted to sell about 35 million shares back 
to the company 
the jury was hung up on charges that mulheren secretly held 
large blocks of stock to help boesky evade taxes and federal 
securities disclosure laws 
the jury obviously believed boesky on the most central 
transaction said john c coffee jr a securities law professor 
at columbia university 
they convicted on on the story that had the clearest motive 
and clearest sense of injury coffee said gulf and western you 
can understand there is a victim there who has been defrauded 
the company paid too much 
stock parking is more of a regulatory crime he said 
parking refers to the illegal practice of disguising ownership of 
securities to avoid federal reporting requirements 
mulheren 41 was an aggressive and successful trader of stocks 
of companies targeted for takeover before he was implicated in 1988 
in the governments fraud investigation by boesky a former friend 
and associate 
his trial in federal court in manhattan was marked by boeskys 
first public testimony under his settlement with investigators 
boesky spent two years in prison and paid 100 million in penalties 
to settle insider trading charges 
defense attorney thomas puccios main tactic was to try to 
discredit boesky as a repeat liar who was motivated to say anything 
to fulfill his promise to assist federal authorities in exchange 
for leniency in his summation puccio called boesky a pile of 
human garbage 
after the mistrial mulheren joked with supporters reflecting a 
casual demeanor that was his trademark on wall street and in court 
mulheren has said he went to trial unlike others implicated by 
boesky in wrongdoing as a matter of principle 
lots of money spent and no answer given he said 
prosecutors said they could not immediately comment on whether 
they planned to retry mulheren on the oustanding counts of 
securities fraud mail fraud and recordkeeping violations 
were very satisfied with the verdict assistant us 
attorney scott gilbert said 
cedarbaum scheduled an oct 5 sentencing for the four counts on 
which mulheren was convicted he faces up to five years in prison 
and a 250000 fine on each count 
puccio said he planned to appeal the verdict 
codefendant leonard destefano 34 a former trader at 
mulherens defunct firm jamie securities was acquitted of all 
conspiracy and recordkeeping violations charges brought against 
him

federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspans suggestion that interest rates will head lower couldnt 
come at a better time for president bush 
in a rare public disclosure of the central banks intentions 
greenspan told the senate banking committee on thursday the fed may 
have to nudge rates down in response to mounting evidence that 
banks are being stingier with loans 
that was a sharp reversal from his assessment only three weeks 
ago when he said the lending squeeze hadnt yet developed into a 
broadbased credit crunch affecting the national economy 
whatever the reason the shift in central bank policy is sure to 
please the president who has been pushing for lower interest rates 
for months 
the administration needs lower rates to counteract the dampening 
effect on the economy if congress and the white house lower 
spending and raise taxes as part of a budget deficit reduction pact 
a few days before the central banks midyear policy review on 
july 2 and 3 treasury secretary nicholas f brady urged it not to 
wait for a budget agreement before cutting rates 
bush mentioned the subject as recently as wednesday in a news 
conference in houston greenspan met earlier this week with worried 
senate republicans 
business owners have been saying since last winter that banks 
have tightened lending standards in response to the savings and 
loan crisis a softer economy and weakening real estate markets 
greenspan said the first statistical evidence backing their 
contention may be emerging he pointed to slow growth in the money 
supply and an increase in average interest rates on commercial 
loans 
if that is in fact the case it could have undesirable effects 
on the economy that the federal reserve would have to consider 
offsetting using monetary policy he said 
such a shift would produce a very modest change in the level 
of the federal funds rate the key rate banks charge among 
themselves for overnight loans he said 
stock and bond markets rallied after greenspans comments the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 3713 to 296980 
a record high 
it is rare for the central bank chairman to so strongly signal 
the future direction of interest rates usually he declines comment 
on the subject or uses deliberately ambiguous language 
i cant remember any fed chairman ever doing something like 
this said economist michael k evans a washingtonbased 
consultant in my recollection this is an absolute first 
evans pointed out that greenspans fouryear term as chairman 
expires in 13 months 
i guess hes scared for his life the implied threat from 
the administration is hey kid if you want your job play ball 
nobodys as crude as that but thats what it amounts to he said 
in response to a question about political pressure from sen 
timothy wirth dcolo greenspan said the federal reserve welcomed 
comments from the administration or anyone else who can supply new 
insight but he said members of the fed make their decisions 
independently 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co inc a 
government securities dealer in new york said greenspan may indeed 
be feeling political heat but he said he believes the chairmans 
concern about the credit crunch is genuine 
what greenspan is saying is if i dont do something now it 
could make what is already a very soft economy worse jones said 
many analysts believe it may already be too late to give the 
economy the kind of boost the white house wants to bolster 
republican chances in the november congressional elections a 
change in monetary policy can take as long as six months to ripple 
through the economy 
jones said he expects the fed to cut rates by late july 
virtually announcing the move in advance allows greenspan to focus 
attention on the reasons he prefers to highlight and shift 
attention from other reasons he said 
the fed wants to link this easing to the credit crunch and not 
to any political factors he said

not since congress declared war on drugs have 
lawmakers found such a tempting target democrats and republicans 
now are raining fire on a common target taxdodging foreign 
corporations 
what we have here is the granddaddy of tax avoidance rep 
byron l dorgan dnd said 
lawmakers see big bucks at stake money that could be used to 
cut the budget deficit without imposing on individuals some 
members of congress insist the government is being cheated of as 
much as 50 billion a year although bush administration officials 
are skeptical 
whatever the figure the prospect of reining in bigtime cheats 
was enough to unite such diverse politicians as house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo sen jesse helms rnc and rep 
duncan hunter of california chairman of the house republican 
research committee 
before we raise taxes gephardt told the house ways and 
means oversight subcommittee thursday we should look at the 
profitable operations of foreigncontrolled corporations that dont 
pay any at all 
hunter released a list of japanese companies compiled from 
newspaper reports that he said are being investigated by the 
internal revenue service on suspicion their us subsidiaries have 
underpaid the list included such wellknown giants as sony 
hitachi toshiba nissan toyota yamaha and matsushita panasonic 
american citizens who conspire to defraud the government of 
large amounts of tax money stand a good chance of going to jail 
hunter said the same should be true of any foreigner who takes 
advantage of our open market but defrauds the american government 
of tax money 
the irs told the subcommittee earlier in the week that in 1987 
the nearly 45000 foreigncontrolled us corporations had receipts 
totaling 686 billion and paid income tax of only 066 percent of 
that total usowned companies paid a 104 percent rate 
for nine months the subcommittee has been investigating 36 
foreigncontrolled subsidiaries and found that over a 10year 
period most of them paid little or no us income tax 
the chief means of avoiding tax was through transfer 
pricing by manipulating prices at which it sells goods to its 
us subsidiaries a foreign company could significantly reduce the 
amount of taxable income subject to us tax 
i propose were talking about billions in the range of 30 
billion a year in tax avoidance rep jj pickle dtexas the 
subcommittee chairman said thursday other members put the figure 
at 50 billion

the federal communications commission says it 
needs to extend the current daytime ban on indecent radio and 
television programs to 24 hours to fully protect young eyes and 
ears 
the agency on thursday said children under 18 are in the 
viewinglistening audience 24 hours a day and that lock boxes or 
parental supervision are not enough to ensure that they dont watch 
indecent programs it said a roundtheclock indecency ban would 
not violate broadcasters first amendment rights 
the commission voted 50 to report its conclusions to a federal 
appeals court here that is considering a 24hour ban the fcc 
adopted under orders from congress in 1988 
the report will not change current fcc indecency regulations 
but it could play a major role in how the appeals court and 
ultimately the supreme court decides the issue 
commissioner ervin s duggan said the fcc had received 88000 
letters complaining about indecent programming he read from a 
letter from a mother who said it would take a superhuman effort 
for parents to monitor what their children hear on see on radio and 
tv at all times 
the people who write letters like that are not enemies of the 
constitution duggan said they are people like you and me 
they are parents 
opponents attacked the commissions action immediately 
what adults should be able to hear or see should not be 
determined by what childrens needs are said andrew j 
schwartzman an attorney for people for the american way one of 
the activist groups challenging the 24hour ban 
i think its preposterous said peggy charren of 
bostonbased action for childrens television the main plaintiff 
in the court challenge protecting children from indecency should 
not be the role of the fcc that should be the role of parents 
currently obscene material is banned from the airwaves at all 
times and indecent material from about 6 am to 8 pm 
the fcc defines indecent as language or material that depicts 
or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium sexual 
or excretory activities or organs 
the fcc under its new chairman alfred sikes has in the past 
year put the nations radio stations on notice it will not tolerate 
the broadcast of indecent programs before 8 pm it has fined 
several stations already for broadcasting sexually explicit 
material 
sikes said thursday that in seeking a 24hour ban the fcc 
simply was reflecting the will of congress and the american public 
weve received a huge amount of mail and it seems the 
public strongly supports the action were taking today he said 
fcc officials repeatedly refused to speculate on what types of 
tv programs could be considered indecent the commission in june 
1988 fined a kansas city mo tv station 2000 for showing an 
allegedly indecent film private lessons at 8 pm at that 
time the fcc had established an aftermidnight safe harbor for 
indecent programs 
however the fcc vacated the fine when the appeals court in july 
1988 ordered the commission to study the timeofday issue further 
in its report the fcc said a 24hour indecency ban promotes a 
compelling government interest and was narrowly tailored to 
serve that interest without infringing broadcasters first 
amendment rights 
the commission said it was guided by a 1989 supreme court ruling 
that used the compelling interestnarrowly tailored argument in 
deciding that the government had the right to regulate indecent 
telephone transmissions 
congress in 1988 ordered the fcc to adopt a roundtheclock ban 
on indecency and it did but broadcasters and freespeech groups 
challenged the rules and the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia in january 1989 stayed implementation of the 
24hour ban pending further review 
the court said the fcc could develop evidence supporting a 
24hour ban

consumer advocates and industry officials 
agree shoppers would find it easier to learn the nutrition content 
of nearly all foods in the grocery store under a new government 
proposal to overhaul food labeling 
shoppers would be able to tell at a glance the amount of 
saturted fat calories from fat cholesterol and fiber serving 
sizes would be standardized so nutrient comparisons would be more 
meaningful 
but this doesnt assure the proposals smooth sailing among the 
public or within the bush administration 
its a step in the right direction but its a long road and 
the question isnt what theyre proposing but whether theyll ever 
finalize it said ellen haas executive director of the consumer 
group public voice for food amp health policy 
past efforts by the food and drug administration to change the 
foodlabeling system stalled which prompted action in congress 
rep henry waxman dcalif and sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
are sponsoring bills that would accomplish many of the same things 
the regulation would 
on thursday health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
outlined the latest effort to make sweeping changes in the system 
to be published in 400 pages of the federal register next week 
the proposals would 
require nutrition labeling for most packaged foods as well as 
fresh produce and seafood 
require labels to include saturated fat calories from fat 
cholesterol and fiber 
establish standardized serving sizes for 159 food categories 
restrict use of the terms no cholesterol low 
cholesterol and reduced cholesterol 
food industry representatives applauded the effort and said 
they will continue pressing to have the regulations applied 
uniformly nationwide 
the issue held up announcement of the regulations late last 
month because of a disagreement within the administration 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the health and human services department wanted uniform rules 
but white house reportedly officials objected saying states should 
be allowed to build their own regulations onto the federal ones 
to get the proposed regulations published and begin the 
administrative rulemaking process the uniformity language was 
stripped from the proposal and the issue instead was posed as a 
question for comment 
without uniform labeling there will be consumer confusion and 
distribution chaos said c manly molpus president of the 
grocery manufacturers of america 
under the proposed regulation nutrition labels would have to 
appear on product packages for fresh produce and seafood 
nutrition information could be available at the point of purchase 
such as in brochures or on posters 
listing of the thiamin riboflavin and niacin now required 
would become optional and listing of protein would be required 
only for food intended for infants and very young children 
to be called cholesterol free a product would have to have 
less than two grams of saturated fat less than five grams of total 
fat and less than two milligrams of cholesterol a food meeting the 
targets on fat but with two to 20 milligrams of cholesterol could 
be called low cholesterol 
a manufacturer could claim a food had reduced cholesterol if 
its cholesterol was cut by at least 75 percent it could also make 
that claim if the reduction was compared with other foods on the 
market but the comparison would have to be explained on the label 
the axiom here is truth in labeling said acting fda 
commissioner james benson 
hhs set a 30day comment period on the cholesterol rule and said 
it could become final by the fall manufacturers would then have 
one year to comply 
a 120day comment period was set for the regulations on 
nutritional labeling intake references and serving size benson 
said he hoped a final regulation could be issued by next spring 
the industry would have a year to comply 
exemptions to the labeling rule would include restaurants 
bakeries cafeterias bitesize foods and foods that have less than 
40 calories per serving do not make a health claim and have no 
meaningful supply of nutrients

a novel deal called a debtfornature swap will 
pay for a 5 million conservation program in madagascar where 
destruction of exotic forests threatens wildlife found nowhere else 
among the forests inhabitants are 43 varieties of lemurs 
treedwelling human relatives that live only on madagascar an 
island off the southeast coast of africa 
eighty percent of their habitat has been wiped out 
washington dcbased conservation international which 
negotiated the debt swap has pledged to pay off 5 million of 
madagascars debt to commercial banks said spokesman roderic mast 
we consider madagascar to be one of the highest conservation 
priorities in the world mast said thursday 
a firstever combination of debt reduction and trade credits 
will enable the environmental group to get better than double value 
for the cash it pays 
madagascars end of the bargain is to begin a fiveyear 
conservation and protection program staffed by its own people under 
the direction of conservation international 
madagascar is an island about 40 percent larger than california 
it contains some of the worlds most threatened wild habitat 
eighty percent of madagascars forests have been lost to 
encroachment by poor farmers struggling to eke out a living the 
remaining forest contains 150000 to 200000 species of plants and 
animals about threequarters are found only in madagascar 
last year the world wildlife fund negotiated a 3 million 
debtfornature swap with madagascar africas first such 
agreement the first debtfornature swap was negotiated by 
conservation international in bolivia in july 1987 
the government of madagascar has shown its commitment to 
saving its own wildlife mast said theyre taking a real 
leadership role in terms of african countries in showing this 
strong commitment to preserving their natural heritage 
the new agreement is unusual for two reasons the united nations 
development program is considering providing much of the money the 
first time the un has joined in a debtfornature swap and the 
agreement may let madagascar reduce its debts to foreign companies 
as well as its commercial bank debt 
under the accord foreign companies that have sold goods to 
madagascar and havent been paid could be paid off in exchange for 
further government commitments to conservation 
conservation international officials are hoping that some 
companies will agree simply to forgive the debts in effect 
donating the money to the conservation effort in madagascar 
this is the first ever debtfornature swap that im aware of 
involving trade credits as well as bank debt said steven rubin 
conservation internationals director of business and legal 
affairs were effectively bringing private companies into the 
cause of ecosystem preservation in madagascar 
debtfornature swaps have appeared only in the last few years 
the legal and financial underpinnings of the swaps are complex but 
their intent is to get conservation groups more bang for the buck 
in this swap for example conservation international will use 
money it raises from the un or elsewhere to pay off portions of 
madagascars foreign debt and trade deficit at less than face value 
at current rates 1 million in debt can be paid off for about 
400000 banks are willing to accept less than what they are owed 
so they can close the books on their loans 
for each 1 million paid off the government agrees to use 1 
million worth of its own currency which banks generally wont 
accept as payment to finance conservation 
the result is that 400000 raised by an environmental group 
results in 1 million worth of madagascars currency spent on 
conservation

requiring child safety seats on airliners for 
infants instead of continuing to let parents hold them on their 
laps would cost more lives than it would save the federal aviation 
administration maintains 
the faa on thursday cited past experience to estimate that such 
a requirement would save only one childs life over the next decade 
but at an additional cost of 3 billion to families who fly 
while the chance of survival aboard an airplane may be 
slightly improved the costs associated with mandating the carriage 
of a child in a separate seat will divert a significant number of 
families from air travel to far less safe travel by 
automobile said associate faa administrator anthony j broderick 
however sponsors of house and senate bills that would require 
the faa to mandate child safety restraints on airliners attacked 
the study as specious and vowed to press ahead with their 
legislation 
its in the airlines economic interest to keep families 
flying sen christopher bond rmo told the house 
transportation committees aviation subcommittee and in order to 
do so i believe they will establish fares for infants that are 
reasonable 
infants under age 2 now may fly free by traveling on the laps of 
a parent or guardian all of the major airlines also allow infants 
to travel in safety seats attached to a regular seat at the reduced 
80 percent fare customarily charged for children between ages 2 and 
12 
testifying before a house subcommittee broderick said the study 
commissioned by the faa concluded that requiring safety seats for 
infants would increase their families average air fare by 31 
percent or 185 
those higher costs the study said would cause about 20 percent 
of the families now using airlines for longdistance trips to 
instead drive or stay at home which also would expose them to 
higher risks associated with increased local travel 
the increased auto traffic would produce at least nine 
additional highway deaths 52 serious injuries and more than 2300 
minor injuries the study said 
companion bills by bond in the senate and rep jim lightfoot 
riowa in the house to mandate the use of child safety seats on 
airliners are supported by the industrys chief trade organization 
the air transport association as well as airline unions and 
consumer safety groups 
ata vice president walter coleman said it would be foolish 
to think that the airlines would not discount ticket prices for the 
infant seats in an effort to keep their parents business 
the faa study estimated that measure would raise annual airline 
revenue by 80 million to 119 million depending on whether the 
carriers charge an 80 percent reduced fare for the toddlers seats 
or a 50 percent reduced fare 
the legislation was prompted by the crashlanding a year ago of 
a united airliners jet at sioux city iowa killing 112 aboard 
including a 23monthold child three other children under age 2 
were injured 
as the result of its investigation into that crash the national 
transportation safety board recommended to the faa in may that 
child safety seats be required for all children less than 40 pounds 
in weight and 3 feet 4 inches in height 
susan coughlin the boards vice chairman aid the faas policy 
of allowing infants to be held in an adults arms while everyone 
else must wear seat belts was a contradiction of basic safety 
principles 
the faa study said the death of the child in the sioux city 
crash was the only one of 10 infant deaths in aviation accidents 
over the past 12 years that could have been prevented by the use of 
a child safety seat 
of the 16 infant injuries in those accidents since 1978 only 
three to six of them would have been prevented by the use of child 
restraints the study said

collapsed attempts to negotiate a loan for its buyout of mgmua 
communications co 
time warner now is unlikely to participate in the planned 
purchase of mgmua and pathe is seeking new financial partners 
spokesman craig parsons said thursday 
the lawsuit seeking damages in excess of 500 million alleges 
breach of contract fraud libel interference with contractual 
relationship and unfair competition it was filed in state court in 
los angeles in response to time warners 100 million 
breachofcontract lawsuit against pathe filed june 29 
in april time warner had agreed to lend pathe 650 million 
half the 13 billion purchase price for mgmua 
time warner insisted that none of the rest of the money for the 
deal should be borrowed and that pathe a motion picture production 
company should come up with 450 million equity on its own 
time warners lawsuit also claimed pathe chairman giancarlo 
parretti misled time warner regarding the video and theatrical 
rights to certain films 
pathes attempted purchase of mgmua has been troubled since it 
was first announced in march time warners financial involvement 
was one of the few solid components in a hodgepodge financial

studio 
time warner and its subsidiaries also were to get a lien on the 
valuable united artists library as part of the deal as well as 
distribution rights to films from the pathe and mgmua studios

the planned 6 billion takeover of atlantabased 
contel the nations thirdlargest independent telephone company 
by no 1 gte corp will give gte a big boost in the cellular phone 
business at a good price an industry analyst says 
they are making a very wise move for the companys longterm 
future telecommunications analyst frederick moran of moran and 
associates in greenwich conn said of gte they are buying 
contel for less than half of what its worth 
we value contel at 81 to 87 a share if i were running 
contel i wouldnt have agreed to it 
in the deal announced thursday gte would exchange 127 shares 
of its common stock for each of contels 159 million shares that 
values contel stock at about 3778 a share at the thursday closing 
price of gte stock of 2975 down 125 
contel shares rose 725 on the news thursday to close at 3525 
in new york stock exchange trading 
moran said the deal raises the question of whether another 
company will step in and offer a higher price than gte has 
offered 
the merger which the companies described as tax free is 
subject to the approval of both companies stockholders and by 
regulatory agencies 
the merger would result in the countrys secondlargest cellular 
phone system operator after mccaw cellular communications inc and 
the nations largest localexchange telephone company 
in a joint announcement with contel gte chairman james l 
rocky johnson characterized the merger as a perfect 
combination of two great companies 
contel provides a broad range of telecommunications products and 
services for 1989 contel reported record earnings of 287 million 
or 180 a share up 4 percent from a year earlier on revenue of 
31 billion 
this merger will provide the critical mass and financial 
strength contel has sought in order to accelerate the many 
initiatives we have recently taken across a wide spectrum of 
ventures contel chairman charles wohlstetter said in the 
statement 
gte based in stamford conn is the nations largest 
independent operator of phone systems providing service to more 
than 14 million customers in 31 states it also provides cellular 
phone service in 34 metropolitan areas and operates a satellite 
communications network 
since deregulation much consolidation has occurred among 
smaller phone companies but this is the first deal of this size 
said theodore j moreau an analyst with robert w baird in 
milwaukee 
this may be the test to see how the regulators view this kind 
of deal he said 
in other telephone industry consolidations this year mccaw 
bought control of cellular phone operator lin broadcasting corp 
for 34 billion mci communications corp bought the long distance 
company telecom usa inc for 125 billion and gte said it would 
buy the cellular phone operations of providence journal co for 
710 million 
last month contel announced it wanted to sell contel office 
communications a division that provides shared telecommunications 
services for tenants of highrise office buildings this spring 
the company announced it was restructuring its telephone 
operations which provide 74 percent of revenues to eliminate 
about 600 jobs nationwide

retail sales bolstered by a big jump in 
department store sales shot up 05 percent in june posting the 
first increase in five months the government said today 
the commerce department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 
14782 billion last month up 784 million from the may sales 
level 
the june increase came after a string of three consecutive 
declines something that had not happened since 1981 during the 
last recession 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of total 
economic activity prolonged weakness in this area raises fears 
that the economy could be headed for a downturn 
the june rebound should lessen recession anxieties but analysts 
cautioned against reading too much into onemonths change 
especially given the fact that retail sales had been sluggish for 
most of this year 
this was the first increase since a big 28 percent increase in 
january after that gain retail sales showed no change in february 
and then fell 04 percent in march 1 percent in april and 06 
percent in may 
with job growth very weak this year consumer confidence about 
the future has slipped and resulted in spending cutbacks 
especially for bigticket items such as cars and appliances 
the june increase was led by a 28 percent rise in spending at 
department stores reflecting a rebound after a big 22 percent 
drop in may 
the 28 percent jump in department store sales was dramatic 
given the fact that sales in this sector had fallen for three 
months but analysts attributed part of the gain to price markdowns 
to encourage purchases of slowmoving summer clothes 
auto sales edged up a tiny 01 percent in june after being down 
02 percent in may weakness in auto sales has been a major factor 
contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this 
year 
sales at building material and hardware stores rose 13 percent 
after falling 02 percent in april 
bucking the upward trend in june sales at furniture and home 
furnishings stores plunged 19 percent they had been up a slight 
04 percent in may 
sales at grocery stores were up 03 percent while sales at 
gasoline stations climbed by 05 percent sales at drug stores were 
up 12 percent but spending at bars and restaurants fell 06 
percent in june

friday that the company is negotiating with unions to add special 
shifts at a number of its factories to help meet rising demand from 
east germany and elsewhere 
the auto making arm of daimlerbenz ag west germanys largest 
industrial concern is negotiating with the workers council and 
unions for permission to add weekend shifts 
the official said that an announcement could be made later

agreement has been reached he added that attempts to add weekend 
shifts in january were thwarted by the unions 
mercedesbenz had planned to build about 556000 passenger cars 
this year up from 542000 produced in 1989 but the spokesman said 
that rising demand from east germany western european markets and 
from japan has prompted the company to boost production goals for 
the year to 570000 
we would very much like to introduce special shifts the 
spokesman said in a telephone interview but this must be agreed 
upon with the workers councils 
the official said that demand from east germany in particular 
has been greater than expected he noted that mercedesbenz 
recently received an order for 500 new taxis for east germany to 
be delivered by the end of september 
but its not just east germany its the domestic market in 
general as well thats quite strong he said 
he added that sales in japan during the first half of the year 
were up by about 40 percent from a year earlier the companys goal 
for the us market is to maintain last years sales level when it 
sold about 75000 passenger cars the spokesman said 
mercedesbenz currently operates two shifts one between 6 am 
and 2 pm local time and the second shift between 2 pm and 10 
pm local time he said that it was unlikely night shifts would be

production cutbacks by 
two opec members should restore oil prices to the 18abarrel 
benchmark within days iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
said friday 
speaking to reporters at the end of a twoday visit to the 
united arab emirates he said production cuts by the united arab 
emirates and kuwait will drive the prices up before the next opec 
meeting in geneva switzerland on july 25 
at the meeting iran will request that the benchmark price be 
increased by 2 a barrel to 20 the minister said 
aqazadehs remarks reflect confidence that opec members would 
refrain from pumping too much oil which depresses prices oil 
produced by members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries was selling recently for 14 a barrel 
during his visit aqazadeh held talks with oil minister mana 
saeed otaiba 
were expecting prices to reach 18 a barrel by the time we 
meet in geneva and then we will propose an increase of 2 in the 
reference price said aqazadeh at abu dhabi airport 
uae is dropping its output by 400000 barrels per day and 
kuwait by 500000 barrels per day and this will lead to a price 
hike aqazadeh said 
oil prices have already traded above 18 this week on new york 
and other markets but opec determines its reference price by 
averaging the prices of seven separate crudes 
otaiba who also spoke at the airport while seeing his guest 
off said the uae output reduction will be effective as of the 
day 
there was no official comment on the cutback reports from 
kuwait another opec member that has been producing well beyond its 
quota of 15 million barrels a day 
opec offered the uae a quota of 15 million barrels a day at 
its last meeting in vienna in november but the uae rejected the 
figure as too low 
at that meeting the collective production ceiling at 22086 
million barrels a day within which the uaes output was 
calculated at only 1095 million barrels a day 
but opec production in june was estimated at 232 million 
barrels per day 
saudi arabia the worlds chief oil exporter and a leading opec 
member was expected to reciprocate for the efforts by the uae 
and kuwait to stabilize the oil market according to senior gulf 
oil executives in manama bahrain 
they said they expected the kingdom to demand that its 
production quota make up 2445 percent of opecs ceiling 
news of the planned production cutbacks surfaced in saudi arabia 
thursday night saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer described 
the moves as a historic crossroads for the 13member cartel 
he said the decisions followed highlevel contacts between king 
fahd and uae president sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan 
iran and iraq their economies battered by the gulf war have 
been lobbying for higher prices of crude oil both countries have 
been critical of kuwait and the uae for overproducing and 
causing a glut on the oil market

declining food and energy prices helped hold 
wholesale price inflation to a modest 02 percent in june despite 
a worrisome jump in the cost of other items the government said 
today 
the rise in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of the retail level followed a rise 
in may of 03 percent 
it brought wholesale inflation for the first half of 1990 to an 
annual rate of 37 percent compared with 48 percent for all of 
1989 
the number was about what economists anticipated however 
prices for items outside the volatile food and energy sectors 
jumped 06 percent in june the steepest incrase in a year and 
about double the expected rise 
analysts consider this socalled core rate a better 
indicator of underlying inflation pressures in the economy however 
the jump follows a string of five moderate rises of 03 percent or 
02 percent 
</TEXT>

another report today showed retail sales bolstered by a big 
jump in department store sales shot up 05 percent in june 
posting the first increase in five months 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration was pleased with the figures on both producer prices 
and retail sales 
inflation has been steadily declining since the first of the 
year confirming our conclusion that the january price increase was 
indeed temporary this is excellent news for the economy he said 
he said the rise in retail sales in june showed that the 
economy continues to grow but at a very moderate rate 
were hopeful that todays news on inflation and retail sales 
indicates a steadily growing economy in the month ahead he said 
the commerce department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 
14782 billion last month up 784 million from the may sales 
level the june increase came after a string of three consecutive 
declines something that had not happened since 1981 during the 
last recession 
wholesale prices rose for tobacco 32 percent passenger cars 
23 percent womens clothing 05 percent furniture 05 percent 
jewelry 09 percent newspapers 05 percent overthecounter 
drugs 08 percent and household flatware 23 percent 
tobacco prices are now 139 percent higher than a year ago 
automobile costs rose after months of generally flat or falling 
prices 
energy prices which skyrocketed 137 percent in january because 
of a severe cold snap have declined every month since they were 
down 09 percent in june after dropping 1 percent in may fuel oil 
fell 105 percent and gasoline was down 13 percent natural gas 
costs rose 04 percent 
food prices headed lower for the third time in four months they 
dropped 04 percent last month after a 06 percent increase in may 
prices for both fresh fruit and eggs jumped 67 percent and 
vegetable prices rose 25 percent but prices fell sharply for 
pasta 74 percent pork 34 percent chicken 58 percent and 
fish 147 percent 
the fairly stiff increase in prices excluding food and energy 
could put a crimp in federal reserve plans to lower interest rates 
the fed attempts to quell inflation by slowing demand with high 
interest rates 
on thursday federal reserve chairman alan greenspan strongly 
suggested that the central bank would cut rates to counter the 
dampening effects of an apparent pullback in bank lending 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1179 in june that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 cost 11790 last month 
up from 11430 a year earlier 
the inflation news was better at earlier stages of the 
production process with prices falling 02 percent for intermediate 
goods and 24 percent for crude goods excluding food and energy 
intermediate prices edged 01 percent lower and crude costs fell 
06 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be bread for 
finished goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

consumer prices have been rising faster than producer prices 
that is because half of the prices contributing to the consumer 
index are for services which are not measured directly by the 
wholesale index 
economist davd jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
government securities dealer said economic weakness has been most 
pronounced in the goodsproducing sector 
it has only recently spread to services where a stable 
unemployment rate near 53 percent has kept wages and thus the 
price of services high he said 
for the first five months of the year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 58 percent up from 46 percent for all 
12 months of last year 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university who 
conducts his own inflation surveys predicted that by the end of 
this year wholesale prices will have risen only 36 percent for 
the best performance in three years 
he forecast they would increase 39 percent in 1991 largely 
because depressed energy prices will start rising again 
underlying inflation appears to be drifting downward although 
the speed of downward drift remains slight ratajczak wrote in a 
recent newsletter

strong truck sales by the nations big three 
automakers pushed the sales rate for north americanmade vehicles 
up 1 percent in early july compared with the same period last year 
the companies said friday 
the increase comes on the heels of a 71percent rise in 
latejune sales by the big three the two increases both based on 
strong truck sales support speculation earlier this year that the 
auto industry will begin to pull out of its early 1990 slump 
sometime in the middle of the year 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
their combined car and truck sales averaged 33850 a day july 110 
this year compared with a daily average of 33504 last year 
a 63 percent rise in truck sales offset a 23 percent decline 
in car sales 
light truck sales by gm and ford during the period rose 182 
percent and 61 percent respectively truck sales by chrysler 
dropped 139 percent 
chrysler which has been struggling financially gets a large 
percentage of its vehicle profits from its minivans and jeeps both 
classified as light trucks 
drawing an accurate conclusion about a trend in the industry 
from two 10day sales periods is difficult industry observers 
prefer to see at least a months worth of sales figures before 
speculating about where the industry is heading 
despite the recent backtoback increases car and truck sales 
for the big three are lagging behind last year 
the companies said they sold an average 33061 vehicles a day so 
far this year compared with 35308 in the same period last year a 
64 percent decrease car sales were down 95 percent and truck 
sales were off 13 percent 
chrysler was the only one of the big three whose combined car 
and truck sales fell during early july the nations thirdlargest 
automaker reported a 163 percent drop in vehicle sales as the 
decline in truck sales combined with an 188 percent decrease in 
car sales 
so far this year sales of chryslers domestic cars and trucks 
were down 132 percent 
sales of gm vehicles in early july were running 67 percent 
ahead of last years pace car sales by the nations largest 
automaker were up 09 percent gms vehicle sales this year were 
down 31 percent from last year 
ford said a 04 percent decline in car sales combined with its 
higher light truck sales for a 22 percent increase in earlyjuly 
vehicle sales so far this year sales of fords north 
americanmade cars and trucks were down 73 percent from last year

the dow jones industrial average shattered the 
3000 level for the first time in history today as the stock market 
surged on a fresh wave of investor enthusiasm 
the nations bestknown barometer of wall street an index 
measuring the performance of 30 big american industrial companies 
moved up 31 points from thursdays close into 3000plus territory 
shortly after 130 pm est then receded back into the 2990range 
the average had risen nearly 79 points in the previous two 
sessions 
the catalyst for the latest advance came from federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who surprised the market thursday by 
saying the nations central bank was prepared to ease credit if 
necessary 
the remark signaled an increased likelihood of lower interest 
rates which would help boost corporate profits and dim the 
prospects of a recession bullish investors snapped up stocks on 
the news 
the dow average was created more than a century ago when the 
stock market was a fledgling operation on wall street and is 
considered the granddaddy of all stock averages although it no 
longer necessarily reflects the behavior of stocks in general 
it closed above 100 for the first time in january 1906 the 
average broke the 1000 barrier in november 1972 and the 2000 
barrier in january 1987 it has been flirting with the 3000 
barrier for several weeks

for the bond market this years second quarter 
turned out to be an unwelcome rerun of the first 
the bond investors association a nonprofit group that tracks 
bond defaults says 26 us corporations stopped making interest 
payments on bonds with a face value of 57 billion in the 
apriljune period 
that compares with 14 issuers who defaulted on an identical 
amount of bonds in the first quarter 
the default rate is almost twice the historic rate said 
richard lehmann president of the groupwe think thats basically 
because the quality of the debt that was put out from 85 to 89 
was vastly inferior to what was done before 
lehmann places the blame on junk bonds those highrisk 
highyield debt securities that were the rage during the takeover 
binge of the mid to late 1980s 
the junk bond market has all but dried up due to the demise 
earlier this year of drexel burnham lambert the wall street house 
that built its shortlived fortune by selling and tirelessly 
promoting junk issues 
but the junk bonds it pumped out in the 80s are coming home to 
roost or die as seems to be more the case all of the defaulted 
bonds in the second quarter were junk issues lehmann says 
among them were 19 billion in bonds sold by southland corp 
troubled owner of the 7eleven chain 652 million in bonds issued 
by equally troubled fellow convenience store operator circle k 
corp 705 million in bonds sold by farley inc for its 
underfunded takeover of textile giant west pointpepperell and 
637 million in western union corp bonds all were drexel clients 
also among major bond defaulters in the second quarter were 
troubled savings and loans which had issued junk as a lastditch 
attempt to stave off collapse 
among them were imperial corp of america a san diego thrift 
holding company with 342 million in bad bonds and centrust bank 
of miami at 315 million the bond investors association says 
lehmann said he doesnt expect bond defaults to ease anytime 
soon over the next three years he projects a total of 40 billion 
in corporate bond issues will stop making payments 
it should peak early next year and then start to decline but 
if the economy turns bad it could go on through next year he 
said last week in a telephone interview from his groups suburban 
miami headquarters 
had drexel survived and the junk market not collapsed many of 
these troubled junkfinanced deals from the past few years might 
have been able to restructure their debt and avoid default said 
david blitzer chief economist for standard amp poors corp a major 
credit rating agency 
drexels destruction left many junkdependent clients in the 
cold they found themselves without a link to the market 
blitzer said 
these companies also found closed doors elsewhere he said as 
banks became wary of highly leveraged deals when the real estate 
market soured and credit tightened 
lehmanns group said only 12 new junk bond issues totaling 17 
billion were sold in the second quarter compared with 93 issues 
totaling 156 billion in 1989s second quarter 
recently however some experts have said the junk bond market 
may not be all gloom and doom 
junk bonds have staged a rally of sorts in recent months and by 
some measures some of the bonds have provided better returns to 
investors than some investmentgrade issues 
the market received a boost last month when kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co the big new york investment group said it would 
inject 17 billion into rjr nabisco the food and tobacco company 
it took private last year 
the news ended speculation that rjr could become another 
troubled junk bond giant

on the chicago board of trade after the agriculture department 
lowered its projections for winter wheat production and corn and 
soybean stockpiles

will continue as the corn crop enters its critical pollination 
phase 
the markets focusing mostly on supply considerations right 
now and things are looking very very good said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc a brokers advisory service 
in chicago 
in a supplyanddemand report released after thursdays close 
the usda estimated soybean stocks for aug 31 the end of the 
198990 soybean marketing year at 275 million bushels down 20

mcdonnell douglas corps stock moved higher 
friday as rumors and speculation about the struggling defense 
contractors future continued to swirl 
the company denied rumors circulated in the financial markets 
and phoned into news organizations that it planned to sell its 
long beach calif subsidiary douglas aircraft co to japanese 
industrial giant mitsubishi group and that chairman john f 
mcdonnell would resign 
mcdonnell douglas has no plans to sell douglas aircraft to 
mitsubishi or to anyone else spokeswoman ellen lemondholman 
said friday the resignation of john mcdonnell theres no truth 
to that either 
on thursday the company denied rumors that it planned to file 
for bankruptcy court protection 
mcdonnell douglas stock was up 150 to 4512 a share in 
afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange 
the rumors have been multiplying as mcdonnell douglas prepares 
for what it calls substantial layoffs in an effort to cut expenses 
by 700 million and help bolster its sagging financial performance 
the uncertainty surrounding those layoffs and other cutbacks 
have kindled the rumors lemondholman said 
people are concerned for their jobs and what happens is that 
anything they hear they tell that to someone else and its that 
feeding process one rumor feeding off another she said its 
an unfortunate situation but if we knew how to control rumors 
then i guess a lot of people would want to talk to us to find out 
how to do that 
howard rubel who follows the company for the brokerage cj 
lawrence in new york said the rumors were helped partly by 
speculators who were betting on price movements in mcdonnell 
douglas stock 
basically speculators are playing games with each other 
rubel said its sort of amusing but its distracting too 
rubel said the rumors were in the realm of fantasy and 
guessed that the company was most likely to engage in layoffs among 
white collar workers in areas of the business that havent shown 
good returns 
lemondholman also denied a rumor heard by some analysts that 
mcdonnell douglas had scheduled a news conference for monday to 
announce specifics concerning the layoffs and cutbacks 
paul nisbet of prudentialbache securities said employees 
likely were the biggest source of rumors 
it starts at the water cooler and goes all over he said 
mcdonnell douglas officials blame the layoffs and other cutbacks 
on the companys weak financial performance at a time that it needs 
cash to invest in new programs 
mcdonnell douglas earned 2 million during its first quarter 
down 98 percent decline from a year earlier the drop stemmed 
mainly from huge losses at the douglas aircraft unit which 
primarily builds commercial jets 
the company the nations biggest defense contractor also faces 
an uncertain future in the defense business as the pentagon slashes 
spending 
while the company has not announced how many workers it plans to 
lay off analysts are predicting 10000 to 15000 layoffs on top of 
earlier job cuts of 4000 workers and 3000 contracted workers at 
douglas aircraft mcdonnell douglas now employs about 127000 
the company faces serious cost problems on three military 
programs the c17 cargo plane the a12 advanced tactical aircraft 
and the t45 goshawk trainer 
it also faces large investment costs in its notyetcertified 
md11 commercial jumbo jet and has experienced production problems 
with its md80 commercial airliners

the ford motor co today was ordered to pay 
nearly 52 million to the inventor of intermittent windshield 
wipers because the automaker unintentionally infringed on his 
patents 
ford attorneys said they were pleased with the amount of the 
award to robert w kearns but kearns attorney and son said they 
were disappointed and considering an appeal 
it follows the standard of the auto industry but i dont 
think thats fair they have no interest in paying for 
innovations said dennis kearns the inventors oldest son 
robert kearns a former wayne state university professor who now 
lives in gaithersburg md was absent when the jury anounced its 
verdict shortly after noon 
the verdict could have wide implications because kearns has 
similar suits pending against general motors corp chrysler corp 
daimlerbenz honda toyota nissan and more than 20 other 
companies the ford case was the first to go to trial 
dennis kearns said other automakers also being sued by his 
father probably would offer minuscule settlements in light of 
the ford verdict 
kearns 63 originally sought 141 million an amount that could 
have been tripled had the previous damages trial determined that 
ford willfully infringed on kearns patents 
ford attorneys said a reasonable licensing agreement would have 
paid the inventor 15 million or less 
the jurys award for 63 million was based on what kearns had 
called fords profit of 685 on each of 206 million 
intermittentwiper options it sold from 19721988 when his main 
patents were in effect 
during a friday afternoon hearing us district judge avern 
cohn ordered the award reduced to 516 million which represents 
what is owed to kearns only after april 1978 when he originally 
filed suit 
the jury that decided kearns patents had been infringed 
deadlocked on how much money he should get the second jury heard 
evidence pertaining only to the damages kearns suffered through the 
infringement

castle amp cooke inc has hired consultants to 
evaluate the possibility of selling its dole food co subsidiary 
the company said 
castle amp cooke had announced earlier that it would split dole 
and its real estate holdings into two businesses however those 
plans were held up by a softening of the realestate financing 
market and the time needed to obtain an internal revenue service 
ruling on a possible spinoff 
castle amp cooke chairman david murdock said thursday that a sale 
of dole could be an attractive alternative to the planned 
separation of our two businesses 
he said castle amp cooke has been contacted by several major 
companies interested in acquiring dole 
the evaluation of a possible sale will be done by the investment 
banking firm of goldman sachs and co he said 
dole founded in 1901 as a hawaii pineapple company has annual 
sales of 25 billion it is incorporated in hawaii and based in 
los angeles

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks rose 
25 percent in early july over a year earlier prolonging a rebound 
that began in late june the automakers said friday 
it was the second consecutive increase for the automakers which 
report their sales in 10day periods while the backtoback 
advances dont provide enough evidence to signal a trend they 
support expectations earlier this year that a sluggish early1990 
sales rate would pick up this summer 
despite the successive increases the sales rate so far this 
year continues to lag behind last years pace car and truck sales 
since jan 1 this year averaged 36921 a day compared with a 
38100aday average last year a 31 percent decline 
car sales for the year were down 43 percent and truck sales 
were off 1 percent 
early july car sales by general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp fell 23 percent while sales of usmade japanese 
cars and trucks rose 352 percent the big three held 903 percent 
of the market and the japanese cars made up the rest 
together the 10 major us vehicle makers said they sold an 
average of 36499 cars and light trucks a day during the july 110 
period this year compared with a daily rate of 35614 vehicles last 
year 
truck sales fueled the early july increase rising 56 percent 
over last year car sales during the period were 06 percent higher 
were certainly a little mystified said auto analyst john 
kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of new york were surprised 
because incentive costs have come down which would have suggested 
that sales would have weakened a little bit 
he speculated that sales may have been boosted by people who 
last bought cars during the 198486 boom years during which 45 
million cars and trucks were sold in the united states 
those vehicles are now in excess of four years of age and 
most of them have been paid off he said theres no question 
that there is a lot of replacement pressure 
chrysler was the only one of the big three whose combined car 
and truck sales fell during early july the nations thirdlargest 
automaker reported a 163 percent drop in vehicle sales as a 139 
percent decline in truck sales combined with an 188 percent 
decrease in car sales 
so far this year sales of chryslers domestic cars and trucks 
were down 132 percent 
sales of gm vehicles in early july were 67 percent ahead of 
last years pace car sales by the nations largest automaker were 
up 09 percent and truck sales improved by 182 percent 
gms vehicle sales this year were down 31 percent from last 
year 
ford said a 04 percent decline in car sales combined with a 61 
percent increase in truck sales for a 22 percent increase in early 
july vehicle sales so far this year sales of fords north 
americanmade cars and trucks were down 73 percent from last year

the stock market kept climbing today in buying 
that carried the dow jones industrial average to the 3000 level 
for the first time 
alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board surprised 
traders in the stock and bond markets thursday by signaling a shift 
in the emphasis of the feds credit policy 
he said the central bank which has been concentrating on 
fighting inflation is now ready to ease credit conditions if 
necessary 
interest rates fell sharply on the news analysts said 
greenspans comments also went a long way toward relieving 
recession worries on wall street 
enthusiasm over that prospect persisted today apparently not 
much affected by statistical reports from the government for june 
showing a 05 percent rise in retail sales and a 02 percent 
increase in the producer price index of finished goods

the founders of a california computer 
company have filed a 25 million lawsuit claiming kubota ltd of 
japan forced their firm into a merger with a financially unstable 
competitor 
the suit was filed in santa clara county superior court on 
thursday by allen michels and matthew sanders founders of ardent 
computer of sunnyvale calif 
they contend kubota ardents largest shareholder and creditor 
planned the merger in order to weaken ardent and gain its 
technology 
im outraged said sanders we want kubota to stop trying 
to drain the assets of this company 
according to the suit kubota forced ardent into a merger with 
stellar computer of massachusetts last year by threatening to 
withhold 50 million in promised financing the merged company was 
called stardent inc 
according to the suit kubotas actions were intended to weaken 
stardent to where the troubled companys technology could be 
acquired in the worst case stardent would have gone bankrupt 
leaving kubota as the largest creditor and shareholder 
when the merger was completed kubota controlled 22 percent of 
the company michels and sanders serve as cochairmen and stellar 
president john poduska is president and chief executive officer 
stardent based in newton mass issued a statement friday

committed to their partnership 
our relationship has been and continues to be excellent and 
has worked to the advantage of both of our companies poduska

sears roebuck and co said friday that heavy 
insurance claims after californias recent fires contributed to 
losses at its allstate insurance group leading sears to expect a 
steep drop in secondquarter income 
a weak earnings performance by the sears merchandise group also 
held back companywide profitability 
sears estimated that its profit from continuing operations will 
slump 41 percent to 65 cents a share in the three months ended june 
30 from 111 a share of net income in 1989s second quarter 
stock of the chicagobased parent of the nations largest 
retailer sagged 37 cents to 3425 a share on the new york stock 
exchange sears is scheduled to release its secondquarter results 
in the week of july 23 
last years second quarter included a gain of 549 million from 
the sale of the commercial division of the coldwell banker real 
estate group excluding earnings from those discontinued 
operations sears earned 95 cents a share or 3912 million in 
the second quarter of 1989 
edward a brennan sears chairman and chief executive officer 
noted that unexpectedly high catastropherelated losses in its 
allstate insurance group will contribute to the quarterly profit 
deterioration payments on claims resulting from the fires that 
ravaged parts of california took a heavy toll on allstate 
profits in the sears merchandise group for the second quarter 
are expected to be lower than last year brennan said 
we continue to expect a solid performance for the second half 
of the year based on our outlook for continued moderate growth in 
the economy he said in a news release 
the projection of losses in sears insurance operation came as 
somewhat of a surprise because it had been expected that allstate 
would show increased earnings from last year said monroe h 
greenstein a bear stearns amp co analyst 
earnings at allstate suffered in 1989 on account of hurricane 
hugo the california earthquake floods in the south and freezes in 
the southeast and the southwest 
this year they are getting the fire around santa barbara 
calif greenstein said it catastropherelated losses almost 
sounds biblical in nature 
greenstein said sears failure to implement substantial rate 
increases also has hurt allstate he attributes the companys 
reluctance to raise rates to the political climate 
a number of states including california have had movements to 
roll back insurance rates which critics contend are inordinately 
high 
the reduced earnings at sears retailing division are due 
largely to the depressed durable goods sector prolonged economic 
weakness has made consumers conservative in buying expensive 
longlasting merchandise such as home appliances 
particularly hard hit has been sears home improvement business 
analysts say for instance sales of air conditioners accounting 
for an estimated 25 percent of the retailers home improvement 
business at this time of year were sluggish in the spring due to 
unseasonably cool weather 
one bright spot for sears is brand central the retailers first 
attempt at selling national brands other than its own greenstein 
said sales of appliances and consumer electronics at brand central 
are up 7 percent to 8 percent against a 4 percent industrywide 
decline in sales 
sears has been struggling to maintain its market share last 
year it restructured and switched to an everyday low prices 
policy to attract customers

wholesale prices rose a modest 02 percent in 
june as declines in food and energy costs helped offset large 
increases for autos and tobacco the government said friday 
meanwhile retail sales rebounded a strong 05 percent the 
first gain in five months 
the overall increase in the labor departments producer price 
index for goods one stop short of the retail level was about what 
economists expected 
however prices for items outside the volatile food and energy 
sectors jumped 06 percent in june the steepest increase in a year 
and about double the anticipated rise 
analysts consider this socalled core rate a better 
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
normally a combination of stronger consumer spending and an 
upturn in core inflation would spook financial markets by 
discouraging any hope that the federal reserve would lower interest 
rates 
this time the market shrugged off the statistical reports both 
stock and bond prices rose in the hours after the reports release 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks touched 3000 briefly 
before falling back to 298020 still a record high 
traders optimism was buoyed by thursdays comments from federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan who suggested the central bank was 
on the verge of cutting interest rates slightly to offset the 
economic effects of an apparent pullback in bank lending to 
businesses 
according to traders the central bank followed through on 
friday by pushing down the federal funds rate the interest charged 
among banks for overnight loans from 8 percent to 8 percent 
the rate cut comes at an opportune time for the bush 
administration which needs continued economic growth to bolster 
republican chances in the november congressional elections 
most analysts agree a rate cut would be needed to counter the 
economic effects of any white housecongress budget agreement 
including higher taxes and reduced spending 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater welcomed 
greenspans comments and said the administration was pleased with 
the reports on retail sales and wholesale prices 
this is excellent news for the economy he said declining 
inflation should continue to relieve pressure on interest rates 
the 02 percent increase in wholesale prices followed a moderate 
gain of 03 percent in may and declines in april and march 
last months increase brought wholesale inflation for the first 
half of 1990 to an annual rate of 37 percent compared with 48 
percent for all of 1989 
prices rose 32 percent for tobacco and 23 percent for cars 
they were also up for womens clothing furniture jewelry 
newspapers and overthecounter drugs 
tobacco prices are now 139 percent higher than a year ago 
automobile costs are rebounding as dealers scale back 
buyerincentive programs 
economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill a lexington mass 
forecasting firm attributed the higher tobacco prices to chances 
in federal price supports and taxes and to a crop shortfall 
wyss said about half of the 06 percent rise in core inflation 
can be attributed to autos and tobacco 
in general its neutral data he said most of what were 
seeing is just a swing in food and energy prices we think the 
inflation rate is going to remain essentially stable 
energy prices which skyrocketed 137 percent in january because 
of a severe cold snap have declined every month since they were 
down 09 percent in june after dropping 1 percent in may 
fuel oil prices fell 105 percent gasoline costs were down 13 
percent natural gas prices rose 04 percent 
food prices headed lower for the third time in four months they 
dropped 04 percent last month after a 06 percent increase in may 
prices rose for fresh fruit and vegetables eggs and dairy 
products but fell sharply for pasta pork chicken and fish 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1179 in june that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 would have cost 11790 
last month up from 11430 a year earlier 
at earlier stages of the production process prices fell 02 
percent for intermediate goods and 24 percent for crude goods 
excluding food and energy intermediategoods prices edged 01 
percent lower and crudegoods costs fell 06 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be bread for 
finished goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude 
in fridays other report the commerce department said retail 
sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 14782 billion last month up 
784 million from the may sales level the june increase came after 
a string of three consecutive declines something that had not 
happened since 1981 during the last recession sales had been flat 
in february

eastern airlines expects to cut its losses 
considerably during 1990 but will still show a shortfall of more 
than 330 million trustee martin shugrue said friday 
shugrue told a news conference the airlines performance 
continues to improve and eastern is seeing an increase in ridership 
that should help the carrier show an operating profit in 1991 
eastern lost 8523 million last year shugrue said the company 
would suffer a substantial loss tis year but it would be much 
lower than in 1989 
asked if the deficit would be more than 330 million shugrue 
replied that it would 
he said he hoped the airline could emerge from bankruptcy court 
protection by the end of this year but no target date has been set 
for eastern to file a plan of reorganization with the court 
shugrue was appointed in april by us bankruptcy judge burton 
lifland to take control of the airline from frank lorenzo chairman 
of easterns parent continental airlines holdings inc the former 
texas air corp 
the trustee said the airline would announce during the summer a 
marketing plan aimed at grabbing a greater share of the crucial 
business travel market and ultimately improving easterns 
profitability 
we expect to be in a good position to be capitalizing on the 
business frequent flyer during the fall shugrue said 
shugrue spoke with reporters after meeting with easterns 
unsecured creditors committee and presenting to them the companys 
latest business plan 
the trustee spoke in broad generalities about the plan and 
offered few numbers he said it presented a bleaker picture of the 
airlines finances for the next few months but a healthier outlook 
for 1991 
he said the creditors reacted positively to the plan were 
expected to continue funding the airlines shortterm losses and 
were not planning to call for a liquidation of the company 
the trustee said eastern was still holding substantial talks 
with northwest airlines about a possible purchase of the carrier 
shugrue said he had met with northwest chairman alfred checchi and 
we are setting up followon meetings to see if there is an 
opportunity for northwest and eastern to do something together 
other parties have expressed interest in eastern but the 
carrier is not currently holding substantive negotiations with 
anyone other than northwest shugrue said 
at times shugrue boomed the airlines accomplishments as he does 
in eastern television commercials the carriers current ad 
campaign shows shugrue giving eastern employees a pep talk and 
confidently predicting a turnaround 
shugrue boasted several times of the airlines ontime 
performance said service was improving and that passengers 
increasingly are satisfied 
but at other times his frustration was apparent especially as 
he discussed easterns labor problems 
shugrue said the airline continues to negotiate with its pilots 
union which is threatening a strike if their contract dispute is 
not resolved eastern and the pilots are in a 30day cooling off 
period after having declared their contract dispute at an impasse 
its hard for me to understand how pilots who are not working 
can go on strike shugrue said most of easterns pilots who 
struck in march 1989 in sympathy with the airlines machinists 
union but later called off their walkout have not been recalled to 
work 
eastern hired replacements for the pilots and machinists and 
flight attendants who also walked out 
eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization after the walkouts 
began since then the company has sold some of its routes 
including its northeastern shuttle and has pared away other assets 
in order to reposition itself as a smaller carrier

the union representing american 
airlines 8500 pilots has replaced its contract negotiators 
signalling a possible hardening of positions as the two sides work 
for a new agreement 
the allied pilots association suspended talks with the airline 
last month while its board of directors convened to discuss 
dissatisfaction with the pace of the 10monthold negotiations 
a large faction of pilots reportedly was unhappy with the 
failure of the negotiating team to win an agreement to abandon or 
reduce the impact of the socalled bscale pay rate for less 
senior pilots 
at a board meeting in chicago wednesday and thursday the 
fivemember negotiating team was replaced and expanded to six 
members according to a message on the unions information line 
union officials remained in chicago friday and did not return 
telephone calls to the associated press seeking comment 
the replacement is expected to lengthen the negotiations which 
have been conducted with a federal mediator since february 
we will negotiate with whomever the union authorizes us to 
negotiate with said al becker spokesman for fort worthbased 
american the real issue is to get back to the negotiating table 
as quickly as possible so that we can work in the spirit of 
compromise toward reaching a new agreement 
the contract became eligible for amendments on dec 31 although 
negotiations on a new pact began in october after a stalemate in 
january federal mediator harry bickford was brought in and 
meetings were held almost daily beginning in february until last 
months recess 
under the national railway act the contract does not expire 
and a strike cannot be called unless the mediator declares talks to 
be at an impasse and a 30day cooling off period has elapsed 
the old contract provides for a bscale wage rate for pilots 
hired after 1983 amounting to about half the starting pay for 
pilots already on the payroll 
with about half of the pilots now covered by the lower wage 
rates there is growing pressure to bring them closer to their 
colleagues at american and elsewhere 
american chairman bob crandall has warned that a huge increase 
for pilots would threaten the airlines aggressive expansion 
program he argues that the airlines growth provides opportunities 
for a more rapid rise to a captains rank and pay 
also at issue is americans insistence the pilots contribute 
more to their health care program

the french company paying 13 billion for motel 
6 plans to accelerate the budget lodging chains expansion rate and 
open the brands first outlets in canada and mexico executives 
said friday 
lodging industry analysts meanwhile said the price that accor 
sa of paris agreed to pay for the chain reflects both the appealing 
growth prospects for economy lodging and accors view of the best 
path into the us market 
burland east an analyst for the investment firm bateman eichler 
hill richards amp co said the economy segment of the lodging market 
has been growing three to four times as fast as the industry 
overall 
he said accor which already owns 850 hotels in 60 countries is 
getting an experienced management team and a popular brand name 
along with the 554 motel 6 properties in the united states 
they are getting a lot more than they could build on their 
own he said 
accor announced thursday that it had agreed to pay 2250 per 
unit for the more than 55 million motel 6 lp partnership units it 
said its tender offer would begin no later than wednesday and that 
it had the financing for the deal 
the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which owns 
more than 50 percent of the partnerhips equity said it would 
tender its stake under terms of the deal the firm expects its 
partners will realize a healthy 38 percent annualized profit on 
their initial investment in motel 6 in 1985 
the kohlberg kravis group bought motel 6 for 880 million 
including 125 million in equity and 756 million in debt and sold 
a minority interest to the public in 1986 
accor said it intended to keep the current management team that 
had overseen the 700 million invested in the motel chain over the 
past five years 
motel 6 used the money to add 180 motels to the chain install 
telephones and color televisions in all 63765 rooms start a 
national reservation system and launch a folksy advertising 
campaign that extolled its low prices and clean rooms and poked fun 
at the amenities more expensive motels provide 
you cant get a hot facial mudpack at motel 6 like you can at 
those fancy joints humorist tom bodett said in one motel 6 radio 
ad 
the strategy enabled motel 6 to attract more business travelers 
and boost its occupancy rate to about 77 percent this year compared 
with an industry average of about 63 percent 
but guests still pay less than at many other hotels currently 
an average of about 27 a night 
georges lemener director of the office of chairman for accor 
said in an interview friday that his company has no plans to change 
motel 6s approach 
he said accor plans to invest about 225 million a year in each 
of the next five years to expand the chain 
motel 6 chief executive joseph mccarthy said the chain has been 
adding about 35 to 40 motels a year but said that with accors 
backing the expansion program will be twice as rapid 
we will try to get 75 a year and we will begin expanding into 
mexico and canada as well he said motel 6 has no motels in 
either country now 
mccarthy said the chain would also stick with its approach of 
owning and operating all of its properties unlike some other 
chains that award franchises to independent operators 
when you are in the economy business all you have to sell is 
price and consistency of product mccarthy said you cant do 
that unless you own and operate the product

the arizona department of insurance is 
investigating james fail for failing to disclose that he had been 
barred from working in the insurance business in alabama for 
alleged securities fraud 
fail who also has been accused of misleading regulators in 
texas and florida already is the subject of a us senate panel 
probe related to his purchase of 15 failed texas savings and loans 
he was indicted in alabama in 1976 for securities fraud but 
those charges were dropped after he signed an order barring him 
from conducting future business in that state 
arizona insurance investigators said thursday that they are 
attempting to determine why fail denied having been subjected to 
any court order regarding violation of securities in his annual 
disclosure certificate filed in 1988 
however arizona insurance officials apparently were aware of 
his background when fail acquired farm amp home insurance co in 
1979 records show that the indictment and order were revealed 
during a hearing on the acquisition 
false information provided to the department can result in the 
revocation of an operating license officials said 
fail reportedly was in europe this week and could not be reached 
for comment his washington attorney stanley brand issued a 
statement earlier this week saying fail has complied with federal 
regulations 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio the head of a senate judiciary 
subcommittee has launched an investigation to determine whether 
federal regulators adequately probed fails background before they 
allowed him to take over the failed texas savings and loans 
metzenbaum contends fail should be disqualified from a 1988 
agreement with the government because of his background 
fail was allowed to buy the thrifts with only 1000 of his own 
money and 70 million in loans in return he was promised 185 
billion in federal aid 
arizona insurance officials suspended farm amp homes license last 
week and the company was placed under the departments 
supervision the company has more than 125000 life insurance 
policies nationwide 6700 of them in arizona according to 
insurance officials

gold futures prices rallied strongly friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange but some analysts wondered whether the market 
will sustain the gains which were prompted in part by a decline in 
interest rates 
on other commodity markets silver also rose petroleum futures 
were mixed grains and soybeans advanced and livestock and meat 
futures rose 
gold futures settled 620 to 670 higher in new york with the 
contract for delivery in august at 36570 a troy ounce its 
highest settlement price since may 31 
silver futures ended 17 cents to 18 cents higher with july at 
4908 a troy ounce 
the rally in gold extended a 390 gain posted thursday after 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan indicated the fed 
which has been concentrating on fighting inflation is now ready to 
ease credit conditions if necessary 
interest rates fell sharply on the news and gold which is 
considered an investment hedge against inflation rose 
analysts agreed that lower rates could create a friendlier 
atmosphere for gold 
craig sloane a metals analyst at smith barney harris upham amp 
co said golds upward reversal on thursday following the 
greenspan comments could be construed as a sign that the market has 
ended its recent decline 
but bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber 
inc said other conditions did not appear right for gold to 
sustain the rally 
sharp gains in the stock market such as occurred on thursday 
and friday are typically bearish for gold he said 
silvers relatively weak gains on friday also contradicted 
notions of a major bull move beginning in the precious metals he 
said 
savaiko said the twoday runup in gold prices might simply have 
represented booksquaring ahead of fridays expiration of the 
august gold options contract on the chicago mercantile exchange and 
bottompicking by investors when gold fell to near 350 an ounce on 
thursday 
we had a lot of bargain hunting at those lower levels he 
said the question is are they willing to hold it here at these 
levels 
crude oil futures ended mixed in a volatile session dominated by 
bullish news of opec unity on measures to contain crude production 
and boost prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 17 
cents higher with august at 1836 a barrel heating oil was 78 
cent to 185 cents higher with august at 5421 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 43 cent to 138 cents higher with august at 
6195 cents a pound 
crop futures prices ended higher on the chicago board of trade 
following an agriculture department report in which the agency 
lowered its projections for winter wheat production and corn and 
soybean stockpiles 
but gains were limited by expectations that beneficial weather 
will continue as the corn crop enters its critical pollination 
phase 
the national weather service predicts more good growing weather 
on the way in reports released after the close the agency 
predicted normal to abovenormal temperatures and precipitation in 
the midwest for the period july 1923 and normal temperatures and 
rainfall for the next 30 days

bond prices posted another broad advance friday 
as the federal reserve took steps that traders viewed as evidence 
the central bank was adopting a more generous credit policy 
a day after federal reserve chairman alan greenspan hinted that 
the fed was poised to relax credit conditions because loans were 
becoming harder to get the central bank injected reserves into the 
banking system at midday 
the move led to a quarterpoint decline in a key lending rate 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond climbed 1732 point or 
about 525 per 1000 face amount after rising 750 on thursday 
its yield which falls when prices rise dropped to 845 percent 
from 849 percent late thursday 
bond prices moved higher from the start of trading on 
expectations that interest rates would be moving lower in the wake 
of greenspans comments thursday to the senate banking committee 
prices moved even higher in late morning trading when the fed 
added reserves to the banking system by arranging shortterm 
purchases of securities 
with more funds available to banks the federal funds rate 
which is the interest that banks charge each other for shortterm 
loans slipped to 8 percent from 8 percent late thursday the 
funds rate had fluctuated near 8 percent for months 
the fed eased said maria fiorini ramirez who heads a 
consulting firm that bears her name they are putting greenspans 
may and might into action 
the federal funds rate is often seen as an indicator of which 
way other lending rates are headed 
but mrs ramirez said she does not expect a quick decline in 
consumer lending rates to follow the move in the federal funds rate 
because many banks are facing profit pressures due to shaky real 
estate and third world loans 
meanwhile government reports on wholesale inflation and retail 
sales went virtually ignored by bond traders 
the commerce department said declining food and energy prices 
helped hold the producer price index to a modest 02 percent in 
june however costs of other items were up more sharply than in 
recent months 
a separate report showed retail sales rose 05 percent in june 
snapping a string of five straight monthly declines 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 732 point intermediate maturities gained between 
point and 1332 point and longterm issues advanced as much as 
1732 point according to telerate inc a financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 310 to 116196 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 732 point to 92rsqb the average yield to 
maturity slipped to 742 percent from 744 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 783 percent as the 
discount dropped 8 basis points to 759 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 789 percent as the discount declined 7 
basis points to 750 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 789 
percent as the discount fell 7 basis points to 736 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

heavy trading after falling in europe

cheaper to investors using foreign currencies

quoted a bid of 36400 an ounce for gold up 630 from thursday 
warren myers a vice president at merrill lynch amp co who 
follows the gold market said trading was influenced friday by a 
carryover effect from yesterday 
on thursday gold rose sharply after the dollar fell on comments

consider easing interest rates 
lower rates reduce the returns on dollardenominated 
investments thus sending investors to other currencies 
other traders said gold prices were boosted friday by the 
expiration of the august contract on gold options on the new york 
comex

repurchase agreements the agencys method for adding funds to the 
banking system that has the effect of lowering interest rates and 
some traders interpreted it as a a followthrough to greenspans 
remarks 
the federal funds rate the rate banks charge each other on 
overnight loans moved lower a negative for the dollar 
but the dollar soon climbed partly because european traders 
were buying dollars to shore up their positions as the markets 
there closed said francoise soareskemp a vice president in the 
foreign exchange department of credit suisse in new york

had reached its floor and were buying dollars to cover short

the securities and exchange commission alleged 
friday that unknown parties engaged in insider trading in contel 
corp securities in the days before the telephone company agreed to 
a 6 billion takeover by gte corp 
the sec in a federal lawsuit filed in new york claimed that 
individuals or entities whose identities are as yet unknown to 
the commission bought contel common stock or call options 
contracts while in possession of confidential corporate information 
according to the sec the unidentified defendants stood to make 
more than 1 million in alleged illegal profits on investments of 
205125 
the sec obtained court orders freezing us brokerage accounts 
used to conduct the alleged illegal trading and preventing the 
destruction or alteration of documents 
joseph goldstein associate director of the secs enforcement 
division said it was not unusual for the agency to act against 
alleged wrongdoers without knowing their identity 
we know what the accounts are but we dont know who the 
persons are what we dont know is who the ultimate customer is 
he said 
goldstein declined to say how the sec became aware of the 
alleged illegal activity court papers said the defendants bought 
contel call options on the american stock exchange and contel 
common stock on the new york stock exchange

bankers and attorneys firms were privy to the discussions 
contel and gte closely monitored the volume of trading in 
contel and gte securities to determine whether possible leaks were 
occurring the sec said although it did not indicate whether the 
companies tipped it off to the suspicious trading 
the suit said such trading took place in both contel common 
stock and call options

procter amp gamble co said thursday it was 
closing an 83yearold plant on staten island in a neighborhood 
that takes its name from the companys famed ivory soap 
pampg said operations from the plant which employs about 425 
people in the islands port ivory section would be relocated to 
other factories around the country the plant is to be shut down 
over the next 19 months 
in addition to ivory soap the port ivory factory makes coast 
soap bars bold and solo liquid laundry detergent mr clean and 
top job surface cleaners and citrus hill orange juice 
pampg spokeswoman louise hughes said employment at the factory 
which was built in 1907 peaked around 1980 with 1400 workers 
mrs hughes said the decision to close the factory was made late 
last week after the company decided it would be more economical to 
consolidate production at other plants 
we wanted to consolidate that manufacturing to fewer 
locations she said it made more economic sense to phase out 
manufacturing at port ivory than it did at other locations 
the company so far has decided to move the citrus hill 
production to its chicopee mass plant and the mr clean and top 
job production to its st louis plant she said some employees 
will be transferred to other plants starting this fall 
a procter amp gamble plant in avenel nj that now employs 75 
people making perfume for company products will be expanded and 
some of the staten island workers may wind up there officials said 
this is just another example of how the high cost of doing 
business in this city and state is driving industry away staten 
island borough president guy molinari said in a statement 
staten island is part of new york city the port ivory plant was 
one of the first opened by cincinnatibased procter amp gamble
