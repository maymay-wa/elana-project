special grand jury hearings on the 
slayings of nine women whose bodies were found by highways have 
been postponed indefinitely because of state funding cuts 
officials said wednesday 
the bristol county grand jury which has been meeting off and on 
for at least two months will not reconvene until investigators get 
enough evidence and serve subpoenas said jim martin a spokesman 
for district attorney ronald pina 
that could take a long time because state troopers are no longer 
authorized to work overtime martin said most subpoenas have been 
served at night and on weekends because witnesses primarily street 
people are hard to find he said 
the female victims were found along or near three highways near 
this city close to rhode island since july 
troopers have run up thousands of overtime hours trying to track 
leads and investigators have gotten some of their best clues at 
night martin said 
the end of overtime puts the investigation further and further 
behind he said every day that we lose we cant get back 
another bristol county superior court grand jury on wednesday 
indicted anthony r degrazia on 13 rape and assault charges 
degrazia was arraigned in district court last week after a 
witness who appeared before the special grand jury said she had 
identified his photo 
martin said the indictment had nothing to do with the killings 
and refused to comment on whether degrazia had been linked to the 
investigation 
the state senate has enacted a 174 million deficiency budget 
but the legislature did not approve 21 million in emergency 
overtime pay for troopers through the end of the fiscal year june

the woman called the godmother of a 
drugsmuggling cult that killed 15 people was charged wednesday 
night with two other members in the weekend deaths of their leader 
and his righthand man authorities said 
godmother sara aldrete villarreal 24 omar francisco orea 
23 and alvaro de leon valdez 22 were formally charged in the 
saturday shootings reported marco antonio diaz de leon director 
of judicial proceedings for the mexico city attorney generals 
office 
earlier wednesday a source in his office said ms aldrete has a 
split personality and us customs agent oran neck told a news 
conference that ms aldrete confessed to conspiracy and 
involvement in ritual killings 
she and the other two also were charged wednesday with criminal 
association resisting arrest shooting a firearm at authorities 
and for injuries incurred in the saturday gunbattle with police 
cult leader adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 and his chief 
lieutenant martin quintana rodriguez were killed in a mexico city 
apartment during a shootout with police constanzo a cubanborn 
american from florida reportedly instructed de leon valdez to kill 
him and quintana as police moved in 
the cult believed that ritual killings would give them occult 
protection in their drugrunning 
the three charged with homicide along with two other mexico 
city women still have not been arraigned diaz de leon said an 
arraignment date was not announced 
diaz de leon said two other mexico city women arrested saturday 
dr maria de lourdes guero lopez 23 a physician and maria del 
rocio cuevas guerra 43 were charged with coverup a federal 
crime in the ritual deaths at the border city of matamoros 
mexico across from brownsville texas 
aldrete a mexican who attended college in texas orea and de 
leon valdez were charged only in crimes said to have taken place 
within the jurisdiction of mexico city they have not been charged 
with the 15 ritual slayings near matamoros 
ms aldrete and orea were charged in the deaths of constanzo and 
quintana because they had agreed and made a pact before the 
deaths in case they were going to be arrested diaz de leon said 
this death pact was carried out 
also on wednesday orea suspected cult members salvador antonio 
gutierrez juarez arrested in the capital on tuesday and juan 
carlos fragoso arrested wednesday were charged in the july 1988 
killing of ramon baez a transvestite who was killed in a mexico 
city suburb 
authorities earlier said gutierrez also known as jorge montes 
confessed to participating along with constanzo in baezs slaying 
ms aldrete was charged with coverup in the baez killing 
constanzo and ms aldrete were wanted on both sides of the 
border since april 11 when mexican police acting on a tip dug up 
15 mutilated bodies at a desolate ranch near matamoros 
one body was identified as that of mark kilroy 21 a premed 
student from santa fe texas 
us authorities said wednesday that ms aldrete admitted to 
involvement in some of the earlier ritual slayings 
diaz de leon would not comment on any confession saying only 
that ms aldrete most certainly is immersed in these crimes 
the source at the mexico city attorney generals office 
speaking on condition of anonymity said ms aldrete loses that 
charming aspect she exhibits when she faces television cameras 
and seems to revert to another self when talking to police about 
cult rituals 
i would say she has three personalities he said 
one personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies 
any involvement in the human slayings another emerges when she 
talks to police and the third one comes out when she talks to 
herself the source said 
us agent neck returned to brownsville on wednesday from a 
72hour trip to mexico city he and a cameron county investigator 
lt george gavito assisted mexican authorities in the closing 
stages of the case 
neck told reporters sara has kind of lost touch with reality 
no question about it her dual personality is coming up pretty 
strong right now when you talk to her without the tv cameras 
there shes pretty truthful 
shes giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators 
working this case right now it seems like when the cameras come 
on she kind of reverts back to this nice young cleancut kid 
from texas southmost college neck said 
when the cameras were there she was real nice when she was 
with us she was the same ol witch gavito said

the city where tough guys frank sinatra and 
g gordon liddy grew up has voted to replace the gritty docks 
featured in the movie on the waterfront with condominiums and 
offices 
by a nearly 21 margin tuesday voters in the one squaremile 
city rejected a referendum that would have converted the 31acre 
hudson river waterfront tract into a park with a tremendous view of 
the manhattan skyline 
the vote shows the concern of the city about being rational in 
the proportion of parklands said councilman steve cappiello one 
of the leaders against the referendum i think the area is 
located so that it would not have too much impact on the city of 
hoboken 
cappello said wednesday that city leaders want to convert the 
prime waterfront space into office and residential space 
the issue highlights the friction caused by the rapid 
gentrification the hudson county community is undergoing newer and 
younger residents many of whom fled manhattan for lower rents 
sought the park older residents want the tax revenues that new 
development might bring to the city

the scales of justice took on a 
whole new meaning when a man decided to try and prevent a detroit 
suburb from making him move 16 boa constrictors and pythons out of 
his onebedroom apartment 
eric larson 26 who owns the snakes has sued sterling heights 
to prevent its enforcement of an ordinance that makes it illegal to 
keep an animal not commonly kept or housed as a household pet 
said lori finazzo an assistant city attorney 
two of larsons pets colah a 10foot 50pound anaconda and 
beauregard a 2foot bolivian redtailed boa constrictor were 
entered monday as evidence by defense attorney charles langton 
larson lifted colah from its cage and wrapped the snake around 
his neck while explaining to macomb county circuit judge raymond 
cashen that he lets eight of his larger snakes slither freely 
around his apartment the eight smaller snakes are kept in cages in 
the bedroom while larson sleeps in the living room he said 
the prosecution is arguring that the snakes could escape through 
plumbing and make their way to other apartments 
anacondas are aquatic finazzo said theyll go straight 
for the toilet

the deaths of six riot troopers in 
south koreas latest wave of protests could bring a lull to the 
countrys turbulent politics but there seems little chance of 
lasting peace 
south koreans were shocked by the killings of the officers set 
on fire by radical students may 3 and angrily demanded an end to 
demonstrations government and opposition leaders all say the 
protests have gone too far and the violence must end 
some radical students have promised to stop violent 
demonstrations and using firebombs several dissident groups 
apologized to police for the deaths and many observers predict a 
lull in protests 
at the same time most political leaders and other observers 
agree the basic causes of unrest have not changed and the struggle 
between the government and its opponents is far from over 
south korea must overcome many problems to achieve stability 
including ending a legacy of authoritarian rule bitter rivalry 
between political parties and the impact of rapid economic and 
social change violent demonstrations are a symptom of these larger 
problems 
since violence is the radicals most effective tool it seems 
unlikely they will renounce it for long especially if the 
government continues to crush dissent violence has been a part of 
korean politics and life for many years and there is little chance 
of it disappearing overnight 
government statistics show there were 1512 major protests in 
the first four months of this year in which students used more 
than 300000 firebombs and injured 3800 police officers 
korean politics are dominated by an acrimonious power struggle 
opposition parties have not accepted the government of roh taewoo 
and constantly try to weaken or discredit it 
roh a former general who narrowly won 1987 presidential 
elections after rival candidates split the opposition vote insists 
he is committed to bringing full democracy but critics on the left 
and the right charge roh is indecisive and is not overcoming many 
of the problems 
bitter feuding between the government and opposition has 
produced constant political confusion and unrest the opposition 
parties drive against the government has been blunted only by 
chronic feuding and attempts to wreck each other 
opposition leaders are targets of growing public criticism for 
pursuing their own ambitions for power and failing to help build 
stability many koreans say they are tired of politics but the 
regional loyalties and factionalism on which politics are based 
help keep squabbling politicians in power 
south korea still is dominated by a traditional ruling elite 
drawn from the military government bureaucracy and industrialists 
despite democratic reforms since the authoritarian regime of chun 
doohwan was forced out after massive riots in 1987 
some political observers and opposition leaders say real 
democracy wont be possible until the control of the elite is 
ended the opposition says the establishment will try to block 
democracy if its hold on power is threatened 
the deepest changes in south korea may come from rapid 
industrialization and westernizing of this once poor backward 
society south koreas meteoric rise as an industrial power has 
been accompanied by the growing sophistication of many of its 
people who expect to run their country and share in its new wealth 
professionals skilled workers and others who produce the cars 
ships and other goods that have made south korea an economic force 
are not willing to accept unresponsive governments that try to 
order people around 
a wave of labor strikes in recent months has been inspired by 
demands for better pay and an end to the long hours and poor 
working conditions many koreans endure for little better than 
subsistence wages 
radical students and dissidents contend the roh government is a 
front for military rule dissident leaders call for the overthrow 
of the government and creation of an illdefined government of the 
masses 
the government says the radicals are leftist revolutionaries 
trying to destroy democracy but the radicals have virtually no 
public support because of their extreme views and violent tactics 
they are no major threat to the government 
radical leaders say time is on their side because industrial 
workers eveutally will join them and fight for their utopian dream 
but most observers say the workers want a share of koreas wealth 
and a democratic government controlled by the people 
the problem is overcoming the many obstacles that stand in the 
way

millionaire businessman pj morgan was 
elected mayor tuesday ending a political comeback bid by former 
mayor mike boyle 
with only absentee ballots remaining to be counted morgan had 
56774 votes or 5335 percent to 48115 votes or 4521 percent 
for boyle in the nonpartisan race 
boyle who was recalled from his second term as mayor two years 
ago amid allegations he abused his executive power said during the 
campaign that he was a changed man 
in his concession speech he echoed his campaign theme of omaha 
as a family town and urged supporters to work with morgan to 
solve the citys problems 
we pull together after we fight boyle said 
morgan a real estate manager said in his acceptance speech 
that it was time for the city to move forward and meet the 
challenges of fighting drugs and improving omahas economic base 
im ready to turn the dream of a better omaha into reality 
morgan said 
during the campaign morgan outspent boyle by a margin of nearly 
2to1 
but he said tuesday night that he didnt believe money made the 
difference in the race 
i think this since april 4 the spending has been pretty 
close morgan said we spent more in the primary but its been 
pretty close since then 
boyle said money was a factor 
we were outspent pretty substantially yet i think we were 
doing really well he said before making his concession 
morgan said he believed the endorsements of mayor walt calinger 
and city councilman fred conley played a part in his victory 
we focused on the issues he said the people of the 
community accepted our message our vision of the future 
douglas county election commissioner vickie edwards florine had 
predicted a 60 percent turnout the april 4 primary with seven 
mayoral candidates had record turnout of nearly 100000 registered 
voters in the city of 340000 people 
boyle 45 contended the recall was prompted by his 
controversial management style something he says has changed he 
said during the campaign that hes a recovering alcoholic and 
hasnt had a drink in more than a year 
the effort that led to boyles ouster by a vote of 55275 to 
42832 was led by the group citizens for mature leadership which 
reemerged in an effort to keep him out of office 
morgan 49 is a member of the omaha airport authority was a 
douglas county commissioner in the 1970s and a state senator from 
197172 he said his business experience could benefit the city 
street gangs drugs and economic development in this missouri 
river city were the main campaign issues 
the city has had three mayors since 1985 the city council chose 
council member bernie simon to succeed boyle in 1987 council 
member walt calinger became mayor after simons death in april 
1988 but lost his bid to retain the job in last months primary

a zoologist frustrated by 
a lack of live animal specimens has found a unique path to 
scientific discovery the everglades roads 
eric juterbock scours roads in the park every night for 
flattened frogs splattered snakes and other wildlife that couldnt 
make it in the fast lane 
juterbock an assistant professor on sabbatical from the 
university of ohio at lima says he turned to the roads after 
failing to find enough specimens of salamanders for a study 
i just got tired of working on things that you cant find many 
of he said recently 
his new search for what sanitation workers call road pizza 
is proving more successful the 41yearold scientist has found as 
many as 358 dead frogs on a onemile stretch of highway 
many specimens are too squashed to be of use but others are 
almost intact juterbock keeps a cooler with his better finds 
including coiled jewelcolored snakes and a frog crouched in an 
action pose 
this one got its head squashed but the rest is in pretty good 
shape he said unwrapping a frozen garter snake at his research 
residence in the park 
juterbock will stop for living creatures too 
he stopped his van one night when his sharp eyes spotted a 
shining green object he found a pair of mating walking sticks 
insects he says are in almost permanent copulation during the 
mating season 
one object of his research is to discover whether animals breed 
more actively to compensate for the roadside slaughter

a government study suggests a host of tax 
trade and antitrust issues will dictate the global competitiveness 
of the us semiconductor industry regardless of a texas research 
consortiums success in chip manufacturing research 
the commerce department study said sematechs performance is no 
guarantee the united states will capture the competitive edge in 
the semiconductor industry 
sematech a jointly funded partnership between the pentagon and 
14 semiconductor manufacturers was created last year in an effort 
to help the us achieve global leadership in such technology by 
1993 
the austin texas consortium was launched because of fears a 
decline in the us semiconductor industry may undermine the 
competitive and technological leadership of us computer and 
communications equipment makers a growing us dependence on 
foreign sources for stateoftheart weapons components also is a 
concern the report said 
the study a report by the advisory council on federal 
participation in sematech recommends the pentagon spend 100 
million on sematech in fiscal 1990 to be matched by the member 
corporations withdrawal of federal support now would seriously 
limit sematechs operations and prospects for success it said 
but the recently released study cautioned that even if sematech 
were a complete success in its own terms major issues now 
affecting the competitiveness of us chipmakers would remain 
limited marketing opportunities and a range of tax antitrust and 
trade policy issues 
the us would still trail the japanese and europeans in 
developing technology needed for competitive leadership in 
semiconductors in the late 1990s particularly in the area of xray 
lithography the report said 
if the public investment in sematech is not followed by an 
increase in the competitive strength of us chipmakers and their 
suppliers sematech as a public policy will not have been 
successful the study said 
even as sematech was gaining momentum in 1988 us 
semiconducter manufacturers continued to lose ground commercially 
as their share of world market sales fell to 37 percent three 
percentage points below the 1987 level the study said 
efforts by other countries to create alliances of business 
government and academia have the potential to weaken the united 
states economically and militarily observers have suggested 
that the sematech model federally sponsored precompetitive 
industry cooperation may be one answer to this problem the 
report said

prime minister yitzhak shamirs proposal for 
elections in the occupied lands is edging toward the dustbin of 
middle east peace plans opposed both by members of his 
conservative likud bloc and by the palestinians 
ariel sharon who heads likuds farright faction was reported 
tuesday to be planning a challenge within the party in hopes of 
sinking the plan he called it israels biggest ever national 
blunder 
shamir in an interview tuesday appeared to dash any hopes held 
by moderate palestinians that elections might be a first step to 
their dream of an independent state 
he told the jerusalem post he wanted those moderates to reject 
the idea of an independent nation even before the election 
he said his proposal for limited autonomy with palestinians 
running their own affairs while israel maintains control of 
security was the best he could offer 
his plan calls for elected palestinians from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip to negotiate an interim peace with israel to be 
followed by talks on the final status of the territories 
the approach has been rejected by the palestine liberation 
organization and a group of influential leaders in the occupied 
lands but shamir has said he does not see the rejection as final 
in tuesdays interview shamir said he believed elections could 
still go forward one government official said israel hopes 
secretary of state james a baker iii can convince the soviet union 
during his visit to moscow this week to join washington in trying 
to persuade the plo to accept the plan 
shamirs statement on prior rejection by palestinians of an 
independent state may have been aimed at deflecting rightwing 
criticism but palestinian leaders said they knew of no politician 
in the occupied lands willing to run with that condition 
i cant imagine any palestinian who would take part in any 
political activity in which he has to veto a palestinian state 
said daoud kuttab a prominent palestinian journalist 
even mayor elias freij of bethlehem who in the past favored 
elections and was threatened by the plo for his stand criticized 
shamirs latest suggestion 
shamirs statement that palestinians must turn down a state 
makes the elections meaningless void of any content freij told 
the associated press 
shamir in the interview said elections could come about if 
israel could convince palestinians that hopes for a state were 
illusions and their 17month uprising in the occupied 
territories can be broken by israel 
kuttab however said the palestinians would not end the 
uprising in which 466 palestinians and 21 israelis have been 
killed without some gains for their losses 
palestinians are willing to stop the intefadeh he said 
using the arabic word for uprising but for what stop the 
intefadeh and go back to where we were in december 1987 no way 
kuttab told the ap that palestinians want a signal from shamir 
that israel is ready to compromise and give up at least part of the 
west bank and gaza in exchange for peace the formula favored by 
the united states 
we want him shamir to recognize that we are occupied that 
this land is not forever israel that its up for negotiations 
he said 
a government official who briefed reporters on the election 
plan said israels coalition government was too divided to make 
any formal declaration on the final status of the territories 
which israel seized in 1967 
finance minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak 
rabin leaders of the centerleft labor party that shares power 
with shamirs likud favor trading territory for peace though not 
the creation of a palestinian state 
shamir and his likud protege foreign minister moshe arens 
oppose giving up any land 
but shamirs biggest problem may be with his own colleagues and 
not with the labor party 
industry minister sharon who has failed in past challenges for 
likuds leadership has repeatedly denounced shamirs plan 
in an interview on army radio tuesday sharon called the 
elections proposal a calamity for israel representing the 
biggest ever national blunder that will lead to the creation of a 
palestinian state 
israel radio reported that sharon planned to try to kill the 
plan by taking it before likuds central committee which he heads 
the jerusalem post quoted a leading likud member planning 
minister yitzhak modai as saying the plan as it now stands will 
be rejected out of hand by the committee

after long periods in which the only 
significant opposition to gen manuel antonio noriega seemed to 
come from the us government american officials are encouraged by 
the throngs of antinoriega demonstrators in panama the past few 
days 
when noriega dumped independentminded panamanian presidents in 
1985 and 1988 the streets of panama city were quiet nary a voice 
was raised in protest even though both presidents could claim at 
least a modicum of democratic legitimacy 
there was concern here that an attempt by noriega to steal last 
sundays election would be greeted with apathy once again by a 
people who often do not expect much from their political leaders 
but the streets of panama city have been alive with protest over 
the past few days suggesting that noriega could be weaker now than 
he has been at any time since becoming defense forces commander 
almost six years ago 
the bush administration strategy has been clear early on 
officials saw the election as a major opportunity for political 
change even though there was little reason to believe that noriega 
would tolerate an honest process 
the administration reasoned that the panamanian opposition 
needed a catalyst around which it could rally and the election 
provided it us officials had predicted that noriega would 
respond in one of two ways to evidence of broadbased opposition 
he would either cancel the elections or try to rig the outcome 
either way he would be weakened politically a highpriority 
us objective noriega decided to go ahead with the election 
thinking all along he would be able to manipulate the results a 
timehonored practice in panama according to many who claim to 
have seen it firsthand 
if there were protests noriega believed he could ride them out 
after all he may have felt with some reason invulnerable to 
pressure he was able to survive street protests two years ago 
after a onetime ally turned against him he was also emboldened by 
his ability to withstand us economic and political pressures in 
addition noriega was able to reduce to irrelevance panamanian 
leaders who dared challenge his authority 
in 1985 president nicolas ardito barletta was ousted with 
lightning swiftness after calling for an investigation into the 
death of a noriega critic who witnesses said was killed by 
noriegas agents 
fourteen months ago after president eric arturo delvalle tried 
to fire noriega it took noriegas allies in the national assembly 
precisely 10 minutes to remove delvalle from office 
noriega also was able to shrug off us criminal indictments 
stemming from his alleged involvement in drug smuggling an attempt 
by dissident officers to oust noriega a year ago was put down 
within hours 
but now noriega appears on the defensive the election seeming 
to demonstrate that his base of support is perilously thin the 
bush administration is now attempting to devise a strategy that 
will push him over the edge and thus restore a degree of normality 
to the uspanamanian relationship for the first time in years 
when the election campaign began several months ago prospects 
for noreigas opponents seemed dim but not hopeless they felt 
reassured by the expressions of support and encouragement from 
delegations of human rights activists from the united states and 
elsewhere interested in a democratic outcome in panama 
the opposition also may have been given a shot in the arm from 
the 10 million it received according to reports in clandestine 
aid from the us government it also has been galvanized by the 
steep economic decline panama has suffered under noriegas rule 
now the administration is groping for new ways to make noriega 
wonder whether he would be better off elsewhere the reagan 
administration thought for sure noriega was on his way out well 
over a year ago and it miscalculated badly the bush administration 
is hoping that it is noriega who has miscalculated this time

the electoral fraud that shocked 
former president jimmy carter was hardly a surprise in a nation 
where voting has seldom determined who holds power 
panama was a province of colombia in 1903 when the united 
states helped gen esteban huertas mount a successful revolt 
because president theodore roosevelt wanted to build a canal 
panama declared its independence on nov 3 that year 
i took the isthmus crowed roosevelt as the us army corps 
of engineers went to work to cut a path through the narrow waist 
between the atlantic and pacific oceans 
democracy has had a rough ride ever since 
by 1940 the country had had 21 leaders in 37 years including 
four in 1918 and in the last 21 years panamanians have rarely 
been able to vote for a president 
in 1940 voters elected arnulfo arias madrid one of panamas 
most influential politicians to the day he died in 1988 
arias madrid was elected to the presidency three times he is 
thought to have been cheated of victory by fraud in 1984 one year 
after gen manuel antonio noriega took control of the nation 
despite his success arias madrid only managed to govern the 
country for 2 years in all he was toppled by coups three times 
in 1968 he served just 11 days before he was overthrown 
even arias madrid was not a model democrat he was an admirer of 
european fascism and some admirers still refer to him as 
caudillo the title taken by dictator francisco franco of spain 
in 1972 after four years of junta rule a president was 
elected but the new constitution gave complete control to gen 
omar torrijos a charismatic populist who made no bones about his 
dominance 
he not the president signed the treaties by which the united 
states turns over the panama canal at the end of the century 
torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981 in 1983 noriega his 
intelligence chief came to power 
when another election was permitted in 1984 arias madrid looked 
like a winner until the count was halted after 10 days nicolas 
ardito barletta was proclaimed victor 
noriega has since imposed and deposed presidents at will 
last year president eric delvalle tried to fire noriega after 
the general was indicted on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering 
charges in florida noriega who has denied the charges forced out 
delvalle 
manuel solis palma was named minister in charge of the 
presidency he is scheduled to turn power over to the new 
president on sept 1 
the us government imposed economic sanctions against panama in 
an attempt to oust noriega but noriega has toughed it out 
sundays vote provided little solace for democracyminded 
panamanians 
witnesses said noriegas troops moved in to seize votetally 
sheets when it looked like his candidate carlos duque was losing 
to arias madrid follower guillermo endara 
according to carter who acted as an international election 
observer noriega had believed that duque would win fairly but 
decided on a steal when things began to look bad 
the core of duques support came from the poor and from 
descendants of black caribbean immigrants many brought in to work 
on the canal 
the rebellion against noriega has been led by the middle class 
however that group has a lot to lose and does not have a 
reputation for being willing to fight for democracy 
the people will not go into the streets not because we are 
cowards but because we are not stupid why get shot and killed 
asked human rights activist otilia koster 
it will not be like the philippines she said referring to 
the militarycivlian revolt that brought millions into the streets 
to topple ferdinand marcos in 1986 
retiree carlos halphen said he didnt know what the opposition 
could do like many panamanians since the days of roosevelt he was 
looking to the north 
we want the united states to do something the us got us 
into this it should get us out he said

fire on a ship an enclosed space made 
primarily of heatconducting metal can turn into a nightmare for 
seamen trying to extinguish the blaze experts say 
the latest example came when fire broke out on the uss white 
plains killing six people and injuring five the blaze on the navy 
supply ship in the south china sea was apparently caused by a fuel 
leak officials said tuesday 
guy colonna a marine specialist with the national fire 
protection association a quincy mass organization that works to 
develop fire protection standards said a major problem confronting 
firefighters aboard a ship is restrictions on the use of water 
the way to fight fire is with water obviously at sea you 
cant add too much or you sink the vessel or impair its 
stability he said you cant pour water on it the way you 
would on land 
maj dave neudorfer who works in the navys safety and 
survivability division said water used to dampen a blaze has to be 
pumped off the ship to keep the vessel afloat 
another hazard is intense heat that builds up on a ship with 
temperatures often reaching 3000 degrees farhenheit metal 
conducts heat rapidly and an allmetal facility is not like a 
building where you have cement walls colonna said 
a navy source speaking on condition of anonymity said the heat 
on the white plains was so hot sailors were limited to fiveminute 
stints in fighting the blaze 
additionally ships are compartmentalized frequently making it 
difficult to move equipment from deck to deck colonna said an 
explosion that ripped through the no 2 gun turret of the uss iowa 
last month was contained to that area fortyseven men were killed 
colonna who was formerly in the coast guard said the navy 
trains all sailors in firefighting techniques but special 
casualty control teams spring into action when fire breaks out 
even so neudorfer said ontheground training is a 
kindergarten situation compared to a shipboard fire which 
often produces billowing smoke and toxic fumes from material used 
to coat electrical cables and insulate equipment 
repair lockers containing hoses and breathing equipment are 
normally kept at each end of the ship colonna said in a large 
ship like an aircraft carrier equipment bins are located at 
various places 
but fire affects everyone one board because it can disable a 
ships navigation and steering equipment and electricity he said 
when they have a fire its almost like a military operation 
he said its a nightmare things are going on and people have 
their jobs to do 
the navy meantime is continually trying to upgrade its ability 
to cope with fires particularly using new technologies neudorfer 
said 
were challenging the technical world to come up with fire 
resistant coating on electrical cables he said 
moreover the navy is looking at socalled sticky water that 
does not evaporate when it is doused on a fire 
on a practical level the navy recently introduced special 
firefighting coveralls for sailors and is looking at 
manufacturing taller boots 
what they found on the uss stark was that water was coming 
over the boots and burning their feet neudorfer said 
thirtyseven sailors were killed when the stark was hit by a 
iraqi missile in the persian gulf in may 1987 crew members 
battled for 24 hours to bring under control the fires set off by 
the attack

the uss white plains is an aging but essential 
support ship that serves as a floating grocery store for vessels 
assigned to the navys 7th fleet 
the 581foot food stores ship has been based at the pacific 
island of guam since 1984 and was returning there tuesday after a 
deployment to the northern arabian sea in support of persian gulf 
operations it was attached to the aircraft carrier constellation 
and its battle group during the deployment 
according to navy records the white plains is more than 20 
years old but there is no history of any past serious problems 
aboard the vessel involving accidents or its machinery 
the vessel the fourth in the socalled mars class of food 
supply ships carries the navy designation afs4 and was 
constructed by the national steel amp shipbuilding co of san diego 
calif the ships keel was laid down on oct 2 1965 it was 
launched on july 26 1966 and then commissioned into active 
service on nov 23 1968 
it has since undergone several major overhauls 
the ship has spent its entire life plying the waters of the 
pacific and indian oceans at various points calling san francisco 
and the japanese ports of sasebo and yokosuka home in addition to 
guam 
the white plains joined the fleet in time for numerous and 
lengthy deployments during the vietnam war and earned seven battle 
stars for its performance even after american troops were 
withdrawn from vietnam the white plains drew additional duty in 
the south china sea supporting warships that had been ordered to 
retrieve underwater mines sown in north vietnamese waters 
the ship has participated in training exercises with a number of 
foreign navies includes those of south korea and australia and 
also served as a mercy ship following natural catastrophes 
for example it carried relief supplies to guam and other 
islands in the mariana chain in 1976 after typhoon pamela later 
that same year the ship drew another special mission ordered 
without notice to the indian ocean to support a carrier task force 
monitoring a flareup in hostilities between kenya and uganda

the nations emergency stockpile of oil is 
losing its value as a shield against an energy crisis former 
energy secretary james schlesinger told congress 
schlesinger told a house banking subcommittee tuesday that the 
strategic petroleum reserve was being undermined by the nations 
growing appetite for imported oil 
as a protective device it offers less and less protection 
schlesinger said 
although the government is continuing to fill the oil reserve 
imports are growing even faster as a result the reserves would 
not stretch as far in an emergency as they would have just a few 
years ago he said 
the salt caverns in louisiana and texas that hold about 565 
million barrels of government crude oil could replace about 70 days 
of imports at the current import rate of 8 million barrels a day 
four years ago the oil reserve was equal to 115 days of imports 
it is particularly distressing to me that this principle 
bulwark is being undermined schlesinger said adding that 
national security is weakened as the united states grows more 
vulnerable to a cutoff of oil imports 
coincidentally energy secretary james d watkins was touring a 
strategic petroleum reserve storage site in louisiana on tuesday to 
watch a test of the system that would be used in an actual 
emergency to pump the oil out of the caverns 
the reserve which was started in 1975 in response to the arab 
oil embargo has never been used 
the united states currently relies on imports for about 44 
percent of its supplies and the energy department has projected 
the rate will reach at least 65 percent by the turn of the century 
the highest rate in us history was 46 percent in 1977 
schlesinger said the country was likely to face an even greater 
reliance on foreign oil in the 1990s as domestic oil production 
continues to decline and consumption grows 
robert w fri president of resources for the future an 
independent research institute told the subcommittee congress 
should increase the target level of the strategic petroleum reserve 
to 1 billion barrels the target under existing legislation is 750 
million barrels which is expected to be reached in 1995 
the energy department said last month in a report prepared for 
congress that it would take more than 6 billion and at least 10 
years to expand the reserve to 1 billion barrels the cost estimate 
was based on the current price of imported oil 
the report did not take a position on whether the reserve should 
be expanded but said an interagency group was making a detailed 
analysis of the costs and benefits of expansion the groups 
recommendations are due later this year

president vinicio cerezo and 
his defense minister took pains to emphasize that the military 
rebellion that sought their ouster was the work of a small sector 
of the armed forces 
at a news conference just hours after tuesdays coup attempt was 
put down they said the action was crushed with relative ease 
that the rebellion was put down without a shot being fired was 
good news indeed for cerezo and gen hector gramajo and supportive 
of the decadeold trend of militarytocivilian rule in latin 
america 
still that a coup attempt was mounted at all shows that the 
tradition of military rule dies hard nearly 3 years into cerezos 
fiveyear term guatemala is struggling to solidify the foundation 
of what would be its first modern democratic period 
civilian authority remains conditioned on military consent and 
supervision 
the army is doing everything possible so that the era of coups 
pertains to the past gramajo told the associated press in 
august three months after his forces quashed an uprising similar 
to tuesdays nonetheless traditional forces are doing 
everything possible so that it does not as of now im winning 
he would probably contend he is still winning 
it pains me to have to report on this because the action of a 
minority affects the prestige and attitude of the entire 
institution he told tuesdays news conference 
but it is difficult to imagine gramajo would candidly agree with 
cerezos sweeping declaration that the army has once again 
fulfilled its responsibility and there is no problem 
gramajo said tuesdays uprising appeared to be an attempt to 
revive the rebellion that occurred nearly a year ago 
the officers who were cashiered came up with this way of 
celebrating last years coup attempt and keeping the movement 
alive he said 
he referred to two colonels a captain and a major expelled from 
the armed forces after their bid to overthrow the government was 
thwarted last may 11 he said the four were among 12 officers 
involved in tuesdays rebellion 
gramajo last year blamed rightist civilian landowners 
businessmen and industrialists the traditional forces for 
fomenting the coup bid 
representatives of the agroexport and business organizations 
alluded to as sponsors of the rebellion denied they participated 
cerezo told the news conference that no civilians were 
immediately implicated in the latest move against him but he said 
the coup attempt would be investigated and any civilians involved 
prosecuted 
gramajo said rebel air force troops backed by two helicopter 
gunships and an a37 warplane had blocked two major highways on the 
edges of the capital tuesday and that rebel troops also tried to 
march on his home 
he said the rebels numbering at least 300 turned back when 
they encountered a superior force of loyalist troops 
gramajo and cerezo said all but two of the coup plotters were in 
custody as well as an unspecified number of soldiers 
that the subversive movement of last years plotters could be 
kept alive undermined gramajos contention that because of the 
1988 rebellion the army was stronger and more cohesive 
we had the chance to discover vulnerabilities and we corrected 
them he said in august but the military as demonstrated by 
tuesdays rebellion is not monolithic 
gramajo acknowledged in last years interview that for most of 
this century power was in the hands of a corporate institution 
comprising the business and agricultural capital and the armed 
forces their alliance provided sumptuous wealth to a tiny minority 
while relegating the majority most of whom are mayan indian 
peasants to extreme poverty 
cerezo a centrist christian democrat was bent on at least some 
redistribution of wealth when he took office though he has seen 
most of his initiatives thwarted by established interests the far 
right considers heretical even the intention to chip away at its 
privilege 
he said the most significant development in recent guatemalan 
history is the process of breaking that bond between the 
traditional sector and the army 
but he quickly added this is a process it is not yet a 
deed

former employees of a kansasbased oil company 
say they were pressured to steal oil from wells on indian land and 
their company was not alone in the practice 
gene poteet a former gauger for koch industries of wichita 
kan told a senate committee tuesday that his nephew worked for an 
oil firm that told him if he couldnt steal his wages they 
didnt need him poteet did not name the firm 
poteet and james spaulding another former gauger for koch 
testified before a special committee of the senate select committee 
on indian affairs which is investigating theft of oil from and 
underpayment of oil royalties to indians 
as gaugers both men were employed to measure oil from tanks at 
well sites into either a pipeline or onto trucks for sale by koch 
which does a large amount of business on indian oil fields 
they said the company expected them to mismeasure so that 
more oil would be received than paid for 
spaulding said that when he resisted he was informed that koch 
would send one their gaugers to reteach me 
spaulding said he worked for koch from 1984 until 1988 when he 
was fired for refusing to work sundays poteet who worked for the 
company from 1979 to 1984 said he quit because i didnt agree 
with their practices 
spaulding said when he went to work for another oil company 
union texas he caught the employee who replaced him at koch 
stealing oil from union texas union texas then canceled its 
contracts with koch he said 
donald l cordes koch industries vice president for legal and 
corporate affairs issued a statement tuesday saying testimony and 
information during the hearing was incomplete and created a false 
impression 
cordes said the senate panel didnt reveal that the socalled 
overages being attributed to koch represent a minute percentage of 
the total oil the company buys and resells he said koch crude oil 
purchases were measured short the first two months of 1989 and the 
overage for 1988 was 0023 of the total volume of crude oil handled 
and measured by the company 
this percentage is well within the range of overage 
percentages reflected in the reports of the states which compile 
that data cordes said overage reports from texas and louisiana 
for example show many other companies with higher percentages 
cordes said 
a spokesman for the senate panel said that depositions were 
taken with koch officials though they were not called to testify 
investigators told the committee that koch consistently took 
hundreds of thousands more barrels of crude oil than it paid for 
during the last three years a certain amount of mismeasuring is 
normal in the industry but not to the degree shown in documents 
subpoenaed from koch witnesses said 
the documents indicated that koch ended 1986 with 803874 more 
barrels of oil than it paid for 1987 with 671144 more barrels and 
1988 with 474281 extra barrels the value of the excess oil was 
estimated at 122 million in 1986 119 million in 1987 and 71 
million in 1988 
chris tucker an independent oil expert who investigated koch 
said most companies mismeasure accidentally but try to be as 
accurate as possible 
at years end they try to get to zero difference he said 
tucker was hired to investigate the company by a brother of the 
owner charles koch according to a senate panel spokesman who 
indicated the brothers had quarreled 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the special 
committee said findings from the investigation would be referred 
to the justice department 
all of the witnesses who testified tuesday said it is easy to 
steal oil from indian land because no one supervises the purchasers 
when they take oil from tanks at the wells 
two caudo indians from gracemont okla said they receive 
royalties from three wells in oklahoma but have noticed their 
individual checks have decreased from 3000 per month to 1000 
despite the rising price of oil 
thurmon parton and arnita gonzalez said they learned from 
investigators for the committee that a gauger from koch industries 
had been caught stealing from their wells 
neither parton nor gonzalez is employed and both say they 
depend on their royalty checks to pay their bills

the hopes and dreams of more than 3 million 
people seeking to enter the united states now rest with a computer 
designed to pluck the winners of a special visa lottery from 
their applications 
the state department announced on tuesday that some 20000 
nominees will be chosen at random by the computer making them 
eligible for visas granting entry into the country in 1991 or 1992 
the socalled visa lottery is now over 32 million people 
applied sucessfully to enter the pool of potential winners 
spokesman richard boucher told reporters 
nearriots were touched off at us embassies and diplomatic 
posts around the world after the state department announced the 
special program under which nearly anyone from 162 countries could 
apply 
telephones rang off the hook and embassy entryways were snarled 
at posts ranging from cairo egypt to bucharest romania as 
people lined up for information 
rep howard berman dcalif the author of the legislation that 
made the new program possible is slated to open the first few 
application envelopes selected by the computer and announce the 
nationalities of the nominees at a special ceremony on monday 
it gives people a little better shot than betting on the 
pennsylvania lottery berman quipped in an interview 
berman said he is pleased that his legislation has received such 
an enthusiastic response from around the world 
obviously a lot of people want to come to america he said 
the congressman said his program was designed as a stopgap 
measure in an attempt to bring some diversity to the us 
immigration flow 
normally an applicant for an immigrant visa has to have a close 
relative in the united states or work in a valued profession 
berman said he believes that there must be a fundamental 
reform of the us immigration law he has introduced separate 
legislation designed to create an independent category for 
immigrants that would allow some 60000 persons into the country 
yearly based on criteria such as their education or job skills 
it will take some months for those who have applied to know 
whether or not their applications were successful according to 
frances jones of the departments consular affairs office 
once the computer picks the applicants the names of the 
nominees will be sent to the us posts around the world which 
will in turn contact the chosen individuals she said 
if they havent heard by october they should know they 
havent been selected ms jones said 
she said she is still receiving some applications even though 
they were accepted only during the month of march 
winning the lottery doesnt automatically gain applicants entry 
they must then meet the basic requirements for entry such as 
good health and absence of criminal contacts 
those who do win a visa and come to the united states could 
apply for citizenship later on if they meet the strict criteria for 
that status ms jones added 
the last lottery for visas was held in 1986 it was more 
restrictive than the current program and allowed only 10000 visas 
with some 14 million applicants losing out 
the countries excluded from the program were those that used 
more than 5000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988 
they were china colombia dominican republic el salvador 
guyana haiti india jamaica south korea mexico the philippines 
and the united kingdom 
also excluded were natives of taiwan anguilla bermuda british 
virgin islands cayman islands falkland islands gibraltar hong 
kong montserrat pitcairn st helena and the turks and caicos 
islands

use of steroids is rampant within the 
national football league with perhaps threefourths of linemen 
linebackers and tight ends using the musclebuilding drugs in a 
desperate effort to stay competitive says allpro tackle bill 
fralic 
steroid use in football represents a vicious cycle the 
atlanta falcon player told a senate committee tuesday i know 
there are many players in high school college and the nfl who want 
to stop using steroids but they cant or wont because they dont 
believe they can be competitive without them 
the senate judiciary committee also heard an estimate from 
former pittsburgh steeler steve courson that at least half of pro 
players at socalled lineofscrimmage positions use steroids 
the estimates made by the two players however were disputed by 
two head coaches who also appeared as witnesses marty 
schottenheimer of the kansas city chiefs and chuck noll of the 
steelers 
it was the committees second hearing this year on the 
musclebuilding substances initially used by body builders and 
power lifters which were introduced into the nfl in the 1960s when 
weight training became commonplace 
a bill to ban steroids from the mail and designate them a 
controlled substance like narcotic drugs has been introduced by 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel and member sen strom 
thurmond rsc 
but witnesses could not agree on how widespread the problem is 
nfl commissioner pete rozelle cited an official league estimate 
that 6 percent to 7 percent of players use steroids but conceded 
that figure might not be accurate 
i thought thats a low figure i thought it might be 
higher rozelle said 
biden asked schottenheimer and noll to comment on estimates that 
50 percent to 70 percent of nfl players use steroids 
i would have difficulty senator in imagining that it would 
be that high said schottenheimer 
i cant imagine that figure as being completely accurate 
said noll 
but fralic estimated that exclusive of quarterbacks running 
backs and wide receivers its probably 75 percent he said 
steroid use was far more prevalant among offensive linemen 
defensive linemen linebackers and tight ends 
courson also said positions requiring bulk and muscle along the 
line of scrimmage are the ones with the most steroid users at 
least 50 percent among linemen 
nfl owners cant grasp this problem fralic said they 
havent been living in the middle of the steroid madness they 
cant see their friends affected by it 
he also charged that coaches at every level turn their back to 
the steroids situation 
high school coaches are trying to build an impressive record 
for their resume or to build their status within a community 
fralic said college coaches face tremendous pressure to win and 
pro coaches are judged on only one basis their winloss record 
the cycle keeps repeating itself and a monster problem is growing 
noll expressed doubts that steroids actually benefit players 
but both players as well as coaches joe paterno of penn state 
and bo schembechler of michigan told the committee that steroids 
do enhance performance 
i could not tell you for sure that we do not have kids taking 
steroids paterno said despite the presence of a university 
testing program 
he said penn state is considering inserting a steroids clause 
into its game contracts with other schools in an effort to avoid 
placing the nittany lions in competition with teams with an unfair 
chemical advantage 
in other testimony gene upshaw executive director of the 
national football league players association told the panel a poll 
of players indicated that 75 percent of the union opposes random 
testing for steroid use 
fralic however said his own poll of the falcons showed 80 
percent of the players would go along with random testing the 20 
percent who opposed such testing feared how management might 
respond to positive tests he said 
steroids are illegal if bought sold or imported without a 
prescription health experts say prolonged use of the drug without 
proper supervision can contribute to heart trouble sexual and 
reproductive disorders immune deficiencies liver problems 
psychological disturbances and growth disorders

the bush white house is treading carefully 
over the issue of a pardon for oliver north whom the president has 
several times called a hero its clearly a touchy subject 
on tuesday bush declared he had wanted all along to see him 
exonerated but declined to comment further on last weeks guilty 
verdicts he brushed aside a question on whether he was considering 
a pardon for north 
at the white house officials apparently dont like the word 
consider when it comes to talking about a pardon for the 
retired marine lieutenant colonel 
we dont have any comment on the north trial or the 
conclusion presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told 
reporters after the former white house aide was convicted of three 
felony counts in the irancontra affair and we havent discussed 
a pardon 
asked what that meant fitzwater said there has been no 
discussion of a pardon whatsoever 
a reporter then asked fitzwater point blank could you put it 
direct and just say the presidents not considering a pardon for 
mr north 
the president has not discussed a pardon he said 
well what does that mean 
fitzwater it means he hasnt discussed it 
is he considering it or will he consider it 
fitzwater he hasnt discussed it 
who is he supposed to discuss it with 
fitzwater anybody 
a day later fitzwater was again asked any change about the 
consideration or lack of consideration of a pardon for ollie 
north 
not discussing it fitzwater said 
the president wasnt much in the mood for discussing it either 
on tuesday when he was asked by a reporter whether he believed 
north to be innocent 
im not going to argue with the courts bush said the 
process is being appealed hes entitled to the right of appeal 
without a lot of editorial comment from me although ive already 
given you some 
when he was asked if he believed in shredding documents one of 
the counts on which north was convicted bush joked i believe 
in taking them with me 
late last month the president told reporters aboard air force 
one that he wouldnt even think about a pardon until the legal 
proceedings were over and that he hadnt discussed it with 
anyone even his wife 
the issue of a pardon for north is a stick of political dynamite 
for the president who over the past several years repeatedly has 
had to deny his own role in the covert dealings that were at the 
heart of the case against north 
bush has denied any advance knowledge of the reagan 
administrations efforts to sell arms to iran and to divert the 
profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
and just last week he insisted that a trip he made to honduras 
in 1985 a trip disclosed by a document released in the north 
trial was not part of a scheme to exchange increased aid to 
honduras for help with the contras 
still despite these denials the subject of bushs involvement 
or lack of involvement continues to linger 
some democratic critics have said they find it difficult to 
believe that bush a former cia chief who claimed he was in on most 
major reagan administration decisions as vice president could have 
been as in the dark as he claims 
bush is no doubt mindful of the political backlash that 
developed when then president ford pardoned former president nixon 
in 1974 that action proved extremely unpopular among americans 
but at the same time north is highly regarded among 
conservatives many of whom view him as a patriot one who was 
just following orders 
bush probably isnt discussing the decision with others at the 
white house says stephen hess a scholar who specializes in the 
presidency at the brookings institution 
george bush seems to have a habit of making these big ones all 
by himself and they sometimes turn out to be surprises like his 
choice of dan quayle as his running mate 
im not sure what hell do but im sure that whatever it is 
it will come from his gut said hess and the analyst added 
bushs decision on north will likely be based on inside information 
he knows something that the rest of us dont know to what 
degree oliver north was an unguided missile hess said

i king jordan didnt hear the applause 
filling the senate hearing room when he finished his impassioned 
plea for legislation to shield 43 million disabled americans from 
discrimination 
but the deaf president of gallaudet university could see it loud 
and clear 
two signers had played jordans every word on their fingers 
during his testimony tuesday 
when he finished they were joined by dozens of others in the 
audience in an unmistakable visual display as they held their hands 
over their heads and waggled their fingers merrily in rhythm with 
the sound of those clapping their hands together 
it was an unusual hearing of the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
the no 3 house democrat rep tony coelho of california 
started it off by describing how he felt suicidal after being 
thrown out of a seminary because of his epilepsy until entertainer 
bob hope convinced him to pursue his dreams of service by turning 
to politics 
before the hearing was over sen paul simon dill pulled a 
hearing aid from his right ear and held it aloft while recounting 
in his booming baritone how an older colleague had approached him 
when his own hearing started to fail and asked about the stigma of 
wearing a hearing aid 
sen tom harkin diowa lead author of the legislation 
introduced tuesday said he had not meant to wax personal but 
after jordans testimony harkin was moved to talk about his own 
deaf brother who when taken to a special school for the deaf many 
years ago was told there were three areas of training open to him 
cobbler printer or baker 
he became a baker recalled harkin 
the senator who was chairing the hearing at the time paused 
for a moment clearly reflecting on his nowretired brother 
he never wanted to be a baker he said quietly 
sen orrin g hatch rutah called his brotherinlaw who was 
stricken by polio one of the greatest heroes i know he spoke 
cryptically but with quiet emotion of physically carrying the 
disabled man through a mormon temple in los angeles and of loving 
him as a brother 
hatch was the only committee member who voiced any reservations 
about the bill but he emphasized that his problems were not with 
its intent but with some details 
im dedicated to working this out said hatch 
there is not a disabled american alive today who has not 
experienced some form of discrimination jordan said at the 
outset of his testimony 
speaking in a loud clear voice full of passion jordan who 
lost his hearing in a motorcycle accident when he was 21 
recounted how he became the first deaf president of the university 
for the deaf last year after the students rose up against 
appointment of another hearing president 
jordan noted that legislation creating the washington school was 
signed 125 years ago by president abraham lincoln 
during the past 125 years conditions of deaf and other 
disabled americans have slowly improved but i regret to state we 
remain today far short of the american dream so eloquently 
proclaimed by dr martin luther king jordan said 
he suggested the student movement that brought about his 
appointment captured the hearts of people throughout the nation 
and said he hoped the spirit they showed would accrue to the 
bled and minority groups everywhere 
even though the harkis widespread support it remains 
controversial because its provisions would extend to people 
infected with the aids virus and would impose certain costs on 
private employers to make special provisions for handicapped

similar legislation failed last year but harkin said revisions 
have been made to eliminate some of the opposition 
for example the new bill would require that only new buses used 
in public transit systems would be required to have special 
boarding aids for the handicapped rather than saying all buses 
must be retrofitted with susen edward m kennedy dmass the committee

top officials of tufts university and mit 
insist they did not whitewash their findings when they investigated 
a scientists challenge of a colleagues article in a scientific 
journal 
the university officials said tuesday that review panels took 
seriously the complaint of former massachusetts institute of 
technology researcher margot otoole but believed she overstated 
deficiencies in the article 
ms otoole told the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee she lost her job at mit and her reputation was smeared 
after she complained to both universities about the article 
published in the journal cell in april 1986 
she testified that those who reviewed her complaint from the two 
schools later accused her of stealing data lying refusing to 
accept alternative interpretations and being unable to distinguish 
between important and trivial issues 
the article dealt with the immune responses of mice bred with an 
extra immune system gene from another species ms otoole 
attempted to show the conclusions of the paper were not supported 
by the original laboratory data 
one of the authors was thereza imanishikari who is now on the 
faculty of tufts but in 1986 was in charge of the mit laboratory 
where ms otoole worked 
john deutch provost of mit told the subcommittee that 
reviewers found that otoole was correct in contending there was an 
error in the article but decided it was not flagrant and a 
correction was not warranted 
at the conclusion of the review i concurred in the judgment 
that the issues raised did not imply misconduct deutch said 
any suggestion of misconduct in research is viewed with 
concern 
our selfinterest in our reputation as a leading research 
university required that the integrity of our research be our first 
priority 
henry wortis a pathology professor at tufts and one of those 
who reviewed the challenge said investigations at his school mit 
and the national institutes of health found the original 
conclusions of the paper are legitimate i stress this point the 
conclusions are correct 
wortis also criticized the committee probe as yet another 
inquiry this time by nonscientists into the same matter 
ms otoole said i challenged the paper because it 
represented evidence that simply did not exist period this is not 
a complicated concept it is one thing to believe that something is 
true it is another to present experimental evidence in support of 
the claim 
a review panel convened by nih said that although there was no 
fraud or misrepresentation errors had occurred that should be 
corrected the nih investigation was reopened after two members of 
the review panel were replaced when it was revealed they had ties 
to one of the authors 
a report from secret service experts said at least five and 
possibly 25 pages in one of ms imanishikaris notebooks were 
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page and at 
least two dates were changed 
ms otoole told the subcommittee she was forced to take a job 
outside the field of science because of her challenge she said she 
learned that highlevel tufts administrators were told she made a 
charge of fraud without justification when it fact she had not 
charged the article was fraudulent 
she said she heard the mit faculty was accusing me of 
purloining or stealing laboratory notes i had never done such a 
thing but i have since confirmed that this is how they described 
my attempts to behave in a professionally responsible manner

legislation requiring the oil industry to 
train emergency response teams to quickly handle spills would help 
protect the entire american coastline says the new jersey 
congressman who introduced the bill 
rep jim saxton rnj proposed the clean ocean act of 1989 on 
tuesday to help mitigate the environmental hazards of oil spills 
he said he hoped to garner strong bipartisan support for the 
measure which is already backed by colleagues in california rhode 
island florida and hawaii 
the thrust of what we are doing today focuses on the entire 
american coastline saxton said at a news conference the fact 
of the matter is that an oil spill can occur anywhere anywhere 
oil is produced where it is transported and where it is refined 
saxton was named chairman in february of the republican research 
committees clean oceans task force 
eight oil refineries are located along the delaware river near 
his district last year more than threequarters of the 66 million 
tons of cargo that moved through delaware river ports were 
petroleum products he said 
saxton said his legislation would ensure that industryfunded 
emergency crews can respond within five hours to spills such as the 
march 24 accident that dumped 10 million gallons of crude oil into 
prince william sound alaska when the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground on a reef 
that spill continues to spur legislation 
sen frank r lautenberg dnj expressing concern about the 
possibility of a major oil spill in new york harbor on monday 
announced plans to introduce a bill requiring coast guard review 
and approval of oil spill contingency plans 
the measure would hold the federal government responsible for 
determining when a cleanup was complete and would establish an oil 
spill liability fund for cleanups if private companies lacked the 
resources 
on tuesday sen ted stevens ralaska introduced a legislative 
package to create a 500 million oil spill research and restoration 
fund financed through a pennyabarrel tax on refined domestic and 
imported oil the measure also would give the coast guard the 
authority to assume immediate control of large or lifethreatening 
oil spills in prince william sound and use industry funds in 
response to a major spill 
another stevens bill would require tankers crossing the sound to 
have equipment and vessels in place in the event of a spill and to 
conduct practice drills at least twice a year his measures would 
allow oil companies to be sued in federal court if cleanup promises 
were broken 
saxtons bill requires regionally located emergency teams to be 
in place by jan 1 1991 they must be certified by the coast guard 
and subject to unannounced periodic drills 
violators face fines of 500000 to 1 million with chief 
executive officers assuming liability he said 
capt richard larrabee chief of the coast guards environmental 
response division said current federal policy holds a spiller 
responsible for timely and effective cleanup of his own spill 
in effect if the federal onscene coordinator determines that 
spiller is not acting effectively then he steps in using federal 
resources and cleans it up larrabee said 
in addition the coast guard has contingency plans in place for 
each of its approximately 48 ports 
states also may regulate the industry

a group of chinese economists is backing a 
radical proposal to use chinese labor and japanese capital to 
develop the soviet far east the worlds largest untapped 
depository of natural resources 
the ministry of agriculture meanwhile is considering a 
massive cooperation program with the soviet union to grow crops 
and process food in chinas northeast 
the proposals represent a new vision of sovietchinese economic 
relations which now consist mainly of exchanging lowquality 
russian wood and iron ore for chinese thermoses and canned foods 
both plans were formulated earlier this year as china and soviet 
officials haggled over the countries first summit in 30 years 
president mikhail s gorbachev will come to china on may 15 
accompanied by trade representatives ready to discuss economic 
relations 
the proposals stem from a realization that the current barter 
and border trade has its limits 
ten years ago there was little trade between the countries last 
year they signed contracts for about 325 billion in goods but 
because of transportation bottlenecks 25 percent of the soviet 
goods and 40 percent of the chinese products were not delivered 
thousands of tons of goods also were returned because they were 
shoddy 
theres lots of hoopla about recordsetting trade figures and 
contracts but theres little future in that said fan yueqiang 
head of the institute of development studies a think tank in 
beijing 
we only sell each other things we cant sell for foreign 
exchange he said they send us lowquality wood and we send 
them secondclass canned food 
fan and his deputy han xiaofeng believe the future of 
chinesesoviet trade is in combining soviet technical skill and 
natural resources with chinese labor and capital from third 
countries such as japan and south korea 
labor export began last year when more than 100 chinese 
construction workers went to zabaikalsk a soviet town that borders 
chinas inner mongolia there they built a gymnasium dormitories 
and a dining hall earlier in the year 77 peasants were given 
1000 acres to grow cucumbers and watermelons in the soviet union 
north of vladivostok on the coast of the sea of japan 
weve found that if you put a tie around the neck of a chinese 
peasant and send him over the border he turns into an agricultural 
expert han said 
both projects were successful this year the official xinhua 
news agency reported more than 10000 chinese laborers will work 
in the soviet union on a variety of projects involving agriculture 
forestry fisheries and mining 
the proposal for the soviet far east has its roots in a series 
of plans stretching back decades to tap east asias vast economic 
wealth 
senior chinese government officials have quietly expressed 
backing for the plan and the soviet embassy in beijing has met 
with its proponents japan would provide the capital and 
newspapers in that nation have been abuzz with reports 
fan and han have a personal interest in the project 
during the ultraleftist cultural revolution they spent about 
eight years planting rice in the mosquitoinfested fields of 
longwangmiao in a fareastern corner of heilongjiang province 
along the soviet border 
like many chinese from the cities they were sent to the 
countryside to farm and cleanse their minds of urban ways 
i lost my youth in that province said fan now in his 
mid40s but i also got to know it i understand clearly the 
possibilities for economic ties with the soviets 
the first step fan said is for china and the soviet union to 
carry out joint ventures 
in the 1950s when relations between the countries were close 
soviet advisers worked on hundreds of projects around china as part 
of moscows support for the communist bloc 
we dont want to see a return to those days of big brothers 
help fan said what we want now is business partners 
the countries are already discussing the possible sale of a 
nuclear power plant to china and officials in chinas remote 
xinjiang province want soviet help in mining and drilling for oil 
and gas 
next the investment power of japan and south korea must be 
brought into play 
for years japanese businessmen have been wanting to get a 
piece of siberia fan said but one of the main problems was 
labor chinese labor is cheap and our workers are hardy

us automakers say theyre working all out to 
eliminate an ozonedestroying coolant from car air conditioners 
and a vermont ban on the substance wont help 
all theyre really doing is hindering our progress from a 
longerterm point of view says norm nielsen supervisor of 
government regulatory programs at chrysler corp 
the last thing we need is having separate standards in 
states 
vermonts legislature last week enacted a bill to outlaw the 
registration of cars with air conditioners using 
chlorofluorocarbons beginning with the 1993 model year gov 
madeleine kunin has hailed the bill and is expected to sign it 
within two weeks 
despite years of research into a replacement coolant the 
nations big three automakers say they doubt they can meet the 
deadline 
there is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify its 
entire car line for vermont in essentially three years said ford 
motor co spokeswoman beryl goldsweig 
car air conditioners were singled out partly because they use 
cfc12 the chlorofluorocarbon thats considered most damaging to 
the ozone layer home refrigerators use a different type of cfc 
when cfc molecules rise into the atmosphere they break down 
ozone that envelops the earth 15 to 20 miles up scientists say 
that lets in extra solar radiation increasing the incidence of 
skin cancer and eye disease and damaging plants and animals crucial 
to the food chain 
lobbyist joan mulhern of the vermont public interest research 
group has testified that car air conditioners are the nations 
single biggest source of ozone depletion producing 266 percent of 
the cfcs released into the environment she cited us 
environmental protection agency studies published in 1987 
one of the options available to automakers is simply not selling 
cars with air conditioners in vermont 
although roughly 90 percent of all new cars sold nationally are 
equipped with air conditioning only about half are in vermont 
said charles ffolliott the states representative of the national 
automotive dealers association the states average july high 
temperature is a moderate 70 degrees 
for years the automakers have had to live with stiffer tailpipe 
emission regulations for vehicles sold in california but changing 
a car to meet those requirements is relatively simple they say 
ridding air conditioners of cfcs is much more complex than 
merely substituting a new coolant the companies say 
the whole system has to be changed said douglas mark an 
emission engineer for general motors corp theres got to be 
compressor and evaporator changes materials have to be 
reevaluated for seals and hoses 
most of the research for a replacement coolant is going into a 
substance labeled 134a it contains no cfcs but isnt as efficient 
as cfc12 so air conditioners using 134a would have to be larger 
automakers also say they are having trouble finding a lubricant 
that can stand up to 134a and that tests to ensure the substance 
carries no health risks wont be complete in time to meet the 
vermont deadline 
chryslers nielsen said the vermont law if imitated by other 
states has the potential of slowing down work on an ozonefriendly 
air conditioner 
but the automakers protests dont bother vermonts governor 
we are a role model and we may be a role model for the us 
congress kunin said 
cfcs were developed as a refrigerant in 1930 by a general motors 
chemist and had been considered ideal because they are nontoxic 
and noncombustible they are used widely as coolants and as 
propellants such as in spray cans 
under vermonts bill the sale of cfcpropelled noisemakers and 
plastic party streamers as well as noncommercial or 
nonindustrial uses of cfcs for cleaning photographic or electronic 
equipment would be banned next year 
supporters say it is the most farreaching of any of the two 
dozen ozoneprotection bills introduced in state legislatures this 
year hawaiis legislature is the only other to have passed an 
ozone protection measure 
vermonts went farther than hawaiis which banned the release 
of cfcs from car air conditioners during repairs

even though president bush has cut 65 billion 
from projected pentagon budgets the defense department will still 
be 100 billion short over the next five years unless more programs 
are reduced according to the general accounting office 
about half the shortfall stems from unrealistically low 
assumptions about the future rate of inflation the congressional 
watchdog agency told the house armed services committee 
the report which was scheduled to be released today was 
described by sources who declined to be identified 
the gao study involves the fiveyear pentagon budget which is 
updated annually and forms the basis for future defense department 
budget decisions such as which weapons to buy 
according to the gao all the spending in the current fiveyear 
plan would cost more than 15 trillion but the sources said the 
actual spending projections are about 100 billion less than that 
the gao report is part of an ongoing debate between the 
administration and the democraticcontrolled congress about the 
cost of defense spending 
for the past four years congress has reduced or frozen the 
pentagon budgets and administration critics have charged that the 
pentagon is making unrealistic plans for future spending when 
those plans are changed economic problems result according to the 
critics 
unrealistic planning means the defense department might be 
forced to cancel weapons systems after they are started as 
evidenced by the current debate over the v22 osprey the marine 
corps plane recently canceled by defense secretary dick cheney 
the gao report notes that bush administration budget planners 
are assuming that inflation will drop to 17 percent by 1994 and 
calls that projection unrealistic the sources said 
according to the sources that unrealistic figure will account 
for about half the 100 billion 
most of the rest arises from plans by the army navy marines 
and air forces to buy weapons that they wont be able to afford in 
future years because of the current budget crunch the sources 
quoted the gao report as saying 
bush reduced by about 65 billion the projected defense budgets 
for fiscal 1990 through fiscal 1994 but according to the gao more 
reductions are needed the sources said

jesse jackson could easily defeat district of 
columbia mayor marion s barry jr if an election were held today 
between the mayor and the civil rights leader a new poll says 
according to the poll in todays washington post jackson would 
win 68 percent of the vote to 17 percent for barry the poll also 
found that barry would lose to police chief maurice a turner jr 
60 percent to 24 percent and to three other possible challengers 
barry has been facing declining support because of questionable 
behavior and mounting city problems 
despite jacksons strong support nearly half of those polled 
said the former presidential candidate should stay out of the 
mayoral race while 40 percent approved of his running jackson 
recently said he would consider moving from chicago to washington 
where he owns a house and making a bid for mayor if barry decided 
not to run 
jackson would be required to establish residence in the district 
for one year before the november 1990 election to be allowed to run 
barry for years was considered politically untouchable despite a 
series of political missteps and the legal woes of many close 
friends and associates 
however his popularity has been slipping since his visit to the 
hotel room of a suspected drug dealer charles lewis in december 
which sparked an investigation into the citys controversial 
involvement in a personnel project involving the virgin islands 
government 
lewis was convicted of cocaine trafficking charges in the virgin 
islands last month and has been indicted in washington on 16 counts 
of conspiracy drug trafficking and perjury 
if barry chooses to run again he would enter the race less 
popular than any of his potential rivals according to a post 
telephone survey of 1021 registered voters conducted between april 
28 and may 7 six out of 10 disapprove of barrys performance as 
mayor 
barry dismissed the poll results saying its clear to me 
that the washington post wants me out of office and this poll fits 
its plan 
barry and all of his potential rivals are democrats although 
turner has indicated that if he chooses to run he may run as an 
independent or republican 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage 
points

a prosecutors decision to charge a woman with 
manslaughter for the cocaineinduced death of her 2dayold 
daughter could backfire and scare other pregnant drug abusers from 
seeking help social workers say 
some medical and legal professionals also disagree with 
winnebago county states attorney paul loglis decision monday to 
charge melanie green who became the second rockford woman in a 
week to be taken to court for exposing an unborn child to cocaine 
it could very well drive these cocaineabusing mothers 
underground said spokesman dave schneidman of the state 
department of children and family services 
you want to develop an atmosphere where they know they can 
come into the healthcare system and not be penalized a punitive 
approach is not going to benefit the children said dr ira j 
chasnoff at northwestern university medical school who has 
directed studies on the effects of prenatal cocaine use 
early treatment for drug abuse works better he said 
the concern is that lowincome women who dont have access to 
educational and medical programs that middleclass women do 
might avoid the system altogether said attorney colleen connell 
with the american civil liberties union in chicago 
the prosecutor defended his decision as a desire to protect 
children 
the actions of this office reflect the concern sometimes the 
outrage of this community that children are born at risk both 
at birth and for many years logli said in a telephone interview 
from rockford 85 miles northwest of chicago 
the aim is to protect children 
ms greens baby bianca died feb 4 an autopsy said the 
infant died of oxygen deprivation linked to cocaine exposure late 
in the pregnancy 
ms green 24 also was charged with delivery of a controlled 
substance to a minor logli said 
involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishable by two to five 
years in prison the prosecutor said ms green could face a 14year 
maximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge she was 
released on 3500 bond arraignment is scheduled may 31 logli 
said 
schneidman said 90 percent of illinois cocaine babies are in 
cook county 1095 of the 1233 cases reported in 1988 
infants exposed to cocaine tripled to 27 in rockford during the 
past year compared to the previous year logli said 
prenatal exposure can cause numerous health problems including 
low birth weight impaired motor ability irritability that can 
hinder learning strokes and seizures 
when a child dies after events that occurred while the child 
was still in the womb the law provides protection for that child 
and allows for prosecution of the person who causes those events 
he said 
my job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events where 
violation of the law works toward the harm of others logli said 
logli said he was unaware of any similiar deaths in illinois or 
elsewhere 
on may 1 a judge in rockford convicted a juvenile mother of 
child abuse and neglect for cocaine exposure during pregnancy the 
child who shows no ill effects at 3 months was temporarily 
removed from her custody 
a florida woman was charged with child abuse and delivery of a 
drug in december after her child was born addicted to cocaine 
prosecutors said it was the first such case in that state 
in 1987 a california judge dismissed a charge of failure to 
provide medical care to a child lodged against a woman whose son 
was born brain damaged and later died prosecutors accused her of 
ignoring a doctors advice not to abuse drugs

the tokyo stock exchanges key index declined 
today and the dollar fell from an eightmonth high against the yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 3952 
points or 012 percent following a 10337point decline on 
tuesday and closed at 3399235 
dealers said the index declined as foreign investors sold 
shares also they said others held back from buying after remarks 
by bank of japan gov satoshi sumita seen as indicating possible 
interest rate increases which usually discourage stock buying 
sumita told an upper house budget committee session today that 
the central bank will take necessary measures whenever 
necessary on interest rates to deter inflationary pressure 
market participants believe the bank of japan is likely to raise 
its key rate by at least 05 percentage points in late may to ease 
upward pressure on prices 
kazuhiro nomura of new japan securities co said the stock 
market showed little positive reaction to the yens recovery 
against the dollar today 
the dollar closed at 13444 yen down 056 yen from tuesdays 
close it opened at 13442 yen and ranged between 13415 yen and 
13453 yen 
the dollars 13500 yen closing tuesday was its highest since 
13560 yen last sept 6 
although the yen recovered from yesterdays 135yen level 
stock players took it as rather neutral and it didnt encourage 
them much nomura said 
he said foreign investors selling spot issues to buy cheaper 
futures issues also contributed to the nikkeis fall 
trading was moderate with first section volume estimated at 900 
million shares down from tuesdays 1 billion 
masafumi koyama of the bank of tokyo said todays currency 
trading was mixed with traders buying and selling dollars 
but that doesnt mean the dollars recent uptrend was totally 
reversed he said 
he said a large demand for the dollar remains considering 
that japanese investors have been buying the dollar without 
specific economic reasons

with potent symbols familiar faces and 
even a lesson on how to vote solidaritys first 45minute show was 
broadcast on government television under an accord giving it 
limited access to the mass media 
at 1045 pm tuesday the words studio solidarnosc popped 
up on the screen followed by the redandwhite national flag and 
then another solidarity sign with the wellknown union logo 
solidarity leader lech walesa joked i dont know what i came 
here for as he walked into the studio filled with union banners 
because this is the first historic entrance of solidarity 
its not that they the staterun tv only speak about solidarity 
its simply for the first time that we are given a chance to 
speak answered the host 
walesa immediately launched into an appeal for support of 
partially free elections june 4 to the sejm or lower house and 
the senate 
we have been waiting for very long for the moment when poles 
in a limited way will be able to speak about the countrys 
problems to take part in deciding about the fate of this 
country he said 
roundtable agreements reached april 5 reinstated solidarity 
after a sevenyear ban and allowed the opposition to run for 161 
seats of the 460member sejm and for the new 100member senate 
the agreements also guarantee the opposition access to mass 
media 
the solidarity television program will be broadcast once a week 
for 45 minutes on tuesday nights at either 10 or 1045 pm 
also as of today solidarity will have a portion of halfhour 
official election studio broadcasts every evening until the 
vote regional nightly news programs will also have short section 
of solidarity information 
a halfhour weekly show on governmentcontrolled radio had its 
first broadcast on april 28 and the opposition published the first 
issue of a masscirculation daily newspaper on monday 
all the opposition broadcasts and publications are subject to 
the same censorship as government media 
walesa dominated the first half of the broadcast 
he was shown laying flowers at a monument in gdansk to workers 
killed in price riots on the baltic coast in 1970 then greeting 
solidaritys candidates to the sejm and senate at a meeting april 
29 at the gdansk shipyard where the independent union was born in 
1980 
the program showed interviews with prosolidarity students 
campaign workers collecting signatures needed to put candidates on 
the ballot for the june vote and then a series of people saying 
why they would vote 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz urged voters 
to make sure they learn and remember the names of the candidates 
backed by solidarity since the ballots will list only their names 
and not affiliations 
he told people not to worry about the authorities list of 
candidates since in that part the elections are not free 
once the roundtable talks began in february government 
television began showing short bits of his news conferences 
meetings and rallies with extensive coverage of walesas trip to 
rome in april to meet with pope john paul ii

the opposition labor partys leadership in a move 
to broaden public support after a decade out of power has 
abandoned the partys unpopular policy of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament 
at the urging of party leader neil kinnock labors national 
executive committee voted 178 on tuesday for a policy under which 
a laborled government would only scrap britains independent 
nuclear arsenal as part of a negotiated arms control deal 
hardline leftists accused labor of betraying its principles 
but kinnock once an ardent unilateralist said the doctrine had 
not won the support of likeminded politicians in other countries 
including the united states france and the soviet union 
unilateralism is not even comprehended by those who share our 
objectives in other countries he said 
they were totally uncomprehending that we should want to get 
rid of a nuclear system without getting elimination of nuclear 
weapons on other sides too without getting anything for it in 
return he said 
the executive committee also voted 169 to defeat a motion by 
hardline leftists to set a deadline for unilaterally scrapping 
britains submarineborne nuclear missiles 
the committee adopted an unopposed amendment that says a labor 
government would negotiate nuclear disarmament with the soviet 
union if ussoviet negotiations stalled 
labor embraced unilateralism in 1981 and the policy has been 
cited as a key reason for its two subsequent defeats by the 
conservatives under prime minister margaret thatcher who believes 
nuclear deterrence alone can maintain world peace 
kinnock and other party chiefs are trying to kill a widespread 
perception that labor is dominated by doctrinaire leftwingers and 
draw the party back to the political center 
labor currently holds 226 of the 650 seats in the 
conservativedominated house of commons 
out of power we do not have the opportunities of unilateral 
or any other sort of disarmament kinnock said we only have 
the chance to talk about it in power we can act and make dramatic 
progress 
leftist hardliners said they would fight to restore the 
unilateralism doctrine at labors annual convention in october the 
convention must approve all policy changes 
the executive committee also adopted unopposed a resolution 
saying nuclear weapons are not a deterrent and of no practical 
use 
answering questions in parliament tuesday mrs thatcher said 
she expected the outcome within labor to be unilateralism in a 
different wrapping 
defense secretary george younger said to arm yourself with a 
deterrent which you then say you will not use would be about as 
effective as a feather duster 
labors foreign affairs chief gerald kaufman said the new 
policy is in line with most of britains nato partners 
thatcher became prime minister in may 1979 after a victory in 
parliamentary elections that forced out labors james callaghan

high school boys have an unfair edge over girls 
in winning lucrative national merit scholarships a new report 
claims 
nearly 63 percent of the 15000 semifinalists competing for this 
years 6000 merit scholarships are boys said the report by 
fairtest a cambridge massbased research group critical of 
standardized tests 
the report said more scholarships go to boys because the 
national merit scholarship corporation of evanston ill uses the 
standardized preliminary scholastic aptitude test as the sole 
criterion for determining semifinalists 
the nonprofit corporation distributes some 24 million in 
scholarships a year ranging from 500 to 8000 each 
critics including fairtest contend that the psat a multiple 
choice exam similar to the scholastic aptitude test is biased 
against females 
thirtyone percent of this years semifinalists are girls 
according to the statebystate analysis that examined the first 
names of winners the genders of the remaining 6 percent couldnt 
be determined from their names 
in previous surveys fairtest found 601 percent of merit 
scholars were boys in 198788 and 61 percent were males in 198687 
marianne roderick the scholarship corporations executive vice 
president termed the report misleading and challenged the bias 
charge she said that while the psat is used to determine 
semifinalists actual scholarship winners are chosen on their 
academic record leadership potential and other personal qualities 
in 34 years we have never based our scholarship decisions 
solely on a test she said 
the college board sponsors the psat taken annually by more than 
1 million students mostly high school juniors the educational 
testing service administers the exam 
test critics claimed a victory in februarywhen a federal judge 
ruled that new york state scholarship programs discriminated 
against women because winners were selected solely on the basis of 
sat scores 
theres no excuse for national merits continued reliance on a 
biased test when a federal court has ruled that using similar exams 
to select scholarship winners constitutes sex discrimination 
said cinthia schuman fairtests executive director 
she said it was too soon to confirm fairtests figures for 1989 
since scholarship winners wont be announced until later this month 
in the achievement program aimed at awarding 700 merit 
scholarships to black students women outnumbered male winners by 
5842 percent said roderick that competition requires information 
about high school coursework leadership qualities and other 
criteria 
the dispute over whether standardized tests like the sat and 
psat are biased against female students has heated up lately 
following the new york state court victory by the american civil 
liberties union a report last month by the center for women policy 
studies identified 23 test questions used in a 1987 sat exam in 
which one sex outperformed the other by at least 10 percent in all 
but two of those questions boys bested girls 
the college board and ets have issued repeated statements lately 
denying the charge of test bias the testmakers contend that women 
are less likely than men to take advanced math science and other 
college prep courses in high school

renewed ethnic violence and more strikes have been 
reported in the disputed southern region of nagornokarabakh 
prompting authorities to tighten security in the armenian enclave 
inside soviet azerbaijan 
at least seven people have been injured since friday in violence 
that shattered a fourmonth calm tass reported tuesday 
the official news agency seemed to leave open the possibility of 
more unrest saying the situation remained tense and complex 
and that calls were growing louder for an extended general strike 
and civil disobedience campaign 
armenian residents of nagornokarabakh said by telephone 
saturday that they had started new strikes 
military and civilian officials increased surveillance on roads 
lengthened a curfew and posted soldiers between armenian and 
azerbaijani neighborhoods tass reported 
when the lives of children women and old men are in danger 
the government cannot stand by this is the allimportant task 
now said arkady i volsky head of a committee created by moscow 
to administer nagornokarabakh quoted by tass 
threefourths of nagornokarabakhs 162000 people are ethnic 
armenians most of whom are christian but it is an enclave in 
predominantly moslem azerbaijan to which it was assigned in 1923 
demonstrations for annexation of nagornokarabakh began in 
armenia in february 1988 and trouble resulted in both of the 
neighboring republics that border iran 
more than 90 people were killed in armenia and azerbaijan last 
year in ethnic strife in january the kremlin put nagornokarabakh 
under moscows direct control in an attempt to halt the bloodshed 
the tass report tuesday said many ethnic armenian residents 
distrust volskys committee and still want an end to 
nagornokarabakhs association with azerbaijan it said the case 
was stated in an open letter to president mikhail s gorbachev from 
the regions communist party and government leaders printed in the 
official newspaper sovietsky karabakh 
tass gave this account of the violence 
soldiers and police fired into the air friday to disperse a huge 
brawl in kirkidzhan village outside stepanakert the territorial 
capital that began when three armenians attacked azerbaijanis 
three civilians and four soldiers were injured when authorities 
intervened to restore order and four cars and a motorcycle were 
damaged 
on saturday rocks thrown from a car smashed windows of a bus 
traveling from armenias capital yerevan to martuni in 
northeastern nagornokarabakh the azerbaijani driving the car and 
two passengers were charged with hooliganism 
stones were thrown at other buses or cars entering 
nagornokarabakh from armenia or azerbaijan 
the news agency said strikes had immobilized industries 
construction sites and some government offices 
workers and employees of azerbaijani nationality are not being 
allowed to work in industries and offices in stepanakert and 
armenians are afraid to go to work in shushe a predominantly 
azerbaijani town tass said 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said by telephone from yerevan 
last week that the strikes were caused in part by reports that 
volsky had ordered the settling of more azerbaijanis in 
nagornokarabakh 
valery a sidorov a government official in nagornokarabakh 
said in a telephone interview saturday that there had been no 
influx of azerbaijanis and armenians who had fled were returning 
tass said 20 percent of stepanakerts residents and 10 percent 
of the entire regions population had fled since the trouble began

alzheimers disease patients with 
depression showed slower decline in some behavioral measures than 
other patients did in a new study a finding researchers say was a 
surprise 
it may mean that depression signals a form of alzheimers that 
follows a more benign behavioral course said study coauthor 
blaine greenwald 
in any case the study is preliminary and more research must be 
done he said 
greenwald is from hillside hospital part of long island jewish 
medical center in glen oaks ny he did the work at the mount 
sinai medical center in new york with colleagues from there and the 
bronx veterans administration hospital 
alzheimers disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects 
an estimated 25 million americans and causes some 150000 deaths a 
year symptoms include gradual memory loss impairment of judgment 
disorientation personality change difficulty in learning and loss 
of language no cause or cure is known 
the study focused on 64 alzheimers patients whose conditions 
were assessed at sixmonth intervals for up to three years 
patients were not treated for depression 
higher levels of depression in the initial assessment were 
linked to slower decline on behavioral measures the measures cover 
such aspects as delusions and hallucinations agitation and 
restlessness and appetite disturbances 
but depression made no difference in the diseases impact on 
such measures as naming objects knowing the date ability to 
follow commands and memory for spoken words 
greenwald said some studies suggest that alzheimers patients 
with depression have an underlying abnormality in certain brain 
cells in contrast to nondepressed patients that supports the 
idea that depression identifies a particular form of the disease 
he said 
a previous study also suggested that patients with depression 
tended to have better behavioral ratings but still another study 
found no difference he said

opponents of a plan to replace the nations fifth 
busiest airport are pulling out all the stops with just one week 
before voters decide the issue 
a rocky mountain news poll published sunday showed support to 
replace stapleton international airport remains 2to1 among denver 
voters 
business owners who would suffer economically if denvers 
airport is moved have formed a group called save our stapleton and 
have hired highpriced political consultant roger ailes 
ailes television ads for george bush in last falls 
presidential election made michael dukakis look unsoldierly while 
riding in a tank his first ad for the save our stapleton group 
depicted mayor federico pena looking awkward in a construction hard 
hat as an unseen announcer warns that developers and 
politicians are trying to sell denver a bad project 
denver wants to build the first major new airport in the united 
states since 1974 when the dallasfort worth international airport 
was built 
stapleton was built in 1929 in northeast denver 
its patchwork and glue baling wire and chewing gum 
stapleton spokesman richard boulware said everything has been 
added on since we even have some of the original control tower 
from 1929 in the subbasement 
opponents say a new airport is unneeded they cite figures 
showing passenger traffic at stapleton has declined during the past 
two years and say stapleton can be expanded 
the airport has become more than just a local and statewide 
issue 
the federal aviation administration would like to see new 
airports built in new york chicago atlanta and los angeles 
new airports have become so expensive that aviation analysts 
predict only one or two will be built before the end of the 
century cost estimates of the new denver airport range from 17 
billion to 23 billion 
where the money ultimately would come from to build an airport 
has been at the heart of debate 
a federal judge ruled monday that denver may not increase 
landing fees or use airline money to pay for the proposed new 
airport but said the city could use concessions fees 
the two main airlines at stapleton united and continental 
responded to the ruling by saying the city should refund at least 
8 million paid toward the proposed new airport between 1985 and 
1986 
concessions funds amount to about 30 million a year officials 
estimate increased landing fees would have brought in an additional 
10 million annually 
people all over the country are looking at denver to see what 
will happen said bill kenyon a spokesman for a proairport 
groups lets vote yes campaign 
the ad the opposition has put on the air is offensive to this 
community said john frew who is directing campaign they have 
lobbed a sizable hand grenade at us 
he said stapleton has gotten a bad reputation for delays and has 
limited capacity to expand 
several years ago western airlines whose hub is in salt lake 
city ran an advertising campaign that said fly with us and 
never fly through stapleton again 
even opponents acknowledge some of the remarks are justified 
stapleton has limited capacity to handle jumbo jets those 
planes are put into what pilots call the penalty box while 
waiting for an access ramp and delays can last from 20 minutes to 
an hour 
when it snows the number of operating runways sometimes is cut 
from four to one snarling air traffic across the united states 
the new airport would be located 17 miles from stapleton on the 
northeast edge of metropolitan denver and east of the rocky 
mountain arsenal 
last year voters in neighboring adams county worried that 
denver was trying to ram the project through by annexing their land 
however when the issue of whether denver should be allowed to 
annex the land went to a vote it passed 55 percent to 45 percent

gunmen stormed beiruts central jail 
early today and freed 189 convicts as christians and syrians 
battled with tanks across the citys dividing green line 
police said a special squad of officers armed with m16 assault 
rifles recaptured 90 convicts in a sweep of moslem west beirut 
seven people were killed and 47 wounded during the night mostly 
by tank fire said a police spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules 
that raised the overall casualty toll to 334 people killed and 
1281 wounded since fighting broke out on march 8 between gen 
michel aouns christian army units and an alliance of syrian and 
druse forces 
an arab league envoy held talks today in damascus the syrian 
capital in an effort to revive a ceasefire called by the 
organization on april 28 
syria the main power broker in lebanon keeps 40000 troops 
across 70 percent of the country under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
the police spokesman said about 30 unidentified gunmen armed 
with sovietdesigned grenade launchers and ak47 automatic rifles 
broke into the jail in a moslem district at 220 am 
he said a moslem police sergeant was killed in a shootout with 
the gunmen who entered the prison wardens office took the 
keys opened the cells and turned loose all 189 prisoners 
the tank clashes near the green line escalated into shelling of 
christian and moslem residential districts at about midnight 
tuesday the police spokesman said 
tanks deployed between apartment buildings drew howitzer and 
antiarmor fire but most shells missed them and blasted the 
buildings 
both sides were using the population as their shield the 
spokesman said 
ambulance sirens and thuds from exploding shells echoed across 
the city until the fighting slackened into occasional exchanges of 
howitzer shells about 315 am he said 
the arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria was 
accompanied by gen ali almomen a kuwaiti officer chosen to head 
a 321man observer force drawn from six arab nations to help 
implement a lasting ceasefire 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed alsabah said 
tuesday that the arab military observers would not arrive until a 
ceasefire takes hold 
it has become difficult in light of the recent developments to 
send the observer force to lebanon to expose their lives to danger 
either by assassination or killing as a result of the 
indiscriminate shelling alsabah told reporters in kuwait 
aoun who also heads a christian military cabinet and acting 
prime minister salim hoss his sunni moslem rival both said they 
accepted the truce 
but syrian forces and their allies from druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party militia continued to shell 
the christian enclave north of beirut they said they were trying 
to prevent three ships loaded with iraqi weapons and ammunition 
from resupplying aouns forces 
iraq which has a longrunning feud with syria backs aouns 
pledge to fight until syrian troops are withdrawn from lebanon 
the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
began two days after aouns navy blockaded three ports controlled 
by syrianbacked militias south of beirut in a bid to recoup lost 
tax revenues estimated at 100 million annually 
jumblatts militia retaliated by shelling the 310square mile 
christian heartland the syrians joined in later

the courts are in charge of detainees and investigate any 
complaints the detainees have until now there has been no 
proof that any torture exists 
the londonbased group said in its 40page report the torture 
testimony has been consistent and prompts the conclusion that there 
is a pattern of torture in egypt and that there are insufficient 
safeguards to protect detainees from torture 
emergency laws allow virtually indefinite detention without 
charge egypt has been under an almost continuous state of 
emergency since 1967 
mubarak came to power on oct 6 1981 after moslem 
fundamentalists assassinated president anwar sadat 
amnestys report said torture usually occurs during the first 
days of detention it cited the case of a 22yearold student 
mahmoud agami mehelhil who was arrested in february 1987 held 
incommunicado for 37 days and allegedly stripped blindfolded and 
whipped all over his body 
the report says mehelhil still bears the physical marks of 
torture and believes he was released from mazraat tora prison 
south of cairo without trial so that the court would not see his 
injuries 
the document also cites reports by moslem activists of beatings 
with cables and whips burnings with cigarettes and other forms of 
torture 
it said many torture victims were among the thousands of 
political suspects arrested after the attempted assassinations in 
may and august 1987 of former interior ministers maj gen hassan 
abu basha and maj gen nabawi ismail and of magazine editor makram 
muhammed ahmed 
the report said at least 1500 moslems were detained across the 
country after a demonstration in a mosque in the southern city of 
fayoum on april 7 
fundamentalist moslems are demanding enactment of sharia 
islams legal and social code with harsh criminal penalties like 
limb amputation and flogging 
the government contends 90 percent of egyptian laws already 
conform to sharia but they do not include the islamic codes 
corporal punishments 
amnestys report called on the egyptian government to provide 
political detainees access to lawyers relatives and doctors 
egypt was among the first six countries in 1986 to sign a un 
convention against torture

select committee on indian affairs that koch industries was 
stealing oil by deliberately mismeasuring it 
the committee is investigating theft of oil from and 
underpayment of oil royalties to indians

companys errors were well within the range commonly found in the 
industry 
wichitabased koch industries has interests in energy real 
estate manufacturing and cattle it is one of the nations largest 
privately held corporations with annual revenues estimated at 16 
billion to 18 billion 
william koch has made several attempts to wrest control of the 
company from charles and has filed several lawsuits against his 
brother the company and other family members 
charles koch 52 of wichita and his brother david 47 an 
executive vice president who heads the companys chemical 
operations from new york city are billionaires according to 
forbes magazine

million and heads a suburban boston energy company oxbow corp 
eldest brother frederick 53 who has residences in monaco and 
new york city and shares in company profits through a trust fund 
despite being disinherited by his father is worth an estimated 
450 million 
the differences that led william and frederick to become allies 
against charles and david never have been discussed publicly 
there is a lot of deep hatred involved here don cordes 
koch industries vice president for legal and corporate affairs and 
a close friend of charles koch once said 
william koch has denied he is pursuing a personal vendetta he 
once characterized his disagreements with charles and david as 
business disputes and said he has a great deal of respect for 
his brothers 
the brothers mother mary 81 said charles always appeared 
destined to follow in the footsteps of his father fred c koch 
who founded the company as rock island oil and refining co 
charles became chairman after his father died in 1967 he turned 
the company into a thriving diversified conglomerate at a time 
when other independent oil companies were faltering the number of

unsuccessful attempt to wrest control from charles william koch

in a 1982 lawsuit william koch sought control of the company 
and accused charles koch and others of misappropriating funds the 
lawsuit was settled out of court in june 1983 when koch industries 
bought the stakes owned by william frederick and other dissidents 
for an estimated 15 billion 
since then william koch has filed two unsuccessful lawsuits 
claiming the settlement undervalued company assets 
william and frederick also are suing their brothers and mother 
claiming they have been cut out of decisions on what nonprofit 
groups get donations from the koch foundation which distributes 
about 300000 a year 
a sedgwick county district court judge will hear closing 
arguments in two weeks

the citys subway trains have been declared 
grafitti free ending an era of guerrilla artists who turned the 
cars into rolling canvasses of cryptic messages oftenpoignant art 
and downright threatening messages 
when youre sitting in a graffiticovered car you dont feel 
safe said transit authority president david l gunn 
there was a sense that the system was out of control 
the transit authority planned a celebration friday in which it 
will send what it describes as its last graffiticovered train on a 
final journey 
the agency began cleaning its 6245car fleet in 1984 and 
figures show the number of graffiti attacks has declined since then 
critics say eliminating graffiti may make it more pleasant to 
ride the subway but does little to improve service increase safety 
or decrease crime within the system 
the transit authority has a 52 million annual budget for 
cleaning cars 
workers wipe the graffiti with a glycol etherbased cleanser and 
then rinse it away 
in the beginning transit officials ordered cars taken out of 
service within 24 hours of being marked by graffiti then it became 
easier to keep the cars clean as more clean cars were put back in 
service gunn said 
i appreciate not having to get on a fun house of colors in the 
morning said gene russianoff president of the straphangers 
campaign which lobbies on behalf of subway riders 
but do riders care more that service is unreliable on most 
lines the answer is yes he said i think the transit 
authority deserves a pat on the back and maybe a cigar but i dont 
think they deserve canonization

a man who spent half his life 
communicating by sign language and computer regained his voice 
after he fell into a glass door 
i feel wonderful said a very hoarse lynn ray collins 33 
who was hospitalized and recovering from last weeks fall 
dr raymond ufford collins doctor of several years said he 
does not know why the accident had such a dramatic effect but he 
said the loss of more than three pints of blood may be a factor 
the only thing that points to some explanation is the 
excessive loss of blood ufford said that is a lot of blood to 
lose and watching that happen i think he realized he wants to live 
so he is trying to speak 
collins lost his voice in 1972 when he was struck by a car an 
accident that caused brain damage and left him in a coma for 11 
weeks 
last wednesday his head struck the glass of a door at an 
albertville store as blood flowed from the 9inch cut collins 
began trying to verbally answer paramedics questions 
ufford said it still takes a great effort to understand 
collins but he is trying very hard to articulate 
hes talking and pretty soon everyone will hear him i praise 
god said his mother myrtice collins he just wants to talk 
and talk and talk 
she said he previously would get depressed and refuse to 
communicate at all even with the computer or sign language 
medical personnel did not know collins couldnt talk when he was 
taken to the hospital on may 10 
mrs collins and her daughter arrived heard collins talk and 
began yelling crying laughing and hugging 
i guess the doctor mustve thought we were crazy laughing and 
carrying on over someone with a hole knocked in their head mrs 
collins said 
i just cant believe it she said we thought we were 
going to lose him after the first accident and now to have another 
accident cure him someone out there must be looking out for us

major state newspapers today gave prominent 
coverage of an appeal made by journalists for press freedom and a 
few offered unusually full accounts of reporters complaints of 
censorship 
this action is unprecedented in the history of chinas 
media science and technology daily said of the anticensorship 
petition signed by more than 1000 reporters and delivered to the 
government tuesday 
press freedom has been one of the main demands of the recent 
student demonstrations along with calls for greater democracy and 
clean government 
generally speaking i believe that todays reports on the 
journalists appeal werent bad said li datong an editor at 
the china youth news who delivered the petition 
despite the coverage the censors work still was apparent some 
articles noted the reporters call for talks with communist 
officials but did not explain the grievances other reports toned 
down the petitions harshest wording 
for example the petition said that restrictions of every kind 
have prevented full objective and fair reporting on the student 
protests the official xinhua news agency and some newspapers 
changed restrictions to reasons 
science and technology daily which gave a lengthy and 
relatively objective account of the reporters protest noted the 
petitioners complained that the press in the capital was tied up 
in every manner in their reports on this major event 
the newspaper in explaining the reporters grievances said 
in fact severe abuses exist in the current system of reporting 
news in china 
at least two newspapers the economic daily and the legal daily 
mentioned the petitioners request to hold talks with party 
propaganda officials on the firing of the editor of chinas most 
liberal paper after he rejected censors demands 
the science and technology daily listed the names of 32 media 
organizations including itself whose journalists were among those 
who signed the petition 
the official media initially maintained silence on the student 
protests which began on april 15 and brought tens of thousands of 
people into the streets of the capital 
xinhua later issued brief understated reports on the 
demonstrations while a few newspapers carried reports that made 
the scope of the marches clear many reporters attended the marches 
and handed in reports and photographs but said their editors 
decided not to use most of the material for fear it would fuel the 
protests 
li said that while beijings newspapers have shown some openness 
and flexibility in reporting the past few days there are no 
guarantees such trends will continue 
chinas press still lacks a feeling of safety li said in a 
telephone interview adding that a set of laws and regulations to 
protect press freedom still was needed

voters in omaha neb rejected a former mayors bid to regain 
the seat he lost in a recall election two years ago while another 
former mayor in jersey city nj advanced to a runoff in his bid 
to win back the post 
also tuesday residents of hilton head island sc turned down 
a measure that would have restricted growth at the golfandtennis 
resort 
in nebraska omaha businessman pj morgan ended former mayor 
mike boyles comeback hopes boyle lost a recall election two years 
ago amid allegations that he abused his executive power 
with only absentee ballots remaining to be counted morgan had 
56774 votes or 53 percent to boyles 48115 votes or 45 percent 
boyle 45 said during the campaign that he was a recovering 
alcoholic who had changed his controversial management style 
i wouldnt have wanted to put my life on hold for another four 
years boyle said 
morgan 49 a millionaire real estate manager outspent boyle by 
a margin of nearly 2to1 but morgan said he didnt believe that 
had been a factor

city cunningham said thats the only race im concerned 
with 
voter turnout was 52 percent compared to 67 percent in 1985

that residents turned down a measure that would have restricted 
growth by tying construction to how long motorists have to wait at

a sheriff has deployed a new weapon in his 
drugfighting arsenal yellow diamondshaped signs on interstate 95 
warning travelers of a narcotics inspection ahead 
there is no inspection but drivers who panic and illegally turn 
around in the median will be stopped 
volusia county sheriff bob vogel whose unorthodox antidrug 
methods have caught national attention says the public supports 
his work 
they applaud the efforts that law enforcement is making to 
curtail this epidemic he said tuesday as he unveiled the signs 
defense attorneys and civil libertarians cried foul 
you have to admit theyre clever but theyre tricking people 
into committing a crime said ron ross chairman of the orlando 
branch of the american civil liberties union 
controversy isnt new to vogel 
he developed a drug suspect profile that produced an 80 percent 
arrest rate on drug cases and was featured in a 1987 episode of 
cbs 60 minutes defense attorneys said he really was 
arbitrarily stopping blacks wearing gold chains and driving large 
rented cars vogel denied any racial factor 
state and federal appellate courts have ruled that officers can 
use a profile to make an arrest only after stopping someone for a 
traffic violation the florida supreme court is considering the 
matter 
vogel has ordered deputies to continue stopping 
suspiciouslooking motorists since becoming sheriff of the north 
florida county in january since then deputies have seized nearly 
300000 in cash when there has not been enough evidence to make an 
arrest 
to defense attorneys and lawyers for the aclu the new highway 
signs are just another highhanded questionable tactic 
it is a very drastic step toward a totalitarian form of 
government said daytona beach lawyer dan warren 
to put up a sign that is meaningless is not a legitimate use 
of police power said robyn blumner president of floridas aclu 
checkpoints would be illegal anyway because cars are protected from 
searches just like homes she said 
vogel said 90 percent of the motorists stopped for traffic 
violations and suspected of transporting drugs or having cash 
tainted with drugs consent to having their cars searched 
when a search turns up a large sum of cash but no drugs a dog 
is brought in to sniff the money the cash is confiscated if traces 
of narcotics are found motorists are entitled to a receipt for the 
money but often they just drive away vogel said 
warren said the use of dogs is questionable and cited a miami 
study that found traces of drugs on 20 percent of money tested in 
bank vaults 
but vogel is undeterred 
its very uncommon for the average american i know of to be 
transporting large sums of cash on the highways he said vogel 
is asking the courts to award money seized to the sheriffs 
department to help finance his war on drugs

the two main opposition parties today 
called for the resignation of president roh taewoos cabinet to 
take responsibility for violent protests by students and workers 
prime minister kang younghoons cabinet is standing in the 
way of democratization and is studded with all kinds of 
mismanagement it must resign immediately assemblyman choi 
yungkun said at the start of a special national assembly session 
to discuss the violence 
the opposition reunification democratic party and the party for 
peace and democracy did not call for rohs resignation 
but they charged that the government is blocking democratic 
reform and using a crackdown on violent protests as a pretext to 
move against all its opponents they accused the government of 
provoking unrest 
the oppositioncontrolled assembly can pass a resolution calling 
on the cabinet to resign but the administration does not have to 
accept such a call 
lawmakers of the governing democratic justice party accused the 
opposition of trying to block a crackdown on the violent dissidents 
and weaken the roh administration 
a wave of violent protests and strikes has hit south korea in 
recent months and many koreans are calling for an end to the 
unrest after six riot troopers were killed by students on may 3 
radical students and the antigovernment dissident groups have 
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views the radicals have been calling for the overthrow 
of roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and 
farmers 
the government has warned that efforts by radicals to build an 
alliance with workers threatens political and economic stability 
leftist forces trying to overthrow our parliamentary democracy 
and free democratic system will face stern punishment kang said 
today the prime minister said nothing about resigning 
roh warned after the riot trooper deaths that he would invoke 
emergency powers if the violence does not end security forces have 
been ordered to round up dissident leaders and block all protests 
the government is trying to push a bill through the assembly 
calling for tougher punishment for radicals who make or use 
firebombs the law would increase prison sentences for using 
firebombs from three years to seven years 
the opposition opposes the bill contending the government must 
limit police use of tear gas against protesters some opposition 
leaders say riot police should only use tear gas with permission of 
the prime minister or home minister and must obtain it even when 
battling rioters 
kim daejung leader of the party for peace and democracy said 
today the government was using the crackdown as an excuse to limit 
political freedom 
he accused roh of attempting to revive the authoritarian rule of 
former president chun doohwan who stepped down in 1988 by 
imposing restrictions on all opposition groups 
roh a former general won presidential elections in late 1987 
after rival opposition candidates split the antigovernment vote 
he has helped introduce democratic reforms but many koreans 
distrust the government because of its ties to the chun regime

the us cultural center in the 
southern provincial city of kwangju a frequent target of violent 
attacks by radical students was closed today american officials 
said 
the center had been a target by radicals who oppose the presence 
of 43000 us troops based in the country under a mutual defense 
treaty 
a notice was posted on the front gate saying the center would be 
closed temporarily while a new site is chosen the us embassy 
said 
it was the first closure of a us cultural center in 40 years 
and the embassy played down the event saying it was temporary for 
an office move 
the closure precedes the anniversary may 18 of the bloody 1980 
kwangju civil uprising in which 200 people were killed and 1000 
injured 
antiamerican sentiment is strong in kwangju residents blame 
us officials for doing nothing during the crackdown 
elsewhere farmers protesting imports of us agricultural 
products staged a sitin outside the us ambassadors residence 
today police said 26 were arrested 
the sitin was brief and peaceful witnesses said the 
residence on a narrow street near downtown has been uninhabited 
since the last ambassador left in january a new ambassador has yet 
to arrive 
us trade pressure is endangering our life and south koreas 
agriculture industry said leaflets distributed by the farmers 
yonhap the south korean news agency said us officials tried 
to move the cultural center to an outlying center of kwangju 160 
miles from seoul but that residents of the area complained and a 
new site has not been found 
the center has been attacked repeatedly since 1980 by students 
wielding firebombs and yelling antiamerican slogans the us 
state department said last january that the center would be moved 
if the attacks continued or if there was concern for safety of the 
staff 
dissidents and radical students welcomed the closure claiming 
the center should remain closed permanently newspapers in seoul 
called the closure a measure to avoid possible trouble during the 
kwangju anniversary

to prove that old bones can still tell tales 
plans are afoot to open a colorado grave and establish whether five 
prospectors were eaten by the legendary alferd g packer or 
someone else or not at all 
james starrs professor of law and forensic science at george 
washington universitys national law center plans to lead an 
expedition for evidence that cannibalism was committed during that 
awful april in 1874 
packer a union army veteran has stood accused in verse and 
mirth of killing the victims and eating their flesh packer said he 
killed one prospector in selfdefense and he denied eating anyone 
so famous is the case that a cafeteria at the university of 
colorado and the one in the department of agriculture here are 
named in packers honor a mocking commentary on their culinary 
qualities 
starrs one of the nations forensic experts insists his 
purpose is scientific to show how anthropology the study of man 
his customs culture and social relationships can combine with 
archeology and pathology in solving crimes 
even after 115 years he said the bones will tell if 
cannibalism occurred any scraping of tissue of flesh should 
leave evidence on the bone he said the examination may even 
show whether the starving prospectors ate their shoeleather as 
alleged 
the search will start july 17 at a grave at the foothills of the 
san juan mountains near lake city colo 
the undertaking has a critic in ervan f kushner 74 an amateur 
historian and packer defender he calls starrs plans macabre 
and says i dont see the point of it 
kushner a retired judge and prosecutor from paterson nj is 
author of alferd g packer cannibal victim 
mr starrs is a wellknown forensics expert kushner said 
but what possible proof can there be found in the bones as to 
motive if he enjoys digging in that beautiful scenery thats a 
great place to dig but how will it establish who struck the first 
blow 
some facts are known packer admitted killing shannon wilson 
bell one of the prospectors but he said he acted out of 
selfdefense and claimed bell had killed and cannibalized their 
fellow miners 
kushner said packer too may have stripped flesh from the 
corpses but only for selfpreservation 
but starrs a 30year student of the case said packer was a 
concerted and deliberate and longterm liar throughout the trial 
his fivehour narration is filled with inconsistency and glaring 
falsehoods 
by packers account an awesome snowstorm in the colorado 
rockies stranded the prospectors and left them starving for a 
month so he took a rifle and set out to kill an animal 
five days later he returned emptyhanded only to find four of 
his fellows dead and the hungercrazed bell about to attack him 
with a hatchet packer told the authorities he said he shot and 
killed bell he said some human remains were boiling in a stewpot 
he fled was captured but escaped recaptured nine years later 
he was tried for murder and sentenced to hang he wasnt charged 
with cannibalism its not a crime but the accusation hung in 
the air 
starrs said he can put to rest as a bartenders fabrication an 
account that says presiding judge melville b gerry in sentencing 
packer to hang bemoaned that there had been only seven democrats 
in all of hinsdale county and ye ate five of em 
the colorado supreme court set aside the conviction because the 
legislature had repealed the death sentence during the time packer 
was a fugitive 
retried for manslaughter packer was sentenced to 40 years and 
paroled after 17 he died in 1907 still proclaiming innocence of 
murder 
in 1981 kushner petitioned richard d lamm then the governor 
of colorado to pardon packer posthumously lamm wouldnt but said 
he found himself agreeing with another packer defender poet olive 
nagel porter 
lets not condemn poor packer 
nor crowd his soul with abuse 
though he hardly would merit approval 
hunger is valid excuse

president bush says he wishes convicted felon 
oliver north had been absolved of all crimes in the irancontra 
affair but says im not going to argue with the courts 
bush who has the power to pardon north said tuesday he would 
not comment on the case further as north appeals the verdict north 
was convicted last thursday on three of 12 felony counts 
the president broke his silence on the north verdict during a 
brief question and answer session with reporters in the oval office 
today bush traveled to the bethesda naval medical center in 
suburban maryland to undergo his first medical checkup as president 
never felt better in my life said bush who is 64 
bush also was optimistic about prospects for resolving a dispute 
with west germany over modernizing shortrange nuclear weapons in 
europe 
bonn has called for eastwest negotiations soon to reduce the 
weapons but bush has rejected the idea on grounds they are needed 
to offset the sovietled warsaw pacts superiority in conventional 
forces 
the dispute threatens western solidarity as nato prepares for a 
summit in brussels may 2930 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of 
the alliance 
i have a good feeling that theres been a lot of smoke and 
that well have a smooth summit bush said 
asked if he were willing to compromise bush replied it might 
mean people are willing to do it our way with the united states 
bush added this alliance is not going to fall apart it is 
going to stay together and be strong 
on the subject of north the white house has said that bush has 
not discussed the possibility of a pardon 
north a onetime aide on the white house national security 
council is awaiting sentencing on his convictions of illegally 
destroying and altering government documents accepting an illegal 
gratuity and aiding and abetting in obstruction of congress 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
asked his opinion of the verdict bush said as you know i 
wanted all along to see him exonerated 
the matter is now under appeal and thus ill have nothing more 
to say about it while it is said bush who has called north a 
hero 
asked directly if he believed north was innocent bush said 
well im not going to argue with the courts the process is 
being appealed 
hes entitled to the right of appeal without a lot of 
editorial comment from me although ive already given you some 
bush was asked by a reporter you dont believe in shredding 
documents do you 
he scooped up some documents hed left on his desk and jokingly 
said no i believe in taking them with me 
bushs meeting with reporters was hurriedly arranged to provide 
an opportunity for him to comment on the outcome of the 
presidential elections in panama which the united states says were 
rigged and stolen by military strongman manuel antonio noriega 
bush said the voting was marred by fraud and massive 
irregularities and called on noriega to heed the call of the 
people and relinquish power 
and i call on all foreign leaders to urge noriega to honor the 
clear results of the election bush said 
the united states says a fair counting of the ballots in panama 
would show that opposition candidate guillermo endara easily 
defeated noriegas handpicked choice carlos duque

president bush is calling on democratic allies 
to rally against panamas gen manuel antonio noriega but us 
officials are playing down talk of an american military response to 
what they call a fraudulent election in the central american nation 
in considering the scope of measures officials ranging from 
panamas opposition candidate guillermo endara to perus 
president alan garcia and former president jimmy carter cautioned 
against us troop involvement 
bush and his advisers kept alive the prospect of military 
intervention tuesday by saying all options were being considered 
administration officials said privately however that such a 
unilateral step was unlikely 
i dont think its necessary to take action immediately 
sen richard lugar rind a senior member of the senate foreign 
relations committee said on nbctvs today show this morning 
the opposition in panama is counseling calm and theyre in the 
best position to know 
bush would not say what actions he was considering in the wake 
of what he called a fraudulent election that nonetheless was won by 
antinoriega forces 
the panamanian people have spoken and i call on general 
noriega to respect the voice of the people and i call on all 
foreign leaders to urge general noriega to honor the clear results 
of the election the president told reporters 
bush was briefed tuesday by two election observer groups 
including one headed by carter just back from central america 
after monitoring sundays elections 
the observers said there was rampant fraud in voting and ballot 
counting bush embraced the conclusions of the observers and the 
catholic church in panama that the noriega opposition won a 31 
victory 
despite massive irregularities at the polls the opposition 
has won a clearcut overwhelming victory bush told reporters in 
a brief oval office session there has been a statement for 
democracy so loud and so clear that perhaps even general noriega 
will listen to it 
the president said that venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
was encouraging neighboring countries to issue a joint statement 
against the fraud that is taking place and calling on noriega to 
honor the results of this election 
the vote was considered a referendum on noriega chief of the 
15000member defense forces whom the united states has been 
trying to depose for more than a year 
bush said he would not discuss what he might do until after the 
official vote results were announced the noriegaled government 
claimed that partial returns showed that its candidate carlos 
duque had defeated opposition candidate endara 
while white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
considering options ranging from military force to economic 
sanctions against panama other officials minimized the military 
angle they said the united states could decide to beef up us 
forces to protect americans living in panama or help to move them 
out 
more stringent economic sanctions also were a possibility the 
united states has been withholding operating fees for the panama 
canal from the panamanian government and has barred us firms 
from paying any taxes or fees to the panamanian government 
fitzwater said us military personnel in panama had been 
harassed and were on a very high state of alert 
talking to reporters outside the white house carter cautioned 
against us abrogation of the panama canal treaties signed under 
his administration and against military confrontation 
any sort of military involvement down there would immediately 
alienate the panamanian people who respect their nations 
sovereignty as do we carter said 
the panama canal treaties under which the united states is to 
turn over the canal to panamanian control at the end of this 
century are a sacred issue with the panamanians carter said 
breaking them would play right into the hands of noriega and 
alienate every other nation in this hemisphere 
fitzwater earlier said there were no plans to break the 
treaties but he hinted the administration might apply pressure 
through provisions on protection of us citizens there and of the 
strategic canal itself 
one member of bushs official observer team democratic sen bob 
graham of florida urged bush to withdraw us military dependents 
and citizens from panama while beefing up the number of combatants 
among the 10000 us troops there 
fitzwater said he did not think an evacuation of dependents was 
underway but added thats not to say there isnt planning under 
way that would accommodate a number of movements of one kind or 
another

millions of italian workers stayed off the job today 
in a general strike called by italys three main labor unions to 
protest a change in the governments health plan requiring payment 
of nominal fees 
schools shut for the day banks and public offices closed in the 
morning and newspapers didnt publish city bus drivers struck for 
two hours 
union rallies were held in major cities 
the unions urged 16 million workers to strike for up to four 
hours to protest what they say is an unfair burden on workers and 
the elderly 
the socalled ticket system went into effect april 1 and 
requires the payment of small fees for hospitalization and medical 
tests in state hospitals 
premier ciriaco de mita denounced the strike saying people are 
prepared to spend large amounts of money to attend soccer games or 
take weekend vacations but not to pay the 7 daily fee required for 
hospitalization 
whoever thinks that this strike is disproportionate in respect 
to the fees is making a mistake social activist giovanni moro 
told a rally in florence where unions said 150000 people turned 
out above all they dont understand that citizens of the 
worlds fifth industrial power dont want a third world health 
system 
the strike was called by the communistdominated general 
federation of italian labor the mostly christian democratic

taking the train to the plane is the way to 
go in the future say argonne national laboratory researchers who 
recommend replacing shorthaul jets with a 30 billion nationwide 
highspeed rail network 
the cost of the 2000mile network of 300 mph magnetic 
levitation trains would be largely offset by reducing airline 
delays and energy aircraft acquisition and airport construction 
costs says a soontobereleased report 
the report suggests that airlines run the system in place of 
jets that travel from hub airports to cities up to 600 miles away 
the trains would allow airports to concentrate on handling longer 
flights the report said 
every study before ours has looked at magnetic levitation as 
railroad technology larry r johnson director of argonnes 
center for transportation research said in todays chicago 
tribune ours is the first to integrate it into airline and 
airport operations 
magnetic levitation uses powerful magnets to lift a train above 
a guideway and propel it on a cushion of air 
at 300 mph a maglev can compete with jet aircraft up to 
distances of 600 miles johnson said 
the report proposes that the trains run on elevated tracks 
alongside interstate highways 
the airlines at first viewed the concept as a threat said 
william r nesbit a retired united airlines economist who 
participated in the study but if they follow the logic the fuel 
and labor savings alone are big

students boycotted classes and at least 850 university janitors

a bank robber dubbed the miss america 
bandit because of her glamorous disguises received a light two 
years in prison from a judge who said she had come under the 
influence of a svengalilike boyfriend 
the history of it is that men have exercised traditional 
control over the activities of women and im not going to ignore 
that no matter how much flak i get from womens lib us 
district judge a andrew hauk said tuesday 
danielle tyece mast 24 of reedsport ore a former 
cheerleader and bank teller who favored fashionable wigs and 
sunglasses as disguises was convicted of taking 13000 in five 
holdups last summer she could have received up to five years in 
prison 
assistant us attorney gregory w alarcon asked for a stiff 
sentence but hauk one of the most experienced judges on the 
federal bench agreed with miss masts lawyer that she acted under 
the spell of her livein boyfriend 
i think its a fact of life that men can exercise a svengali 
influence over women hauk declared he added women are a soft 
touch particularly if sex is involved 
the prosecutor complained that miss mast had shown no remorse 
and he argued that the boyfriend wasnt present during any of the 
robberies and hasnt been charged 
feminist attorney gloria allred said hauks remarks were 
unfortunate 
that is an untrue stereotype that men are able to control 
women she said unscientific generalizations such as this one 
have no place in the courtroom or in the decisionmaking process

are heard who raise the question to what extent can we do these 
unilateral steps without a response from the other side said 
andrei kokoshin one of the leading proponents of the soviet new 
thinking on national security issues 
the remarks by kokoshin deputy director of moscows usacanada 
institute and three other prominent soviet civilian experts on 
military affairs clearly were aimed at spurring the bush 
administration in arms talks with the kremlin 
those talks were expected to regain momentum after secretary of 
state james a baker iii met in moscow today with his soviet 
counterpart eduard a shevardnadze baker was to meet thursday 
with kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the capitol hill session generally was friendly as house armed 
services committee chairman les aspin dwis and kokoshin 
addressed each other as les and andrei by contrast when 
cabinet members testify they usually call aspin mr chairman 
and are addressed as mr or mrs secretary 
despite the informal atmosphere three panel members expressed 
concern about the testimony and several all but accused the soviets 
of lying 
rep richard ray dga asked the soviets to discuss warnings 
by defense secretary dick cheney and other americans that the 
goals of the soviet union have really not changed despite the 
reforms 
they point to the fact that weapons manufacturing continues 
tank production at 278 a month continues with no letup submarine 
building ship building airplane building and so forth continues 
to be modernized said ray 
kokoshin said weapons production was down new soviet policy 
includes not only unilateral cuts in the armed forces and arms 
which we possess now but also the decrease of the production of 
military hardware kokoshin said 
i know that we are cutting the production he said 
roald sagdeyev a prominent reformer elected to the newly 
created congress of peoples deputies told the house panel that 
soviet military spending had been cut by 15 percent this year and 
would be cut by 7 percent next year and 142 percent in 1991 
the actual soviet military budget has not been published 
kokoshin and sagdeyev acknowledged but they said the figure would 
be revealed in june 
intelligence sources said preliminary data indicated that during 
the first four months of 1989 soviet tank production had risen 
from the previous level of 3200 to 3400 a year in the same range 
as rays figure 
but the statistics were under review and the surge was believed 
to be temporary and related to plans to close down production lines 
rather than to reflect soviet intentions to boost annual output 
according to intelligence sources who asked not to be further 
identified 
a report by central intelligence agency and pentagon analysts 
released last month estimated that soviet defense spending 
increased by 3 percent last year but cited evidence that gorbachev 
planned to make good on his pledge to cut that level by 142 
percent 
the ranking republican in the panel rep william dickinson of 
alabama complained that the soviets had deployed antisatellite 
weapons 
sagdeyev who formerly headed the soviet institute for space 
exploration replied that i have serious doubts if russians my 
russian military space counterparts have anything like an 
operational asat system 
our intelligence apparatus tells us that you do have in fact 
more than one asat operational capability dickinson responded 
dickinson expressed reservations about the presence of the 
soviet delegation and the reluctance of the soviet government to 
grant visas to members of the armed services committee to travel to 
moscow later this month 
i have mixed feelings about foreign witnesses testifying 
before the committee in open session on diplomatically sensitive 
foreign national issues we are prohibited by law from 
negotiating dickinson said 
rep beverly byron dmd also complained about the visa issue 
soviet officials and scholars have testified before congress at 
least twice previously in april 1986 vitaly churkin then a third 
secretary at the soviet embassy in washington appeared before a 
house panel to answer questions about the chernobyl nuclear reactor 
accident and kokoshin appeared before the house armed services 
committee earlier this year

us secretary of state james a baker iii held 
his first round of talks today with soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze and they jointly pledged to produce good 
results for superpower relations 
the twohour 45minute session at a foreign ministry mansion 
established goals and ground rules for four working groups that 
opened discussions on arms control human rights regional problems 
and direct ussoviet relations 
we are very pleased with the way things started baker said 
gennady i gerasimov a foreign ministry spokesman said baker 
and shevardnadze at the request of the american side concentrated 
on regional conflicts including the middle east central america 
and afghanistan 
dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last 
of the cold war behind us and move into a new stage of our 
relationship gerasimov said 
he said the subject of shortrange missiles in europe did not 
come up 
the two sides found common ground on central america gerasimov 
said both sides stated there was good potential for a furthering 
of dialogue on a central american settlement he said 
baker wants the soviets to curb their aid to the sandinistas in 
nicaragua which amounted to 500 million last year the soviets 
also raised afghanistan a topic baker had no intention of bringing 
up because the kremlin is demanding the united states halt its 
military aid to afghan rebels 
in both countries marxist governments have soviet support 
while the united states is backing the insurgents with weapons 
through pakistan for the mujahadeen and with nonlethal aid to the 
contras in nicaragua 
according to gerasimov baker and shevardnadze also discussed 
us defense secretary dick cheneys prediction that perestroika 
the restructuring program of president mikhail s gorbachev would 
fail 
baker explained that cheneys remarks did not reflect 
washingtons official position and shevardnadze did not take 
offense gerasimov said 
we understand that the secretary of defense needs more money 
for military programs and how can he possibly obtain that if the 
soviet threat is going away gerasimov said we were not 
offended 
baker in the soviet union for the first time later met with 
three members of the congress of peoples deputies a new 
parliament elected as gorbachev gives greater powers to the 
legislative arm of government 
we think there are real changes taking place in the soviet 
union and we think those changes are more than cosmetic as 
demonstrated by the fact that we now see competitive elections 
looking towards a sitting legislature baker said at the meeting 
at spaso house the us ambassadors residence 
the congress is to meet may 25 to choose a smaller fulltime 
legislature as well as a president asked if more than one 
candidate should run for president baker said one step at a 
time 
in two days of talks baker is expected to turn to gorbachev for 
help in accelerating the fledling us drive for arabisraeli 
negotiations 
the us approach to the middle east represents a shift in 
diplomatic gears from two decades of trying to fence out both the 
soviet union and the palestine liberation organization as apt to 
undermine american peacemaking 
once before in 1977 the united states made a concerted effort 
to engage the soviet union in middle east peacemaking the carter 
administration at that point was at a deadend in its mideast 
diplomacy 
but egypt and israel quickly decided to launch negotiations and 
the soviets were shut out again 
egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and since then 
have been the largest recipients of us aid and solidly on the 
american side of the superpower divide 
but baker is faced with a different situation he is trying to 
prod israel into negotiations with the palestinians and has 
concluded he needs the support of both moscow and the plo 
he is hoping the soviets under gorbachev would bring pressure on 
syria to support peace talks that do not hold out the promise of a 
palestinian state the soviet union has refused to exert such power 
in the past 
the plo meanwhile quietly has been assured that if israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for palestinian elections does 
not break the diplomatic stalemate in the middle east the bush 
administration will look for alternatives 
at the same time baker and his senior advisers are convinced 
plo chairman yasser arafat is sincere about his public acceptance 
of israel 
if the soviets push the missile issue they could widen the 
fissures between the united states and west germany over natos 
nuclear arsenal 
the bush administration supported mostly by britain wants to 
enhance the range of the 88 lance launchers and their 700 or so 
missiles most of which are in west germany while chancellor 
helmut kohl backed by a majority of the alliance is resisting and 
calling for ussoviet negotiations on such weapons in europe 
by contrast baker is playing down arms control 
he headed to moscow with a proposed date the third week in 
june for the reopening of ussoviet negotiations to reduce the 
superpowers longrange bombers nuclear submarines and 
globegirdling missiles 
but he was not planning to outline the position the united 
states would take at the table nor was he assuring the soviets 
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in 
november

a mobsters decision to turn informant may 
finally enable prosecutors to link mafia boss nicodemo little 
nicky scarfo to the atlantic city casinos law enforcement 
sources say 
lawrence yogi merlino facing up to a 40year prison term in 
a federal racketeering conspiracy agreed to cooperate in an 
attempt to shorten his possible jail time a source said tuesday 
merlino already is serving a life term for murder in a 1985 mob 
hit and cannot be paroled unless the governor commutes the sentence 
we think hes got a lot to say an investigator said about 
merlino the fourth member of scarfos mob to break the code of 
silence and become an informant 
the 42yearold merlino has been associated with two companies 
that reportedly did millions of dollars in atlantic city 
construction some with the casinos 
for years fbi agents and new jersey state police despite their 
suspicions have been unable to get sufficient evidence to charge 
the mob with infiltrating the construction industry and casino 
unions 
merlinos lawyer nino tinari declined to comment on the 
reported defection 
scarfos lawyer robert simone said nothing surprises me 
anymore but i will be surprised if a new informant comes out of 
the woodwork 
merlino was convicted with scarfo and six others last month in 
the murder of gangster frank frankie flowers dalfonso all got 
life terms 
seventeen men were convicted in november in the racketeering 
case which involved nine murders four attempted murders 
extortions drug dealing loan sharking and gambling

the justice departments civil rights division 
the leadership conference on civil rights said tuesday that 
lucas doesnt have the experience or litigation skills needed in 
the position which is the federal governments top civil rights 
job

opposition was adopted by consensus at a meeting of the 
conference according to ralph neas executive director of the 
organization 
neas and benjamin hooks chairman of the conference said lucas 
may well be qualified for other important positions in the 
federal government but he does not have the experience the 
substantive knowledge of the increasingly technical field of civil 
rights or the litigation skills to carry out the duties 
effectively 
the naacp legal defense and education fund a new yorkbased 
civil rights organization said in a separate announcement that it 
would oppose the nomination because lucas lacked the knowledge 
and experience for the position 
people for the american way a 275000member constitutional 
liberties organization also announced its opposition to lucas 
group president arthur j kropp said in a statement that lucas 
has demonstrated none of the civil rights experience so necessary 
for this position has no litigation experience whatsoever and has 
barely a few months of legal experience 
the opposition was the latest round in the controversy swirling 
around lucas a black detroit lawyer lucas 61 also has been an

could cause birth defects the environmental protection agency has 
said in ordering tighter safeguards to protect workers handling the 
pesticide 
the epa said tuesday there are only negligible health risks 
to consumers of food products on which the pesticide is used but 
that the risks are substantially greater to workers who come into 
direct contact with the chemical 
bromoxynil sold under the trade name buctril is used to 
control broadleaf weeds in the growing of field corn wheat 
onions garlic mint and flax 
under the epa directive mixers and other handlers of the 
chemical must wear protective clothing including 
chemicalresistant shoes or boots the manufacturer also must 
provide protective labels warning that exposure to a worker during 
pregnancy could cause birth defects 
epa believes that compliance with the new label directions and 
restrictions will provide adequate protection from the risk of 
birth defects the agency said

an official says the bush administration will 
soon propose legislation to provide state control over current 
federal family planning programs which generate continual 
controversy over abortion 
making the states the sole family planning grantees will 
enable them to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services 
to best meet their citizens needs said nabers chambers deputy 
assistant secretary for population affairs at the department of 
health and human services 
in advocating the transfer tuesday she did not specifically 
mention differences over how far federally funded family planning 
clinics can go in telling pregnant women about the availablity of 
abortion a matter now being fought in three separate federal court 
suits 
but ms chambers said giving states authority over how to parcel 
out the federal money allocated to them for family planning would 
allow them flexibility to operate clinics through county 
agencies private agencies or hospitals as is most appropriate for 
each particular state 
congress consistently rejected similar efforts by former 
president reagan to transfer the program to state control

the air force has agreed to keep its fleet of 
hurricane hunters for two years reversing defense secretary 
dick cheneys plan to scrap weather reconnaissance flights in the 
midst of the hurricane season 
its a good resolution of the problem sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas said late tuesday after a group of coastal states 
lawmakers met with acting air force secretary jack welch and other 
officials of the pentagon and national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
noaa and the air force will attempt to work out an agreement 
over the next two years on which agency would eventually man the 
planes that fly into the eye of a hurricane lawmakers said 
it has been suggested the hurricane hunters become the 
responsibility of noaa but bentsen and others contend the agency 
would be unable to take over the program on such quick notice 
cheney said the flights used to predict the intensity and 
position of an approaching hurricane were not a defense mission 
and sought to save at least 14 million annually by slashing the 
program 
but lawmakers complained that phasing it out this summer would 
leave hurricaneprone regions dangerously exposed

the national transportation safety board says 
the crew of an eastern airlines jet was to blame when the plane 
cracked open on landing in pensacola fla in 1987 
the board in determining probable cause of the incident at a 
meeting tuesday said the captain failed to maintain a proper 
descent rate on final approach and both he and the first officer 
failed to properly monitor flight instruments 
the tail section of the plane was dragged 7000 feet down the 
runway 
three of the 105 passengers aboard the dc9 received minor 
injuries the twinengine jetliner was landing dec 27 1987 in 
rain and fog on a flight from richmond va after a stopover in 
atlanta 
board investigators noted that five other dc9s had cracked in a 
similar manner after similar hard landings that exceeded the 
planes design capabilities they said they found no signs of metal 
fatigue or corrosion in the eastern plane 
the hard landing left a twofoot crack circling the fuselage 
between the wings and the rearmounted engines 
the approach got away from the captain said board 
investigator jack drake he said the crew should have taken the 
plane around for another approach when it failed to stabilize the 
approach below 1000 feet 
the boards report did not identify the pilot or first officer

solidarity workers found electronic 
eavesdropping devices in campaign offices in a northern provincial 
capital and demanded that the interior ministry investigate a 
union spokesman said today 
the devices were found in the solidarity citizens committee 
office in slupsk a city near the baltic coast 270 miles northeast 
of warsaw 
jacek moskwa spokesman for the solidarity committee 
coordinating election activities told reporters in warsaw the 
electronic devices were spotted by campaign workers and reported to 
the national campaign headquarters on tuesday 
a government spokesman in warsaw pawel byra said he knew 
nothing about the matter 
most leading opposition activists in poland presume that their 
homes and telephones are bugged as a matter of routine although 
the government has said its use of eavesdropping devices is limited 
and requires a court order 
the slupsk campaign offices were provided by provincial 
authorities and are in the building of the provincial social and 
recreation club wires from one listening device led to the club 
directors office said a slupsk citizens commission spokeswoman 
maria skrowonska 
the wire disappeared behind some paneling in the office and 
efforts were being made to remove the paneling and follow the wire 
said mrs skrowonska 
moskwa said that the slupsk committee asked the local 
prosecutors office to investigate but it was turned down the 
national committee then complained tuesday night at the interior 
ministry in warsaw the ministry oversees the countrys police 
forces 
we are going to protest officially and we are also going to 
lodge a complaint about being refused an official investigation 
moskwa said 
the committee offices are directing local campaigns for the 
sejm the existing unicameral parliament chamber and the senate 
which is to be the east blocs first totally freely elected 
legislative chamber 
under an agreement reached last month the opposition is 
competing for 35 percent or 161 seats in the 460member sejm and 
for all 100 of the senate seats voting will be held in two stages 
june 4 and june 18

the communist party faced with an 
economic crisis and increasing pressure for more democracy has 
offered to hold talks with opposition groups to work out details of 
next years elections 
the offer from the partys policymaking central committee came 
tuesday night after it stripped former leader janos kadar of his 
last official posts and said he made mistakes that slowed 
democratic and economic progress 
similar broadbased talks in poland earlier this year resulted 
in the legalization of solidarity and a more democratic electoral 
system 
the state news agency mti said in a statement outlining the 
offer of negotiations that they would fix an exact date for the 
first multiparty elections in hungary since the communist takeover 
in 1948 the talks would also determine rules and procedures for 
the elections expected in june 1990 
mti said the leadership would also negotiate over the exact role 
of a new constitutional court and revised powers for the state 
president 
it is not the first time the communists have offered talks but 
the latest offer detailed a broader agenda of issues the numerous 
opposition groups have refused earlier offers for talks because the 
agenda appeared to be limited and entirely controlled by the 
dominant communists 
the offer came before a parliamentary session opened today 
about 75 percent of the parliament deputies belong to the communist 
party 
the central committee offer followed its removal of kadar from 
the committee and the honorary post of party president kadar 76 
rose to power behind the sovietled invasion of 1956 that crushed a 
popular uprising for democracy 
by stripping kadar of the posts the central committee appeared 
to be trying to appease a public increasingly suspicious of the 
role kadar played in postinvasion repressions including the 
interrogation and execution of former premier and revolutionary 
leader imre nagy 
kadar is rumored to be suffering from cancer but central 
committee secretary gyoergy fejti declined tuesday at a news 
conference to specify the nature of kadars illness 
at the parliamentary session that opened today lawmakers 
considered a cabinet shuffle proposed by premier miklos nemeth 
according to nemeths plan gyula horn is to take over foreign 
affairs from peter varkonyi who has been named ambassador to 
washington csaba hutter head of a farming cooperative takes over 
agriculture and financial expert laszlo bekesi moves to finance 
the new ministers whose names were published two weeks ago are 
expected to strengthen recent reforms and assist nemeth in an 
economic overhaul he said he will present later this month 
the foreign debt of 17 billion remains the largest per capita 
in the east bloc with inflation expected to top 20 percent this 
year workers who have shown little interest in political reform 
are unhappy and even official trade unions are demanding the 
government ease its austerity drive

state department representatives it was accompanied by the no 2 
diplomat at the israeli embassy here oded eran said the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the officials are trying to tie up loose ends remaining from the 
affair in which pollard an intelligence analyst for the us

navy was convicted of selling thousands of secrets to israel and 
was sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment his wife anne

it could not be learned whether the us team managed to resolve 
the outstanding problems although one official said he doubted the 
case was now closed its been going on for so long and so 
slowly i doubt this trip is the end of the matter this source 
said tuesday 
a top aide to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir elyakim 
rubinstein has held periodic talks in washington in an effort to 
close the case which has been an embarrassment and strain for the 
close ties between israel and the united states 
last weeks mission appears to be only the second time a us 
team has traveled to israel to discuss the pollard affair the 
first team went there in 1986 and was allowed to interview three of 
pollards contacts who had worked at the israeli embassy and 
consulate in washington and new york 
but the team headed by former justice department prosecutor 
joseph digenova claimed later the israelis had not told them the 
whole truth and had withheld information about the man who first 
recruited pollard in washington aviem sella 
sella was indicted here in 1987 and was forced to retire from 
the israeli air force because of us pressure the justice 
department also threatened to revoke the immunity granted at the 
time to the other three israelis 
us officials also want israel to return some of the documents 
that pollard supplied and which were not given back during the 
initial phase of the investigation 
israel has contended the pollard espionage operation was run by 
rafi eitan who headed an obscure israeli defense bureau without 
authority from the government it has apologized to the united 
states but the affair continues to affect israels close 
intelligence ties with the united states

khmer rouge guerrillas have moved up to 
4000 refugees closer to the heavily shelled cambodian frontier 
evidently to stop relief agencies gaining greater access to them 
relief sources said today 
during the first week of may the communist guerrillas moved 
30004000 refugees from ta luan camp eastward along a route 
bombarded by artillery in april the sources said 
in front of relief officials they loaded the refugees onto 
chinesemade military trucks along with their pigs and entire 
households said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity other 
refugees walked the 2000 people left behind were mostly infirm or 
handicapped 
the guerrillas evidently fear they otherwise will lose control 
over the refugees whom the united nations had planned to move to a 
new camp where they could get medical and other services denied at 
ta luan 
theyre obviously playing games with peoples lives and with 
us one relief official said 
the chinesearmed khmer rouge is the largest guerrilla group 
fighting vietnamese forces that invaded cambodia in 1978 and ousted 
it from power the khmer rouge government had killed hundreds of 
thousands of people in execution chambers and slave labor camps to 
fashion a primitive agrarian society 
relief officials charge that guerrillas in khmer rouge refugee 
camps regularly deny people emergency medical treatment force 
children to carry arms through minefields and execute disobedient 
soldiers 
ta luan is four miles inside thailands eastern trat province 
and is among four khmer rougecontrolled border camps aided by the 
un border relief operation relief officials said the thai 
military crucial backers of the khmer rouge do not seem anxious 
to halt the movements from ta luan 
negotiations with guerrilla leaders have been very 
frustrating sources said they quoted the guerrillas as saying 
people must be moved because they are the soldiers families and 
the families must be with the soldiers 
the guerrillas have been increasingly isolated by the 
international community as talks on ending the war have proceeded 
rapidly in recent months khmer rouge leaders have rejected all 
peace proposals and western officials say they apparently have 
made no attempts to end alleged human rights abuses 
the khmer rouge moved about 7000 people from ta luan to the 
border area in november apparently to populate strategic areas 
inside cambodia gunners inside cambodia responded with heavy 
shelling reportedly inflicting numerous casualties and forcing 
thousands of refugees back to the camp 
relief officials say khmer rouge guerrillas often isolate 
refugees because they want to make sure the refugees are not 
polluted by western influences and do not defect to 
noncommunist resistance groups

frustrated by her hollywood bosses actress 
kelly mcgillis is taking a holiday from her lucrative film career 
and happily returning to the shakespearean stage where shell play 
some longsought comedy roles 
a comedian kelly mcgillis the gentle young amish beauty whose 
demure sensuality tempted harrison ford in witness the tough 
district attorney in the accused the woman who had tom cruise 
flying emotional barrel rolls in top gun 
i have good instincts and a good sense of timing she says 
quietly i have a good sense of humor 
miss mcgillis will get her chance to display her comic talents 
when she joins the acting company of the shakespeare theater at the 
folger for its four productions next season which begins in 
september 
she will appear in two shakespeare comedies twelfth night 
and merry wives of windsor as well as the tempest she 
also will play the title role in friedrich von schillers tragic 
drama mary stuart 
she was interviewed over a latemorning breakfast at her hotel 
two poached eggs whole wheat toast and cappuccino a few hours 
before she attended the annual helen hayes awards show monday night 
at the national theater 
she was nominated for but did not receive a bestactress 
helen for her portia in the folgers production of merchant 
of venice last year the awards recognize outstanding 
achievements in washingtons professional theater community 
miss mcgillis is eagerly looking forward to her ninemonth 
sabbatical from the movie grind partly because shell be working 
again with michael kahn the folgers artistic director they first 
met in 1979 when she was a drama student and he was a teacher at 
the juilliard school in new york 
michael knows my weaknesses and my strengths and i think he 
will push me to get better she said 
thats very difficult to find when you work in film where you 
only come together with a group of people for two or three months 
and then you leave with michael theres a sense of continuity 
hes seen me and my work over the years 
she says shell also enjoy staying close to her new husband 
california yacht broker fred tillman whom she married last new 
years eve they plan to live in a small rooming house near the 
folger with the nine other members of the theaters acting company 
what are her strengths 
probably commitment thoroughness and i think the ability to 
work with other people i really am an artist who truly 
believes that what i do cannot be done without other people 
theater is a communal art we all need one another on that stage or 
in that film 
her biggest weakness confidence she replies with a low 
chuckle she doesnt look insecure shes told ah but you dont 
know me she replies i may be 5 foot 10 but inside im only 5 
foot 1 
miss mcgillis says she is drawn to the poetry the beauty of 
language the sense of period and style in shakespeares plays 
for which she was trained at juilliard she readily acknowledges 
that her string of screen hits has made her wealthy enough to 
afford the luxury of a lowpaid season on the folger stage 
at 31 she can boast nearly a dozen movies plus an occasional 
stage appearance she refuses to be typecast as the new grace 
kelly and says she plays a very unwholesome type of woman in 
her latest film cat chaser 
she complains though that hollywoods playitsafe producers 
arent willing to take a multimilliondollar gamble and cast her in 
comedies or classical drama so her stint at the folger she says 
will really be a challenge and push me forward in a way that i 
havent allowed to do in films 
in her days as a single actress miss mcgillis seduced harrison 
ford in witness with a convincing display of sexual fireworks 
did she feel the same way when the cameras werent rolling she was 
asked 
hes not my type she replied harrisons a nice man i 
dont look at him as a sex symbol i look at him as an actor hes 
very charming and hes very delightful to work with 
did she ever have a crush on any leading man 
yes i have but i wont tell you which ones she said 
laughing its none of your business

a sixstory hotel going up closer to the 
airport than expected because of a typographical error is 
interfering with traffic controllers radar but a federal official 
says flights are in no danger 
the federal aviation administration today sent a jet full of 
computer equipment to fly around the portland international jetport 
to find the gaps in coverage caused by the quality suites 
we considered it urgent faa spokesman michael ciccarelli 
said this morning a day after 16 controllers brought the gaps to 
the faas attention 
the faa blamed the problem on an error in plans submitted by the 
hotel developers to the faa for approval 
they showed it 12000 feet from the runway it was actually 
1170 feet said jim lucas manager of the faas new england air 
traffic division 
however lucas said the airport is safe and that air traffic 
routes could be changed if a serious enough problem is detected 
i think any time we lose radar coverage its a problem but we 
have the ability to procedurally work around it he said 
the situation might be corrected by moving the radar said 
cheryl readio local president of the national air traffic 
controllers association 
i dont think theyll knock down the hotel she said 
somebody already goofed and allowed the hotel to be built 
she said local flights could fall out of the radars sight as 
could planes coming in from boston if they are flying under 6000 
feet 
a spokesman for the air traffic controllers union in washington 
characterized the gaps as serious 
if you can imagine the radar all of a sudden a big slice of 
pie becomes dead tony dresden said theyre starting to lose 
things its about eight miles which is a big chunk of space 
dunfey properties inc president bob dunfey jr said tuesday the 
hotel is being built according to plans signed by the faa and 
ciccarelli said the error was an innocent mistake 
were not pointing the finger at anyone he said

thousands of students bicycled to major media and 
government offices today to protest censorship and officials 
announced their first policy change in response to demands made in 
nearly a month of prodemocracy protests 
the ministry of supervision said today it will allow more open 
news reporting of corruption cases a move prompted by the recent 
demands of beijing university students to crack down on 
corruption 
todays protest by more than 5000 students came a day after 
government officials received a petition signed by more than 1000 
chinese journalists seeking press freedom 
thousands of students in the northern city of taiyuan also took 
to the streets today in what the official xinhua news agency 
described as massive demonstrations 
xinhua said the students held sitins in front of a hotel and 
the headquarters of the shanxi provincial government demanding 
dialogue with the governor the twosentence report gave no other 
details 
it was the first protest reported in taiyuan 260 miles 
southwest of beijing since students in the capital began 
demonstrating in midapril 
the beijing demonstration was largely to support the 
journalists petition 
were riding bicycles today because were too tired to walk 
said a history student who attended four recent marches along the 
10mile route from the nations top schools to tiananmen square 
downtown 
the road to democracy is very long said a tibetan student 
from the nationalities institute we are riding on bicycles to 
get there faster 
about 1000 protesters pedaled out of beijing university the 
countrys most prestigious and were joined by students from about 
six other schools 
protesters filled all six lanes of the street in front of their 
first stop china central television headquarters and shouted 
slogans critical of the governmentcontrolled media 
the peoples daily cheats the people they chanted 
referring to the ruling communist partys official newspaper the 
press must speak the truth they yelled 
many cyclists wore green yellow and red headbands that read 
democracy freedom and beijing university 
as the colorful procession passed major intersections lined with 
workers several students would raise both hands to flash the v 
for victory sign 
police who in previous demonstrations tried to block 
protesters helped clear the way for the bicyclists as traffic 
backed up for several miles some students distributed leaflets on 
buses that urged liberate the press 
after the rally outside the tv headquarters the protesters 
moved to the main office of staterun xinhua news agency and later 
to police headquarters where they chanted thank you police for 
working for the people 
on its way to the peoples daily the party mouthpiece the 
processions loose organization gave way to some disorder when it 
ran into rushhour traffic 
at the peoples daily several thousand people gathered outside 
and cheered as the students inched by a group of about 50 writers 
and poets also joined the protest march by evening the students 
were on their way home 
cyclists carried a statement protesting government delays 
toward the students request for a dialogue and demanding that 
as soon as possible the government hold a true open dialogue that 
will resolve problems of concern to the broad masses of people 
the government has refused to meet with independent student 
groups established over the past month 
at the front of the leisurely paced procession were students 
traveling by threewheel pedicart who held high a banner that said 
the press must speak the truth 
a free press is a major demand of university students who since 
midapril have staged the largest demonstrations in communist 
chinas 40year history early this week we were tired but now 
we are ready to fight again said one history student from 
beijing university a campus of more than 10000 
the last mass march was thursday when tens of thousands of 
people poured into tiananmen square the countrys symbolic seat 
of power to celebrate the 70th anniversary of chinas first 
student movement 
the bicycle procession was organized by beijing university 
where sentiment to maintain the prodemocracy movement is strongest 
when other schools decided to end a twoweek class boycott over 
the weekend beijing university students immediately voted to 
continue the strike to apply pressure on the government to respond 
to their demands

china and vietnam backers of rival forces in the 
cambodian war failed to make progress at talks to end the 
10yearold war the official xinhua news agency reported today 
three days of talks between vietnams deputy foreign minister 
dinh nho liem and his chinese counterpart liu shuqing ended today 
we had hoped for some progress toward a fair and reasonable 
settlement of the cambodian issue and its a pity that the 
consultations have made no progress and achieved no 
understanding the agency quoted chinese foreign minister qian 
qichen as saying 
qian who also met dinh said chinas relations with vietnam 
will improve only after the cambodian conflict is resolved 
vietnamese sources said the talks contributed to mutual 
understanding 
relations have been strained since china launched a 20day 
border war against vietnam in early 1979 to punish hanoi for its 
invasion of cambodia 
china is the main backer of the antivietnamese resistance 
battling vietnamese troops and forces of the hun sen government 
hanoi installed in phnom penh 
the sources said the two sides agreed on previous positions that 
china will stop aid to the resistance after vietnam withdraws its 
estimated 50000 to 70000 troops from cambodia 
hanoi has said it will pull out all troops by the end of 
september 
the sources also reiterated their broad agreement on the need 
for international supervision of the withdrawal that the future 
government in cambodia should be nonaligned and neutral and that 
an international conference on cambodia be convened as soon as 
possible 
the two sides still differed on the composition of a proposed 
coalition government to be formed after the vietnamese depart the 
sources said 
the resistance led by prince norodom sihanouk has called for 
the hun sen government to be dismantled before a coalition is 
formed an idea rejected by vietnam and phnom penh 
vietnam also has refused to accept sihanouks call for un 
supervision of the troop withdrawal 
the meeting was the second following a secret visit by dinh to 
beijing in january for the first highlevel contacts between the 
two countries in more than nine years 
both sides agreed today the consultations should continue but 
did not set a date for the next meeting 
vietnams invasion of cambodia ended the brutal regime of the 
khmer rouge which in its campaign to turn the country into an 
agrarian commune caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
people through execution and starvation 
the dinh visit comes just one week before soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev arrives in beijing for the first sinosoviet summit in 
30 years china is critical of the soviet union for supporting 
vietnams military presence in cambodia and the cambodian question 
is expected to be discussed in detail during gorbachevs visit

eventual creation of a palestinian state will be acceptable 
negotiating partners with israel 
shamir has called for elections in the occupied lands to choose 
representatives who would negotiate an interim arrangement with 
israel on limited palestinian selfrule 
we cant talk with the plo because their minimum demand is a 
palestinian state we cant agree to this shamir told israel 
radio therefore we have to talk to people who are interested in 
a solution those who dont insist on this minimum demand for a 
palestinian state 
the plo and leading palestinians have rejected shamirs plan 
according to arab reports the worst violence today was in the 
west bank town of ramallah where troops opened fire to disperse 
about 200 palestinians throwing stones 
a 17yearold palestinian identified as mahoud sami abdul 
ranni arrived dead at ramallah hospital with a gunshot wound in 
the chest hospital officials said one youth was wounded in the 
clash

gaza strip twentyone israelis have died

army that soldiers hampered the work of its medical crews saturday 
when troops fatally shot three palestinians and wounded dozens of 
others in the gaza strip 
there have been problems with stopping ambulances from time 
to time but we have never had so many incidents as on saturday 
said a western un official speaking on condition of anonymity 
in a statement issued in vienna the agency said ambulances 
carrying injured persons were repeatedly stopped and searched by 
the israeli military 
army officials said they could not immediately comment on the 
report by the agency the agency was set up in 1949 to care for 
palestinians made refugees at the founding of israel

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 4 
the journalbulletin providence ri on yasser arafat 
yasser arafats public relations campaign is in full swing and 
last week he found himself in paris received by president 
mitterrand of france 
this is of course a significant breakthrough for the head of 
the palestine liberation organization recognition by the french 
head of state is exactly the sort of ammunition the plo requires in 
its diplomatic campaign 
it is a step or two above the american decision long overdue 
to talk to the principal voice of the palestinian people 
arafat did tell the french that he explicitly disavows the old 
plo charter a provision of which calls for the destruction of 
israel 
that is real progress now if arafat will take action 
against these internecine killings he may lend some real substance 
to his diplomatic status

daily news los angeles on iranian moderates 
when exnational security adviser robert c mcfarlane and oliver 
north then a national security council aide flew to iran in may 
1986 to exchange military parts covertly for american hostages 
more than an armsforhostages deal was supposedly at stake 
the other goal or so president reagan later claimed was to 
increase contacts with socalled iranian moderates who presumably 
would improve relations with the united states and soften irans 
brutal government after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
one of the moderates who administration officials had long 
hoped would produce a diplomatic breakthrough was hashemi 
rafsanjani speaker of the iranian parliament who was endorsed 
sunday by departing president ali khamenei as his successor 
on friday the moderate rafsanjani urged palestinians to 
kill americans and their western allies to avenge arabs killed in 
the 17 months of rioting in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip he recommended that for every palestinian killed in the 
uprising five americans britons or frenchmen be assassinated 
rafsanjani has shown unfortunately that hes more than ready 
to carry on in the khomeini tradition

the charleston wva gazette on the oliver north verdict 
the reagan administrations place in us history was further 
cemented may 4 by the conviction of oliver north ronald reagans 
idea of a national hero 
the guilty verdict was more than a finding against one white 
house agent on three specific violations it will be seen around 
the globe as a judgment against ciastyle covert wars 
when the president attempted to overthrow tiny nicaragua hiding 
the operation from the american people he broke the first rule of 
democracy that the people decide their nations actions the 
concealment failed and america was dishonored in the eyes of most 
of the human race the world court found america guilty of 
treatybreaking 
for years the kremlin and its kgb sponsored surrogate wars in 
other nations we hope the north verdict helps terminate 
americas participation in this ugly practice

the greenwood miss commonwealth on the oliver north verdict 
oliver l north really believed in his covert mission of helping 
the nicaraguan rebels who were struggling against the communist 
sandinista government which runs the country were persuaded that 
he thought what he was doing was the right thing to do 
but he violated the law he lied to people in authority he 
deceived congress even when persons are loyal and wellmeaning 
that is no excuse for deceit that violates the law 
the jury in the north trial obviously had a tough time coming to 
a decision jury members deliberated painfully over 12 days before 
reaching their verdict not guilty of nine of the charges against 
him but guilty of shredding documents of accepting payment for the 
13800 security system installed at his home and of destroying and 
falsifying records and aiding and abetting the obstruction of 
congress as we recall north conceded as much during the trial 
while north now faces substantial penalties at worst 10 years 
in prison and fines totaling 750000 we suspect his sentence 
will be much lighter and in our view it should be 
were convinced north was not working on his won despite the 
denials of former president ronald reagan and president george 
bush we suspect they knew what north was doing so did cia 
director william casey now dead certainly that mitigates norths 
wrongdoing

capital journal pierre sd on the oliver north verdict 
we believe that while an appeal from the oliver north 
verdict might result in reversing the conviction on those three 
counts president bush should spare the taxpayers and lt col 
north of any further expensive litigation by promptly issuing a 
pardon 
this would not be full compensation for the indignity to which 
he and his family have been subjected during the past year but at 
least it would recognize the validity of his assertion that there 
was no criminal intent on his part and that he believed the orders 
he received from his superiors were lawful

hobbs nm daily newssun on the federal budget agreement 
president bush describes the budget agreement he reached 
recently with congressional leaders as a first manageable step 
toward solving the nations deficit problem 
what he and congressional leaders dont say is that the step was 
manageable only because it was so small 
although the accord nominally meets the 1990 grammrudman 
deficit target it does so through the use of rosy scenarios and 
accounting flimflam leaving the real deficit virtually untouched 
by now the devices of budget fudging are drearily familiar 
faced with the task of reducing the deficit from 163 billion the 
estimate for the current year to the required 100 billion the 
negotiators first agreed to assume that the economy will grow 
faster with lower inflation and interest rates than any private 
forecaster dares predict that cut the problem in half 
then came the usual accounting evasions assume 500 million in 
new revenues from unspecified internal revenue service actions 
save 22 billion in postal spending by moving the postal 
service off budget cut farm support programs by 900 million 
by making october payments to farmers in september a move that 
saves taxpayers no money but shifts the spending out of the coming 
budget year onto this years account require changes in law that 
will yield 53 billion in new revenue without being viewed as new 
taxes 
using this smoke and mirrors technique congress and the 
president will pretend to have done their job

dallas times herald on the fsx deal 
president bushs decision to proceed with the codevelopment of 
the fsx fighter for the japanese air force may be economically 
sound in the short term 
but its difficult to justify the deal on a longterm basis 
because it gives japan commercial and military technology it has 
been unable to develop and which it will use to build a competitive 
aerospace industry 
bush was right to discard some aspects of the deal set by 
president reagan and to ensure that us firms receive at least 40 
percent of the production revenues but that does not correct the 
basic flaw in the transaction providing crucial technology to 
assist japan in developing a competing industry 
congress should reject this pact and let japan try to compete 
alone 
there are three drawbacks 
the agreement is not binding like a contract or a treaty 
development of the fsx will not necessarily provide jobs 
the administration is providing the japanese with the basic 
source codes for the crafts armaments system though the japanese 
will have to develop their own high performance weapons and 
interlocking operational software this is excessively generous 
bush asserts us firms will share in the development of 
phasedarray radar systems and highperformance composite wing 
material what he overlooks is the japanese do not have these 
items the radar is the domain of texas instruments esystems and 
other us firms and the aircraft giants such as gd lockheed and 
mcdonnelldouglass pioneered composites 
its not likely the japanese in the next decade can surpass 
the existing lead of us firms and the advances they are sure to 
develop so there will be no japanese gains in which american firms 
reasonably can share 
aviation experts do not believe the japanese can create the 
worlds most demanding technological machines in the next decade 
for that reason it would be preferable to let the japanese go it 
alone rather than provide the tools to boost them to the top

independent marshall minn on new ethics legislation 
the integrity in postemployment act of 1989 has been introduced 
in congress by rep craig t james rfla 
it is a good bill designed to help restore integrity and 
honesty to service in congress and throughout the federal 
government it should sail through congress but probably wont 
the honor that once graced government service no longer exists 
disappearing in a pattern of abuse by public officials at every 
level the problems are rampant and have been festering for years 
elected officials have lost their commitment to the values of 
honesty and integrity and accountability 
significant changes in current federal laws will be required to 
correct the present flawed system of ethics dishonest and 
unethical behavior cannot be legislated away of course but laws 
can be put into place that would close the potential avenues of 
corruption as well as severely punish those who are corrupt 
james legislation would do that the essence of his proposal is 
simple it establishes an equality of ethical rules for all 
branches of government for far too long congress has demanded 
high ethical standards from others while exempting itself from even 
the most perfunctory ones

seattle postintelligencer on flight attendants work periods 
this week a house subcommittee will hold hearings on a topic 
that ought to interest every airline passenger the length of work 
periods required of airline flight attendants 
a bill sponsored by rep norman y mineta dcalif would set 
limits on the number of consecutive hours flight attendants must 
work 
as it now stands flight attendants are the only crew members 
not covered by federal aviation administration regulations to limit 
work hours and they have been known to be required to work 24hour 
shifts since the faa requires the flight attendants to be aboard 
for safety reasons the rationale for this oversight is hard to 
figure 
in an emergency passengers depend for their safety on the 
alertness and quick response of cabin attendants a cabin attendant 
who is exhausted from long flights and quick turnarounds with no 
rest break is a potential safety hazard to passengers 
protecting flight attendants from exploitation that hampers 
their performance is public interest legislation that deserves 
speedy enactment

the wichita kan eaglebeacon on cracks impact on children 
when childrens advocate david liederman addressed members of 
the kansas childrens service league last week he emphasized the 
dire consequences to children and families that result from drug 
abuse particularly crack cocaine 
the strong correlation between substance abuse especially 
crack and escalating rates of child abuse and neglect is 
convincing and deeply troubling 
current federal priorities sadly help assure that children who 
dont even smoke crack will remain its frontline victims 
the federal government if it is truly serious about the war on 
drugs must devote more spending on programs that help 
drugafflicted children and families without assistance from a 
benevolent government children of crack addicts may well consider 
themselves americas unloved and unwanted

the daily astorian astoria ore on the spotted owl 
controversy 
for anyone who has followed northwest timber politics for more 
than a few years the current hullabaloo over the northern spotted 
owl has a familiar ring we have heard these kinds of 
prophecies of doom before 
the likelihood that the fish and wildlife service will list the 
owl as a threatened species has given license to industrys hit 
men 
the aspect of the timber industrys grumbling that gets a little 
tiresome is the implicit attitude that everyone else must give way 
in favor of its economic demands that attitude becomes especially 
galling when you review the industrys historically favored 
position in the federal tax code or its subsidies 
it is no secret that a number of companies have overcut their 
northwest lands 
the industry has already sent more than 60 times as many raw 
logs overseas to be cut by japanese and other foreign sawmills as 
are in jeopardy because of the spotted owl

exxon corp under prodding from the bush 
administration announced today it plans to sharply increase the 
number of workers and ships cleaning spilled oil from more than 300 
miles of alaska shoreline 
transportation secretary samuel skinner called the move a 
substantial increase in manpower and resources by exxon and said 
it improves the likelihood that the oil company will meet its 
cleanup goals for this summer 
nevertheless said skinner the cleanup effort might still have 
to be continued in the spring of 1990 exxon said it is confident 
it can clean the shoreline by september with the added manpower and 
ships 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground in alaskas prince william 
sound on march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons into the 
pristine waters of the sound within days the oil spread down the 
southern alaska coast causing environmental and economic havoc 
the coast guard estimates that more than 300 miles of rocky 
shoreline needs to be cleaned by hand and highpowered water hoses 
in recent weeks cleanup efforts have proven to be much more 
difficult than exxon had expected on the soiled shoreline of smith 
island which was particularly hard hit 
in a revised cleanup plan submitted to the coast guard exxon 
said it will increase the number of people to be involved in the 
summer cleanup from a previously planned 3400 workers to 5000 it 
also said it will bring in seven additional barges and 17 more 
landing craft bringing the number of vessels to 70 
the additional manpower and vessels will allow the number of 
people directly employed on the battlefront on the shoreline to 
increase by over 1000 from 1475 to 2500 william d stevens 
president of exxon co usa said in a statement 
exxon executives met with skinner and john sununu president 
bushs chief of staff at the white house on monday and were told 
their earlier cleanup plan was inadequate to meet the companys 
announced cleanup goals officials said 
coast guard vice adm clyde robbins told exxon officials in a 
letter monday that additional manpower was needed he said in light 
of the problems exxon has had with cleaning up smith island he was 
seriously concerned that the investment of resources you 
described earlier will not be able to clean the 300plus miles of 
shoreline in the time allotted 
robbins said exxons cleanup plan was well designed but that 
the company needed to substantially increase its workforce with 
an aim at quickening the rate of beach cleanup 
exxon and the federal government has been under sharp criticism 
for its lack of coordination and pace of the cleanup in the first 
few weeks after the spill since then the coast guard gradually 
has assumed increased oversight in the effort although the actual 
work and development of cleanup plans continue largely to be in 
exxon hands 
exxon has acknowledged that they need to do more and the 
substantial increase in manpower and resources described today will 
allow them to accelerate the pace of the cleanup skinner said in 
a statement

the annual assembly of the world health 
organization today put off for 48 hours a decision on the plos 
controversial bid to be admitted as a state member of the 
166nation un body 
failure by the arab countries to obtain an immediate vote 
boosted hopes of those favoring a compromise to head off a showdown 
with the united states 
washington has threatened to stop all financial support to any 
un agency that grants full membership to the palestine liberation 
organization which now is a nonvoting observer in the united 
nations 
the united states made that threat even though it reveresed a 
longstanding policy earlier this year and opened talks with the plo 
after its chairman yasser arafat recognized israels right to 
exist 
on friday the who annual assembly will vote on two rival draft 
resolutions 
one cosponsored by all 21 arab countries would admit the 
state of palestine as a member of the 166nation organization 
the other backed by nine western and third world states would 
combine deferring the issue until the 1990 assembly with calls for 
increased assistance to residents of the israelioccupied gaza 
strip and west bank 
an austrian motion to adjourn the debate until friday seconded 
by canada was carried by 5647 votes with 20 abstentions bahrain 
seconded by libya opposed adjourning 
the western and third world resolution invites the assembly to 
express the hope that the palestinian people will be fully 
represented within the who by their legitimate representatives 
that language apparently is addressed at developing countries 
that sympathize with the plo but are worried by who 
directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajimas warning that a cutoff of 
us funds would completely destroy the agency the united 
states funds a quarter of the organizations budget and this year 
contributed 71 million 
who plays a vital role in assisting governments worldwide to 
strengthen their health services and advance work to eradicate 
diseases such as aids and to promote health care and nutrition 
washington and its western allies say the plodeclared state 
of palestine does not fulfill internationally accepted criteria 
of statehood including control of a defined territory 
us secretary of state james baker iii also has says plo 
admission would harm the middle east peace process and the entire 
un system 
but the plo seems determined to push its bid throughout the un 
system with support of nearly 100 of the 159 member states that 
have recognized the state of palestine or acknowledged its 
proclamation 
on tuesday the plo announced in paris that it will seek 
admission to three more un bodies the parisbased un 
educational scientific and cultural organization the romebased 
food and agriculture organization and the genevabased 
international labor organization 
the international labor organization probably will be the next 
target because its annual conference opens june 7 admission 
however would require a twothirds majority while a simple 
majority suffices in the who assembly 
the united states which withdrew from the international labor 
organization from 1977 to 1980 to protest what it charged was 
growing politicization pays onefourth of its budget of 357 
million for fiscal 198889

a gunman killed his exwife and then commandeered 
a small plane and swooped over boston for three hours strafing 
logan airport and firing at baseball fans leaving fenway park 
authorities said today 
alfred james hunter iii awaited arraignment today on charges of 
murdering his former wife elvira in front of their 5yearold son 
tuesday night 
the 42yearold licensed pilot took to the skies after the 
slaying in an aerial shooting spree during which he buzzed the 
control tower at logan four times before landing with just five 
minutes worth of fuel authorities said 
the fourth time the controllers were directed to literally 
vacate the tower and relocate to the radar room until further 
notice said michael ciccarelli a spokesman for the federal 
aviation administration 
no injuries were reported from the shots fired from the plane 
trooper barbara bennett said authorities decided to track the 
twoseat cessna by radar from the ground and wait for it to run out 
of fuel instead of sending a helicopter after it because youd be 
a sitting duck in the air 
there was a high degree of frustration for authorities on the 
ground but it wouldnt have made sense to go up after him 
bennett said 
hunters flight took him over the kenmore square neighborhood 
where the boston red sox had just finished a game police found two 
shell casings nearby he also flew under a bridge over boston 
harbor and buzzed several other neighborhoods and the post office 
where he worked authorities said 
he kept divebombing it there said richard serino a deputy 
superintendent of boston emergency medical services the people 
were saying it looked like he was going to crash then he pulled up 
and did a couple of turns 
hunter was captured peacefully when he landed at the airport 
shortly after 1 am no weapons were found police said they did 
not know how many shots were fired from the plane two casings and 
two live shells were in the aircraft 
the trouble began in danvers 30 miles north of boston when 
hunter shot his exwife three times at her home with a rifle in 
front of their son steven said danvers police sgt richard 
landers trooper mark lynch said the couple divorced two years 
ago had appeared in court tuesday but he declined to say why 
hunters wife was believed to be in her mid30s 
after the shooting hunter fled in his van tried but failed to 
wave a car down with his gun and then stole a car at gunpoint at a 
restaurant in peabody 
the car owner told police hunter was carrying an assault rifle 
lynch said the casings recovered might have come from an ak47 or 
another largecaliber weapon 
hunter drove the stolen car to an airport in beverly where he 
took the plane landers said robert golder a 21yearold flight 
instructor said hunter wielding a rifle ordered him to start the 
plane and leave the cockpit 
he told me not to do anything stupid he said he had just 
killed some people golder said he said he headed back to the 
airport with his back to the man 
i thought about running i thought about dropping to the 
ground i just walked calmly he said 
at one point 10 rounds were fired at a continental airlines jet 
that was on the ground at logan but missed the plane and a mechanic 
working underneath said faa agent stacy grace shots ricocheted 
off the runway and a building she said 
airports across massachusetts and in new hampshire were alerted 
said trooper byron rizos 
a man showed police a shell casing he said had fallen from the 
sky and struck him one other casing was found nearby theres no 
question its from the plane said robert hayden deputy police 
superintendent

police broke up a demonstration today by about 40 
soviet jews calling on the united states to keep denying 
mostfavorednation trading status to the soviet union as long as 
limits on emigration remain 
the halfhour protest outside moscows international trade 
center came on the first day of secretary of state james bakers 
visit to moscow and at least four of the demonstrators were to 
meet later in the evening with baker at the us embassy protest 
organizer yuri semenovsky said 
many in the group which stood on the pedestal of a statue of 
mercury the roman god of trade carried banners calling on the 
us government to maintain the 1972 jacksonvanik amendment the 
measure bars trade concessions to communist states unless the 
president can state that he has received assurances that emigration 
will be liberalized 
i wait for permission to leave the ussr for 10 years 
another protest sign read mr vanik we are still here said 
another 
jewish emigration from the soviet union rose in april to its 
highest level since 1979 with 4129 soviet jews allowed to leave 
according to the genevabased intergovernmental committee for 
migration which helps emigres resettle 
charles vanik no longer in congress called may 4 for waiving 
the restrictions he had cosponsored for one year saying such 
action would encourage further human rights improvements in the 
soviet union under president mikhail s gorbachev but semenovsky 
claimed it was misleading to look only at the emigration figures 
the soviets say only 1 percent to 3 percent of those who want 
to leave are refused permission he said but thats only the 
tip of the iceberg many others want to leave but are afraid to 
apply or the government will not accept their applications 
semenovsky leader of a refusenik group called poor 
relatives said the jacksonvanik amendment should not be 
repealed until the soviet union passes a law allowing anyone who 
wants to to emigrate he claimed that 100000 people were refused 
permission last year 
uniformed police and kgb agents in plainclothes surrounded the 
protesters and forced them off the statues pedestal after a local 
government official announced through a bullhorn that the 
demonstration was illegal 
although police placed their hands on some protesters shoulders 
to make them leave there were no arrests or violence

a trapper harpooned the biggest 
alligator on record in florida a 13foot 10inch reptile that 
weighed in at 1043 pounds 
biologists needed a tow truck to maneuver the gator onto three 
scales 
licensed trapper columbus white hauled the gator out of a lake 
april 17 because patrons of a fish camp 10 miles from gainesville 
felt threatened the florida game and freshwater fish commission 
said tuesday 
we occasionally get reports of gators longer than 14 feet but 
this was the longest and heaviest one ever officially measured in 
florida said woody woodward a biologist with the agency 
it took three hours to land the alligator white said 
the gator produced 294 pounds of meat and 15 feet of hide with a 
combined wholesale value of about 2500 woodward said 
two days later a game officer trapped the largest bear ever 
captured in the commissions nuisance bear program the 475pound 
black bear had been destroying beehives in the florida panhandle 
it was too big for a standard trap so a game officer baited it 
with honey laced with a tranquilizer the bear was later released 
in the area because it was not considered a menace to people 
before it regained consciousness a tooth was pulled to check 
the bears age and discourage the animal from returning to the 
hives by making him associate the capture and toothache with the 
site said biologist steve shea

the justice department said today it will 
launch its own review of house speaker jim wrights conduct after 
the house completes its ethics investigation of the congressional 
leader 
at the same time wrights new eightlawyer defense team was 
filing a series of legal motions aimed at combatting the 69 formal 
charges against the texas democrat and the house ethics committee 
is considering whether to expand its case against the speaker 
i expect the department will take an independent look said 
david runkel spokesman for attorney general dick thornburgh the 
department would review matters brought up by the house ethics 
committee and other matters that have been raised such as 
wrights involvement in a 1985 political fundraising effort in 
texas he said 
runkel said the departments review of wrights conduct will 
begin after the house has completed its ethics process and 
regardless of the outcome on capitol hill 
wright escalated the battle tuesday saying his legal team has 
been profoundly shocked by the lack of professionalism and the 
prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy in the report by the 
ethics committees outside counsel chicago lawyer richard j 
phelan 
and wright told reporters the committee had been totally 
dependent on mr phelans interpretation and his summary of the 
investigation in charging him with wrongdoing 
on allegations that his wife didnt work for her 18000ayear 
salary on the payroll of fort worth developer george mallick 
wright said the report was a lie a falsehood a distortion and a 
misrepresentation of the testimony 
ethics panel members however dismissed the harsh attack as a 
defense gambit im glad you recognize that is the strategy 
chairman julian dixon dcalif said when asked about the defense 
attacks 
dixon and other committee members said wrights complaint was 
unfounded because they had thoroughly read transcripts of the 
panels witness interviews and examined underlying evidence in 
reaching their conclusions 
i think the committee has done its homework very well said 
rep larry craig ridaho a panel member 
the ethics committee was meeting today to consider whether to 
file additional charges against wright stemming from a lucrative 
1988 texas gas drilling venture and whether to investigate further 
a list of other issues that have arisen in news media reports in 
recent weeks 
dixon said the committee also has asked for transcripts and 
other documents from the texas fraud trial of three savings and 
loan executives where wrights name surfaced in testimony last 
week 
although wright is not directly involved in the trial it raised 
anew the issue of whether he tried to exert improper influence on 
behalf of the sampl industry the ethics committee already has looked 
at similar questions but did not bring charges 
we just cant get our platter cleared off before more is piled 
onto it said rep john t myers of indiana the panels senior 
republican 
in defense motions filed tuesday wrights lawyers asked for 
access to committee documents and witnesses and sought to bar 
private contact between the committee and phelan who has served 
thus far as a staff member to the panel 
clearly the risk is great that the committee will be 
biased by hearing only one side of the story or by hearing one side 
under exceptionally favorable circumstances stated one of the 
motions 
further motions were being prepared asking that the most serious 
charges against wright be dismissed because the defense contends 
they are based on a faulty reading of house rules the motions all 
must be ruled on by the ethics committee 
i think mr wright will be totally cleared in any fair trial 
before his peers said stephen d susman a houston trial lawyer 
among those brought in to bolster the speakers defense team 
wright is charged in 69 counts with evading house limits on 
outside earned income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and 
with improperly accepting some 145000 in gifts from mallick who 
the committee has deemed had a direct interest in legislation 
before congress 
but wrights attorneys argued that a strict reading of the rules 
permits house members to collect unlimited book royalties they 
also sought to make the case that mallick had no direct interest in 
legislation as defined by the rules and therefore any gifts 
from him to the wrights would be acceptable 
the lawyers contended phelan misread the history behind the 
rules and brought charges when none were warranted phelans 
charges amount to a rewriting of the rules the defense lawyers 
said

some farmers are stuck in the mud others wish 
it would rain enough to create some muddy fields 
crops continued to suffer in major areas of the great plains 
while too much rain slowed spring planting in the eastern corn belt 
and the southeast the governments joint agricultural weather 
facility reported tuesday 
nationally winter wheat was in mostly fairtopoor condition 
during the week of may 17 although the great plains crop was 
rated below that in the pacific northwest corn belt and 
southeast winter wheat was in mostly good to fair shape 
the report said 89 percent of the winter wheat crop in kansas 
was in very poor or poor condition and continued to deteriorate 
due to lack of moisture during the week 
but cool wet weather reduced crop stress in oklahoma where 
wheat was reported in mostly fair condition lack of moisture 
continued to hurt the crop in colorado and nebraska 
harvesting of the 1989 winter wheat crop has begun in southern 
texas and will gradually move north the agriculture department 
will issue its first official estimate of this years production on 
thursday 
meanwhile the facility which is operated jointly by usda and 
the commerce department said corn planting nationally was about 43 
percent completed eight percentage points behind normal for this 
time of year 
lack of moisture has slowed germination and emergency of 
corn in kansas the report said rain continued to slow 
planting in the eastern corn belt and the southeast 
corn planting was 42 percentage points behind in ohio and 25 
points behind in indiana the report said while planting trailed 
the usual pace by 34 percentage points in north carolina 
only about 5 percent of the soybean crop had been planted four 
percentage points behind the normal pace although planting was 
under way in all major soybean states except minnesota and north 
carolina

the agriculture department has put federally 
inspected poultry and hog slaughtering plants in arkansas under 
intensified surveillance for traces of the cancercausing 
pesticide heptachlor 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said tuesday the agency may expand 
testing into surrounding states over the next few weeks the 
steppedup program for heptachlor in arkansas began on monday he 
said 
the usda agency has been monitoring arkansas slaughter plants 
since january for traces of heptachlor after finding contaminated 
poultry at townsends of arkansas in batesville he said 
we also began surveillance testing in other poultry and 
redmeat slaughtering plants in arkansas to determine if the 
heptachlor problem extended beyond townsends crawford said 
regrettably we found additional problems 
one hog tested positive for heptachlor at unacceptable levels 
and two others showed traces of the chemical meanwhile he said 
the food and drug administration reported unacceptable heptachlor 
levels in noncommerial egg samples 
contaminated feed is the suspected cause although the fda has 
not been able to determine the specific source at least four feed 
mills have been under investigation 
crawford said his agency will inform the fda whenever actual 
or potential violations are detected through our testing 
meanwhile the fda will attempt to determine who bought the 
contaminated feed after that crawford said his inspectors will 
test animals from those producers 
the problems occurring with heptachlor are disturbing he 
said heptachlor has been shown to induce tumors in mice in 
1978 the environmental protection agency banned heptachlor for all 
agricultural uses except as a seed treatment but it is apparent 
from the problems were finding now that residues from treated seed 
persist in food animals 
crawford said the problem will not be resolved until the 
practice of using chemically treated seed as animal feed is 
stopped we are very encouraged by the epa announcement that they 
will ban the future use of heptachlor on treated seed he added

when the agriculture department talks about an 
underground spy camera the camera really is under the ground six 
feet or so under 
dan r upchurch of the departments agricultural research 
service says hed rather poke a camera in the ground than dig 
down six feet or so and pull out a plant roots and all 
upchurch a soil scientist at the agencys research facility in 
lubbock texas showed some of underground videos at an annual 
symposium this week at beltsville md 
another alternative to pulling out plants roots and all is to 
use a rhizotron a roomsized cellar with glass observation windows 
just as zoo and marine aquarium visitors view underwater life 
upchurchs version is a minirhizotron which uses a portable 
color video system that lets scientists watch roots develop over an 
entire growing season a clear plastic tube is inserted in the soil 
and a pocketsized video camera is lowered the researchers watch 
roots on a television monitor 
the roots are seen about 25 times actual size depending on the 
monitor he said through timelapse photography droughtstricken 
roots are seen to break up as the soil shrinks

hud secretary jack kemp said today that 
fighting drugs in public housing rank in importance with repair and 
modernization of units as hundreds of residents gathered outside 
the white house to protest the lack of federal money for 
construction and rehabilitation 
kemp also said that if given flexibility in allocating the 
department of housing and urban developments public housing budget 
and additional money specifically earmarked for antidrug efforts 
he could make a significant attack on the problem 
the antidrug effort in public housing is as important a part 
of modernization and rehabilitation in public housing as anything 
else he told the senates permanent subcommittee on 
investigations 
housing officials and tenants from chicago new york 
washington dc and delaware joined kemp to discuss federal 
antidrug efforts in public housing at the hearing 
meanwhile members of the national tenants organization gathered 
for a rally in lafayette park across from the white house 
were asking hud to make emergency money available for an 
immediate rehabilitation program for all boardedup public 
housing maxine green ntos chairwoman said in advance of the 
rally 
green said her group is concerned with recent estimates that 
70000 units of public housing lie idle and in disrepair 
we talked about drugs years ago and no one wanted to address 
that because they felt it only touched poor people said the ft 
pierce fla resident 
drug abuse and trafficking in public housing have been key 
issues for kemp since he witnessed drug sales while touring 
developments in several major cities in february 
in march kemp waived hud administrative appeals procedures to 
allow public housing officials in virginia to speed evictions of 
suspected drug dealers the secretary said he would extend the 
exemption to other housing authorities that could demonstrate state 
and local laws would provide due process to tenants facing eviction 
last month the secretary outlined a series of antidrug actions 
issuance of photo tenant identification cards installation of 
security fences around projects and increased police patrols 
available to local public housing authorities 
but green said mr kemp was not appointed drug czar and 
the responsibility of dealing with the nations housing problems is 
too great for kemp to take on the added duties of fighting drugs 
she also said nto has requested that kemp appoint a committee of 
representatives from nto hud congress and city officials to work 
with federal drug czar william bennett 
it is within the secretarys responsibility to make sure that 
public housing is decent livable and safe said mary brunette 
kemps special assistant 
i think that although kemps drug initiative in public housing 
is important the real issue is in building more housing and 
maintaining the housing stock that we have left after the reagan 
years said rep joseph kennedy dmass who was to deliver the 
keynote address at the rally marking the tenant groups tenth 
annual save public housing day 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control said he sees no conflict 
between the nto and the secretary because both want to preserve 
public housing 
rangel who was also to appear at the rally said he hadnt seen 
kemps proposals and while he wants to ensure tenants are afforded 
due process in any eviction procedure he was adamant about 
punishment 
when apartments are used for the packaging processing and 
sale of drugs that apartment should not be available to those 
people rangel said they should be in public housing of 
another kind jails

the government announced wednesday its 
support for a 45 billion rail link to handle an anticipated 
increase in commercial transalpine traffic in the next 20 years 
the plans call for a new 31mile tunnel through the gotthard 
massif in central switzerland which would run below the 
107yearold 93mile link the tunnel estimated to be completed 
by the year 2005 would match the length of the channel tunnel 
between britain and france planned for 1993 
the old gotthard tunnel handles more than fourfifths of the 
rail freight passing through switzerland but wont be able to cope 
with an increase in traffic expected after the unified european 
economic community market after 1992 
the project also envisions a new 176mile tunnel through mount 
loetschberg connecting the bern region with western switzerland and 
italy that link could be finished by 1997 
parliament is expected to take up the project next winter if 
100000 people sign petitions against the plan it would be put to 
a nationwide vote 
switzerland has about 680 railway tunnels through its mountains 
it also has about 40 road tunnels including the worlds longest 
101 miles also piercing the gotthard massif

firebombmanufacturing factories neither will we allow them to 
become the bases of violence kang told the national assembly

against rohs government demanding kang and all cabinet ministers 
resign for failing to provide effective leadership 
dissenting legislators charged the government is blocking 
democratic reform and using a crackdown on violent protests to 
suppress all its opponents they accused the government of 
provoking unrest 
the oppositioncontrolled assembly can pass a resolution calling 
on the cabinet to resign but the administration is not obliged by 
law to honor such a motion opposition legislators did not call for 
rohs resignation 
answering their charges kang said diss and undermine the 
seoul government the two nations have been bitter rivals since

a major radical weapon in antigovernment protests and increase 
prison sentences for using them from the existing three years to 
seven years 
opposition leaders have agreed in principle to adopt the 
antifirebomb bill but they contend the government also must limit 
police use of tear gas which they say is excessive and tends to 
aggravate violence 
radical students and the antigovernment dissident groups have 
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views the radicals want a leftist state ruled by workers 
and farmers

thousands of people with perfectly healthy 
hearts are living as virtual cardiac cripples because of chest 
pains caused by untreated anxiety or panic disorders a researcher 
says 
they avoid exertion and fear they might have heart disease even 
after medical tests show their hearts are normal said psychiatrist 
francis kane jr 
he and colleagues surveyed 371 people who had complained of 
chest pain or other apparent heart trouble but who showed no sign 
of disease when tested with a procedure called an angiogram 
an angiogram detects narrowing of the arteries that supply blood 
to the heart muscle that narrowing can set the stage for heart 
attack 
despite the angiogram findings 56 percent of the people were 
unsure about whether they had heart disease fortyfive percent 
feared that exertion would be dangerous and 32 percent said they 
were limited in physical activities 
sixtynine percent of the people qualified for diagnosis of 
panic attacks or another anxiety disorder based on their answers 
to the survey said kane psychiatry professor at the baylor 
college of medicine in houston 
more than 1 million americans have panic attacks which inflict 
sudden bouts of intense terror for no apparent reason according to 
the american psychiatric association 
about half had been told their symptoms were due to stress but 
only 4 percent were told to seek mental health treatment and only 
17 percent were given tranquilizers kane said 
he spoke in an interview before presenting the study tuesday at 
the annual meeting of the american psychiatric association 
in a telephone interview cardiologist adolph hutter of 
massachusetts general hospital in boston said anxiety and stress 
are not the only possible explanations for chest pain in people 
with normal angiogram results 
more common causes in his professional experience he said are 
a spasm in the esophagus the muscular tube leading from the 
pharynx to the stomach or a tenderness of cartilage in the chest 
wall 
brian doyle clinical professor of psychiatry and of family 
medicine at georgetown medical school said kanes paper 
illustrates the way it is 
cases of chest pains and breathing difficulties in response to 
anxiety crop up frequently in his work with family doctors he said 
about 540000 angiograms were performed in 1984 and the annual 
total has probably risen since kane said about 10 percent to 45 
percent of such tests find no sign of heart disease he said 
in kanes study 90 percent of the patients had suffered chest 
pain before the angiogram and a third had been hospitalized for it 
about a third had complained of breathing difficulties and smaller 
fractions had reported feelings of suffocation palpitations 
dizziness or sweating 
at the time they were surveyed eight months to 18 months after 
the angiograms 76 percent reported they still had chest pain and 
37 percent said they were still seeing a doctor because of it 
symptoms of chest pain palpitation breathlessness and fear of 
fainting tended strongly to be reported by people who also appeared 
to suffer from panic attacks the survey showed 
the survey also found that generalized anxiety disorder was 
linked to persistent chest pain and belief that one had suffered a 
heart attack fiftyfive percent of the sample believed they had 
suffered a heart attack although only 2 percent had been told that 
in the past 
generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by unrealistic or 
excessive anxiety and worry about two or more circumstances of 
ones life for six months or more 
while the studys use of questionnaires rather than interviews 
tends to make the diagnoses less secure the results are consistent 
with previous interviewbased studies said psychiatrist wayne 
katon of the university of washington in seattle 
doyle who is leading a psychiatric association effort to help 
physicians recognize panic disorder said many doctors overlook 
anxiety when analyzing physical symptoms 
and patients just dont like the idea he said 
for most people being told they have symptoms based on 
psychological difficulties is a real insult he said its 
considered a sign of moral weakness its a personal failing its 
not an acceptable diagnosis

a team of forensic scientists plans to dig 
into a colorado grave and perhaps settle the centuryold questions 
surrounding alfred or is it alferd packer to wit who killed 
whom and who ate whom 
packer a gold prospector and union army veteran has stood 
accused in history of killing five fellow prospectors and eating 
the flesh of some of them 
he confessed to killing only one but said he did it in 
selfdefense and admitted to cannibalism but only in the interest 
of selfpreservation 
much is not known about him for certain including his first 
name it is alfred in some court documents he signed a 
confession that way and some letters to the parole board and his 
death certificate reads alfred but it was alferd in a 
tattoo he wore and on some other documents hed signed at his 
trial he referred to himself pretty consistently as packer 
to demonstrate how much can be learned when the sciences of 
anthropology team up with pathology and archeology in solving 
crimes james starrs professor of law and forensic science at 
george washington universitys national law center plans to lead 
an expedition in july to the prospectors joint grave near lake 
city colo 
the experts think they can determine the extent of which 
cannibalism was committed by looking for bone scrapes that would 
likely occur 
if they find evidence of gunshot holes in the bones of more than 
one victim they will have disproved the story that packer told in 
court 
he said that an awesome snowstorm in april 1874 in the colorado 
rockies stranded the prospectors for a month and threatened them 
with starvation so he was sent out with a rifle to kill an animal 
five days later he subsequently told the authorities he 
returned empty handed to find four of the prospectors dead killed 
by hatchet and the fifth shannon wilson bell about to attack him 
with a hatchet he said he shot bell then struck him with the same 
instrument 
packer also claimed that he found parts of his colleagues 
boiling in a stewpot he confessed to helping himself but said he 
did it to stay alive 
packer left and mingled in society for some weeks but questions 
about the case finally led to his arrest 
he escaped but nine years later was recaptured in wyoming he 
was tried for murder and sentenced to hang the sheriff sent out 
fancy invitations to the hanging but the colorado supreme court 
set the verdict aside on the grounds that the legislature had 
repealed the death penalty during the time packer was a fugitive 
packer was retried for manslaughter sentenced to 40 years and 
paroled after 17 he died in 1907 still insisting he had killed 
only bell and only in selfdefense 
packer found a defender in ervan f kushner 74 a retired judge 
and prosecutor from paterson nj and author of alfred g 
packer criminal victim 
kushner accepts packers version says his two trials were 
riddled with errors and questions the worth of starrs macabre 
undertaking 
mr starrs is a wellknown forensics expert kushner said 
but what possible proof can there be found in the bones as to 
motive if he enjoys digging in that beautiful scenery thats a 
great place to dig but how will it establish who struck the first 
blow 
starrs agreed the bones wont tell much about motive but can 
answer other questions packer he said was a concerted and 
deliberate and longterm liar throughout the trial 
starrs said that bullet holes in more than one set of bones will 
tend to establish that packer not bell killed the four other 
prospectors 
starrs also said there is no truth to the legend that presiding 
judge melville b gerry in sentencing packer to hang commented on 
the demographicpolitical consequences of the slayings saying that 
there had been only seven democrats in all of hinsdale county and 
ye ate five of em 
in 1981 kushner petitioned richard d lamm then the governor 
of colorado to pardon packer posthumously 
lamm although a democrat wouldnt but said he found himself 
agreeing with another packer defender poet olive nagel porter 
lets not condemn poor packer 
nor crowd his soul with abuse 
though he hardly would merit approval 
hunger is valid excuse

a plan to restructure pennsylvanias 
local taxes is being contested with the zeal of carnival hucksters 
and voters appear to be confused over whether it would mean lower 
taxes or another dig into their pockets 
the complex proposal appears on a statewide referendum may 16 
boiled down to a critical 50 words dealing with the balance between 
business and residential taxes if approved it would mark the 
first major change in the states local tax system since the 
mid1960s 
at the heart of the plan is a tradeoff homeowners are being 
promised property tax reductions in exchange for allowing local 
governments to raise income taxes 
its a trend that has been taking place around the country 
similar proposals to place a larger tax burden on income are being 
weighed in michigan nebraska washington and montana 
predictions of what pennsylvanias plan will mean for average 
taxpayers have varied so greatly that its essential component 
seeking greater fairness by taxing income instead of property 
seems lost the sole focus has become whether overall local taxes 
will go up or down 
the plans architects hold that those hurt most by increasing 
property taxes are residents on fixed and lower incomes including 
many elderly by shifting more of the tax burden to income the 
state would be creating a fairer tax system that would benefit 
those groups they say 
according to state figures about 58 percent of the local tax 
revenue across the state is now raised through property taxes and 
about 115 percent from income under the proposed changes 
property taxes would make up about 30 percent of the local tax base 
and income about 40 percent 
the great irony and a fact acknowledged by both sides in the 
debate is that no one can truly say what will happen there are 
just too many local variables 
in addition to the propertyincome tax shift the bill would 
also allow counties to use a sales tax the despised philadelphia 
wage tax imposed on both city residents and suburbanites who work 
in the city would be lowered and other local wage taxes would be 
eliminated 
its like picking the lotto its just not something that can 
be done with any precision said robert greenwood of the 
pennsylvania economy league an independent research group 
the confusion is illustrated in estimates prepared by various 
groups at the state capitol the administration of gov robert p 
casey a democrat who championed the plan has predicted that a 
family in lehigh county in eastern pennsylvania making about 
30000 annually would pay about 12 percent less in local taxes 
under the reforms senate democrats say a family in that county 
making 25000 would pay 17 percent more 
using such figures supporters are trying to sell the plan as a 
tax cut for most homeowners while opponents are pitching it as a 
virtual acrosstheboard tax hike 
the shrill tenor of the tax debate was unexpected in 
pennsylvania where there is no tradition of controversial ballot 
questions in the past 30 years only nine of the 68 statewide 
referendums have been voted down and those elections were 
lowprofile 
republican opponents like to describe the referendum as a 
measuring stick for the governors popularity casey urged the 
legislature to enact the plan last fall and republicans are 
apparently looking for potential political ammunition for caseys 
expected reelection bid next year 
casey has attached his star to this issue the governor 
has gone way way out on a limb said senate president robert 
jubelirer a republican and opponent of the tax plan 
the whole thing has proven difficult to sell to voters a 
political consultants nightmare 
its certainly different and unique compared to promoting a 
candidate its a concept and a concept thats very difficult to 
grasp said david sanko a coordinator for citizens against 
higher taxes a group opposed to the plan 
im disgusted with the distortion and the partisan political 
debate said john stauffer a former republican leader in the 
state senate who is cochairman of the vote yes committee which 
supports the plan 
if anything it will get worse in the final few days it will 
be a typical election he said

xu gang a poet and a writer 
we made them ourselves he said pointing proudly to his 
chest very fine calligraphy wouldnt you say 
xu and his colleagues said they came out to support students and 
journalists in their call for a free press 
they should not be allowed to stand alone said su xiaokang 
a leading essayist 
on wednesday thousands of students bicycled to the offices of 
major media to press their call for freedom of expression the 
protest came a day after journalists presented the government with 
a petition signed by more than 1000 reporters requesting a 
dialogue with the government 
reporters said they wanted to discuss the recent firing of the 
editor of a liberal shanghai paper and the issue of censorship 
the intellectuals joined the protest midway and bicycled with 
the students to the gates of the peoples daily the newspaper of 
chinas communist party 
recognized by many in front of the newspapers office they were 
almost crushed as the crowd pressed in 
i cant breathe said novelist xu xin after sevaral minutes 
of pushing and shoving the band of intellectuals broke through 
xu gang said he felt odd coming back to the peoples daily as a 
protester the poet once worked as a journalist at the paper

rightist and ousted from his job 
they havent really changed much he said as the crowd 
around him chanted the peoples daily deceives the people

xu xin said he also felt odd but for a different reason 
the novelist wellknown among the young for his black humor and

sidelines during the recent student demonstrations for a freer 
china protests began following the death april 15 of hu yaobang 
the ousted communist party chief 
many of them support the movement but do so quietly some are 
fearful that participation could affect their livelihood others 
say that as adults they feel silly demonstrating 
earlier in the year intellectuals were at the forefront of a 
movement calling for the release of chinas political prisoners 
essayists poets scientists and novelists wrote open letters to 
the government calling for the release of wei jingsheng who was 
sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for counterrevolutionary 
crimes 
the government has said no amnesty will be granted and has 
denied that china has political prisoners

young poet qu wei 
today we are doing what little we can he said as he got on 
his bicycle to ride home perhaps tomorrow we will be able to do

the air force appears to be maintaining an 
unnecessarily large cash balance in operating a key spare parts and 
supply system a congressional audit concluded wednesday 
when the air force does make refunds it gyps other military 
services out of their money to help cover its own budget cuts the 
congressional general accounting office added 
the audit found the air forces stock fund had issued 131 
million in refunds in fiscal 1988 with all of the refund money 
going into the services own operation and maintenance account even 
though the navy the air national guard the air force reserve 
foreign governments and various other customers had purchased items 
from the stock fund that year 
the gao said that if the refunds had been distributed 
proportionately based on purchases foreign customers would have 
received refunds totaling 18 million the navy 12 million the 
guard and reserve 6 million and the other customers a combined 
5 million 
as a result of the stock funds disproportionate refund 
practices certain customers financed the refund made to the air 
forces operation and maintenance appropriation the audit 
concluded 
the 12page audit requested by the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee late last year was released wednesday the air force 
declined immediate comment saying it had not received a copy 
for the most part the audit focuses on the intricacies of a 
highly technical accounting system that must deal with wide 
fluctuations in daily cash balances but it also shows how annual 
budget and accounting changes made by congress can cause problems 
for a government bureacracy as well as spotlighting the internal 
competition among the armed forces when money gets tight 
the air force stock fund is simply a huge centralized office 
supply and spare parts system doing about 27 million a day in 
business 
it buys and distributes supplies and relatively inexpensive 
equipment as needed by various military units most of the 
customers are air force units although selected units from 
other services can use the air force system for the sake of 
convenience 
to ensure that enough money is on hand every day to pay 
suppliers the fund marks up the cost of its items by a small 
amount generating what in the commercial sector would be a profit 
the house appropriations panel asked the gao to analyze the 
stock fund because the air force says it needs to keep an operating 
balance equal to 11 days of business or about 297 million and 
sets its markup accordingly 
the audit challenged the air forces approach saying the 11day 
standard fails to reflect the fact that congress now provides 
special appropriations to the stock fund to purchase war reserve 
materiel and inventory items to support weapon systems 
modernization and modification 
over the last seven years those appropriations averaged 421 
million a year the gao said 
if the air force would shift to a 3day standard and formally 
acknowledge the appropriated money the pentagons budget could be 
cut automatically by 216 million in budget authority the gao said 
as for the refunds the gao said congress had pushed the stock 
fund to refund a total of 711 million over the last three years 
during annual budget reviews the refunds were then used to offset 
budget cuts 
the only problem with that the auditors said was that the 
refunds were made only to selected customers and were not 
distributed proportionately based on sales

most americans who move dont venture far from 
their old homes but those who switch states seem to prefer to head 
south the census bureau said wednesday 
southern states scored a net gain of 279000 movers between 
march 1986 and march 1987 the bureau said in a study covering the 
most recent mobility figures available 
the analysis of people who moved during that time found that 
181 percent of all americans relocated about the same as in the 
year before amounting to about 425 million people changing homes 
those movers included 272 million who relocated within the same 
county 88 million who moved to another county in the same state 
and 66 million who changed states 
in addition 11 million people moved in from abroad 
the souths strong showing resumes the trend of the early 1980s 
when the that region was the largest gainer as millions of 
americans flocked to the sun belt 
in 198485 and 198586 the attractiveness of the south seemed 
to slip a bit with the western states showing the largest gain 
from movers 
but the new study shows the west back in second place adding 
166000 movers to their population in the 198687 period 
most of the 198687 movers who changed regions 334000 came 
from the northeast with the remaining 111000 leaving the midwest 
according to the study 
overall mobility has been relatively steady in this decade 
slightly below the 20 percent annual rates recorded in the 1960s 
and 1970s 
there was a jump back to the 20 percent moving rate in 198485 
which some analysts attributed to pentup demand among people who 
had postponed moves during the recession early in the decade since 
then the rate has evened out again 
the 198687 analysis found that movement into metropolitan areas 
is continuing with a net gain of 932000 people within these 
areas it was the suburbs that were growing however central cities 
lost 1 million people over the year while suburbs grew by 19 
million 
hispanic americans moved more often than americans in general 
relocating at a 226 percent rate blacks recorded a 196 percent 
mobility rate and nonhispanic whites had a 174 percent rate 
regionally blacks like other americans moved south the south 
had a net gain of 148000 blacks during the year while all three 
other regions showed a net loss of blacks 
regional mobility figures for hispanics were not reported nor 
were figures for individual states 
other findings of the study included 
young adults were the most mobile americans with 347 percent 
of those aged 20 to 24 moving during the year and a 318 percent 
rate for people aged 25 to 29 
men were somewhat more likely to have moved than women 184 
percent vs 178 percent 
bein a member of a family tended to add to stability the study 
found people living in a family had a 164 percent rate of moving 
compared with 221 percent for people living alone or with 
unrelated people 
people who had completed four years of college had the highest 
mobility rate 218 percent people who attended college but didnt 
graduate were next at 196 percent people who had gone on to grad 
school moved at about the same rate as those who only finished high 
school 17 percent 
the lowest rate was 118 percent for people who had not finished 
high school most of them are elderly the study said

antisemitism is increasing in hungary 
a rabbi said wednesday and he called for ties with israel during 
the first parliamentary commemoration of holocaust victims 
rabbi alfred schoener addressed a session of parliament that 
paid tribute to the 600000 hungarian jews who died in the 
holocaust and to tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians who 
perished in world war ii 
the commemoration came on the 45th anniversary of the start of 
mass deportations of hungarian jews to death camps 
i dont know whether there is more antisemitism in hungary 
today than before but i must say it has become more open 
schoener said 
swastikas were painted on a synagogue wall the windows of 
jewish seminaries were broken and jews were being insulted in the 
streets he said 
we must not allow antisemitism to grow in our society which 
undergoing democratization allows many things to happen 
schoener said 
he also complained hungarian school textbooks contain only 
cursory mention of the holocaust and for some reason the very 
word jew has been avoided in the media

former gov george wallaces brother 
says two businessmen owe him stock in a dog track for not asking 
his brother to veto the venture but a judge said such a deal would 
be illegal and threw out the claim 
circuit judge william gordon in dismissing the 1 million 
lawsuit ruled tuesday that the agreement if it existed could not 
be enforced because it was against the law 
in court papers gerald wallace said he promised milton mcgregor 
not to tell his brother who was then governor to veto a bill 
allowing dog racing in return wallace claimed mcgregor agreed to 
pay him a 5 percent stake 
mr mcgregor knew i could tell my brother to kill the bill 
and it would have been killed wallace said 
the law allowing dog racing was approved in 1983 and mcgregors 
victoryland track opened the next year george wallace left office 
in 1987 
gerald wallace said lawyer thomas marr in whose name the stock 
was held refused to give him the stock 
marr and mcgregor maintained no deal was made 
perhaps mr wallace is hallucinating mcgregor said after 
the case was dismissed

longtime civil rights activist charles 
evers the mayor of fayette says he plans to abandon his 
longstanding democratic affiliation to join the republican party 
an outspoken political maverick who has supported republican 
candidates in the past evers said its a mistake for blacks to 
primarily support the democratic party 
if we dont like what the republicans do we need to get in 
there and change it he said adding that he was concerned about 
a political realignment along racial lines 
if they dont change rapidly by the turn of the century 
itll be a 95 percent white republican party and a 99 percent black 
democratic party thats not what we need he said 
state republican party chairwoman evelyn mcphail said the party 
welcomes evers 
i think what hes doing is what so many elected democrats and 
independent officials are doing theyre saying ive been 
supporting republican candidates and now im going to call myself 
a republican she said 
state democratic party chairman ed cole said evers was only 
making official what he has practiced for years cole said evers 
who recently lost a bid for reelection as mayor still has clout 
among black voters 
but clout works only when youre trying to take people where 
they want to go there aint any man alive who can take a 
significant number of black voters to the republican party cole

a lawyer for nicaraguas government sparred 
wednesday with the cochairmen of a commission studying plans for 
the 1990 nicaraguan election and charged that some members of the 
commission are biased 
our european and latin allies are as committed to the spread 
of democracy as we are washington attorney paul s reichler told 
the privately financed commission on free and fair elections in 
nicaragua 
and as judges they have two distinct advantages over the 
bush administration the majority of witnesses before this 
commission and even some of the members they are unbiased and 
they are unburdened by a need to justify their support for what 
even the secretary of state has called a failed policy 
reichler told the commission he had represented nicaragua in 
legal cases for nearly 10 years but he said he was testifying on 
his own wednesday and the sandinista government may or may not 
agree with what i have to say 
a representative of the nicaraguan embassy was invited to 
testify but the embassy declined 
the commission established by the conservative world freedom 
foundation is made up of three democrats and three republicans 
several witnesses at its opening session tuesday were skeptical of 
the prospects for a fair election in nicaragua 
former sen gaylord nelson dwis cochairman of the 
commission told reichler the fact that nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega would appoint all five members of the proposed supreme 
electoral council for the election makes the process suspect from 
the word go 
two of the members are to be drawn from sandinista ranks two 
from opposition parties and the fifth is to be neutral 
i think you would be helpful to your client if you told him 
that if ortega insists on appointing the fifth member it will 
be rejected by everybody in this country who understands what 
democracy is all about nelson said we wouldnt accept that in 
any precinct in this country 
reichler replied that ortega has asked the opposition parties 
for nominations and said judgment should be suspended until the 
members of the council are named but nelson said he believed the 
integrity of the process is at stake 
when reichler said nicaraguas muchcriticized press law is 
less restrictive than the laws of venezuela or costa rica the 
other cochairman curtin winsor interjected thats rubbish 
winsor who served as ambassador to costa rica during the reagan 
administration said he was familiar with the laws of both 
countries 
under an agreement made by ortega with the governments of costa 
rica el salvador honduras and guatemala nicaraguas election is 
to be held next february reichler said he believes the sandinistas 
will win and that they will hand over power to the winner if they 
do not 
the united states government has been supporting the contra 
rebels in their fight to oust the marxistled nicaraguan 
government though military aid was cut off last year 
the upcoming election in nicaragua will certainly test the 
sandinistas commitment to democracy said reichler a washington 
attorney it will also test our own the bush administration 
and most longtime contra supporters have already begun to 
discredit the process 
peter rodman counsellor to the national security council at the 
white house told the panel that the possibility of a pluralist 
future in nicaragua is not excluded and the election obviously 
is a test of it 
asked by nelson what us policy would be if a fair election 
resulted in an ortega victory rodman replied i think there is a 
presumption that if there is a fair election and we accept it as a 
fair election that makes a big difference in our attitude toward 
nicaragua and certainly our policy

it was to be the start of a new day for new york 
citys beleaguered schools 
fourteen months ago richard r green strode through the 
auditorium of erasmus hall high school in brooklyn the former 
minneapolis school chief decked out in academic robes was 
attended by the mayor the governor and every other top city and 
state official 
he was the hero riding in from the west taking over as new york 
citys first black schools chancellor at a time when many wondered 
if the schools were capable of positive change 
business as usual must come to an end green told the 
gathering at his inaugural and it must do so today 
green died early wednesday unexpectedly stricken by 
asthmarelated respiratory failure he never got the chance to 
duplicate his successes in minneapolis reforms that persuaded 
normally clannish new york educators to cast their lot with an 
outsider 
for much of his brief tenure in new york citys 939000child 
school system green had to deal with scandal 
an elementary school principal was arrested on drug charges 
investigations into drug use sexual harassment and jobselling by 
members of community school boards led green to suspend two boards 
children brought guns into class green installed metal 
detectors at some shools and launched an antigun campaign 
green had little time to turn around the citys dropout problem 
or institute concrete reforms still there were successes 
he trimmed the infamous central school board bureaucracy by 
onefifth he scored points with teachers and others with gestures 
such as removing time clocks from schools 
and anyone who saw green with children and parents saw something 
special and inspirational green who could be shy and aloof lit 
up with children 
he was very much a symbol for minority kids and parents 
said stanley litow who headed the search committee that offered 
green the new york job two winters ago 
he was turning the corner litow said he was beginning to 
be much more on top of things the whos who and whats what 
asked at the beginning of last school year what his chief 
accomplishments were green answered without apology none 
he explained that he was still sizing up the problems in the 
school system that he was looking at longterm solutions and 
wasnt interested in blowing his own horn 
my mission it may sound altruistic is to serve children 
he said my eye is on that prize

president bush had a cyst treated on a right 
finger during a routine physical examination on wednesday but 
otherwise was pronounced in extremely sound physical condition 
by his doctor 
the 64yearold bush who had said he never felt better in my 
life underwent his first medical checkup as president at the 
bethesda naval medical center in suburban maryland 
shortly after bush returned from the threehour examination the 
white house press office issued a statement from his personal 
physician dr burton lee giving the president a clean bill of 
health 
president bush is in extremely sound physical condition lee 
said he keeps fit through a number of physical activities which 
we recommend he continue on a regular basis 
todays examination shows him to be in excellent health he 
has no significant symptoms related to any of his organ systems 
the statement said 
it said a sebaceous cyst on the third finger of his right hand 
was drained the president is wearing a bandaid on the finger 
which he can remove within the next few hours lee said this 
cyst has been present for many years and does not present a medical 
problem 
rain forced bush to travel to the hospital by motorcade but he 
flew back by helicopter he sprang down the chopper steps and 
jauntily waved at reporters and staff and headed straight to his 
office to work 
he smiled broadly and jabbed both thumbs skyward when they 
shouted over the helicopter whirring to ask how he felt 
he shook his head and waved off questions about his intentions 
toward panama as he strode across a soggy white house lawn to the 
oval office 
todays statement said that a chest xray an electrocardiogram 
blood samples and a urinalysis all appeared normal 
the checkup showed mild degenerative arthritis of the hip but 
the statement noted the condition has been present for several 
years 
todays examination was conducted under lees direction 
lee took several blood samples earlier this week which will be 
analyzed as part of the examination an earlier statement said 
speaking with a group of reporters tuesday the president was 
asked about his health 
never felt better in my life he said 
however bush suffers from several physical ailments including 
a strong allergy to bee stings that requires him to receive regular 
injections he takes antihistamine pills for hay fever he also has 
mild arthritis of the hips and knees that has forced him to cut 
down on his jogging 
in addition to occasional jogs bush exercises by swimming 
playing tennis pitching horseshoes and using an indoor bicycle and 
treadmill 
in 1986 bush had a skin cancer removed from his face he 
suffered from duodenal ulcers involving a section of his small 
intestine in 1960 and again in 1966 
despite his fondness for fatladen pork rinds bushs 
cholesterol at his last physical examination was 192 a level 
considered desirable by the american heart association 
the president is 6 foot 2 inches tall and weighs 195 pounds 
bush once told an interviewer his formula for keeping in shape 
was dont eat too much dont drink too much and exercise 
despite his overall good health the president shortly after 
taking office was plagued by the flu which persisted for more than 
two weeks and claimed his voice entirely for several days

the secretarygeneral of the governing party met 
wednesday with former foreign minister masayoshi ito to try to 
persuade him to take the post of prime minister but ito refused 
ito said after the meeting he remains determined not to accept 
the offer 
shintaro abe the liberal democratic partys secretarygeneral 
told ito the party unanimously supports him to succeed prime 
minister noboru takeshita kyodo news service and the japan 
broadcasting corp reported 
takeshita announced april 25 that he would step down to assume 
responsibility for a scandal involving the recruit co an 
information and publishing conglomerate accused of trying to buy 
influence in the government by selling bargainpriced unlisted 
stock in a subsidiary 
ito is one of the few senior liberal democratic party members 
not linked to recruit three cabinet members have resigned over 
their links to the scandal 
the news reports said takeshita agreed to talk to ito on 
thursday and it quoted him as saying political reform is the 
urgent need of the party and we need to promote that under mr 
itos leadership 
they also quoted takeshita as saying he was willing to take his 
time in efforts to persuade ito 
ito 75 and diabetic has cited his age and health for not 
wanting to replace takeshita 
but japanese news reports have said he is holding out for 
promises of major reforms party sources said that among other 
things ito wants abolition of factions within the party and the 
resignation of all politicians linked to the scandal 
the liberal democratic party is a group of about a half dozen 
factions whose relative strengths and desires have to be considered 
each time a cabinet is formed because fundraising is a key part of 
factions efforts to boost their influence in the party 
factionalism is often said to be one cause of money politics 
in the absence of any other widely supported candidate party 
officials have said ito is the only solution for the time being 
to a replacement for takeshita 
leaders of four major opposition parties however have called 
on abe to have the liberal democrats hand over power to the 
opposition abe refused citing the liberal democrats majority in 
the house of representatives it holds 297 of the 512 seats

strengthened by favorable polls a recent 
electoral triumph and moves to scrap its unpopular banthebomb 
policy the labor party suddenly is buoyed after a decade in the 
political wilderness 
labor has lost three successive general elections to prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative party partly because its 
policies projected a party in thrall to unrealistic leftwing 
doctrine 
this week the party leadership decided to dump the ideology of 
unilateral nuclear disarmament and adapt labors economic policies 
to the prosperous 1980s 
opinion polls taken as mrs thatcher celebrated 10 years in 
office this month show labor is regaining popularity and 
credibility polls placed the two parties neck and neck 
labor leader neil kinnock is gambling he can hold onto that 
strength and his oftcriticized leadership in the two years 
leading to the next election 
last week labor won a byelection for a welsh parliamentary 
seat the tories had held for 38 years the government dismissed it 
as a routine midterm setback but the sheer size of the 
125percent swing was a massive boost to labors spirits 
kinnocks risky strategy focuses on a wideranging review of 
party doctrine ordered after the last electoral drubbing in 1987 
on tuesday kinnock persuaded labors ruling national executive 
to unshackle the party it voted 178 for a new policy whereby a 
laborled government would scrap britains independent nuclear 
arsenal only in a negotiated arms control deal 
kinnock a lifelong antinuclear campaigner told party leaders 
he no longer could publicly defend the policy 
i am not going again to make that tactical argument for the 
unilateral independent abandonment of nuclear weapons without 
getting anything in return he said 
i will not do it and the majority of the people in the party 
and in the country do not expect me to do it 
it was a thinly veiled threat to quit if he did not receive 
backing but kinnock also went over the heads of the executives to 
appeal directly to labors rankandfile and the electorate at 
large 
critics say the fundamental flaw in the new policy is that it 
forecloses its options by declaring nuclear weapons are not a 
deterrent and of no practical use 
the rider is intended to appease the hardline left but it 
enables tories to taunt kinnock with the question would you 
press the nuclear button 
unless it is answered with a straight yes critics say the new 
policy is in the words of defense secretary george younger 
about as effective as a feather duster 
criticism also comes from commentators more friendly to labor 
columnist peter jenkins said in the independent newspaper that 
all kinnock need reply is that uncertainty is the essence of 
deterrence the trouble is that either he does not grasp the 
theory of deterrence or he cannot believe in it he wrote 
kinnock still faces a long hot summer of trying to sell his new 
policy which must be approved by labors annual fall convention 
he got a foretaste of trouble when ron todd leader of the 
transport and general workers union declared his abiding faith in 
unilateralism 
theyre not going to make me suddenly change the views that i 
have held all over the years todd told independent television 
news on wednesday 
todd whose 134 millionmember union controls the largest bloc 
vote at labor conventions said the party dumped unilateral nuclear 
disarmament because people said its not very popular 
but to kinnock the overriding priority is to beat mrs thatcher 
out of power we do not have the opportunities of unilateral 
or any other sort of disarmament he told the party tuesday in 
power we can act and make dramatic progress

gerasimov said the us side explained that richard burt who 
has been nominated by president bush to head the us bargaining 
team probably would not be confirmed by the us senate in time to 
resume talks this month 
the two leaders met for almost three hours today after bakers 
arrival from helsinki for his visit to the soviet union 
the discussions began with regional issues such as the middle 
east and afghanistan and included arms control human rights 
regional problems and direct ussoviet relations 
we are very pleased with the way things started said baker 
who is making his first trip to the soviet union 
gerasimov had told reporters earlier that at the request of the 
us side baker and shevardnadze concentrated on regional 
conflicts rather than nuclear weapons 
dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last 
of the cold war behind us and move into a new stage of our 
relationship gerasimov said 
he said the subject of shortrange missiles in europe which has 
caused a rift in the north atlantic treaty organization did not 
come up 
the two sides found common ground on central america gerasimov 
said both sides stated there was good potential for a furthering 
of dialogue on a central american settlement he said 
baker wants the soviets to curb their aid to the sandinistas in 
nicaragua which amounted to 500 million last year the soviets 
also raised afghanistan a topic baker had no intention of bringing 
up because the kremlin is demanding the united states halt its 
military aid to afghan rebels 
in both countries marxist governments have soviet support 
while the united states is backing the insurgents with weapons 
through pakistan for the mujahadeen and with nonlethal aid to the 
contras in nicaragua 
according to gerasimov baker and shevardnadze also discussed 
us defense secretary dick cheneys prediction that perestroika 
the restructuring program of president mikhail s gorbachev would 
fail 
baker explained that cheneys remarks did not reflect 
washingtons official position and shevardnadze did not take 
offense gerasimov said 
we understand that the secretary of defense needs more money 
for military programs and how can he possibly obtain that if the 
soviet threat is going away gerasimov said we were not 
offended 
baker in the soviet union for the first time later met with 
three members of the congress of peoples deputies a new 
parliament elected as gorbachev gives greater powers to the 
legislative arm of government 
we think there are real changes taking place in the soviet 
union and we think those changes are more than cosmetic as 
demonstrated by the fact that we now see competitive elections 
looking towards a sitting legislature baker said at the meeting 
at spaso house the us ambassadors residence 
the congress is to meet may 25 to choose a smaller fulltime 
legislature as well as a president asked if more than one 
candidate should run for president baker said one step at a 
time 
in two days of talks baker is expected to turn to gorbachev for 
help in accelerating the fledling us drive for arabisraeli 
negotiations 
the us approach to the middle east represents a shift in 
diplomatic gears from two decades of trying to fence out both the 
soviet union and the palestine liberation organization as apt to 
undermine american peacemaking 
once before in 1977 the united states made a concerted effort 
to engage the soviet union in middle east peacemaking the carter 
administration at that point was at a deadend in its mideast 
diplomacy 
but egypt and israel quickly decided to launch negotiations and 
the soviets were shut out again 
egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and since then 
have been the largest recipients of us aid and solidly on the 
american side of the superpower divide 
but baker is faced with a different situation he is trying to 
prod israel into negotiations with the palestinians and has 
concluded he needs the support of both moscow and the plo 
he is hoping the soviets under gorbachev would bring pressure on 
syria to support peace talks that do nothold out the promise of a 
palestinian state the soviet union has refused to exert such power 
in the past 
the plo meanwhile quietly has been assured that if israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for palestinian elections does 
not break the diplomatic stalemate in the middle east the bush 
administration will look for alternatives 
at the same time baker and his senior advisers are convinced 
plo chairman yasser arafat is sincere about his public acceptance 
of israel 
if the soviets push the missile issue they could widen the 
fissures between the united states and west germany over natos 
nuclear arsenal 
the bush administration supported mostly by britain wants to 
enhance the range of the 88 lance launchers and their 700 or so 
missiles most of which are in west germany while chancellor 
helmut kohl backed by a majority of the alliance is resisting and 
calling for ussoviet negotiations on such weapons in europe 
by contrast baker is playing down arms control 
he headed to moscow with a proposed date the third week in 
june for the reopening of ussoviet negotiations to reduce the 
superpowers longrange bombers nuclear submarines and 
globegirdling missiles 
but he was not planning to outline the position the united 
states would take at the table nor was he assuring the soviets 
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in 
november

democrats on house ways and means committee 
mounted an assault on president bushs savings and loan bailout 
plan in a move that also could upset a no new taxes 
deficitreducing budget agreement between congress and the white 
house 
led by rep sam gibbons dfla members of the taxwriting 
panel moved to include all of the 50 billion government infusion 
of cash to cover sampl failures in the fiscal 1989 1990 and 1990 
budgets 
i have great ethical and moral problems with the way this 
program is financed under bushs plan gibbons said this is a 
mess that ought to be cleaned up without passing the costs on 
to our children and grandchildren 
bush would have included only the anticipated interest costs of 
35 billion over the three years in the budget by borrowing the 
50 billion through private maket bond sale instead of directly 
through the us treasury 
the plan involved closing or merging some 350 insolvent thrift 
institutions that because of bad loans and often fraud have lost up 
to 100 billion in federally insured deposits most of the money 
would be used to cover those losses 
the house and senate last week approved a budget resolutions for 
fiscal 1990 beginning next october that would trim this years 160 
billion deficit to just over 99 billion neither plan reflected 
most of the bailouts costs assuming it would be handled off 
budget as bush proposed 
weve fairly well destroyed the budget agreement between the 
administration and congress rep bill frenzel rminn 
complained tuesday 
gibbons alternative adds 10 billion to this years deficit and 
potentially 25 billion in fiscal 1990 ending any hope of meeting 
the grammrudman deficit target of 100 billion then without 
spending cuts elsewhere or an increase in taxes 
treasury secretary nicholas brady spent more than an hour behind 
closed doors with members of the committee trying to convince them 
to go along with bushs plan and repeating a threat that he would 
urge the president to veto it if they didnt 
he left the meeting smiling but when asked by reporters if 
bushs plan had sufficient support in the committee he said only 
you never know about that well have to wait and see 
gibbons led the attack on the administrations plan after the 
panels chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill said tuesday that 
he would not mount an offensive against it 
senate democrats also had pushed for handling the cost of the 
bailout which including interest is expected to exceed more 
than 250 billion over the next 30 years directly 
but they stopped short of forcing a showdown after the white 
house and brady threatened a veto and said it would upset then 
ongoing negotiations on reducing the deficit through spending cuts 
in defense and domestic programs in order to fulfill bushs 
campaign pledge of no new taxes 
a confrontations with bush over the sampl financing would have 
stopped dead in its tracks the budget accord that had been 
negotiated over three months said senate budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn 
frenzel who led the support for bushs plan said changing it 
will only force a veto that will prolong the crisis and allow 
sampl institutions to keep on making bad loans 
actually the federal deposit insurance corp has taken control 
of more than half of the 350 most troubled thrifts in the past 
three months and stopped some of their riskier lending activities 
but losses are still mounting at a rate of 10 million a day 
because of past bad loans according to the administration 
frenzel also echoed the administrations arguments in contending 
that waiving the grammrudman deficit target will open the door for 
increased government spending and drive all interest rates up 
once the credit market understand that we are willing to 
breach grammrudman they will understand that we are willing to 
breach it for toxic waste cleanups homelessness or whatever comes 
down the pike he said 
democats however seemed willing to force a veto showdown 
theres not going to be a delay unless the administration 
wants a delay said rep robert matsui dcalif it will be up 
to the president to sign the bill or not sign it 
the democratic alternative retains the same resolution financing 
corp that bush would establish for raising the 50 billion 6 
billion of it from the industry and the rest borrowed the industry 
also would have to pay 300 annually for 30 years as its share of 
the bailout 
however the financing corporation would have to borrow the 
balance through the treasury or the federal financing bank rather 
than via the private bond market 
the congressional budget office estimates the savings in lower 
interest rates that have to be paid through direct treasury 
borrowing will total 671 million over the first five years 15 
billion by the year 2000 and 45 billion over 30 years

the government wednesday announced 
draft legislation that would make moneylaundering a crime 
the proposal expected to be presented to parliament before 
midjune is aimed at combatting drugtrafficking and organized 
crime said justice minister arnold koller 
switzerlands financial and political communities have been 
rocked by the lebanon connection scandal in which investigators 
say about 12 billion including alleged drug money was recycled 
through swiss banks 
the case led to the resignation of the former justice minister 
elizabeth kopp after it was revealed she tipped off her husband to 
sever his links with shakarchi trading a lebanesecontrolled 
zurichbased company under investigation 
the legislation would outlaw those acts that obstruct the 
investigation of the origin the tracing or the seizure of 
assets known to have come from illegal activities 
violators would be punished by up to five years in prison and a 
fine of up to 600000 
a second part of the proposed law would punish bankers lawyers 
financial advisers and banknote traders for lack of care if they 
fail to determine the identity of their customers in transactions 
offenders face up to a year in prison 
the draft law was greeted by three of the four parties making up 
the government coalition and was cautiously welcomed by the banks 
the social democratic party said it did not go far enough

the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday approved a resolution urging southeast asian nations to 
resume providing refuge for asylumseeking vietnamese 
meantime a house subcommittee endorsed a resolution urging 
vietnam to speed the emigration to america of thousands of people 
sent to reeducation camps because of their ties to the former 
prous government of south vietnam 
the senate panels resolution is directed to members of the 
association of southeast asian nations and seeks to state us 
policy before an international conference on indochinese refugees 
is held next month in geneva under auspices of the united nations 
the resolution sent to the full senate states that asean has 
announced a policy of screening all asylumseekers to determine 
their refugee status it says vietnam has demonstrated its 
hostility to those leaving vietnam illegally and in particular to 
those refusing to return to vietnam voluntarily 
the resolution declares that asean should reinstate the practice 
of providing adequate refuge for all vietnamese seeking asylum 
while carrying out their screening 
it calls for early access for the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees to provide humane care and protection to 
those seeking asylum 
the resolution states that no vietnamese seeking asylum should 
be sent back to their homeland without guarantees they will not be 
persecuted 
given vietnamese attitudes toward illegal departure forced 
repatriation of refugees to vietnam should not be considered a 
viable option the resolution declares 
and it says the united states should remain committed to a 
generous and humane southeast asian refugee resettlement policy 
meantime a resolution approved by voice vote of the house 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs and sent to the full 
house foreign affairs committee for further action says that the 
willingness of vietnams government to satisfactorily resolve 
this humanitarian issue involving emigration will have an 
important bearing on usvietnamese relations 
the legislation noted that the united states has made it 
clear to hanoi that it is ready to allow those detained because 
of loyalty to the saigon government to enter the united states 
south vietnam collapsed in 1975 
the united states and vietnam agreed in principle last july on 
the us resettlement of reeducation detainees and their 
families but hanoi later suspended negotiations the resolution 
said it asked hanoi to resume talks and to publish the names of 
and to release those still in reeducation camps as well as 
dissidents arrested for nonviolent political or religious activity 
rep frank wolf rva wrote the resolution which has been 
cosponsored by 32 other members of both parties

a fast by a louisiana priest to 
protest government delays in finishing a health clinic for peasants 
wednesday prompted officials to begin installing new equipment 
its a minor miracle theyre bringing in everything from 
xray machines and hospital beds to fluorescent lights said the 
rev donald bahlinger who began his fast friday 
the 60yearold roman catholic priest from baton rouge said he 
would continue his meals of bread and water for one more day as a 
way of thanking god 
bahlinger camped out on the first floor of the empty health 
center in san ignacio misiones 135 miles southeast of asuncion 
although the 35bed hospital building was finished in 1981 it 
remained an empty shell until this week critics blamed official 
corruption and inefficiency during the regime of gen alfredo 
stroessner who was ousted feb 3 
his last health minister adan godoy jimenez is in jail facing 
charges that include overcharging the government for building 
health centers dozens of which never were properly equipped or 
staffed 
san ignacio residents were cared for in a rundown sixbed 
veterans hospital where three beds in one room were reserved for 
maternity cases and three in another room were for any ill men 
women or children 
we would ask authorities if we could just use some rooms in 
the new hospital as dormitories and they would tell us we couldnt 
use them until it was inaugurated and they couldnt inaugurate it 
because it wasnt equipped said bahlinger 
hundreds of residents turned out to support bahlinger with 
masses and a silent march during his fast 
one of the things that really made it click was the support of 
the people said bahlinger who came to paraguay eight years ago 
to serve as parish priest in san ignacio 
late tuesday two loaded flatbed trucks pulled up at the 
hospital and assistant health minister ruben mayorquin asked 
bahlinger to bless the new equipment 
it turned into a real fiesta with close to 1000 people 
singing chanting and applauding said the rev leo leise a 
fellow jesuit from new orleans 
the first patient to be treated in the new hospital is a 
30yearold mother of five suffering from cancer who was turned 
away from the old veterans clinic 
she regained consciousness and seems to be in good spirits 
they have her in a nice room now said bahlinger

exxon corp told by the white house to pour 
more resources into its alaska oil cleanup said wednesday it would 
deploy 1600 additional workers as well as more boats and barges in 
the effort 
the coast guard commandant adm paul a yost jr told a senate 
hearing that despite the increase it will be almost impossible 
to clean all the oil from more than 300 miles of shoreline by the 
target date of sept 15 
however exxon usa president william d stevens told openly 
skeptical senators the company fully expects to clean up the 
beaches by that date after which poor weather is likely to make 
efforts impossible 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said exxon had pledged 
a substantial increase in manpower and resources nearly 
doubling the cleanup efforts by the company whose tanker spilled 11 
millions of oil into alaska waters last march 
the exxon announcement came after company executives were told 
in a meeting at the white house on monday that their summer cleanup 
plans were inadequate 
skinner who along with white house chief of staff john sununu 
had met with the exxon officials said even with the additional 
resources it remains uncertain whether exxon will be able to finish 
by september 
its a massive massive effort exxon has got a big 
challenge skinner told reporters adding that he plans to hold 
their feet to the fire to finish the job if the cleanup is not 
completed in september he said he expects exxon to renew the 
effort next spring 
yost of the coast guard sounded pessimistic about quick 
results in his testimony before a senate commerce science and 
transportation subcommittee 
he told of his hands dripping with oil after reaching under the 
gravel on a beach that had been cleaned for 10 consecutive days by 
200 workers he said increasing personnel will not prevent oil from 
washing back onto the beaches 
asked by sen albert gore jr dtenn if the oil giant was 
trying to stonewall the cleanup yost said thats one view 
of it mine would be slightly more sympathetic i think the job is 
so extensive and the damage so serious the amount of equipment 
that can be operated in that weather so small that exxon is now 
doing the most that can be done 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground in alaskas prince william 
sound on march 24 spilling a quarter of its oil into the pristine 
waters of the sound in the worst oil spill in us history within 
days the oil spread down the southern alaska coast causing 
environmental and economic havoc 
cleanup costs have been estimated at anywhere from 100 million 
to 400 million by the time the oil is cleared by hand or by 
highpowered water hoses and wildlife and the natural habitat 
affected by the pollution is restored 
exxons stevens confronted with figures showing only 17 miles 
have been cleaned said the work started slowly because the company 
tackled the worst beaches first 
but sen slade gorton rwash told stevens that exxons 
performance has been so poor that he should be drawing 
unemployment compensation 
earlier this week bush administration officials expressed 
concern that exxons plans did not commit enough resources to the 
effort this summer those concerns were reiterated by skinner and 
sununu at the meeting with exxon officials at the white house 
monday and in a letter to exxon from the coast guard 
in response exxon said wednesday it will increase the number of 
people to be involved in the summer cleanup from a previously 
planned 3400 workers to 5000 a move the company said will allow 
it to put 2500 people directly to work on the beaches the company 
also said it will deploy seven more barges and 17 more landing 
craft than previously planned bringing the total number of barges 
and boats to 70 
exxon currently has more than 6000 people working in alaska in 
connection with the spill the manpower increase to 5000 workers 
pertains to those actually involved in the shoreline cleanup 
after saying the cleanup should be completed by sept 15 
stevens said the company would return in the spring to assure 
that the job has been properly done

with their eyes on revenue of at least 15 
billion a year representatives of state and local government asked 
congress wednesday to require that taxes be collected on mailorder 
sales to outofstate residents 
under a 22yearold supreme court decision a state may not 
require an outofstate merchant to collect sales taxes unless the 
merchant has a retail outlet in the state a bill introduced by 
rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of the house judiciary 
committee would require only that a company regularly solicit 
business in a state before the state could require that taxes be 
collected 
gov george sinner of north dakota speaking for the national 
governors association said present law is unfair to local 
merchants because it allows their competitors to undercut prices by 
the value of sales taxes which range from 5 percent to 8 percent 
that sinner said is greater than most merchants average profit 
margin 
a 5 percent sales advantage is overwhelming the main street 
retailer he told a news conference that is why the national 
governors association and other state government groups are 
joining with a new coalition of retail and labor groups to end this 
competitive interstate disadvantage 
across capitol hill opponents of brooks bill were having their 
say 
this will have the maximum irritation effect on tens of 
millions of consumers who would have to do the tax calculations 
every time they order said robert levering vice president of 
the direct marketing association 
if this legislation were to pass direct marketers would be 
saddled with tax collection duties for over 7000 municipal and 
state tax jurisdictions he said that means we can be audited 
by every one of those jurisdictions even where our companies dont 
have physical presence in a state and dont receive benefits 
sen robert w kasten jr rwis who is leading the fight 
against brooks bill said it unfairly targets the elderly the 
handicapped farm families and the millions of consumers who rely 
on mailorder purchases for many of their basic needs 
kastens state is home to lands end one of the nations 
largest catalog suppliers of clothing 
here is the problem created by present law 
if a wisconsin woman buys a 20 blouse from a lands end catalog 
or from a hometown store she pays the 5 percent wisconsin sales 
tax if a tennessee woman buys the same blouse from lands end she 
pays no sales tax if she buys it in her hometown she pays 
tennessees 5 percent tax plus any local sales tax 
brooks bill would require that outofstate mailorder and 
telephoneorder companies including the popular television 
shopping shows collect sales taxes from outofstate customers 
only if the firms have annual sales above 125 million 
sinner said that would exempt from collection about 95 percent 
of mailorder companies the remaining 5 percent account for 70 
percent of mailorder sales he said 
state officials estimate enactment of brooks bill would bring 
state and local governments more than 15 billion a year

iranian parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani sought wednesday to distance himself from an 
inflammatory call for palestinians to kill americans and other 
westerners saying his remarks were misinterpreted 
in an interview on tehran radio rafsanjani said he was only 
analyzing the middle east situation and did not mean to 
condone the killing of innocent civilians 
in his prayer sermon at tehran university on friday rafsanjani 
called on palestinians to kill westerners hijack planes and bomb 
western interests 
of course maybe my tone was such that it was taken to mean 
that i was recommending such action maybe my tone was such but i 
meant it as an interpretation rafsanjani said in an interview 
with tehran radio monitored in nicosia 
in fridays sermon rafsanjani had urged palestinians to 
declare open war on american targets 
he had said if for every palestinian martyred in palestine 
they kill five americans britons or frenchmen outside the 
zionists would not dare continue these wrongs 
why dont you hijack planes to swap prisoners in israeli 
hands or blow up prisoners advised rafsanjani who so far is 
irans only presidential candidate for summer elections 
his sermon was seen as an attempt to distance himself from a 
clique that sought to build bridges with the west until recent 
weeks when the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini moved decisively to 
strengthen the hand of hardliners 
rafsanjanis remarks triggered strong criticism in a west 
already incensed by khomeinis religious edict calling on moslems 
to kill british writer salman rushdie for his book the satanic 
verses many moslems say the book blasphemes islam 
the united states france and britain accused tehran of inciting 
murder through rafsanjanis sermon 
rafsanjani told tehran radio he found the us british and 
french reaction very interesting 
he said the west was looking for a new issue to make up for 
their defeat in the salman rushdie affair he claimed an 
antiislamic campaign after khomeinis edict was foiled by the 
support of moslems all over the world 
britain and its 11 european community partners withdrew their 
ambassadors from tehran after khomeinis feb15 declaration some 
since have returned 
rafsanjani told the radio wednesday the statements i made 
were my own opinion i presented an individual opinion which wasnt 
new other officials may or may not agree with my opinions 
rafsanjani said the israeli crackdown on palestinians in the 
occupied territories is the worst kind of terrorism 
he told tehran radio he believed their actions will lead to 
the killing of westerners whose governments he said back israel 
rafsanjani concluded if the americans dont want terrorism 
then they must hit at the roots of it they must not allow 
israel to do what it does if they dont then the other things 
will automatically follow

the bush administration asked congress on 
wednesday for funds to enable the interamerican development bank 
to lend 225 billion to western hemisphere countries by 1993 
the us contribution would be 78 million a year only 25 
percent of the proposed increase in the banks capital is paid in 
with the rest remaining on call but not expected to be needed 
david c mulford assistant secretary of the treasury for 
international affairs said the bank will begin making loans to 
help change borrower countries policies in whole sectors such as 
agriculture past lending has been for specific projects such as 
dams roads or schools 
sector loans are disbursed quickly so they can also help a 
borrowing country meet interest payments on old loans which amount 
to more than 400 billion and will not be directly affected by the 
new ones 
regarding the debt problem the banks present role is to 
encourage the borrowers to adopt policies that improve economic 
performance stimulate new foreign investment increase domestic 
savings and encourage the repatriation of flight capital mulford 
said 
mulfords request for funds came after three years of 
negotiation to get more power for the united states and other 
contributing countries over the banks lending policies they can 
now delay a loan for as long as a year 
the intent and design of the new loan approval mechanism is to 
foster a consensus in support of loans and thereby improve loan 
quality mulford said 
he appeared before the subcommittee on international economic 
policy of the senate foreign relations committee

a former fda supervisor accused of taking 
bribes told congress in an affidavit wednesday that favoritism was 
common in the generic drug division of the agency 
charles y chang a former branch chief in the food and drug 
administrations division of generic drugs said special handling 
of applications resulted partly from pressure by the larger more 
sophisticated companies 
favoritism he said was not necessarily the result of illegal 
behavior but reflected in part highly personal arbitrary and 
often arrogant management 
he also referred to examples of special treatment of 
applications and said they were the result of continuous pressure 
put on the division at all levels by the industry through 
lobbying conducted by executives lawyers consultants and 
occasionally through political channels inside and outside the 
fda 
chang was charged tuesday in us district court in baltimore 
with two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering he was 
accused of accepting a free trip to hong kong and furniture as 
bribes from american therapeutics inc a bohemia ny generic 
drug manufacturer 
each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
and a 250000 fine upon conviction 
another fda employee and a drug company executive were charged 
last month in the wideranging investigation of allegations of 
bribery in the generic drugs division more charges are expected 
officials in the office of the inspector general at the health 
and human services department of which fda is a part have said 
there is no indication that impropriety at the agency has resulted 
in unsafe or ineffective drugs being placed on the market chang 
echoed that assessment in his affidavit 
chang said in the document dated tuesday that he could not 
discuss matters under active criminal investigation but said 
he would continue to cooperate with the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee which has been looking into the fdas 
generic drug approval process 
the panel released his affidavit at a hearing wednesday 
in the affidavit he said favoritism helped speed the processing 
of applications usually those of the larger drug manufacturing 
companies he said he sometimes tried to counteract the special 
treatment by helping to expedite reviews of applications submitted 
by smaller companies 
chang said favoritism occurred because of poor management and 
lax enforcement of the few fda rules governing reviews of generic 
drug applications 
larry d morey an assistant inspector general at hhs testified 
that his office is looking into allegations that 15 fda employees 
received subsidized accommodations during meetings in puerto rico 
sponsored by the national association of pharmaceutical 
manufacturers an association of generic drug companies 
morey said such subsidies are considered illegal but he said 
the us attorneys office has declined to prosecute the results 
of the inspector generals investigation will be referred to the 
fda for administrative action he said sanctions could include 
dismissal he said

authorities on wednesday arrested 
the former head of a west german company and said he was suspected 
of a leading role in building a libyan plant allegedly intended 
to produce chemical weapons 
west german and us authorities alleged that the company 
imhausenchemie was the key supplier of material for the plant in 
the libyan city of rabta libya claimed the plant was for making 
pharmaceuticals but us and west german officials claim it was 
intended to manufacture chemical weapons 
juergen hippenstielimhausen who was chief of imhausenchemie 
until march was arrested wednesday in the city of bochum said 
prosecutor holger preisendanz in a telephone interview 
hippenstielimhausen is strongly suspected of violating west 
german export laws said the mannheim prosecutor who heads the 
investigation 
in a separate statement preisendanz said there is the strong 
suspicion that the accused dr juergen hippenstielimhausen 
himself had a leading role in the planning and construction of the 
plant in rabta libya that was intended for the production of 
chemical weapons 
although the statement referred to hippenstielimhausen as the 
accused he has not been charged with any crimes 
the ard television network reported wednesday that authorities 
also were investigating hippenstielimhausen for possible tax law 
violations 
hippenstielimhausen is the first person to be arrested in the 
investigation into the scandal that strained relations between 
washington and bonn earlier this year 
chancellor helmut kohls government in january initially denied 
west german companies were involved in the rabta project but later 
acknowledged widespread west german participation setting off a 
backlash that embarrassed his coalition government 
the dispute over the plant rekindled tensions between the united 
states and libyan leader col moammar gadhafi the plant is 60 
miles south of tripoli 
preisendanz said prosecutors police and customs inspectors had 
searched the offices of imhausenchemie in the southwestern town of 
lahr and its subsidiary the gesellschaft fuer automation in bochum 
the arrest is in connection with the probe into the libyan 
plant the prosecutor said 
he said that further arrests could not be ruled out but added 
i dont see any cause for that right now 
preisendanz emphasized authorities also decided to arrest 
hippenstielimhausen to prevent him from fleeing the country 
imhausen officials said in january that hippenstielimhausen and 
his family had gone into hiding after receiving death threats 
in bochum judicial authorities released a statement saying they 
were concerned hippenstielimhausen might have been trying to hide 
evidence needed for the investigation

premier miklos nemeth on wednesday 
criticized the 32year leadership of former party chief janos kadar 
and denounced the communist partys past monopoly on political 
affairs 
kadar said he may have made mistakes but that he meant well 
parliament approved changes recommended by nemeth that installed 
six new cabinet members expected to speed the pace of reform 
the move came a day after the policymaking central committee 
offered to negotiate democratic reforms with opposition groups 
similar talks have brought about a more democratic electoral system 
in poland and legalized solidarity there 
the party said the new talks could include all registered 
opposition groups and focus on an exact date for next years 
multiparty elections a new constitutional court the powers of a 
new state presidency and a new electoral law 
a leader of one of the new independent political groups karoly 
ravasz of the smallholders party said his initial response to the 
offer was positive 
he said the leaders of eight opposition groups planned to meet 
to decide on a common strategy for replying to the offer 
in a speech to parliament nemeth suggested the budapest 
leadership is caught in an impasse 
the conservative forces are unable to turn the clock back but 
the reform forces are still unable to attain a decisive turn 
nemeth said he said the situation is not conducive to a coalition 
with noncommunist groups although i would liked to see this 
come about 
nemeth gave the most critical appraisal yet of the kadar years 
although he did not mention the longtime leader by name 
kadar 76 rose to power behind the sovietled invasion of 1956 
that crushed a popular uprising on monday he was removed from the 
central committee and stripped of the honorary post of party 
president 
in another sign that the party is opening up about the past the 
state news agency mti on wednesday published for the first time the 
names of all 277 people it said were executed after the 1956 revolt 
hitherto government decisions have been almost exclusively 
based on party decisions nemeth said the activities of the 
government were accompanied by the least possible openness 
not only did the government not accept parliament as a 
supervisory body but it did not accept parliament as an equal 
partner either he said referring to the parliaments longtime 
role as a rubberstamp body 
nemeth blamed kadars economic policies for the crisis facing 
hungary now the rise in living standards in the 1970s was based on 
massive borrowing resulting in a 17 billion foreign debt that 
requires further loans of up to 3 billion annually to cover the 
interest 
replying to a letter from the central committee that echoed 
nemeths criticism kadar said he was sure he had made mistakes but 
added that all of my actions were guided by good intentions 
the letter dated wednesday was made public by mti in it 
kadar also said his health took a turn for the worse in april 
but he did not elaborate 
at a news conference nemeth introduced his new cabinet members 
and said all are reformminded 
they are foreign minister gyula horn 57 finance minister 
laszlo bekesi 46 industry minister ferenc horvath 46 
agriculture minister csaba huetter 45 culture minister ferenc 
glatz 48 and ernoe kemenes 48 head of the planning office 
horn replaces peter varkonyi at the foreign ministry varkonyi 
has been named to be the next ambassador to the united states the 
others replaced in the 17member cabinet will be retired or 
transferred to other government jobs

the united states and the soviet union reached 
tentative agreement wednesday to reopen negotiations next month to 
reduce their arsenals of globegirdling nuclear missiles and took 
steps to cooperate in easing conflicts in the middle east and 
central america 
both american and soviet officials gave a positive account of 
the first trip to moscow by secretary of state james a baker iii 
and a formal announcement of a date for the arms control 
negotiations is expected thursday when he meets with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
headway in an expanding and more conciliatory relationship was 
especially evident in bakers discussion of the middle east with 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze he assured baker 
according to a senior us official that israels usblessed 
proposal to hold elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs 
on the west bank and gaza was worthy of attention 
and when baker pressed him to resume full diplomatic relations 
with israel after a 22year lapse shevardnadze gave him an 
encouraging but not a definitive response the official said 
giving an account of their nearly three hours of talks on condition 
of anonymity 
on central america meanwhile shevardnadze told baker there was 
a good basis for dialogue and opportunity to find a cooperative 
agreement to bring peace to the region the official said 
baker summarizing his first day in moscow after addressing a 
group of soviet human rights activists including jews denied visas 
to emigrate said we had good discussions indepth discussions 
particularly on regional issues 
a prominent soviet official alexander bessmertnyk the first 
deputy foreign minister said the talks were conducted in a 
businesslike constructive and on the whole good and calm 
atmosphere 
typifying the bracing atmosphere the soviets did not bring up 
the divisive issue of shortrange nuclear missiles that has pit the 
united states against west germany with some members of the 
western alliance lining up with the bush administration in trying 
to extend their range and others backing chancellor helmut kohl in 
calling for us negotiations with moscow 
there was virtually no evidence of discord although the 
american side was clearly irritated with soviet refusal to condemn 
iranian calls for attacks on americans shevardnadze explained that 
moscow which shares a long common border with iran was trying to 
be on good terms with its neighbor 
the sweep of the talks which included separate meetings of 
mixed working group on arms control regional issues human rights 
and direct ussoviet relations reflected a broadening discourse 
and less of a focus on curbing the nuclear arms race 
but bakers suggestion for a resumption of talks on a strategic 
arms reduction treaty in midjune struck a positive chord the 
soviets had been eager to resume the talks that were recessed last 
november but president bush ordered a delay while us weapons 
policies were reviewed 
baker suggested the negotiations be reopened the week of june 
18 and a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the soviets would agree to june 19 or june 20 
gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
the talks would resume on either june 12 or june 19 with the first 
round to last six weeks he said the soviets had wanted to get 
started in may but the united states had demurred 
the reagan administration had agreed tentatively to resume in 
midfebruary 
the negotiators have some tough problems to grapple with as 
they try to reduce by 30 to 50 percent us and soviet arsenals of 
longrange bombers submarines and landbased missiles that can 
span oceans and continents among the issues are whether to try to 
restrict mobile missiles and how to verify such elusive weapons as 
cruise missiles fired from airplanes and submarines 
on human rights baker departed from the practice of his 
predecessor george p shultz and did not start out his meeting 
with shevardnadze on the subject but a us official said human 
rights still had pride of place on the superpower agenda and 
baker elicited from shevardnadze a description of the changes the 
soviets are making in their legal code 
baker also spoke to an assemblage of some 50 human rights 
activists at the us embassy and told them we are going to keep 
up the pressure to resolve individual cases we are going to push 
to see that changes are institutionalized and human rights 
guaranteed 
baker plans to meet again with shevardnadze on thursday morning 
before a twohour session with gorbachev baker will fly to 
brussels thursday night to brief the members of the north atlantic 
treaty organization

thousands of college students who have trudged 
miles to protest for democracy got on their bicycles wednesday and 
pedaled to the offices of staterun media to call for press freedom 
the peoples daily cheats the people the beijing daily talks 
nonsense students chanted in their first marchonwheels in 
nearly a month of campaigning for political reforms many of the 
5000 students wore colorful paper sashes and headbands supporting 
their cause 
students in the provincial capital of taiyuan joined in the 
democracy movement for the first time wednesday when thousands held 
sitins in front of a hotel and shanxi provincial government 
offices 
the official xinhua news agency described the taiyuan 
demonstration as massive but gave no exact figure for 
participants a reporter at the shanxi daily contacted by 
telephone said 4000 to 5000 students took part and demanded a 
dialogue on corruption with the governor 
the reporter said the protest was peaceful it was not clear if 
the governor responded 
thousands of students in more than a dozen other cities also 
have held sporadic protests for political reform since beijing 
students began the movement april 15 
but beijing students have protested in the greatest numbers to 
press their demands for a dialogue with national leaders to reform 
chinas tightly controlled political system 
on wednesday the ministry of supervision said it will allow 
more open news reporting of corruption cases it said the move was 
prompted by the recent demands of beijing university students to 
crack down on corruption the first acknowlegement that the 
government was giving ground to students and workers 
the bicycle protest was much smaller than other recent protests 
in the capital but participants said they were keeping up pressure 
on the government at least 16 schools took part 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang who has made 
several conciliatory statements on the student movement on 
wednesday stressed the need for political reform but mentioned no 
specific changes 
zhao was a key sponsor of political reform plans in 1987 that 
called for increasing popular access to officials and reducing 
direct party involvement in daytoday government operations but 
political reforms have been put on hold in the past year as leaders 
have emphasized reestablishing controls over a chaotic economy 
many difficulties that have cropped up in the course of the 
reform of the economic setup cannot possibly be overcome without a 
reform of the political setup xinhua quoted zhao as telling a 
visiting bulgarian delegation 
the student protesters have put forward no comprehensive 
political program but say they want the rights listed in the 
chinese constitution freedom of speech assembly and publication 
strict party censorship of the media has been a target of their 
protests 
the student bicyclists painted slogans on their tshirts 
jackets hats and headbands calling for a free press and accurate 
reporting on their own protests they also expressed support for 
more than 1000 journalists who signed a petition given to the 
government tuesday calling for a dialogue on censorship 
the bicyclists stopped traffic for miles as they swarmed from 
campuses in northern beijing to hold protests at the national tv 
network xinhua and the peoples daily the party newspaper no 
officials came out to speak with them 
peoples reporters speak for the people the students 
chanted outside the peoples daily where they were cheered by 
about 2000 residents one man brought out two cases of beer for 
the thirsty protesters 
about 50 leading writers cycled along with the students the 
first time they have done so about 300 journalists joined a 
student march last week 
they should not be allowed to stand alone said writer su 
xiaokang 
police did not attempt to interfere and tried along several 
stretches of the route to clear the way for the bicyclists 
many students said they planned more protests next week when 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arrives for the first 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
i am willing to keep marching said one student im a bit 
tired but these things cannot be achieved in just one swoop

is declared the winner of sundays presidential election 
supporters of the opposition canceled a plan to present an 
official protest claiming fraud saying they wanted to prepare for 
todays march 
opposition leaders and the united states which has long tried 
to drive noriega from power have condemned the vote as fraudulent 
since the election the presidents of guatemala costa rica 
peru and venezuela have contacted endara and he urged them to ask 
the panamanian government not to proclaim noriegas candidate the 
victor sources in the opposition said today 
guillermo cochez vice president of the opposition christian 
democrat party told reporters today that a government proclamation 
of victory would incite violence because the people know who

endara 2to1 with about 15 percent of sundays vote counted the

rid of noriega panamas de facto leader since 1983 and head of its 
15000member defense forces noriega has not made a public 
appearance or statement since election day 
endara said tuesday he opposes ousting noriega through us 
military intervention an option cited by the white house as under 
discussion endara said intervention would cause more problems than 
it could solve 
he and other opposition leaders did not specify what action they 
wanted from washington which has been trying to topple noriega

independent delegation monitoring the elections returned to 
washington where he briefed bush on tuesday and denounced the 
elections as fraudulent

the 1977 torrijoscarter treaties would play into noriegas hands

united states plans to invade panama and renege on the treaties 
which cede control of the canal to panama at the end of the century 
in washington bush called on foreign leaders to urge noriega to 
honor the election results

charges were dismissed wednesday against 
a popular university basketball player who last month was accused 
of raping a woman on campus 
the suffolk county district attorneys office said it had 
determined that quincy brandon troupe 22 who is black had not 
attacked the 20yearold white woman 
his arrest had triggered demonstrations on campus at the state 
university of new york at stony brook in which protesters alleged 
the arrest was racially motivated 
the victim had picked troupe out of two police lineups and 
identified him from a yearbook picture 
troupe a harlem resident who had been free in 10000 bail 
maintained that he was with friends in manhattan at the time of the 
march 24 attack 
assistant district attorney michael ahearn told suffolk county 
district court judge edward green that a long and exhaustive 
investigation showed the evidence against troupe was weak and 
insufficient 
he said there was no physical evidence against troupe his alibi 
witnesses were strong and the victim decided not to appear before a 
grand jury 
troupe smiled broadly and hugged his parents margaret and 
quincy troupe sr and his lawyer c vernon mason when the judge 
dropped the case 
john williams spokesman for the district attorneys office 
said outside the courtroom that the decision to drop charges did 
not mean the victim was lying this means that we do not believe 
that he troupe did it said williams 
i knew i wasnt guilty troupe told reporters i felt it 
was just a matter of time 
of the victim troupe said i hope in her case that justice 
will be done because if the rape occurred then theres still a 
guy running around out there 
troupe a popular senior engineering student and starting guard 
on the basketball team was initially suspended by the school after 
his arrest april 1 a week later he was granted unrestricted access 
to the campus

the government brought in a special plane 
wednesday to determine how much airspace a new sixstory hotel is 
obscuring from controllers radar 
federal aviation administration officials insisted flights in 
and out of portland international jetport are safe but they 
considered the gaps in the radar coverage serious enough to send in 
an airplane full of computer gear two pilots and a technician less 
than 24 hours after air traffic controllers complained about the 
problem 
we considered it urgent faa spokesman michael ciccarelli 
said 
he said it would be at least a few days before any information 
on the problem could be analyzed he said 
air traffic controllers said a wedge of airspace 6000 feet high 
and perhaps eight miles wide at its broadest point has been blocked 
from radar by the construction of a quality suites hotel 
the faa said that when portlandbased dunfey properties inc 
proposed the hotel no objections arose because a typographical 
error in the developers documents indicated the building would be 
about 12000 feet from the runway instead of about 1200 feet away 
but were not pointing the finger at anyone ciccarelli 
said why point the finger at an innocent mistake 
dunfey president bob dunfey jr on wednesday acknowledged the 
typo but he said the companys documentation included a us 
geological survey map that showed the correct location dunfey 
suggested faa officials should have caught the error 
a quarter of a mile and 2 miles is a big difference dunfey 
said 
dunfey and the local president of the national air traffic 
controllers association cheryl readio said moving the radar or 
altering its setting might solve the problem 
jim lucas manager of the faas air traffic division for new 
england said that if wednesdays testing found a serious enough 
problem some flight corridors could be temporarily changed 
ms readio said no flights had run into trouble but the air 
traffic controllers wanted the situation changed before a problem 
did develop 
controllers said the gap could cause some planes southwest of 
the city to disappear from the radar screen including flights from 
boston to portland flights in and out of smaller airports in 
biddeford and sanford and some military flights from pease air 
force base in newington nh 
president bush flies in that area of southern maine on the 
marine one helicopter when he travels from pease to his summer home 
in kennebunkport but lucas said the presidents flights could not 
be affected because they are controlled through pease

the midgetman intercontinental ballistic 
missile subject of debates on capitol hill and within the bush 
administration will be flight tested for the first time thursday 
the pentagon announced wednesday 
the initial test of the missile designed to be fired from a 
truck launcher will be at vandenberg air force base in california 
the pentagon and air force said in a statement 
the first test will not be made from a mobile launcher but 
rather from a standard concrete launch pad the air force added 
the launch time has been set at 2 pm edt but is subject to 
change the service said 
if all goes according to plan the launch will send the missile 
more than 5000 miles to the pacific test range in the kwajalein 
islands 
the midgetman known formally as the small intercontinental 
ballistic missile is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to 
a target as far away as 6900 statute miles 
the threestage missile weighs 37000 pounds stands roughly 52 
feet tall and is 46 inches in diameter 
the political controversy involves the issue of whether the 
united states should develop one or two mobile missiles for its 
nuclear arsenal the soviet union already has developed and begun 
deploying two such landmobile missiles while the united 
states has none 
defense secretary dick cheney would prefer to develop only one 
mobile missile a version of the huge 10warhead mx that could be 
carried and launched from a rail car 
president bush recently decided however to pursue development 
of both the mx and midgetman to appease congress 
democratic leaders on capitol hill argue that the nation needs a 
mobile missile to deter the soviet union from attempting a first 
strike against missiles deployed inside silos and that the smaller 
more mobile midgetman is the best alternative 
cheney while accepting the presidents decision has countered 
by saying the pentagon will be hard pressed to afford the 
midgetmans cost roughly 25 billion if 500 are built 
the issue remains controversial despite bushs decision 
because some democrats want to speed up the pace of development for 
the midgetman at the expense of the railmobile mx 
the major contractors on the midgetman include morton thiokol 
inc of brigham city utah which is building the firststage 
rocket motor the aerojet nevada rocket operations of sacramento 
calif which is developing the secondstage motor and the 
aerospace production group of magna utah which is building the 
thirdstage motor 
the martin marietta corp has been hired by the air force to 
oversee assembly and testing and to provide support services the 
truck launcher for the missile is being developed separately by the 
boeing aerospace co in seattle wash

the barrage of charged particles from the sun 
may be contributing to the damage to the earths protective ozone 
layer a pair of government scientists reported wednesday 
very dramatic changes have occurred in the number of 
electrons raining down on the earth between 1979 and 1984 linwood 
callis of the national aeronautics and space administration said at 
a meeting of the american geophysical union 
this flow of electrons enhanced by the solar wind an energy 
flow from the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in 
the upper parts of the stratosphere 
in turn those nitrogen compounds can settle into the 
stratosphere where if you have any kind of significant buildup 
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of 
ozone said callis 
ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damaging 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun 
what the model calculations show and that the data confirm is 
that from 1979 to 1985 the nitrogen oxide levels in the polar 
lower stratosphere probably increased betweeen 30 and 80 or 90 
percent in the equatorial region there have been increases much 
smaller on the order of 10 or 15 percent callis said 
damage to the ozone over the south pole has been widely 
discussed in recent years callis said that socalled antarctic 
ozone hole appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds 
trapped over the polar areas since ice particles in this region 
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air 
the interest that we have in this is primarily related to 
global ozone there are larger than expected ozone changes 
said callis 
scientists have warned that if that ozone damage were to spread 
to other parts of the earth the increased radiation could cause an 
increase in skin cancer international efforts are being made to 
reduce or ban the use of ozonedamaging chemicals 
callis and dan baker also of nasa reported that they have used 
satellite data to study levels of ozone nitrogen oxides and other 
chemicals around the world 
in the air about 16 miles above the surface the area where 
ozone is most concentrated they found the gas depleted by as much 
as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985 callis said 
this could be occurring because of some natural changes in 
atmospheric chemistry he said but having it occur at the same 
time the flood of charged particles from the sun is increasing 
makes them consider the possibility of cause and effect 
natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of 
incoming charged particles between now and the mid1990s said 
callis and he and baker are interested in seeing if ozone levels 
will recover during that period 
the flow of particles is lowest during periods of sunspot 
maximums and increased when there were fewer sunspots 
there are clear links between the state of the 
magnetosphere and the state of the middle atmosphere callis said

vice president dan quayle said wednesday a 
senate committee is considering legislation he called 
unfortunate because it would undermine us efforts aimed at a 
negotiated political peace in cambodia 
it surprised me to learn that the senate foreign relations 
committee is considering a measure that would abruptly change us 
policy toward cambodia and essentially eliminate whatever leverage 
we may be able to exercise over the situation there quayle told 
the philadelphia world affairs council during a luncheon 
quayle returned last week from a tour of southeast asia at a 
cambodian refugee camp near the thaicambodian border he noted 
that the refugees would like to return home but must await the 
withdrawal of vietnamese forces 
the refugees also must consider the political climate in their 
homeland after troop withdrawals before they could go home he said 
considerable progress has been made in ongoing negotiations 
among the cambodian factions toward agreement on an interim 
coalition government under prince sihanouk he said part of that 
agreement is a provision for free elections later 
with negotiations now in a delicate state he said the bush 
administration is staying away from any binding policy decisions 
with respect to possible additional aid to the noncommunist 
resistance as well as some form of concession to the communist 
factions who might help in achieving a peaceful settlement 
the group of prime concern is the communist khmer rouge once 
the most powerful faction and believed responsible for the deaths 
of 20 percent of cambodias 1975 population during its bloody rule 
quayle said the senate committee is considering legislation that 
would prevent the us from supporting any cambodian settlement 
in which any elements of the khmer rouge would play a role of any 
kind even a peacemaking or maintaining role 
quayle said the effect of the committee proposal would be to 
reward the vietnamese by leaving their puppet regime in place 
during a question and answer period the vice president was 
asked about us reaction to the recent panamanian elections in 
which gen manuel antonio noriega declared victory for his 
candidate despite claims of election fraud 
president george bush has all the options quayle said 
im not going into that 
before his speech quayle explored the mediterranean sea by 
means of a live satellite arrangement set up by dr robert d 
ballard who found the titanic in the north atlantic using a 
remotecontrolled robotcamera known as jason 
jason television and satellites are providing live coverage of 
ballards work to audiences of children at nine museums around the 
country including philadelphias franklin institute 
quayle also was in philadelphia to place a wreathe at the tomb 
of the unknown revolutionary war hero near independence hall

the leader of italys communists will visit the 
united states next week for the first time presenting his party as 
liberal in american terms and even as willing to consider dropping 
communist from its name 
party secretary achille occhetto who leads the largest 
communist party in the west and the no 2 party in italy said 
it is very important in the united states that one understands 
that our party represents something profoundly original 
he said his party has fought domestic battles for civil rights 
and democratic causes and has criticized soviet foreign policy 
still his party which claims 15 million members has been 
locked out of christian democratdominated governments since 1947 
successive us administrations have viewed the party with 
suspicion favoring a reduction in communist influence in western 
europe 
i can say that the government of the united states doesnt 
share the values that the communists set forth and on this point 
our position hasnt changed us ambassador maxwell rabb said in 
an interview published this week by epoca magazine 
however he added yes i think it will be good that occhetto 
listens to the american point of view and in this sense he will 
find the united states a warm and friendly country rabb said 
he spoke in an interview with the associated press on tuesday in 
communist party headquarters shortly after the government easily 
survived a confidence vote brought by the communists they were 
protesting a new health plan that imposes nominal fees for 
hospitalization and medical tests 
occhetto 53 took over the party last july with the mandate to 
reverse its sagging electoral fortunes a decade after winning 
about a third of the vote and coming to the brink of power the 
communists have been jolted by a series of electoral drubbings 
the new party secretary has been trying to give the party a 
youthful image allowing himself to be photographed while sailing 
or while kissing his wife the party has been jumping on ecological 
issues and debating a name change as part of a wider initiative to 
forge links with western european socialist parties 
the partys daily newspaper even carries the milan stock market 
listings in a bid to attract the upwardly mobile who have been 
giving their votes to former premier bettino craxis socialists 
if i can translate it into american terms our party is a 
liberal party said occhetto 
he acknowledged that in the united states the word 
communist is often synonomous with eastern europe he said he 
intends to project an image of a party that uses democratic 
methods to reform society 
occhetto also said his party supports italys membership in the 
western nato alliance 
he leaves for new york on monday with giorgio napolitano a 
party foreign policy specialist who will interpret for him 
they have no meetings lined up with bush administration 
officials however occhetto is scheduled to talk with leaders of 
the house and senate meet with the editorial boards of the new 
york times and the washington post and give speeches in washington 
and new york according to his aides

a controversy over the loss of a us hydrogen bomb 
off japan 24 years ago has added to the tension surrounding the 
us military presence here and created anxiety among japanese 
japan the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons is 
especially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms 
the us military said monday that an a4 skyhawk jet carrying 
the bomb fell off the us aircraft carrier ticonderoga in 1965 
about 80 miles from a small island in southern okinawa 
the statement followed the release of a report by the greenpeace 
environmental group that detailed the loss 
the us government said the bomb does not threaten the 
environment foreign minister sousuke uno said in response to 
opposition party questions in parliament on wednesday 
uno said tokyo would decide whether to take action on the 
matter which has triggered angry citizen protests after it hears 
from washington on monday the government asked for a us 
explanation of the incident 
the controversy has added an irritant to us military relations 
with okinawa site of one of the bloodiest battles in world war ii 
the presence of about 35000 us troops there has led to friction 
over a range of issues from soldiers behavior to target range 
accidents 
the japan congress against atomic and hydrogen weapons blasted 
us secrecy about the bomb loss in a statement tuesday 
the governor of okinawa junji nishime said he will urge the 
government to take steps to calm anxiety among residents of the 
island prefecture the okinawa assembly is to open an extraordinary 
session to look into the bomb loss 
another antinuclear group in kagoshima in southwestern japan 
sent telegrams to prime minister noboru takeshita and president 
bush asking them to abide by japans ban on nuclear weapons or 
abolish the japanus security treaty 
under the treaty about 60000 us troops are posted in japan 
citizen protests of accidents aircraft noise and the presumed 
presence of nuclear weapons aboard us ships visiting japan are 
common 
japan maintains that the security treaty requires prior 
consultation by the united states if it wants to introduce nuclear 
weapons into japanese territory it says there never have been any 
such consultations 
us policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence of 
nuclear weapons in specific locations 
japanese citizens and opposition politicians have accused 
washington of covering up the 1965 incident but the defense 
department denied the allegations 
it was way out to sea in international waters said defense 
department spokesman dan howard the weapon went down in 16000 
feet of water there was no danger to anyone there was not 
then and there is not now 
we have faithfully honored our obligations under the 
usjapanese treaty of mutual security and its related 
arrangements and well continue to do so he said

only a few times since young george 
washington took a hatchet to a sapling has cutting into trees 
caused such a ruckus 
after court fights charges of lying and deception and a work 
stoppage a judge has told officials of oak park and the dupage 
county water commission that if they cant agree on how to finish 
carving out the path for a new water main i will deal with this 
on a treebytree basis 
and so tuesday as cook county judge kenneth gillis ordered 
officials from both sides set off on a walking tour in the brisk 
spring air their mission was to determine exactly how much more 
tree trimming is necessary to make room for the pipelaying crane 
longtime residents of the historic west chicago suburb which 
won national recognition as a tree city just last year say too 
much trimming already has been done 
it already looks like a war zone said tina birnbaum an oak 
park resident for 10 years you can define anything as pruning 
i guess but when you take off everything but the trunk id call 
it destruction 
at the center of the controversy is dupage countys attempt to 
pump in water from lake michigan and replace a system of wells 
inadequate to serve a booming housing and business corridor 
i used to live in elmhurst a dupage county community and i 
can appreciate how bad well water is said mrs birnbaum but 
one of the reasons i moved here was because i got tired of looking 
at tiny trees in all those new subdivisions 
worse yet i walk my son to school each day and the work 
crews dont have the good sense to stop the machinery and the 
driving back and forth 
they came to school one day and told the kids to be careful 
she said but these are little children were talking about not 
high schoolers 
the eastern edge of dupage county is only about 20 miles west of 
lake michigan but about 160 miles of pipe will be laid most of 
it channeling the water to different communities within county 
boundaries 
in oak park residential streets along a twomile stretch have 
been torn up at an average of one block each week while work crews 
dig trenches about 20 feet deep 
branches of trees that hang over the street most of them elms 
oaks and maples many 70 years old are pruned to make room for 
the 90foot crane that lifts the pipe sections 20 feet long and 9 
feet wide and drop them into the trench 
donald mulack an attorney for oak park told the court monday 
that 47 of 356 trees designated for pruning have been 
amputated and nine others were destroyed 
clifford weaver attorney for the water commission said only 
three trees have been destroyed and plans call for destruction of 
just one more to finish the route 
gillis sided with the village on the extent of damage to the 
trees 
but rather than granting either sides request for an 
injunction the judge ordered representatives from both sides to 
walk the route negotiating by inches and branches and agreeing 
on every cut before moving on to the next tree

the house on wednesday impeached us district 
judge walter l nixon of mississippi who is serving a fiveyear 
perjury sentence and sent the case to the senate for trial to 
decide whether he should be ousted from office the vote was 4170 
lets get on with this task unpleasant as it may be before 
he returns to the bench rep james sensenbrenner rwis told 
the house as it acted on the third judicial impeachment case in 
recent years 
the three impeachment articles were sent to the senate for a 
trial to determine whether nixon will be removed from office and 
deprived of the 89500 annual salary he has been collecting while 
serving his sentence at eglin air force base in florida 
the senate currently is holding an impeachment trial for us 
district judge alcee l hastings of florida he was acquitted in 
1983 on charges of conspiracy to receive a 150000 bribe but 
lawmakers are seeking his removal anyway saying there is ample 
evidence 
us district judge harry claiborne of nevada was impeached by 
the house in 1986 while serving a tax evasion sentence and later 
removed from the bench by the senate 
nixon was convicted of perjury after denying in 1984 before both 
a federal grand jury and justice department investigators that he 
intervened in a narcotics case involving the son of hattiesburg 
business executive wiley fairchild 
nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity in that 
case 
but evidence at his trial and developed in an impeachment 
investigation by the house was that nixon discussed the marijuana 
case with thenforrest county district attorney paul holmes 
fairchild later pleaded guilty to a charge of providing nixon 
with an improper gratuity in 1981 specifically an oil and gas 
investment nixon paid with 9500 in promissory notes and 
collected royalties totaling 60000 
theres no doubt that wylie gave judge nixon a sweet deal 
rep don edwards dcalif told the house 
the written agreement between the two was backdated one year to 
a time before fairchilds son hattiesburg airport manager drew 
fairchild was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle a ton of 
marijuana through the airport 
nixons attorneys have argued that many of the answers that he 
gave to the grand jury were technically correct and that others did 
not constitute an impeachable offense 
nixon has collected more than 286000 in salary since his 
conviction and has been saying that he plans to return to the bench 
and preside over cases when he is released lawmakers said his 
release could come within a matter of months 
the articles of impeachment said that nixon has raised 
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity undermined 
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
betrayed the trust of the people of the united states and brought 
disrepute on the federal courts and the administration of justice

by 30 percent and end a sixday walkout a spokesman said 
the workers had been demanding a 50 percent increase in their 
pay which now averages 118 to 176 a month the strike they began 
last week reportedly has cost millions of dollars in lost 
production

official trade union opzz but that solidarity members were 
supporting it 
the strike represented the first significant labor unrest since 
a broadranging accord between the solidarityled opposition and 
the communist government was concluded april 5 
the agreement restored legal status to solidarity the 
independent trade union that was outlawed in 1982 after the 
imposition of martial law in 1981 
solidarity leader lech walesa speaking tuesday at a workers 
rally stopped short of telling the copper miners to return to 
their jobs but said there were more significant problems to solve 
first 
the four affected mines employ about 20000 miners near the 
southwestern city of lubin and produce most of polands copper the 
official pap news agency said the strike has cut production by 
about 100000 tons daily the television news said losses amounted 
to 28 million daily 
about 15000 miners have supported the strike the strike 
committee said 
the committee includes 10 members of the independent solidarity 
trade union seven from the partydominated opzz union and 13 
unaffiliated miners solidarity said

the world jewish congress has received 
assurances from several governments that austria will not be 
admitted to the european economic community unless it pays 
reparations to jewish victims of the nazi holocaust a spokesman 
said wednesday 
the assurances were given in response to a letter by the wjc to 
the 12 nations of the eec asking them to link austrias expected 
application with its commitment to compensate fully the jews who 
suffered persecution when the nazis ruled austria austria intends 
to apply for membership in the trading body by the end of the year 
wjc executive director elan steinberg declined to say which 
european governments had responded to the letter but said he was 
encouraged by their reaction 
in its letter to the 12 eec ambassadors in brussels the wjc 
said the jewish communities of europe are of the firm view 
that prior to eec membership austria must recognize its moral and 
material responsibilities towards jewish survivors 
the wjc which provided copies of the letter said a similar one 
was sent last november to the chancellor of austria franz 
vranitsky 
some 68000 austrian jews died in nazi concentration camps in 
world war ii and another 120000 were incarcerated or fled the 
country 
austrias parliament last year voted a onetime compensation of 
between 200 and 400 for each victim 
jewish groups called the decision a sacrilege saying it was 
motivated by the international condemnation of the election of kurt 
waldheim as president despite allegations of his involvement in 
nazi atrocities waldheim has been banned from entry into the 
united states because of his past 
west germany agreed in 1952 to pay holocaust victims lifetime 
reparations but austria contends it was annexed by nazi germany 
and is not as culpable even though many of its citizens cooperated 
with the germans 
austria seeks entry into the european community based on a 
desire for financial benefit steinberg said it should not 
receive such benefits unless it fulfills its financial obligations 
arising from its participation in the persecution of jews

the coast guards onsite commander of the 
exxon valdez oil spill told exxon on wednesday that its proposed 
cleanup plan was basically sound but ordered changes including 
weekly progress reports 
vice adm clyde robbins the onsite commander of the alaska oil 
spill cleanup ordered exxon to provide immediately a detailed 
operations schedule for areas outside prince william sound along 
the fouled beaches southwest of valdez that include the spectacular 
katmai national park wildlife refuge 
that should be submitted as soon as the shoreline committee 
furnishes you an inventory of beaches requiring attention 
robbins said in a letter to exxon general manager otto harrison 
the oil companys ranking executive in the spill zone 
he said it appeared doubtful that exxon could meet its sept 15 
cleanup deadline i am seriously concerned that the investment of 
resources you describe will not be able to clean the 300plus miles 
of shoreline in the time alloted he told harrison 
exxons proposed cleanup plan submitted may 1 called for 
cleanup of 364 miles of shore by sept 15 and said it would seek 
exemptions from local environmental laws in order to dispose of the 
recovered oily waste 
i emphasize that the concept of the plan is sound robbins 
said please address these concerns ive presented immediately 
and incorporate them into your plan advise me as you do so 
in washington exxon usa president wd stevens told a senate 
committee that the company would deploy 1600 more workers plus 
more barges and boats bringing to 5000 the total number of 
cleanup workers involved in the shoreline cleanup 
robbins in a separate issue said authorities were considering 
the possible use of chemical dispersants on beaches to break down 
the oily sludge thats going to be studied very carefully before 
we try it robbins said 
environmentalists have attacked the use of dispersants 
contending the chemicals pose a health risk 
under federal law the coast guard is responsible for 
supervising the cleanup and must approve the companys strategy to 
handle the more than 10 million gallons of crude oil dumped into 
prince william sound when the tanker exxon valdez struck a reef 25 
miles from valdez on march 24 
the oil has spread about 450 miles southwest of valdez 
robbins told exxon to 
provide more personnel and equipment for the cleanup 
let the coast guard know what special equipment is needed so 
the government could help find it 
place immediate importance on the cleanup outside prince 
william sound 
expect to have the cleanup reviewed by state and federal 
officials next spring 
continue to have the use of the uss juneau and uss mchenry as 
communications and support vessels 
give the coast guard each week a planning schedule that allows 
federal authorities to track the progress of the cleanup 
robbins said he was speaking for coast guard commandant paul a 
yost jr who was in washington dc i have consulted the 
commandant and he agrees with my letter robbins said 
in other spillrelated developments wednesday 
state and federal officials reported that an estimated 600 
otters have been killed by the oil spill along with several 
thousand birds 
exxon launched an oil bounty hunter program paying 5 a 
gallon for recovered crude the company said the bounty hunters 
were private boat owners using their own equipment and fuel who 
skimmed oil from prince william sound there was no immediate word 
of how much bounty oil had been recovered 
a scientist with the state department of environmental 
conservation pete mcgee said tests for hydrocarbons in the sound 
showed that the water was apparently safe 
exxon ordered 60 mobile homes moved from anchorage next month 
to provide housing for oil company employees working on the 
cleanup exxon bought the units for 12000 each and they will be 
installed at a mobile home park by june 14 a day before exxon 
employees must vacate valdez hotels to make way for summer 
tourists the company reportedly is spending 15 million to move 
the units outfit them with new furniture televisions and dishes 
and hire maids 
a 50foot landing craft involved in the cleanup sank near 
valdez but the three people aboard were rescued uninjured the 
coast guard said the vessel was under contract to exxon and an 
investigation was under way said dave haulbrook a coast guard 
spokesman

interest rates on both fixed and 
adjustablerate home loans rose in april to their highest levels in 
more than three years the government reported wednesday 
fixedrate mortgages in early april rose 021 percentage point 
from the previous month to 1158 percent and adjustablerate 
mortgages rose 037 point to 1014 percent the federal home loan 
bank board reported 
those were the highest levels since december 1985 when 
fixedrate mortgages averaged 1201 percent and adjustablerate 
home loans averaged 1039 percent rates also had risen strongly in 
march 
the sharp twomonth increase in arm rates followed increases 
in shortterm market interest rates reflecting federal reserve 
efforts to restrain inflation said james barth chief economist 
for the bank board 
the federal reserve for a year has been pushing up interest 
rates in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by restraining 
economic growth 
the housing industry among the sectors of the economy hardest 
hit by rising interest rates has registered sharp declines in 
building permits construction and sales in recent months 
despite the rise in arm rates the percentage of mortgages 
closed with adjustable rates rose to 56 percent in early april up 
slightly from 55 percent in the previous month 
a separate weekly report released friday by the federal home 
loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac showed interest rates 
remained relatively high throughout april and into the start of may 
fixedrate mortgages were averaging 1097 percent last week 
down slightly from 1103 percent during the previous week on 
oneyear adjustable rate mortgages lenders were asking an average 
initial rate of 936 percent last week down from 938 percent the 
week before freddie mac said 
the freddie mac figures are lower than those reported by the 
bank board because they do not include addon fees known as 
points which are paid by borrowers

nuclear industry leaders accused federal 
regulators wednesday of overloading plant operators with new and 
unneeded safety requirements 
j phillip bayne president of the new york power authority 
told members of the nuclear regulatory commission that despite a 
recent trend toward improved safety at nuclear plants the burden 
of nrc safety orders was growing rapidly 
bayne also said the commissions staff has gone beyond the 
normal bounds of regulation to impose the safety orders 
the perception is that plants are being evaluated on a scale 
that is rising but without the benefit of the formal regulatory 
process bayne said he and other industry leaders held a 
onehour public session with the commissioners at nrc headquarters 
as part of the industrys annual nuclear power assembly 
bayne said there had been a fourfold increase between 1987 and 
1988 in the number of nrc bulletins to plant operators that require 
a specific safety improvement he said the number of such bulletins 
had declined over the previous six years 
industry officials think last years spurt in safety orders may 
mean the commissions staff is trying to impose requirements that 
go beyond established standards bayne said 
this would be a dramatic reversal in nrc policy and id 
suggest that there is no evidence of safety concerns that would 
justify it he added i acknowledge that this industry has some 
poor performers who should and must be called to account but we 
the industry have the means to get their attention 
bayne also complained about what he said was a 50 percent 
increase over the past four years in the number of nrc actions that 
result in civil penalties against utilities 
lando w zech jr the commission chairman responded by saying 
the technical demands and risks of nuclear power oblige the 
industry to try to exceed minimum safety standards 
it bothers me when i hear that were criticized for 
encouraging excellence he said 
zech also criticized the industry for giving the nrc 
essentially no cooperation at all in attempting to make a new 
rule on maintenance standards for nuclear plants 
bayne said the industry should be allowed to resolve what he 
called isolated problems with maintenance without the need for new 
rules affecting all plants

the pentagons fiveyear defense plan is 
fiscally unrealistic and would cost about 150 billion more 
than what congress would approve congressional investigators said 
wednesday 
charles bowsher head of the general accounting office an 
investiagative arm of congress told the senate armed services 
committee that his agency had found that the defense spending plan 
for fiscal 1990 through 1994 exceeds president bushs own budget 
plan by 45 billion 
he also said that the pentagon plan assumes an inflation rate of 
36 percent in 1990 declining to 17 percent in 1994 however the 
congressional budget office and others expect inflation rates of 4 
percent or higher for the next five years 
under cbos projections the fiveyear plan is underfunded by 
nearly 48 billion bowsher said 
compounding the problem is the strong possibility that congress 
will approve defense budgets accounting for inflation and providing 
for no real increases that bowsher said would require an 
additional 54 billion in pentagon reductions 
president bush has cut pentagon spending requests for 1990 
through 1994 by about 65 billion but the gao believes more cuts 
are needed 
the comptroller general also said that the pentagon has planned 
for more than 2 trillion more than provided for in congressional 
budget authority 
what is the effect of being that much off on the fiveyear 
defense plan asked sen sam nunn dga the committees 
chairman does that mean the fiveyear defense plan has been 
essentially worthless 
it might be close to that bowsher responded 
whats a word close to worthless nunn interrupted 
bowsher told the panel that since the mid1980s the 
departments fiveyear defense planning has been fiscally 
unrealistic more weapons were being planned and developed than 
could be produced in an economic manner or supported once they were 
produced 
in a related development a study released wednesday by the 
liberal brookings institution found that the administration has 
made unrealistic economic assumptions but also concluded that 
cheney was on the right track in choosing to cancel major 
weapons systems to trim the budget 
lawrence korb a former assistant secretary of defense in the 
reagan administration and william kaufmann of harvard university 
forecast a gap of 200 billion between projected force levels and 
available funds 
korb said however that cheney had substantially closed the gap 
by canceling the v22 osprey aircraft and delaying development of 
the b2 stealth bomber by a year korb and kaufman recommended that 
the pentagon produce only six of b2s for testing rather than the 
entire 132 requested by the air force

the senate on wednesday supported president 
bushs certification of the government of the bahamas as fully 
cooperative in the war on drugs rejecting an effort to overrule 
his action 
senators voted 57 to 40 to defeat a resolution offered by sen 
john kerry dmass to brand the bahamas as uncooperative in 
important areas a move that would have subjected it to the loss of 
50 percent of us aid 
during debate kerry said the bahamian government has been 
uncooperative in many areas including effective prosecution of 
arrested drug traffickers while providing only superficial and 
selfserving cooperation with us law enforcement agencies 
but opponents said that penalizing the bahamas would be 
counterproductive because it would destroy important progress in 
the effort to end the role of the bahamas as a major transfer point 
for narcotics flowing from south america to the united states 
the president is required under the antidrug abuse act of 1986 
to certify to congress that nations in which narcotics are grown 
or which serve as transit points for narcotics are either fully 
cooperative with us antinarcotics efforts or are taking adequate 
steps of their own 
unless countries are certified they are subject to strong us 
economic sanctions including the loss of half of us economic 
military or other assistance 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said that the bahamas have been 
remarkably cooperative with us law enforcement officials 
they are the only country to allow unimpeded hot pursuit of 
drug traffickers by sea or land deconcini said 
he added that the bahamas have permitted the installation of 
radar surveillance equipment permitted us law enforcement 
authorities to conduct undercover operations on bahamaian soil and 
cooperated in combined operations to arrest drug traffickers and 
seize narcotics 
it is estimated that the united states has as many law 
enforcement officials in the bahamas as the bahamians do de 
concini said 
but kerry said he believes the current level of cooperation is 
merely a front erected to permit more serious drug operations and 
corruption to flourish 
it enables them to pull the wool over our eyes he said 
weve been snookered he said the same thing is taking 
place in the bahamas as happened in panama cooperation at one 
level then expansion of a network of narcotics connections 
sen john chafee dri said the bahamas probably has some 
corruption i wont certify that it does not but i do know the 
administration has stated that this will not help the situation 
however sen trent lott rmiss told the senate we cant 
continue to do business as usual if we are to win the war on the 
drugs that are sweeping our country the most serious concern about 
the bahamas today is their failure to prosecute convict and remove 
from positions of influence persons involved in drug trafficking

uniformed police and kgb agents in plainclothes 
dispersed about 40 soviet jews on wednesday who were demanding 
washington make no trade concessions to the soviet union until 
moscow ends all limits on emigration 
their protest outside moscows international trade center came 
on the first day of secretary of state james bakers visit to 
moscow 
protest organizer yuri semenovsky said baker arranged to meet 
some of the demonstrators later at the us embassy 
the protesters want the united states to keep denying the soviet 
union mostfavorednation status until emigration limits are 
discarded entirely 
many of them carried banners asking the us government to 
maintain the 1972 jacksonvanik amendment that bars trade 
concessions to communist states unless the president can state he 
has received assurances that emigration will be liberalized 
one sign read i wait for permission to leave the ussr for 
10 years another read mr vanik we are still here 
charles vanik no longer in congress suggested last thursday 
that restrictions he had cosponsored be waived for one year 
saying such action would encourage further human rights 
improvements here under president mikhail s gorbachev 
semenovsky leader of a refusenik group called poor 
relatives said the amendment should stay put until moscow passes 
a law letting anyone leave who wants to he said 100000 people 
were refused permission last year 
according to the genevabased intergovernmental committee for 
migration which helps resettle emigres jewish emigration from the 
soviet union rose in april to its highest level since 1979 with 
4129 soviet jews allowed to leave 
semenovsky claims however that many who want to leave are 
afraid to apply or the government will not accept their 
applications

a christian science couple who did not seek 
medical attention for their dying son should not be tried for 
manslaughter their lawyer argued wednesday at the state supreme 
court 
the outcome of the case is being watched closely by many of the 
estimated 650000 members of the christian science church who shun 
doctors and medicine and espouse spiritual healing 
rikki klieman attorney for david and ginger twitchell told 
judge herbert wilkins that state laws are so vague about such 
matters a trial would be unfair and the charges should be 
dismissed 
a 1971 amendment to the state child abuse and neglect law 
recognized spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine 
klieman said the law gives christian scientists no guidance as to 
the point at which they must call in doctors 
the problem is they do not know what the law is said 
klieman they know they have been told by the legislature that 
they will not be prosecuted for caring for their children by 
spiritual healing but then they see that if something goes wrong 
or when it goes to a certain point then they get indicted for 
manslaughter 
john kiernan a special prosecutor representing the state 
argued that it is every parents duty to care for the children he 
said a jury should have the opportunity to decide if the twitchells 
fulfilled that obligation 
klieman said it was unfair to ask a lay jury to decide a case 
based on religious beliefs when the laws are unclear 
wilkins is expected to decide within two weeks whether to send 
the case to the full supreme court or to a trial 
the twitchells did not appear in court wednesday 
according to police reports the twitchells 2yearold son 
robyn became feverish and lethargic in early april 1986 the 
twitchells contacted a church practitioner who came to their home 
to pray for the boys recovery 
on the evening of his death the boy went into convulsions and 
lost consciousness and vital signs the boys father first called a 
funeral director who told him to contact the police the boy was 
pronounced dead at carney hospital in boston 
klieman has the boy died from complications of a bowel 
obstruction caused by a birth defect 
a jury in sarasota fla last month found a christian science 
couple guilty of murder for allowing their 7yearold diabetic 
daughter to die without medical attention 
william and christine hermanson who remain free pending 
sentencing were the first christian scientists in 20 years 
prosecuted in the united states for denying a child medical care 
for religious reasons according to the church 
the church of christ scientist is located in boston and the 
denomination has about 3200 branches worldwide

the us southern command responding to an 
outbreak of violence in panama city upgraded its alert status late 
wednesday for american military personnel and their dependents 
the command raised its socalled personnel movement limitation 
alert from a bravo level to a charlie meaning servicemen 
and their families were told to limit all movement 
a pmlcharlie in military parlance means that major civil 
disturbances are occurring and personnel should not go into 
public areas in panama except for essential business 
limit your travel to work nonaffected areas or another 
defense site and monitor southern command broadcasts closely to 
avoid trouble areas the alert adds 
the previous alert a pmlbravo was issued shortly before last 
weekends national elections and simply advised servicemen to 
decrease visibility because some civil disturbance activity 
is probable 
the pentagon said it had been advised the southern command 
tightened the alert at 445 pm edt wednesday 
no other special precautions or troop movements have been 
ordered the pentagon added 
the change in alert status came amid reports that panamanian 
opposition candidate guillermo endara had been injured wednesday 
afternoon when police using tear gas and gunfire broke up a protest 
of the governments vote count in the presidential election

auto caravan in panama city when riot police began using tear gas 
and birdshot to disperse the demonstrators

a veterinarian headed the medical operation of 
the governments fernald uraniumprocessing plant in ohio until 
recently union officials told a congressional panel wednesday 
to me it is an obvious example of the casual attitude the 
department of energy and their contractors took when dealing with 
the health and very lives of the men and women who worked at these 
facilities elmer chatak of the aflcios industrial union 
department told the house health and safety subcommittee 
a spokesman for the feed materials production center confirmed 
that david howell who holds a degree in veterinary medicine was 
the plants manager of medical services until april 13 
howell who also holds an undergraduate degree in health 
sciences and a graduate degree in pathology did not perform 
medical evaluations and was not considered the supervisor of the 
three physicians who work at the plant on a subcontract basis said 
william kelley a spokesman for the plants operator westinghouse 
materials of ohio 
he has not been a practicing veteriarian at all since his 
affliation with westinghouse kelley said 
the medical services job involves overseeing medical records and 
technologists kelley said a new administrator has not yet been 
named he added 
howell was moved to another department as part of major 
reorganization in which many department heads were changed the 
spokesman said 
the fernald plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processes 
uranium for use in nuclear weapons or as fuel for reactors 
it is the subject of a 300 million suit on behalf of 14000 
people who live or work nearby and believe their health has been 
threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water the 
government has admitted ignoring or undermining efforts to reduce 
pollution there 
the government has estimated that as much as 552000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the 
plant an engineering consultants report prepared as part of the 
lawsuit said releases could be as high as 31 million pounds over 
37 years 
workers have been complaining that they werent adequately 
protected from or told about the dangerous substances to which they 
were exposed most of those complaints have been directed against 
the plants former operator nlo inc which ran the plant until 
1985 
david day president of the fernald atomic trades and labor 
council said workers had been unhappy with the plants medical 
staff in the past but that he is satisfied with recent changes and 
with the current physicians 
there were doctors that are no longer there that made 
diagnoses that were incorrect he said those doctors have been 
replaced 
wrong diagnoses included women who were told they had cancer 
and they didnt have cancer he said 
such episodes led workers to trust only certain doctors and 
increased workers fears about the risks associated with working at 
the plant day said 
concerns increase with each new revelation about the extent of 
radioactive releases over the years he said

except for the white hair it could have 
been railroad entrepreneur leland stanford standing between 
steambelching locomotives wednesday driving in a gold spike that 
bound the nation together by rail 
like stanford 120 years ago actor sam gordon missed on his 
first swing with the sledge so did the actorportraying union 
pacifics thomas durant 
they were totally inebriated as far as we know said john 
stewart a utah state university historian and frockcoated member 
of the local troupe that annually reenacts the makeshift ceremony 
nearly 2000 people gathered at this spot near the great salt 
lake to watch giant steam locomotives come face to face as they did 
may 10 1869 
gordon nearly 80 and a teetotaler has played stanford since 
1961 and codirects the 18member cast he apologized for his 
snowwhite mane 
i feel kind of bad because leland stanford had black hair 
and was 45 at the time gordon said i thought it was ok because 
leland got older too 
once the ceremonial spikes were placed another sledge and 
spike both attached to the telegraph wire were used to alert a 
waiting nation that the 1776mile line was finished 
the last rail is laid the last spike is driven the pacific 
railroad is completed read the telegram from durant and stanford 
to president ulysses s grant 
stanford was a former governor of california and president of 
the central pacific railroad he later represented california in 
the us senate 
a bottle of champagne was broken over the ceremonial tie and 
central pacifics jupiter engine and union pacifics 119 
were driven over it after the ceremonial tie was removed it 
burned in the san francisco fire of 1906 historians believe an 
unknown chinese worker probably drove the last steel spike into a 
wooden tie 
if so it was only fitting 
using up to 400 kegs of blasting powder a day some 12000 
chinese immigrants labored dawn to dusk for about 30 a month 
without board to carve a rail bed out of the granite of the sierras 
it took them more than a year to bore a 1650foot tunnel at 
donners summit four years to pound the 690 miles from sacramento 
calif to this sagebrushdotted valley which has been home to the 
golden spike national historic site since 1969 
occasionally national park service employees find shards of 
broken rice bowls and brass opium boxes furnished to the workers by 
the railroad 
it was their way of keeping them happy said park service 
engineer bob dowty 
two weeks before the rails merged in 1869 the central pacific 
crews had laid a record 10 miles and 56 feet of track in a single 
day 
durants union pacific crews made up largely of exsoldiers of 
the union and confederacy and young irish and german immigrants 
hammered 1086 miles over the great plains and rocky mountains from 
the missouri river frequently braving indian attack 
the rail link was completed six years ahead of schedule at an 
estimated cost of 500 million 
the minute that spike was driven you changed six months from 
omaha to sacramento to six days dowty said 
historians generally agree that the mammoth enterprise that grew 
out of the pacific railroad act signed by abraham lincoln in 1862 
was the single most significant reason for the rapid settlement of 
america west of the mississippi during the late 19th century 
wednesdays reenactment was the 10th involving two 
blackredandgold fullsized replicas of the eastbound jupiter 
and westbound 119 the locomotives cost 750000 each and were the 
first steam engines built in the united states in a quarter century

defense secretary dick cheney defended the 
proposed 7 billion fsx warplane deal with japan on wednesday as 
the senate foreign relations committee considered a resolution to 
disapprove the controversial coproduction arrangement 
addressing charges that the deal will give the japanese vital 
us technology cheney told the committee 
we are not giving them unrestricted access to all the 
technology that goes with our capability to design and produce 
advanced fighter aircraft 
but sen jesse helms rnc the committees ranking 
republican strongly disagreed 
the fsx program is a bad deal for america the fsx will be 
the laboratory and training ground for the design production 
avionics and other engineering talent necessary to build a 
worldclass japanese civilian aircraft industry 
the committee originally was scheduled to vote on the fsx issue 
wednesday afternoon but senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine later said the vote had been postponed until thursday 
after sen frank h murkowski ralaska requested a closeddoor 
intelligence briefing thursday morning on reports of involvement by 
japanese companies in a weapons complex being built in libya 
during the hearing murkowski said he was disturbed by the 
role of japanese firms in helping to construct the libyan complex 
at rabta which includes a suspected poison gas plant as well as a 
metal fabrication plant to produce bomb and shell casings 
deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger told the 
committee there was no evidence that mitsubishi heavy industries 
the prime japanese contractor for the fsx had any involvement with 
the rabta complex 
other japanese companies were involved in the metal 
fabrication plant not the chemical plant eagleburger said 
even if the resolution passes the house and the senate a 
twothirds majority in both houses would still be required to 
override a presidential veto which would be considered likely 
under the deal general dynamics would join with mitsubishi to 
codevelop and coproduce the fsx an advanced version of the us 
f16 for deployment by japan in the late 1990s general dynamics 
is headquartered in st louis but most of the fsx work would be 
done at its f16 plant in fort worth texas 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher who earlier had raised 
concerns within the administration over economic implications of 
the fsx deal told the committee i am confident that this 
agreement will not harm the economic security interests of the 
united states 
cheney asked about how solid he views a promise by the japanese 
that approximately 40 percent of the production work on the fsx 
would be handled by us companies replied we think that its 
solid as solid as it can be 
proponents of the fsx deal have argued that it will give the 
united states valuable flowback of japanese technology 
involving composite wing construction and phasedarray radars 
but sen alan j dixon dill said a report by the general 
accounting office an investigative arm of congress has already 
concluded that these technologies are well known to us aerospace 
companies 
the evidence clearly before us is that were really not 
getting anything in return dixon said 
sen alphonse damato rny called the technology flowback 
argument total nonsense and a facade to cover up the shortcomings 
of this deal 
senators speaking in favor of the deal included sen jeff 
bingaman dnm who argued that if the united states scraps the 
agreement japan will build the new fighter completely on its own 
or in conjunction with a european country 
there is going to be an fsx bingaman said i think that 
if we do not participate we will lose economic benefits and we will 
lose technological benefits 
also backing the deal was sen richard g lugar rind who 
said voting against the fsx would amount to acting in a fit of 
pique over the usjapan 55 billion trade deficit and other 
outstanding economic issues

drug traffickers have all but taken over the 
bahamian island of south bimini chasing off us patrol boats with 
gunfire and intimidating the bahamian military say customs service 
reports and law enforcement officials 
a bahamian police lieutenant on the island even removed a 
suspected drug smuggler from a us boat and freed him says a us 
customs service report obtained wednesday by the associated press 
customs service spokesman michael sheehan and coast guard 
spokesman lt jeff karonis refused to give details of the case 
saying the matter is being handled by the us embassy in nassau 
the bahamas 
bahamian government spokesman edward ellis said he could not 
comment immediately on the incidents 
drug officials are reluctant to talk on the record about the 
situation for fear of endangering joint usbahamian drug 
interdiction efforts but said privately that the island is out of 
control 
the situation in south bimini is near anarchy a federal law 
enforcement official said wednesday speaking on condition of 
anonymity the drug smugglers alone control the island and 
police corruption is obvious 
us drug officials have long complained of highlevel 
protection of drug smugglers and a 1984 royal commission of inquiry 
found lowlevel corruption the bahamian government strenuously 
denies any wrongdoing by current leaders however 
on wednesday the senate defeated 5740 a resolution by sen 
john kerry dmass to revoke president bushs certification that 
the government of the bahamas has fully cooperated in the war on 
drugs decertification could have cost the bahamas nearly all of 
its us foreign aid and other privileges 
south bimini only about 45 miles from florida was finally 
raided may 7 by bahamian troops who made at least one arrest and 
seized six pounds of marijuana and two weapons us embassy 
officials point to the raid by the royal bahamian defense force to 
show good faith by the nations government 
they sent in about 50 rbdf people thats a major raid for 
here i dont think thats any evidence of lack of cooperation 
said martin cheshes charge daffaires at the embassy in nassau 
but drug agents here say they are not impressed with the 
bahamian raid complaining that such actions are rare and usually 
late 
it is gotten to the point that our people are being shot at by 
snipers using machine guns the law enforcement source said 
the bahamian government is closing its eyes to whats going on 
allowing bimini to be used as a thoroughfare for drugs 
the raid was staged five days after coast guard and customs 
service officials assisted by the royal bahamian defense force 
responded to an apparent airdrop of drugs on south biminis coast 
and were thwarted by angry crowds 
cheshes said the delay was caused by the time it took reports to 
get to nassau and the difficulty of mounting a major operation in 
the small country 
two boats believed involved in the drop were intercepted and 
three people taken into custody but when the group docked outside 
the south bimini hotel to allow the bahamian soldiers to search for 
drugs about 75 people gathered according to the customs report 
the angry crowd would not let the rbdf on shore to search for 
the contraband the report said 
the task force withdrew and then intercepted another vessel 
carrying two cubanamericans and two bahamians 
the two bahamians insisted repeatedly on being taken to the 
south bimini police station instead of rbdf headquarters on another 
island 
one bahamian jumped overboard and swam to shore when the 
customs boats headed to shore to rearrest him a bahamian police 
lieutenant took the second bahamian off the boat and freed him at 
the hotel while another crowd gathered 
the bahamian soldiers threatened to fire on the crowd but 
members of the mob said they would shoot back and the task force 
again decided to withdraw the following day a us customs vessel 
returned to the island and came under small arms fire the report 
said

israelis filled beaches and parks to celebrate 
their independence day wednesday while bloodshed continued in the 
occupied lands two arabs were reported killed and 13 wounded 
confrontations between stonethrowing youths and israeli 
soldiers took place despite army curfews that confined more than 
half the 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
to their homes 
curfews and blocking of roads from the territories for a third 
day were designed to keep palestinians from entering israel during 
memorial day on tuesday when israelis honored their war dead and 
the independence day observance 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was hospitalized for tests after 
complaining of tiredness earlier he elaborated on his peace 
proposal in independence day interviews broadcast wednesday on 
israel radio it calls for elections in the occupied lands for 
representatives to negotiate with israel on limited palestinian 
selfrule 
that interim agreement would be followed in two years by 
talks on a final settlement 
his comments in hebrew and english appeared contradictory on 
whether israel was willing to talk with palestinians intent on an 
independent state 
in hebrew after repeating his refusal to deal the palestine 
liberation organization shamir said we have to talk to people 
who are interested in a solution those who dont insist on this 
minimum demand for a palestinian state 
in english when asked how palestinians could be persuaded to 
negotiate if israel insisted on continued rule in the occupied 
lands he said the negotiators could propose whatever they wished 
therefore he added i can suppose that the israeli side 
will propose israeli sovereignty and the arab side will ask for 
palestinian sovereignty both the plo and leading palestinians in 
the occupied lands have rejected shamirs proposal on grounds it 
does not recognize their national aspirations 
also wednesday a foreign ministry official said the united 
states is pressuring israel to calm violence in the occupied 
territories and proceed with shamirs elections plan 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
reports that secretary of state james a baker iii sent a letter 
ten days ago to his israeli counterpart moshe arens expressing 
support for elections as part of a peace plan 
jewish settlers used independence day to inaugurate two new 
settlements in the occupied west bank 
organizers said about 50 families will live in ofarim in the 
north and tzorfim near jerusalem they are among eight new 
settlements approved for construction this year and join about 130 
existing settlements which are home to about 70000 jews 
western governments including the united states see the 
settlements as an obstacle to peace 
in renewed clashes in the occupied west bank troops shot and 
killed two palestinians an army spokesman said the spokesman also 
confirmed two arabs wounded and said other reports were being 
checked 
arabs sources reported a total of 13 wounded in the occupied 
lands on wednesday 
the army spokesman who commented on condition of anonymity 
said one palestinian was shot and killed as he was about to throw a 
firebomb at an army jeep on the jerusalembethlehem highway 
another arab was wounded the spokesman said 
arab reporters told a slightly different story they said the 
palestinian was shot and killed while he and some companions were 
standing along the highway throwing stones at cars driven by 
israeli settlers the cars were flying large blueandwhite israeli 
flags from their rooftops for independence day 
an israeli paramilitary border policeman spotted the 
palestinians and opened fire killing one of the stonethrowers 
the reporters said they also reported two arabs wounded 
arab hospital officials identified the slain man as 24yearold 
sayez ismaeel musa they said he was fatally wounded in the chest 
in the town of ramallah troops opened fire to disperse about 
200 palestinians who were throwing stones killing one and wounding 
another the army spokesman said 
mahoud sami abdul ranni 17 arrived dead at ramallah hospital 
with a gunshot wound to the chest hospital officials said 
the deaths brought to 469 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 17month uprising twentyone israelis have also died in the 
violence 
elsewhere in the west bank and gaza strip 10 palestinians were 
wounded by army gunfire arab sources said

breast cancer patients offered a 
psychological support group lived an average of almost 18 months 
longer than women who received only standard medical care 
concludes a study released wednesday 
i was quite stunned said researcher david spiegel since 
it was so contrary to what we expected to find 
the research provoked some skeptical reactions one scientist 
who has studied the impact of psychology on cancer said she found 
the new results questionable 
spiegel of the stanford university school of medicine 
presented the study at the annual meeting of the american 
psychiatric association he did the study with colleagues at 
stanford and the university of california at berkeley 
the work focused on the survival times of 86 women whose breast 
cancer had spread elsewhere in their bodies by random selection 
50 women were given a chance to participate in a weekly support 
group for a year 
ten years later researchers compared the survival times of the 
two groups of people only a few women were still alive and for 
the study they were included as if they had died at the end of the 
10 years 
analysis showed that the average survival time of women offered 
the support group was 366 months in contrast to 189 months for 
the other women survival time was measured from the point the 
women entered the study 
analysis showed that the survival difference began to appear 
about eight months after the support group began spiegel said 
women in the support group category were comparable to those in 
the comparison category on key characteristics except for stage of 
cancer at the time they were diagnosed support group women on 
average were at an earlier stage but spiegel said further analysis 
convinced him that staging did not explain the survival difference 
troy thompson psychiatry professor at jefferson medical college 
in philadelphia said in an interview after spiegels talk that the 
staging difference still made him skeptical 
the research should be duplicated to see if the same result 
occurs he said sometimes when something sounds too good to be 
true it is he said 
barrie cassileth director of psychosocial research at the 
university of pennsylvania cancer center said in a telephone 
interview that the studys conclusion was highly questionable 
while conclusions were based on survival of the 50 women who 
were offered the support group only 34 attended any sessions and 
only 18 attended more than 10 sessions she noted from the reported 
data 
so it is not clear whether enough women attended enough sessions 
to be sure the program really had a chance to influence survival 
cassileth said 
cassileth said however that research into psychological impacts 
on cancer should be encouraged and that support groups are 
important for improving quality of life and social interaction for 
cancer patients 
another researcher who has studied psychological impacts on 
cancer said that despite some limitations in the new study she 
believes it does suggest the support groups made a difference 
it looked to me that they have something said sandra levy 
associate professor of psychiatry and medicine at the university of 
pittsburgh school of medicine

the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday recommended senate approval of six key diplomatic 
appointments but delayed action on three others including that of 
richard r burt to be the new us strategic arms negotiator 
burt now us ambassador to west germany and a former assistant 
secretary of state for european affairs is under fire by sen 
jesse helms rnc for allegedly publishing classified material a 
decade ago in the position he then held as a national security 
correspondent for the new york times 
helms asserted at a hearing last week that a june 29 1979 
article headlined us plans new way to check soviet missile 
tests disclosed highly classified information involving the 
thennew us chalet satellite system helms said the pentagon 
believed the disclosure that an antenna associated with the system 
was located at a base in norway would jeopardize norways delicate 
relations with the soviet union 
burt said he wrote the story not believing at the time that 
this would be extremely damaging 
helms also questioned burts relationship with a new york times 
reporter while he held his state department position 
helms contended that the reporter judith miller published a 
number of articles allegedly based on classified material 
concerning issues with which burt dealt professionally the senator 
implied but did not explicitly state that burt may have been miss 
millers source 
burt said he never provided such information to miss miller or 
any other reporter and that he and miss miller had a clear 
understanding that he would not do so 
burt said he had told secretary of state alexander m haig jr 
and his successor george p shultz that he and miss miller had a 
social relationship he said they had told him it was none of 
their business because they trusted burts discretion and sense 
of responsibility 
a reporter who twice telephoned the office in new york of max 
frankel the times executive editor was told wednesday there was 
no one immediately available to comment 
helms objection to the immediate consideration of the burt 
nomination delays action on it for at least once week 
the committee also postponed action apparently for technical 
reasons on the nominations of michigan republican activist peter 
f secchia to be us ambassador to italy and douglas p mulholland 
to be assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research 
the panel recommended senate approval of these nominations 
charles e redman a former state department spokesman to be 
ambassador to sweden 
walter j p curley a new york executive to be ambassador to 
france 
joseph vernor reed to hold the rank of ambassador while 
serving as chief of protocol for the white house 
ronald f lehman ii to be director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency 
herman jay cohen to be an assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs 
morris b abram to be the us representative to the european 
office of the united nations 
a committee fight is expected to erupt friday during 
confirmation hearings on the qualifications of donald gregg to 
serve as ambassador to south korea gregg was bushs national 
security adviser when bush was vice president 
several democratic senators including sen alan cranston 
dcalif believe gregg misled the congressional irancontra 
committees as to the role played in the affair by both himself and 
bush some republicans say democrats are attacking gregg out of 
partisan considerations 
some committee members meanwhile complain that the 
administration has been unusually slow in submitting nominations 
for many key diplomatic and state department positions 
nominations have yet to be received for example to fill the 
posts of assistant secretaries of state for europe asia the near 
east and latin america

a 3yearold recovering from wounds 
allegedly suffered when her father slashed her throat in a bloody 
murder spree was quietly released from a hospital wednesday and 
left with her grandfather 
carmina salcido was really in a good mood she knew she was 
leaving and she was excited about that said petaluma valley 
hospital spokeswoman mary frost 
carminas grandfather robert richards of cotati applied for 
her custody following the april rampage in which ramon salcido 
allegedly murdered his wife two daughters his motherinlaw two 
sistersinlaw and a coworker 
carmina was found abandoned at a sonoma county dump along with 
her two sisters sofia 4 and teresa 1 all had their throats 
cut only carmina survived 
frost said the childs morning departure with her grandfather 
and other relatives was kept secret to allow the family to leave 
in peace without the news media fanfare generated by the 
slayings 
she declined to say where the family will live 
doctors will see carmina to make sure her wound heals properly 
during the next few months frost said and although she may have 
cosmetic surgery to lessen the scar on her neck she wont require 
additional surgery 
a tracheotomy performed on carmina will be removed in a few 
weeks and doctors expect no lasting damage to her larynx shes 
more than whispering shes talking frost said 
before carminas release officials met in a closed hearing 
before sonoma county superior court judge arnold rosenfield to 
discuss her custody rosenfield ordered hearing participants not to 
discuss the matter and set another hearing for may 30 
salcidos preliminary hearing has been set for september but 
sonoma county public defender marteen miller has said he will ask 
the court to rule salcidos arrest and deportation from his native 
mexico after the crimes were illegal 
salcido could face the death penalty if convicted of the murders 
that authorities said may have been fueled by jealousy drug abuse 
and marital trouble 
the killings and carminas survival elicited contributions of 
hundreds of toys and stuffed animals for her from wellwishers 
around the country 
in addition more than 180000 has been collected in 10 
separate trust funds for the families of people authorities say 
were slain by salcido 
a trust fund for carmina was opened wednesday with 1065 
donated by jail officers and inmates at the same jail where her 
father is held money will continue to be collected for two weeks 
then the fund will be closed until carmina turns 13 
that account was initiated by a prisoner counseling group run by 
the rev bob gutleben the sonoma county jails unofficial chaplain 
he said inmates many of them abused as children suggested the 
10year account so funds will be available for whatever special 
needs she may develop as she becomes a teenager

soviet bloc delegations and the west united on 
wednesday to delay for two days a decision on the plo bid for full 
membership in the world health organization arab nations had 
sought an immediate vote 
most african delegations also supported a motion proposed by 
austria and seconded by canada to delay the choice between rival 
resolutions until friday 
it carried 5647 with 20 abstentions mostly by latin american 
countries according to an unofficial tally 
of the 160 delegations 37 were absent votes were cast by 
holding up nameplates of member nations 
iraq said after the vote it had wanted a roll call but that 
chen minzhang of china the chairman ignored the request to speak 
two draft resolutions are before the who assembly one 
sponsored by all 21 arab members would have the organization 
decide to admit the state of palestine 
the other is designed to avert a showdown with the united 
states which has threatened to halt payments to any un agency 
that gives full membership to the palestine liberation 
organization which now has nonvoting observer status in the un 
system in november the plo legislative body declared an 
independent palestinian state 
nine western and third world countries support the compromise 
which would combine deferral of the issue until the 1990 assembly 
with a call for more aid to residents of the israelioccupied 
lands where a palestinian uprising began 17 months ago 
by adopting it the assembly also would express hope that the 
palestinian people will be fully represented within the who by 
their legitimate representatives 
that language apparently addresses developing countries that 
sympathize with the plo application but are worried by the warning 
from dr hiroshi nakajima director general of who that loss of 
us funds would completely destroy the agency the united 
states this year paid the agency 71 million a quarter of its 
annual budget 
the united states and its western allies say the nation 
proclaimed by the plo does not fulfill internationally accepted 
criteria of statehood including control of a defined territory and 
a capital 
secretary of state james a baker ii has said admitting the plo 
would harm the middle east peace process and the entire un system 
on tuesday the plo said it would apply for admission to three 
more un agencies the un educational scientific and cultural 
organization based in paris the food and agriculture organization 
in rome and the international labor organization whose 
headquarters are in geneva 
the labor organization probably would be the next target because 
its annual conference opens june 7 and its statutes allow 
applications for membership to be submitted at any time even 
during the meeting admission would require a twothirds majority 
however rather than the simple majority stipulated by who 
from 1977 to 1980 the united states withdrew from the 
international labor organization to protest what it described as 
politicization and an antiwestern bias 
us contributions to the world health organization this year 
total about 94 million to the regular budget and special programs 
to fight specific diseases

published comments by chancellor 
helmut kohls chief spokesman on hitlers waffenss troops has 
damaged west germanys international image a greens party federal 
lawmaker charged wednesday 
jutta oesterleschwerin speaking to parliament referred to an 
interview with chief government spokesman hans klein published last 
thursday in the illustrated magazine quick 
the waffenss were fighting troops not criminals klein was 
quoted as saying in the interview they believed that they must 
defend their homeland 
the waffenss were military units in the ss the nazis special 
police 
ms oesterleschwerin told parliament the government should 
clarify its position on kleins comments which have damaged our 
international image 
after the article was published the leader of west germanys 
jewish community heinz galinski also protested and said kleins 
remarks should not go without criticism 
galinski pointed out that some waffenss units served as guards 
at nazi concentration camps where millions of jews were 
exterminated or died of disease and malnutrition 
galinski himself was the only member of his immediate family to 
survive internment at the auschwitz concentration camp in what is 
now poland 
klein was not available in bonn for comment wednesday 
kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters said the spokesman would 
clarify his position at a later parliament session 
last year philipp jenninger was forced to resign as president 
of the bundestag or parliament after a controversial speech in 
which he gave an inflammatory explanation of hitlers appeal to the 
german people 
jenninger said many germans considered hitlers march through 
europe triumphal and he bluntly referred to the widespread 
antisemitism among germans that allowed hitlers repression of 
jews

a major dispute has broken out within 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition government over the handling of 
natos missile feud by foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
officials said wednesday 
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said genscher angered 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg by not toning down remarks 
aimed at the united states and britain about shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
it said officials within kohls christian democratic union and 
its bavarian sister party the christian social union fear the 
nato feud could damage west germanus relations 
sources within the parties speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the newspapers account 
kohl and genscher have called for eastwest negotiations to 
reduce shortrange nuclear weapons which would be used on german 
soil the united states and britain strongly oppose such talks 
genscher has taken the lead in pressing the issue while kohl 
appears to be standing back to give north atlantic treaty 
organization nations a chance to patch up differences 
in tv and radio interviews genscher has also been vocal in his 
opposition to making an immediate decision on whether to upgrade 
natos shortrange nuclear missiles 
he said on may 4 we have the first and last word about the 
stationing of rockets on our territory and no one else 
most nato shortrange nuclear weapons are based in west germany 
sueddeutsche zeitung quoted stoltenberg as saying genscher is 
not among those who contribute to a calming of natos internal 
dispute 
it further quoted him as saying it is comical that genscher 
appeals for other coalition partners to soften their own remarks 
while he constantly speaks his own mind 
stoltenberg is a christian democrat genscher is a free 
democrat the junior partner in kohls coalition 
the newspaper reported michaela geiger foreign affairs expert 
of the christian social union as accusing genscher of using his 
power within the coalition to give the mistaken impression that the 
bonn government wants shortrange nuclear weapons eliminated 
completely 
other christian social union and christian democratic officials 
fear the nato feud could damage the american view of germany 
the newspaper said 
the comments were made during a private meeting monday night of 
officials of the sister parties the newspaper said 
the defense ministry meanwhile announced that stoltenberg would 
visit the united states from may 1719 for discussions that will 
include defense topics 
he will meet with defense secretary dick cheney and secretary of 
state james a baker iii said ministry spokesman winfried dunkel 
the warsaw pact also wants negotiations on shortrange nuclear 
weapons and denounces nato plans to upgrade its shortrange lance 
rockets 
nato says lance missiles will be have be replaced because of 
their age and plans to upgrade the rockets by extending their 
range 
the west german news magazine stern quoted yuli kvitsinsky the 
soviet ambassador in bonn as saying that increasing the range of 
lance rockets would destroy the basis of the intermediate 
nuclear forces treaty under which the two superpowers are 
eliminating intermediaterange nuclear rockets 
if nato now builds a missile that perhaps has a range of 20 to 
50 kilometers 12 to 30 miles less than our ss23 that is a 
betrayal kvitsinsky was quoted as saying 
soviet ss23 rockets are being eliminated under the inf treaty 
stern telexed excerpts of the interview to other news 
organizations in advance of thursdays publication

housing chief jack kemp on wednesday praised 
antidrug efforts now underway in public housing but some housing 
residents complained that poor management and unfair eviction 
practices have turned them into victims of the nations drug 
problem 
citing programs developed in trenton nj washington dc and 
st louis kemp praised success in the countermovement among 
tenants to wrestle control of public housing projects from drug 
dealers 
kemp the secretary of housing and urban development also told 
the senates permanent subcommittee on investigations he is 
encouraged by successful antidrug strategies used by public 
housing authorities 
but tenants said public housing managers werent doing enough to 
fight drug trade 
edith grisby a washington dc resident said public housing 
managers should live in public housing and be present 24 hours 
a day so they could take immediate action when tenants reported 
drug problems 
my building wouldnt need one more dime of appropriations from 
you in order for it to be run correctly said charles jenkins 
another district resident echoing grisbys complaints about poor 
management 
one of kemps first major actions was to ask public housing 
administrators asking them what they were doing to combat drugs 
that query came after he witnessed drug sales while touring housing 
developments in several cities 
last month kemp outlined a series of antidrug actions 
issuance of photo tenant identification cards installation of 
security fences around projects and increased police patrols 
available to local public housing authorities 
i want to be tough on drugs but i also want to be tough on due 
process said kemp emphasizing he has waived hud administrative 
grievance procedures to help speed evictions of suspected drug 
dealer only in virginia and massachusetts 
if your child is doing drugs it is your responsibility to 
deal with that situation you dont ask the federal government to 
take your child to the hospital when he or she has a broken leg 
said grisby backing kemps actions 
we dont believe we can make a strong case for eviction unless 
a persons lease has been violated said mary ann russ 
executive director of public housing in wilmington del 
sen william roth jr rdel the subcommittees ranking 
minority member whose staff investigation prompted the hearing 
noted that congress three years ago authorized evictions for 
drugrelated criminal activity in public housing 
but herman m holloway jr a former delaware state 
representative warned that many longtime tenants in good 
standing are being hurt by hastily conceived eviction procedures 
meantime rain virtually washed out a save public housing 
day rally by members of the national tenants organization where 
about 250 people gathered at lafayette park across from the white 
house to protest the lack of federal money for construction and 
rehabilitation

striking city bus employees began returning 
to work wednesday after a labor court ordered more negotiations on 
wages 
the service is being resumed immediately and by tomorrow most 
of the buses will probably be back said rafael cardona 
spokesman for the city administration 
judge maria esther cervantes issued an injunction tuesday night 
on the strike and a subsequent lockout ordering that negotiations 
resume the 23000 bus employees went on strike may 3 
after her ruling union and city officials agreed to incorporate 
the bus system into a new transit authority to be established 
within the next few weeks cardona said in a telephone 
interview 
public transit in mexico city also includes a subway highspeed 
street cars and minibuses 
before the walkout the bus system carried an estimated 2 
million passengers daily in 3900 aging buses notorious for spewing 
thick clouds of diesel exhaust into mexico citys badly polluted 
air the buses were dirty usually ran late and were playgrounds 
for pickpockets 
millions of commuters were stranded when the bus systems 
drivers mechanics and administrative employees walked out 
demanding pay raises of 50 percent the strike was declared 
illegal and the city said it was firing all of them 
the city began taking strikers back on wednesday but whether 
all 23000 would be rehired was not clear no date was set for the 
pay negotiations 
bus drivers are paid about 9000 a year more than four times 
the average wage of a public school teacher mayor manuel camacho 
solis has called them the highestpaid transit workers in mexico 
city officials brought 1000 buses in from a neighboring state 
during the strike and pressed hundreds of military vehicles into 
service

former chancellor fred sinowatz will be 
charged with perjury in connection with testimony in a 1987 trial 
that arose from a probe into president kurt waldheims world war ii 
past the justice minister said wednesday 
justice minister egmont foregger did not specify which 
statements by sinowatz were thought to be false 
in october 1987 sinowatz lost a libel suit against a journalist 
who quoted sinowatz as telling fellow politicians two years earlier 
that austria would become aware of waldheims past 
waldheims controversial background as a german army lieutenant 
in world war ii was first publicly disclosed in march 1986 in 
reports by the new york times the austrian weekly profil and the 
world jewish congress 
the question of who released the documents on waldheims past 
has never been answered 
waldheim won over a candidate from sinowatzs socialist party in 
the 1986 presidential election which was marked by fierce 
controversy over waldheims past 
at the 1987 trial sinowatz denied under oath a report by 
journalist alfred worm that he said in late 1985 austria would soon 
learn of waldheims past 
sinowatz resigned as chancellor a day after waldheim was elected 
president in june 1986 
waldheim denies he was involved in nazi war crimes during his 
service in the balkans as media reports alleged 
an international commission of historians appointed to probe 
waldheims past concluded in february 1988 it had no evidence he 
was involved in war crimes but said waldheim concealed his past 
and was in close proximity to nazi crimes when in the balkans

the bush administration on wednesday accused 
panamas leader manuel antonio noriega of blatant attempts at 
intimidation and of responsibility for violence against 
opposition leaders but wouldnt say how the united states might 
respond 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush 
condemned the violence now under way in panama including an 
attack on opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara 
fitzwater said noriega thwarted the desire of the people of 
panama for democracy by conducting a fraudulent election he 
has now escalated this to include violence against opposition 
leaders including mr endara 
endara was injured when police broke up an opposition 
demonstration wednesday 
fitzwater said bush tried to call endara in the hospital where 
he appeared before reporters in a wheelchair but could not reach 
him 
bush received a firsthand account on the deteriorating 
situation in panama from the us ambassador there in a late 
afternoon phone call fitzwater said 
he said reported harassment of us servicemen was one of 
the topics of discussion 
the president also contacted the leadership of other countries 
with interests in the region fitzwater said those 
conversations related to latin american unity in facing the blatant 
attempts at intimidation now being conducted by the noriega 
regime 
this action underscores that general noriega does not have the 
interests of the panamanian people at heart fitzwater said 
he declined to say how the united states might respond 
bush discussed the situation at the white house in a hastily 
called afternoon meeting of his national security advisers 
a senior official speaking on condition he not be identified by 
name told reporters the administration didnt want to signal what 
actions might be taken or when as for possible military action or 
increasing us forces in panama the official said he wouldnt 
comment on any military actions but that us forces would be 
prepared to take whatever action might be necessary 
meanwhile the us militarys southern command responding to 
reports of violence in panama city upgraded an alert to a level 
meaning servicemen and their families should limit all movement 
should not go into public areas in panama except for essential 
business 
no other special precautions or troop movements have been 
ordered pentagon officials said 
in panama panamanian defense forces detained three american 
army soldiers for three hours because they were taking pictures in 
the vicinity of a car carrying noriega said mercedes morris a 
spokeswoman for the southern command 
in a separate incident two us military attaches both army 
majors were detained by panamanian defense forces during an 
opposition demonstration according to a us official who declined 
to be identified 
earlier us officials said it was important that the united 
states make a credible demonstration of us resolve following 
sundays national election which bush contended was marked by 
massive irregularities 
but there were significant drawbacks to virtually all the 
proposals designed to bring about quick results according to the 
officials who asked not to be identified 
significant military action or abrogation of the canal treaties 
seemed out of the question the officials said because such 
actions could touch off a wave of antiamericanism throughout the 
hemisphere and encourage sabotage against the panama canal 
in addition either could lead to retaliatory action against 
some of the 50000 americans living in panama 
imposing a trade embargo has major drawbacks the officials 
said because this could deal a devastating blow to the extensive 
us business interests in panama 
one alternative apparently not ruled out was a legal effort to 
seize noriegas foreign assets believed to total in the hundreds 
of millions of dollars 
for the third day in a row the administration accused noriega 
of orchestrating the results in favor of his handpicked candidate 
carlos duque 
having failed to rig the election in advance noriega is now 
doing everything he can to steal it after the fact despite the 
clear message from the people of panama state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said 
in answer to a question during an appearance in philadelphia 
vice president dan quayle declined to discuss what steps the 
administration might take 
the president has all the options he said im not going 
into that the people of panama have spoken noriega ought to 
accept the view of the people we should be patient while the 
president considers the course to take 
there was no support for noriega from any segment of the 
panamanian population he must go quayle said 
peter rodman a national security council aide told a gathering 
in washington that he believes there is reason for hope in panama 
i am encourged by the fact that a major event has just taken 
place and i am not sure it is so easy for noriega to contain it 
rodman said in the end maybe he will contain it but i think an 
unmanageable problem has been created 
with a few exceptions much of the rest of the hemisphere seemed 
content to await future developments in panama before taking a 
stand on the election process 
at the organization of american states us delegate william t 
pryce called on oas nations wednesday to add their voice to the 
international outcry against the noriega regime and what he 
described as its efforts to oppose the will of the panamanian 
people 
the delegates from peru and el salvador criticized panama but 
as one us official put it there was a lot of temporizing by 
other representatives 
mexico in particular sees national elections as an internal 
matter which should not be the subject of international criticism 
a number of countries will be holding elections over the next 
year in latin america and some delegates believe silence on the 
panamanian election now could spare their governments criticism if 
their election processes do not go smoothly the official said

six righttolife senators signed a letter to 
president bush on wednesday expressing their continued opposition 
to health secretary louis sullivans choice of an oklahoma state 
official for a top agency job 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who drafted the letter said a 
meeting last week attended by a half dozen senators sullivan and 
his candidate robert fulton did little to allay his concerns that 
fulton does not share their righttolife views on matters 
involving handicapped infants 
it would be just inappropriate for mr fulton to serve in a 
high position at hhs humphrey said in an interview tuesday 
he declined to release the letter but his spokesman said that 
in addition to humphrey it was signed by sens william armstrong 
rcolo dan coats rind phil gramm rtexas jesse helms 
rnc and steve symms ridaho 
when informed of the letter fulton said im disappointed i 
havent been able to reassure them and im still very interested in 
the job and hope i can be endorsed by the president 
sullivan has been pushing the white house to name the oklahoma 
secretary of social services as head of the family services 
administration at hhs which manages the governments major welfare 
programs 
fulton however is opposed by righttolife groups who 
criticise him for failing to act when as director of the state 
human services department he became aware of an alleged state 
hospital policy to withhold lifesaving care from babies with the 
crippling deformity spina bifida before fulton became director 24 
spina bifida babies denied surgery at the hospital died in a 
fiveyear period ending in 1983 
fulton fends off the criticism by saying that shortly after he 
took office and became aware of the deaths he put into effect new 
federal regulations requiring medical treatment for all infants 
unless the treatment would be futile or would shorten the babys 
life 
he said that while he served in the top two health offices in 
oklahoma only one spina bifida infant died and that child died of 
complications from multiple birth defects 
sullivan ran afoul of righttolife advocates after he was 
nominated for the hhs job when twice he reportedly made prochoice 
comments about abortion each time he responded to prolife critics 
by saying he shared president bushs opposition to abortion 
fulton has been actively supported for the hhs post by oklahoma 
gov henry bellmon said white house personnel chief chase 
untermeyer 
but untermeyer said that no decision has been made while fulton 
remains a candidate he said on something this controversial 
wed be looking at a broad range of candidates

coal miner steve hamilton did something 
wednesday that most other workers only dream about he confronted 
the chairman of his company and told him why hes out on strike 
paul w douglas chairman and chief executive officer of the 
pittson co listened patiently as hamilton addressed shareholders 
at the companys annual meeting before responding in a calm voice 
the human needs and values of our employees are very much on 
our minds douglas said he said pittston needs concessions from 
1700 striking miners in virginia and west virgina so pittston can 
modernize and become more flexible 
hamilton a 27yearold heavy equipment operator from 
castlewood va refused to accept the explanation 
you want us to say we will work seven days a week we cant go 
to church because we have to observe our jobs he said there 
are several issues that you are trying to sugarcoat its a whole 
lot more than youre willing to say 
douglas shrugged off the criticism saying its a question of 
proper communication 
the dialogue ended in a standoff but both sides later claimed 
victory on three proxy issues submitted to the shareholders by the 
united mine workers and opposed by management 
hamilton was one of a few miners and union leaders allowed to 
attend the annual meeting in a cramped thirdfloor lunchroom at 
pittston headquarters the session lasted more than three hours as 
labor and mangement argued about pittstons corporate goals as well 
as strike issues 
about 200 other miners and their supporters rallied outside the 
building despite a steady downpour the rally was noisy and the 
voices of the chanting crowd could be heard during the annual 
meeting but no arrests were made 
violence has marked the strike since it began april 5 more than 
1300 coal miners and their spouses have been arrested in virginia 
and west virginia since the walkout began with 140 of those people 
charged with felonies 
the unions main effort was concentrated on the meeting where 
leaders pushed for the acceptance of three proposals questioning 
the operation of pittston the national union and umw local 950 
through their pittston independent shareholders committeee own 
1721 shares of pittston stock enabling the miners to include 
items on the proxy ballot 
kenneth zinn the unions director of special projects said a 
goal of the three proxy issues was to return the company to good 
corporate governance 
douglas told shareholders the proposals were nothing more than 
an attempt by the union to enhance its contract negotiations 
the first proposal asked that shareholders be allowed to vote on 
the antitakeover or poison pill measures adopted by 
management the second proposal called for secret ballots during 
annual meetings and the third asked to establish a committee to 
study the possible sale of subsidiaries 
union leaders said after the meeting that the vote was close 
but they believed they had won a majority of the companys 38 
million shares douglas agreed that the vote was close but said 
no votes would tally just over 50 percent on the first 
proposal well over 50 percent on the second and 80 percent on the 
final proposal 
the results of the vote wont be known until june 12 when 
auditors are to report at a special meeting

monroe hit a woman in the face with a bible was dismissed wednesday 
after prosecutors said she was a fan whod harassed him for four 
years 
wanda huff 51 obtained the misdemeanor assault and battery 
warrant may 1 saying monroe struck her with the book after she 
asked him to swear on it that he wasnt seeing other women 
after the incident at monroes farm in goodlettsvile northwest 
of nashville mrs huff said she was the 77yearold grand ole opry 
stars girlfriend but prosecutors said she was just a fan 
mrs huff denied making harassing phone calls 
i know this warrant has been an embarrassment to you sumner 
county general sessions judge jane wheatcraft told monroe 
im so happy the grayhaired grammy award winner said 
outside the courtroom its been difficult with people bothering 
me im glad its over 
when mrs huff arrived wednesday for the hearing sumner county 
sheriff richard sutton confiscated a loaded 25caliber pistol from 
her pickup truck 
monroe lawyer bob ingrum said he requested the search because 
mrs huff said several times she had received word someone waited 
to kill monroe 
prosecutors recommended the charge be dropped after talking to 
several witnesses who said mrs huff often using aliases called 
monroes home and office up to 15 times a day 
before the may 1 incident that led to the charge mrs huff 
called the farm to warn workers she was coming to see monroe to 
retrieve some gifts she gave him assistant district attorney dee 
gay said 
ingrum said mrs huff wanted to take back some blue jeans a tie 
tack a hatband and 27 for garden seeds she had given monroe 
she threw the britches in the yard the hatband in the mule 
yard and the 27 in mr monroes face ingrum said we never 
did find the tie tack and she threw her glasses on top of the 
roof 
monroe called goodlettsville police to throw mrs huff off his 
farm gay said she asked them to arrest monroe but they refused 
to file charges against him 
mrs huff went to a magistrate who issued the assault warrant 
monroe was arrested may 2 and released on 500 bond 
ingrum obtained a temporary restraining order wednesday 
instructing mrs huff to stay away from monroe mrs huff agreed to 
comply gay said 
grand ole opry security officer james lewis said the harassing 
phone calls began in later 1984 or early 1985 when mrs huff called 
him at the opry and said she had gotten a call from someone who 
threatened monroes life 
lewis said he talked with mrs huff five or six times since and 
each time she mentioned death threats 
monroe best known for the song blue moon of kentucky said 
he didnt like publicity about the incident but my good friends 
and fans know it was wrong 
a tearful mrs huff denied making the harassing phone calls 
you can pay people to tell all kind of lies she said as she 
left the parking lot 
ive been deceived ive been betrayed i got beat up she

the sniper who fired an assault rifle into 
downtown boston from a small airplane thwarted five different law 
enforcement agencies with instant communications stateoftheart 
helicopters and sophisticated radar 
murder suspect alfred hunter was captured early wednesday when 
he landed a stolen plane at logan international airport after a 
threehour flight just five minutes before the cessna would have 
run out of fuel 
jet helicopters owned by state police could easily have 
overtaken the cessna if officials had decided to use them said 
trooper david f morrill 
why risk a helicopter chasing an armed person in an 
airplane morrill asked all a helicopter is going to be able 
to do is follow him we did that anyway with the radar if you get 
up there and engage in a shooting match all you do is endanger 
other people 
state police the federal aviation administration the 
massachusetts port authority which operates logan airport 
emergency response crews and three local police departments were 
responded to hunters threehour escapade 
airports all over massachusetts and southern new hampshire were 
alerted 
like the feat of mathias rust the 19yearold west german who 
flew through elaborate soviet border security in a singleengine 
cessna and buzzed red square before landing there hunters buzzing 
the control tower at logan airport and swooping under the tobin 
bridge stunned law enforcement officials 
longtime law enforcment officials said they had never seen 
anything like it 
we could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was 
going to land said logan airport spokesman phil orlandella we 
could only have made things worse by going up and chasing him 
what if you shoot the guy down and he crashes into a house or 
something said morrill noting that for much of the time hunter 
was flying low over heavily populated areas it just isnt 
feasible you basically have to hope he runs out of fuel 
faa officials tracking hunter from logans control tower twice 
had to scramble out of their perch because the cessna came so close 
they feared it would crash into the tower 
we have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic 
control but theres nothing in there about what to do if a maniac 
comes shooting an ak47 at you in the control tower said john 
leyden an faa spokesman in washington

scientific research worldwide 
four construction workers and a firefighter were injured in the 
midday fire at jackson laboratory the worlds leading nonprofit 
supplier of genetically identical mice used in research on cancer 
aids diabetes and other human diseases 
the labs directordesignee kenneth paigen said the fire would 
not retard the jackson laboratorys research because mice used in 
its own experiments already had been transferred to the research 
building 
what it will set back is the research efforts of scientists 
all over the world who depend on the lab for specially bred mice 
he said 
we managed to save what are called the foundation stocks 
the original genetically defined strains paigen said it will 
take us time but we will be able to reproduce what was there 
the fire broke out about 115 pm in the onestory brickfaced 
morrell park building where the mice are bred and housed in a room 
that was undergoing renovation fire officials said 
bar harbor fire chief royal higgins said a sealant being used by 
the construction workers apparently acted as an accelerant in the 
fire but what ignited it i dont know 
he said several propane tanks had exploded but he was not 
suggesting that it caused the fire 
most of the mice were earmarked for shipment to researchers 
throughout the world said barbara trevett the laboratorys 
spokeswoman she said the building was destroyed along with the 
mice housed in its 18 storage rooms 
the facility stocks 1700 different strains of mice some of 
which are produced only at the jackson lab 
each year the laboratory ships about 3 million mice to 
scientists around the world sales of the mice generate 10 million 
a year which is plowed back into research and other programs at 
the laboratory trevett said 
she said the labs the major customers include the national 
institutes of health harvard mit and other universities doing 
research on mammalian genetics and major hospitals with research 
centers 
lab officials said about 230 employees worked in or in 
connection with the animal production building the campuslike 
laboratory complex beside acadia national park employs more than 
500 people 
one injured construction worker was transferred in stable 
condition to maine medical centers burn unit in portland but the 
extent of his injuries was unknown officials said 
jeanne dulong director of nursing at mount desert island 
hospital said three other workers were admitted with nonextensive 
firstand seconddegree burns and would probably be released in a 
day or two 
the firefighter whose name ms dulong could not release was 
being treated for minor smoke inhalation and would probably be 
quickly released she said 
in 1947 a forest fire that swept across mount desert island 
destroying the laboratory that was founded 18 years earlier with 
financing from wealthy summer residents rebuilt after the fire 
the lab grew rapidly to become the worlds largest center for the 
study of mammalian genetics 
earl green a former director of the laboratory said it would 
take six to eight generations of mice or about two or three years 
to replace the destroyed animals

a grain elevator besieged by a 
demolition crew is making one of the most stubborn last stands 
since the alamo but some say the problem isnt tough concrete 
its a curse 
people whove climbed secretly to the top of the 110foothigh 
silos and looked across a moonlit fort worth say the curse has 
struck a number of times including the fatal stabbing last year of 
a japanese tourist 
theyve found several dead dogs and cats by it said charles 
shields 25 who works near the 1902 structure just west of 
downtown 
i dont believe in curses said jerry vann whose chicago 
demolition company has spent 39 days trying to knock the elevator 
down with more than 500 dynamite blasts all i know is its 
costing me money 
vann took the job for a flat fee expecting to finish the job in 
eight or nine days so far hes 9000 in the hole and expects to 
stay at least through saturday at a cost of 1000 or so a day 
ive got my reputation he said ive knocked down 
buildings worldwide but this is like nothing ive ever seen 
twentytwo of the 17footwide silos are gone but 23 remain 
lined three deep in a honeycomb pattern alongside the remaining 
silos is the 190foottall main building 
among those working for vann is tony cruson 37 who grew up in 
fort worth and heard rumors the elevator was haunted 
around halloween the big deal for boys was to bring girls out 
here and try to get in good with them by protecting them he 
said 
james ferrar 33 who has climbed the tower secretly a number of 
times said he believes its haunted and has heard chilling screams 
several times 
one of his friends making a night climb by lantern light in the 
late 1970s fell and broke both arms he said cruson and others 
have heard the story 
the unidentified man told others he was climbing a circular 
staircase in the main building reached the top but then the 
staircase seemed to extend itself as he kept climbing someone 
from above reached out and pushed him ferrar said 
for 30 years i wanted to go up and see the top of this 
silo cruson said but when you get up there the wind whistles 
through it and you hear all kinds of noises its eerie really 
eerie 
fort worth police homicide lt tommy swan said the only 
reallife horror he can associate with the elevator is the stabbing 
of japanese tourist fumika okada who was lured to her death 
i grew up in fort worth and i never heard about anything 
satanic about that place swan said but of course i never 
heard about marijuana until i was 21 either and that doesnt mean 
it wasnt there 
developer james toal who hopes to build an office and 
residential complex on the site along with a major hotel said 
hed never heard the elevator was haunted theres people killed 
all over the place he pointed out 
toal says there are plenty of rumors flying as the silos make 
their last stand but one rumor workmen say they cant discuss in 
detail is true a local production crew is making a movie at the 
site the story of an entity trapped in the elevator as it is being 
destroyed

an engineer inspired by the flight of 
hummingbirds hovered 40 feet in the air wednesday in a saucerlike 
craft he said will revolutionize commuter travel 
paul moller said his brief noisy flight over a crowd of 
windblown reporters was to demonstrate the technology his company 
is developing to build a flying car for the 21st century 
at some point in time it will be used for that moller 
said you know the automobile is still good for that short 
distance but here to san francisco here to reno here to la 
youre going to see something like this will be in common usage 
its going to take off very rapidly once the credibility is 
established 
a former professor and founder of the aeronautics program at the 
university of california davis moller has spent nearly 30 years 
developing whats known in the field as a vertical takeoff and 
landing or vtol aircraft 
his company moller international in a davis research park 
about 80 miles northeast of san francisco is working on robotic 
aircraft for reconnaissance use by the military as well as 
commuter vehicles 
moller 51 calls his machines volantors referring to 
quick nimble flight like that of the hummingbird that awed him 
since he was a 6yearold child 
the 10foot wide round blue craft he flew wednesday the 
m200x hung in the air for about three minutes and made a slow spin 
before landing in virtually the same spot where it took off 
but its visual grace was accompanied with the deafening roar of 
eight unmuffled snowmobile engines and a vortex of wind that pushed 
it off the ground slashed the grass below and tumbled camera bags 
and the contents of a purse across the lawn 
moller wore a fireretardant racing suit and a motorcycle 
helmet his machine was tethered by a thin cable to a construction 
crane for insurance and safety reasons but once unleashed he 
said it would go as high as im willing to let it go 
while the m200x looks like a vehicle for george jetson of 
cartoon fame a another model that moller said his company will 
produce and begin testing later this year is fit for james bond 
sleek and bubbletopped it looks like a cross between a jet 
fighter and the batmobile 
moller said his m400 will be able to carry four passengers at 
speeds up to 403 mph as high as 31000 feet and as far as 850 
miles before refueling on lowoctane gasoline at a cruising speed 
of 220 mph he said its fuel efficiency would be about 15 miles 
per gallon 
like the saucer craft the m400 will be powered by eight 
gasoline rotary engines built with technology acquired from a 
company that used them in snowmobiles mollar said he chose rotary 
engines for their power light weight and relatively low cost 
the engines power fans that drive air down for takeoff and 
hovering then a series of vanes and ducts redirect thrust for 
horizontal flight computers and gyroscopes control the vehicles 
pitch and roll 
moller said the m400 could be ready for sale to the public 
within five to 10 years he estimated the price for initial 
handbuilt models would be about the same as a helicopter or 
airplane then would drop to 20000 or 30000 once mass produced 
jack allison the companys marketing director said onboard 
computers could navigate the crafts using satellites to determine 
their location and avoid collisions 
eventually well have electronic highways in the sky created 
so that this type of vehicle can carry commuters in substantial 
numbers and do so without any danger whatsoever to commercial 
aviation and other general aviation allison said

nine states have reached a 315000 
settlement with campbell soup co which agreed to change certain 
healthrelated advertising practices the wisconsin attorney 
general said wednesday 
don hanaway said the attorneys general of the states contended 
that campbells ads made high fiber claims about certain soup 
products which were not high in fiber calcium source claims about 
soups which alone are not a good source of calcium and generally 
mischaracterized the health effects of campbells soup products 
for example hanaway said campbell misrepresented the calcium 
content of its tomato cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups 
by claiming in its advertisements that one serving of these soups 
provides 10 percent of your daily requirement when in fact the 
calcium is not in the soup but in the milk that the soup can 
optionally be prepared with 
hanaway said campbell also falsely implied that its bean and 
pea soups can prevent some kinds of cancer by not sufficiently 
stressing in the advertisements that only a diet high in fiber and 
low in fat has been proven to help reduce colorectal cancer and not 
other types of cancer 
campbell issued a statement saying it was not admitting 
wrongdoing in reaching the agreement on the ads which have not 
appeared since early 1988 
the company said it chose not to fight the matter in court 
because of what it described as peripheral nature of the dispute 
and because of the drain on campbell resources that would result 
from pursuing the matter in each of the nine states 
wisconsin worked with attorneys general of california illinois 
iowa massachusetts minnesota missouri new york and texas in 
reaching the settlement hanaway said 
hanaway said the agreement requires campbell of camden nj 
to pay each state 35000 in costs 
the agreement does not affect a complaint filed against campbell 
in january by the federal trade commission which accused the 
company of overstating the health benefits of its chicken noodle 
soup 
campbell advertisments misled consumers by failing to alert them 
of the soups sodium content the federal agency charged 
campbell halted the advertising campaign challenged by the nine 
states a year ago but campbell spokesman james h moran said the 
company plans to fight the ftc complaint 
were standing by the ad and were going to court and prove 
our case said moran 
campbell which sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year 
garnering about 65 percent of the 22 billion retail soup market 
in the united states has come under heavy criticism from the 
center for science in the public interest 
since 1983 the washingtonbased consumer interest group has 
twice asked the ftc to review campbells advertising and sodium 
content claims 
the amount of sodium and salt in the soups is a serious 
concern said charles mitchell a staff attorney for science in 
the public interest most of their soups are so high in sodium 
that the increased risk of high blood pressure from the soups might 
outweigh any other positive benefits that are or are not in the 
soups

the progovernment teachers union and its 
dissident wing reached an agreement on wages and union corruption 
wednesday night ending a 3weekold strike 
the national education workers federation agreed with the 
dissident democratic coordinate to accept a government offer of a 
25 percent increase in wages and benefits and to adopt 
anticorruption measures inside the union a union official said on 
condition of anonymity 
about 8000 teachers voted wednesday night and approved the 
agreement overwhelmingly the official said he did not have a vote 
count and did not say why so few voted 
there is agreement between both factions to end the strike 
the official said classes will be open tomorrow thursday 
the education department also said it would replace the 
superintendents in all 14 of the nations districts it said the 
move was designed to increase efficiency but gave no details 
the democratic coordinate which claims the loyalty of about 
half the federations 11 million members struck april 17 to 
demand a 100 percent increase in pay and democratic reforms within 
the union 
the strike closed roughly half of the nations grammar and high 
schools and vocational institutes 
the teachers whose takehome pay averaged 147 a month 
rejected a first government offer of a 15 percent increase the 
government later raised it to 25 percent effective may 15 
the strike also led to the ouster of carlos jonguitud barrios 
an oldstyle machine politician close to the governing 
institutional revolutionary party 
jonguitud and a group of corrupt cronies had controlled the 
union for 17 years 
union dissidents accused jonguitud of mismanaging union funds 
and keeping his group in power by forbidding rankandfile 
assemblies and rigging union elections 
jonguituds replacement by elba esther gordillo a moderate 
loyal to the ruling party removed a major stumbling block in the 
negotiations between the two sides coordinate leader teodoro 
palomino refused to talk with jonguitud but said he could deal with 
gordillo 
the two sides also agreed to set up a bilateral commission to 
negotiate wage increases for about 300000 school janitors and 
nonteaching staff by july 15

a distraught man who allegedly had just killed his 
exwife commandeered a small plane and held the city hostage for 
three hours early wednesday firing a semiautomatic weapon while 
flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings 
we could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was 
going to land airport spokesman phil orlandella said we could 
only have made things worse by going up and chasing him 
traffic controllers at logan international airport said the 
pilot buzzed them repeatedly forcing officials to close the 
airport for an hour and reroute several latenight flights 
controllers fled the tower twice 
we have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic 
control but theres nothing in there about what to do if a maniac 
comes shooting an ak47 at you in the control tower said john 
leyden a spokesman for the federal aviation administration in 
washington 
we didnt know if he was on drugs drunk or if he was 
suicidal said orlandella of the massachusetts port authority 
which operates logan we had not one word of radio contact 
throughout the whole flight 
alfred j hunter 42 pleaded innocent wednesday in salem to one 
count each of murder and armed robbery after a midnight flight that 
reportedly included a dip beneath a harbor bridge essex county 
district judge john t doyle ordered hunter held without bail at 
bridgewater state hospital for 20 days of psychiatric observation 
hunter made no comments when he was captured police said 
bullets struck a variety of targets including parked cars and 
the prudential towers 50thfloor skywalk 
one pedestrian was struck by ejected casings from the spent 
rounds 
faa field manager richard fontz said hunter was not a licensed 
pilot but had apparently had some instruction from his father 
it obviously wasnt the first time he flew an airplane 
fontz said 
hunter also repeatedly buzzed the post office where he worked 
fontz said the diving he was doing among the buildings and under 
the bridge was something 
the sniper flight began at 1020 pm tuesday and for the next 
three hours ambulance services tried to anticipate where the pilot 
might land so they could prepare for possible injuries 
police in boston received more than 200 calls from people 
reporting the sound of gunfire in suburban lynn police said two 
cars were hit by a shower of shots believed fired from the 
zigzagging plane 
andrew smith said he was walking along fashionable newbury 
street in the citys back bay section when he heard popping noises 
from the sky 
about two seconds later several shell casings landed all 
around at that point i realized that the guy was shooting out of 
his plane said smith who notified police nobody believed me 
at first i didnt believe it at first 
trooper barbara bennett said officials decided to wait until the 
gunman ran out of fuel rather than send up a state police 
helicopter if the plane had been shot at she said it could have 
endangered the public 
hunter landed briefly at logan at 1257 am but took off again 
he landed again 17 minutes later and was captured after a minor 
scuffle bennett said 
two shell casings and two live shells were found in the 
twoseater cessna which had about five minutes of fuel left 
police found no weapon and said it probably was discarded during 
the flight they also said there was no way to tell how many shots 
were fired 
the ammunition was like that used in a semiautomatic assault 
rifle such as an ak47 said state police cpl joseph howley he 
said it would not be possible to determine te type of weapon used 
from the ammunition alone 
earlier tuesday hunter a mail handler was given one years 
probation for assaulting his 26yearold exwife elvira in 
december 1988 in an argument triggered when he ordered her not to 
change a television channel 
hunter was convicted of assault and battery making threats and 
violating a restraining order his wife sought in january 1988 the 
couple divorced in may 1988 
hunters only previous criminal conviction stemmed from a 1979 
incident in which he pleaded guilty to assaulting a group of people 
with a machete he told the court they tried to rob him and was 
sentenced to a years probation 
police said they believe that on tuesday night hunter went to 
his exwifes home and shot her in front of their 5yearold son 
before launching his aerial attack 
hunter then commandeered a car and demanded and got a plane at 
the small municipal airport straddling the beverlydanvers border 
about 20 miles north of boston 
it was the last thing i was expecting i was basically in 
shock said robert golder 21 a flight instructor he wanted 
me to start the airplane for him he told me not to do anything 
stupid he said he had just killed some people

the nations largest ecumenical organization 
the national council of churches is struggling to overcome an 
operational and financial crisis and to widen its work for 
christian unity 
a proposed charter for that purpose was issued last week by a 
special action committee of 15 after six months of work and 35 
regional consultations around the country 
the committees report to be considered by the councils 
governing board of 265 denominational representatives may 1619 in 
lexington ky calls for a reformation of the councils structure 
and functioning 
the changes will help our council be a viable entity in the 
times in which we live says united methodist bishop melvin g 
talbert of san francisco chairman of the reorganization committee 
the council includes most of the nations mainline protestant 
and eastern orthodox churches with memberships totaling 42 million 
among other things the plan provides for expanded involvement 
with roman catholics and evangelical bodies as well as 
streamlining the council itself into a trimmer framework 
it would fuse a complex looseknit array of 11 operational 
units into three program units on unity and relationships 
witness and service nuture and discipleship christian education 
each unit including denominational representatives would have a 
greater role in its own decisionmaking programming and staffing 
thereby reducing centralized direction 
this has been a source of recent friction and turmoil in the 
39yearold council 
critical problems have too often been papered over rather than 
named examined and resolved says the committee attributing 
them to changed situations in the churches and in american culture 
neither the council nor even the entire christian community 
enjoy or expect the privileged status and moral authority they once 
took for granted when the council was formed in 1950 the report 
says 
it says that not only is religion more pluralistic but it and 
the nation are pummeled by racism sexism secularism nationalism 
and expanding technologies and communications engulfing local 
communities 
describing the councils trouble as a crisis built upon 
multiple crises that are interactive and cumulative the report 
identifies three major areas of conflict over authority 
accountability and leadership 
the conflicts emerged as the council sought to move from a 
cooperative agency of churches working together to a 
community of christian communions acting in common faith and 
mission as one in christ 
some of the operational units particularly the huge relief arm 
church world service clashed with central leadership headed by the 
rev arie r brouwer and also with the governing board 
without a structure which was correlated to the new vision 
conflict inevitably arose resulting in lack of trust and 
hampering the council from working together fruitfully the 
report says 
brouwer says the new design aims to deal with the problems 
consolidating units and giving them greater rein in determining 
priorities but with accountability to an executive coordinating 
committee 
the plan also calls for an annual conference of communions 
bringing representatives of all the participating churches into 
mutual deliberations and for a wider ecumenical forum every four 
years 
it would seek involvement of nonmember churches such as roman 
catholics and southern baptists which already participate in 
several council functions as well as various evangelical bodies 
the council has a special sixmember committee working on closer 
links with roman catholicism and in that cause a 12member council 
delegation in april visited pope john paul ii and other vatican 
officials it was the first such visit in 20 years 
the talks give us hope for deepening levels of conversation 
and community in progress toward full communion in christ 
the group said afterward 
the council president the rev patricia mcclurg a presbyterian 
minister said controversial issues such as ordination of women 
were not discussed but we share the same faith and if we draw 
closer to christ we draw closer to one another 
roman catholic archbishop j francis stafford of denver head of 
the us bishops ecumenical committee who accompanied the council 
delegation called the affair an enriching exchange

despite a more grownup role as cowboy newt 
in the acclaimed cbs miniseries lonesome dove rick schroder is 
still struggling with a transition from his child star status to 
adult roles 
so its hard said schroder a lot of people say it can 
never be done successfuly natalie wood did it maybe a few other 
actors 
schroder was 8 when he made his film debut in 1979 opposite jon 
voight in a remake of the champ then spent five years playing 
a rich kid in the comedy series silver spoons 
on sunday in the cbs movie out on the edge he plays a 
troubled teenager who is sent against his will to an institution 
making the transition is not easy he said in fact its 
pretty hard but its getting easier with each new role everything 
since silver spoons has been a role thats helped me grow up im 
being taken more seriously for adult roles i dont want to be 30 
and still playing highschool kids 
schroder has been passed over for a few roles that went to older 
actors 
i went up for a role in a movie with robert de niro called 
the freshman he said the script calls for a 19yearold 
which is my age they cast matthew broderick hes got to be 30 i 
said thats not fair and its not realistic 
hed also wanted the lead role in gore vidals billy the kid 
on turner network television it went to the older val kilmer 
mention the names of child stars such as elizabeth taylor and 
mickey rooney who went on to adult careers in show business and 
schroder says im talking about actors those are celebrities 
in the cbs movie schroder plays danny evetts 17 who is 
committed to a behavioral treatment center when his divorced mother 
is unable to control him 
the movie also stars maya lebenzon as a young patient who 
befriends danny mary kay place as dannys mother richard jenkins 
as his father and dakin matthews as the hospital administrator 
this is a good role for me because i get to be bad said 
schroder i usually play such angelic roles in this one im 
really messed up dannys a good guy hes not a jerk or nothing 
but hes got problems he doesnt know how to deal with he starts 
to hurt himself and those around him 
schroder has let his blond hair grow long and has grown a wispy 
beard for an expected role as a basketball player and cocaine 
addict he also had to lose 20 pounds 
the end of lonesome dove looked like a good jumpingoff 
place for a story about newt and that apparently wasnt lost on 
schroder he said that on a recent visit to new york he talked to 
cbs officials about doing a sequel to lonesome dove no story 
has been drawn up but it probably would include woodrow call 
tommy lee jones finally owning up to the fact that he is newts 
father 
schroder said hes also writing a cbs schoolbreak special about 
two young people who fall in love the boy has a severe case of 
acne and the girl was burned in a fire they help heal each other 
emotionally he hopes to direct it 
ive never had a directing credit but ive directed before 
he said you direct scenes youre in sometimes you work with a 
director you dont think is good or you dont like you do your own 
thing 
schroder began acting in new york and appeared in more than 45 
commercials before the champ 
talk about your life changing overnight he said it all 
happened so quickly my sister had also done some commercials and 
i was following in her footsteps shes now studying to become a 
screenwriter at the university of southern california id like to 
take some courses too but i dont want take out time to go to

in one sense this small native fishing 
village was spared although the tanker exxon valdez hemorrhaged 
more than 10 million gallons of crude just 5 miles from their cove 
local folks have seen little of the oil in their waters 
in another sense theyre not so fortunate its probably 
still going to get us says village president gary kompkoff 
right now most of us would be out collecting salmon spawn 
he said but that has been canceled were not sure if were 
going to be able to fish at all this year ninetyeight percent of 
the annual income of the village is fishing 
tatitlek settled in the late 1800s on the northern shore of 
prince william sound has 95 residents all but 10 are aleut 
indians and many are russian orthodox typical of this part of 
alaska 
tatitlek fishermen have caught salmon in prince william sound 
for decades but since the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef 
on march 24 the familiar cycle of village life has been disrupted 
right now were just trying to understand what this will mean 
for us long term said kompkoff 
the lucrative herring season has already been canceled 
in the nearby fishing town of cordova loss of the herring catch 
will cost 12 million but cordova fisherman are making up some of 
the loss with income from working booms for exxon gathering 
remnants of the spill in their boats 
few of tatitleks fishermen have been offered such work 
says kompkoff weve gone from fear to anger to apprehension 
over this thing its going to be with us for a long time to come

as the villain manuel antonio noriega is 
perfectly cast he even sounds like a dictator his pockmarked 
cheeks his shouted speeches his belligerent manner all mark the 
strong man of panama as the obvious bad guy 
furthermore by the measures known to american political 
leaders many of his own countrymen hate his guts he also is 
predictable everybody said he would steal sundays panamanian 
elections and the evidence is that he did so 
with traits like that he ought to be an ideal adversary 
but he also has been a survivor our policy remains that 
noriega must go white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said tuesday 
but the policy prior to that one involved a secret partnership 
with the panamanian general against nicaraguas marxistrun 
government 
that may be one of the reasons that he is a survivor the united 
states has been trying to bring him down since 1987 with 
negotiations political opposition threats economic sanctions and 
criminal charges all of them withstood 
as head of the panamanian defense forces noriegas power is 
solidly rooted in the military unfortunately for 1989 
policymakers before beginning the effort to get rid of him the 
us government tried to use him 
the reagan administrations nicaragua fixation led to 
collaboration with noriega the governments statement of facts at 
the oliver north trial told of an offer from the panamanian boss in 
late august 1986 
noriegas representative proposed that in exchange for a 
promise from the us government to help clean up noriegas image 
and a commitment to lift the us government ban on military sales 
to the panamanian defense forces noriega would assassinate the 
sandinista leadrship for the us government 
north said that would be illegal noriegas man replied that the 
panamanian could help in other ways as when he had helped blow up 
a sandinista arsenal in 1985 
according to the court papers vice adm john m poindexter 
then the white house national security adviser said that if 
noriega had assets inside nicaragua he could be helpful the 
us government could not be involved in assassination but 
panamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story 
in september 1986 north said noriega wanted to meet him in 
london poindexter and secretary of state george shultz both 
approved that meeting north returned to report that noriega 
would try to take immediate actions against the sandinistas 
 
that cozy relationship lends an ironic flavor to warnings in 
congress that if noriega got away with stealing an election the 
sandinistas would have scant incentive to deliver on their promise 
of free elections in nicaragua early next year 
the era of us collaboration with noriega withstood initial 
accusations that he was involved in drug trafficking however the 
reagan administration was trying to get rid of him before federal 
grand juries in florida returned drugdealing indictments against 
him in early 1988 
sen john f kerry dmass calls panama an example of what the 
drug trade does to democracy what is clear from the panamanian 
experience is that drug enforcement took a back seat to perceived 
foreign policy concerns he said last week 
bush and a unanimous 100 senators declared in advance of the 
sunday voting that the united states would not tolerate a rigged 
election and would respond accordingly they also declared in 
advance that noriegas candidate could not win anything but a 
rigged election 
the question now is what will work two years of gradually 
escalating sanctions have battered the panamanian economy without 
dislodging noriega the white house says no option including the 
use of military force now is foreclosed 
the preferred option of course would be for the panamanians to 
get rid of him themselves rising up to insist on the leadership 
they are said to have chosen with their burned ballots 
bush is urging noriega to step aside because of the verdict of 
his countrymen should it require a heavier push from the outside 
the united states needs to have it come from other latin american 
capitals not only from washington 
noriega long ago mastered the political art of rallying 
supporters and even some skeptics by claiming yankee interference 
in panama even nicaraguas daniel ortega turned up in panama city 
in june 1987 to express support for noriega against us pressure 
to get him out 
that was less than a year after noriega was said to have sent 
north the secret offer to assassinate the sandinista leadership

will a fleet of foreign container ships sidle up 
to docks in major us ports some dark day in the future and 
proceed to load aboard all the assets foreigners have purchased 
only in a nightmare could it happen but that image symbolizes 
the horror that americans often feel that foreigners eager to own 
american investments are buying us out of house home and country 
it isnt quite so even though the united states is in a 
negative position in regard to international investments with 
foreigners investing roughly 370 billion more in this country than 
americans invest abroad 
and yes it is true that if foreigners en masse buy or sell 
american assets they could indeed disrupt segments of the american 
economy raising or lowering prices precipitously 
but some assurances are in order 
1 foreigners can only load financial paper not physical 
assets onto those imaginary ships but why should they by cashing 
in their chips they would be foresaking investments in the worlds 
biggest single marketplace 
2 some of the big figures that are tossed about arent for 
many practical purposes what they seem to be 
when for example j paul getty left the united states for 
residence in britain he caused a big drop in the officialy reported 
us investment position but getty took not a dime with him when 
he relocated 
that latter example is used by robert brown tax foundation 
president to make a point the negative investment position of the 
united states may be no reason to cheer but it is no reason to 
grind teeth either 
brown points out that while foreign investment in the united 
states exceeds 15 trillion the united states is no slouch in 
foreign investments with total us assets abroad amounting to 
around 12 trillion 
that he suggests is what the global economy is all about and 
that to suggest a perfect balance of investments is unrealistic 
foreigners invest in the united states he says because it is a 
desirable place in which to invest he points to a strong economy 
stable politics dynamic private sector and a labor force that can 
produce with the best 
why shouldnt they want to invest in such a market 
still he suggests that isnt the reason why foreigners invest 
more here than we do there the real reason he says is that us 
tax policy discourages americans from saving that is investing 
in their own country 
what this country needs in order to correct the imbalance of 
investments says brown are incentives for savings and investments 
and a tax policy that aids rather than damages the competitive 
position of us companies 
in that respect he places himself among a growing list of 
critics of us taxing practice which penalizes those who risk 
capital imposes taxes on those who save and provides tax breaks 
for being in debt 
change the tax situation he suggests and americans might 
recognize what foreigners see in the us economy a superior 
investment opportunity

the cost of plastic is rising again 
tracking the trend in interest rates many financial 
institutions have been boosting the rates or fees on standard 
credit cards for the first time in several months some are 
shrinking or scrapping grace periods 
the rate rise began late last year but has been particularly 
noticeable lately with some of the nations largest banks and 
thrifts announcing changes 
as of june 1 for instance two of the largest bank credit card 
issuers chase manhattan bank and manufacturers hanover trust co 
plan to raise rates on some types of mastercard and visa cards 
chases rate will go to 198 percent from 175 percent on 
standard cards the first increase in about two years 
manufacturers hanover will hike some standard card rates to 198 
percent from 178 percent for the first time since october 1985 
john c pollock iii editor and publisher of iselin njbased 
bank credit card observer said the majority of the 200 banks his 
publication regularly surveys has raised card rates since january 
the average rate among those institutions now stands at 1778 
percent he said up from 1761 percent just three months ago the 
prime stands at 115 percent 
financial institutions have defended the high rates as necessary 
to cover costs and fraud theyve also called the move a reaction 
to higher interest rates initiated by the federal reserve to 
restrain inflation 
creditcard using consumers themselves have been cutting into 
bank profits by paying the full balance at the end of the month in 
increasing numbers about 40 percent in 1988 vs 37 percent in 1987 
with credit cards theres a high degree of administration cost 
as opposed to your plain vanilla loan said chase spokesman ken 
mills there are literally hundreds of small transactions as 
cards are used 
elgie holstein director of bankcard holders of america a 
consumer group based in herndon va said he doesnt dispute that 
but says the spread between banks cost of funds and what they 
charge credit card customers is excessive 
it costs banks about 7 percent for money theyre lending out 
at 18 to 20 percent he said 
consumers can shop for better deals by doing some homework and 
the government will make it easier aug 31 
thats when a new law takes full effect forcing all card issuers 
to supply complete credit terms such as the interest rates fees 
and grace periods on applications and solicitations they 
previously had been permitted to delay the release of such 
information until the card was issued 
consumer groups are hoping the disclosure law will make credit 
card rates historically high compared with other loan rates 
more competitive especially if banks and thrifts must advertise 
them 
those who tend to carry over their balances should shop for the 
lowest rates while those who pay them promptly are better off 
seeking institutions offering no or low annual fees 
many americans arent aware that you can easily go out of 
state to find the best deal said robert k heady editor of bank 
rate monitor a north palm beach fla publication that tracks 
conventional credit card rates nationwide 
bank rate monitor bank credit card observer and bankcard 
holders of america are among organizations that provide lists of 
best deals in credit cards for a fee 
bank rate monitor said the lowest rate for those carrying 
balances is at arkansas federal savings bank in little rock ark 
which had an 1188 percent annual rate as of may 3 
ncnb offered one of the best allround deals with no annual fee 
and a 1390 percent variable rate bank rate monitor said 
others with no fees it said included amalgamated trust and 
savings bank in chicago dauphin deposit bank amp trust in 
harrisburg pa security bank amp trust in southgate mich and 
beverly bank in chicago 
consumers also should scrutinize credit card fees which have 
been creeping up and grace periods or the time before lenders 
charge interest on unpaid bills grace periods range from 0 to 30 
days 
experts say in recent months some institutions have eliminated 
or trimmed grace periods in some cases the grace period was 
revised to begin after a purchase is made instead of when a bill is 
sent 
by the time you receive your bill you may be subject to an 
interest charge pollock said

pedro rodriguez fondly remembers the fun he 
had as a kid watching mexican plays and feature films at the 
guadalupe theater which in its heyday during the 1940s and 50s 
served as the anchor for mexican art and entertainment in the city 
today rodriguez still has fun as executive director of the 
guadalupe cultural arts center a nonprofit organization that not 
only runs the restored 410seat theater but sponsors literary 
theatrical musical dance painting and visual arts workshops and 
shows to preserve mexican culture 
with grants from the city and federal governments and 
corporations the center already has the nations largest 
curriculum devoted to development and preservation of mexican 
cultural arts and operates on a 1 million annual budget 
were it not for the fact that the mexican culture itself is 
very strong here the cultural arts would not have survived but it 
just barely did and i think the creation of this institution is 
very timely said rodriguez a former university professor who 
took over the guadalupe cultural arts center in 1983 a year after 
it was formed 
now we have hundreds of artists yearly that we support 
directly through contracts and through the training that we provide 
for about 900 students per year and the art and cultural events 
throughout the community 
but the center hopes to preserve more than just cultural arts 
it also hopes to improve the areas social and economic environment 
the center and the avenida guadalupe development association a 
nonprofit economic development agency are transforming a 
threeblock area around the guadalupe theater from a dilapidated 
barrio dominated by bars and shacks to a medical retail and 
entertainment showplace that will serve one of the citys oldest 
hispanic neighborhoods 
i think all this construction and all the changes are going to 
help everyone here said 48yearold roger mercado a lifelong 
resident of the guadalupe area i think all the art coming out of 
here also will help us communicate with the rest of the community 
the guadalupe theater opened in the 1939 served as host for 
hundreds of spanishlanguage plays and movie premieres until it 
fell into disrepair in the early 70s in 1979 performing and 
visual arts groups banded together to better secure funding for 
hispanic arts by 1982 the group was known as the guadalupe 
cultural arts center a year later the city provided 1 million 
for renovation of the guadalupe theater which by then was being 
used as a flea market 
rodriguez said the centers 17member staff has had to use all 
types of marketing techniques to attract not only those in the 
neighborhood but many nonhispanics who are weary of traveling to 
an area surrounded by housing projects 
there is a certain image about coming to this side of town 
that we have to get people past and that was that it was not safe 
to come over here but thats not true once they get over here we 
know we have them hooked and i think everyone in the community is 
pretty proud of what is happening here rodriquez said 
the guadalupe theater now holds art exhibitions in its foyer 
gallery brings in foreign and artistic films and is home to the 
san antonio cinefestival a hispanic film festival in its 13th 
year its other major event is the tejano conjunto festival a 
fourday event now in its eighth year which will bring in hundreds 
of artists and thousands of spectators to hear accordianplaying 
musicians 
the theater also is home to the theatre arts program which 
produces up to four bilingual plays a year through its resident 
company los actores de san antonio the actors of san antonio 
the centers visual arts program annually sponsors about nine 
exhibits with emphasis on hispanic and native american artists in 
the summer it provides a free weekly outdoor film festival in 
guadalupe plaza 
the centers literature program offers poetry and fiction 
readings and annually sponsors a bookfair this years major 
presenters are pulitzer prize winner alice walker the color 
purple and mexican poet octavio paz 
classes for adults and children are offered in all the various 
arts programs at the center and 15 other locations across the city 
we work out of very makeshift kinds of situations the only 
thing that we do have that is firstrate is the theater but 
everything else that we do we do on a shoestring and in poor 
conditions rodriguez said 
but our vision centers around the creation of an institution 
that will be anchored in bedrock here to stay forever to provide 
services so the mexican arts culture continues to subsist and 
flourish 
there are plans for a 50000squarefoot classroom and office 
building next to the theater rodriquez also envisions use of the 
former progreso theater across the street from the guadalupe as a 
rehearsal and reception hall 
those developments would add to area renovations by the 
development association which built guadalupe plaza and plans to 
open a 48stall mexican market later this spring a private drug 
store and medical complex already are operating next to the plaza 
the avenida guadalupe development association has spent 75 
million in the past decade renovating three city blocks surrounding 
the guadalupe theater 
this neighborhood was one of the pride and joys of san 
antonio but because of demographic and social changes it began to 
deteriorate in the 1960s and 70s said david garza executive 
director of the development agency 
we are just trying to revitalize the area and change the 
conditions of the neighorhood to attract the businesses and the 
families or otherwise we are going to see this neighborhood die 
away garza said

whenever lee williams sees a school bus he 
thinks of his wife and daughters and of one gnawing question that 
remains for him a year after their deaths shattered his life how 
do you put it back together 
joy williams 10yearold robin and 14yearold kristen were 
among the 24 children and three adults killed a year ago sunday 
when an allegedly drunken driver slammed into the bus carrying 67 
people home from a church outing 
before you put something back together you have to have 
pieces he has no pieces said the rev w don tennison whose 
radcliff first assembly of god church sponsored the trip to an 
amusement park 
the crash the nations worst alcoholrelated highway accident 
also raised questions about school bus safety and treatment of 
drunken drivers the acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board called it one of the most influential highway 
accidents the board had ever considered 
recommendations have been made to get some older buses off the 
road the bus involved a 1977 model was manufactured before 
federal regulations on some safety matters took effect such as 
protective cages around gas tanks 
emergency pushout windows have been added to school buses in 
kentucky after it was revealed that the emergency exit in the back 
of the bus was partly blocked by seats and hard to use because of a 
narrow aisle 
because the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation 
recommendations also have been made to use less flammable less 
toxic materials in bus seats 
a state school bus safety task force apparently will recommend 
testing all fuel for buses as the debate over fuel explosiveness 
continues 
stricter drunken driving laws have been endorsed by gov wallace 
wilkinson though the general assembly has shown reluctance to get 
too tough 
the laws not fair here the laws not right said williams 
he notes that kentucky law allows the vehicle of a deer poacher to 
be seized no such provision is allowed for drunken drivers 
wheres the value 
larry w mahoney of rural owen county was driving the pickup 
police say on the wrong side of interstate 71 his blood alcohol 
level two hours after the accident was 024 legal intoxication in 
kentucky is 010 
mahoney was indicted on 27 counts of murder 13 of assault 44 
of wanton endangerment and one of driving under the influence 
second offense he pleaded innocent and could be given 27 life 
sentences plus 480 years if he is convicted on all counts at his 
trial in november meanwhile he is free on bond 
for williams that raises another question can you promise me 
tonight this guy wont drink and drive 
its drunken driving that continues to prompt the most 
discussion and activity in this town near fort knox its made 
the judges not only in our area but in the whole county more aware 
of the need to tighten up on the law and enforce it more 
strictly said mayor joseph hutcherson 
students against drunken driving chapters are active at radcliff 
middle school and north hardin high school linda probus a 
counselor hired to help students cope with the tragedy said 
drinking and driving is no longer acceptable behavior among the 
students 
residents take time to pull off the road to report suspected 
drunken drivers said police officer greg mayfield 
on the anniversary of the crash radcliff is holding a memorial 
expected to draw hundreds of people 
many of those touched by the crash have mixed emotions about the 
ceremony 
i think the community not to forget the families is ready to 
put the accident to rest said dick booher whose son jason 
escaped from the bus 
we want to be left alone we want to try to put our lives back 
together said williams a career soldier who spends much of his 
offduty time speaking publicly about the dangers of drunken 
driving 
but another reminder of the tragedy will come nov 8 when 
mahoney goes on trial his role is still a troubling one for many 
involved 
ms probus said many of the students who survived the crash have 
changed their attitudes toward mahoney initially they really 
really wanted mahoney to die as they have come to grips with the 
tragedy they want him punished left in jail but not to be 
killed 
the memorial sunday will mark a milepost in this tragedy but 
will not end it legislators still will debate tougher laws state 
agencies will weigh the benefits of additional training for school 
bus drivers against the cost drunken drivers still will kill 
innocent victims 
first sgt lee williams still will think of his family when he 
sees a bus and he will continue to warn people of the danger 
i give these speeches for the robins and the kristens who 
havent been killed i give these speeches for the husbands and the 
wives who havent been hurt

these are the days of the anonymous 
nocturnal bullet of the slashing of throats of village officials 
of the disappearance of union leaders 
so wrote cesar hilderbrandt in a column recently in si magazine 
in a passage that epitomizes the desperation of todays peru a 
nation struggline with economic chaos and a savage leftist 
insurgency that threatens to explode into civil war 
from cab drivers to congressmen peruvians are asking themselves 
what went wrong in their andean country which had one of south 
americas strongest economies until the 1960s 
more than 14000 people have been killed in the nineyear

inflation hit a record 1722 percent in 1988 and is widely 
projected to soar above 10000 percent this year pushing wages and 
salaries down to baresurvival levels the economy shrank 9 percent 
in 1988 and is likely to contract even more this year 
the collapse is putting hundreds of thousands of people out of 
work in the continents third largest country and one of its 
poorest in 1976 peru produced 34000 automobiles this year it is 
expected to assemble at the most 3500 few people can afford 
them 
although many peruvians blame president alan garcia for the 
chaos most independent analysts say the economic crisis had been 
building toward an eruption for the past several decades garcias 
populist freespending policies lit the fuse 
highway bandits have begun waylaying buses and automobiles 
making travel outside lima dangerous and adding to the sense of a 
disintegrating nation where law and order has broken down 
many peruvians now speak of the civil war that is coming 
seeing it as inevitable 
there is a very real danger that peru without realizing it 
is sinking deeper into the swamps of fratricidal war the 
magazine oiga commented in a recent editorial 
surveys indicate most people have little faith that solutions 
will be found 
garcia a dynamic young leader was elected in 1985 as the 
president of hope but his defiant stance against paying the 
foreign debt now 19 billion cut peru off from international aid 
and his uncontrolled spending bankrupted the country critics say 
these days angry crowds shout alan you charlatan when he 
speeds by in heavily armed convoys 
in recent months lima has been hit by waves of coup rumors and 
many peruvians doubt the presidential election scheduled for april 
1990 will take place leftist military officers seized power in 
1968 constitutional government was restored in 1980 
former mayor alfonso barrantes of lima a marxist is one of the 
favorites in the campaign the other frontrunner is the writer 
mario vargas llosa leader of a centerright coalition 
peruvians frequently mention the opening passage in vargas 
llosas 1974 novel conversation in the cathedral saying it 
succinctly reflects their feelings now 
from the doorway of la cronica santiago looks at the avenida 
tacna without love cars uneven and faded buildings the gaudy 
skeletons of posters floating in the mist the gray midday at what 
precise moment had peru screwed itself up 
one who saw things that way was morty weisselberg 41 a 
secondgeneration peruvian who had a highpaying job as the 
manager of a small metallurgical company he packed up and left a 
few months ago for canada with his wife and two small daughters 
before he left he explained why 
what worries me is the kind of future i am going to leave my 
children the future that this country offers is very different 
from the one 30 years ago when i was in the position of my 
children then there was a bright future for the country at least 
apparently 
the weisselbergs were among 150000 peruvians most of them 
professionals and skilled workers who bought oneway tickets out 
the country in 1988 the largest exodus in perus history

many blame perus economic decline on several decades of 
government mismanagement controls that have stifled private 
enterprise and strident nationalism that has frightened away 
foreign investors and isolated peru from world financial centers 
more than anything weisselberg said before he left he was 
frightened by what he saw as the countrys deep class divisions and 
its growing violence 
political analysts agree with him that perus social and racial 
divisions inherited from the spanish colonial era have spawned 
class hatred that threatens to rip apart the fabric of peruvian 
society 
the scorn and discrimination shown by perus white elite toward 
the darkskinned indian and mestizo majority has generated deep 
resentment among perus poor say social scientists 
political violence in peru is not the result of poverty alone 
but of humiliation oppression class hatred racism said sen 
enrique bernales head of a blueribbon senate panel on violence 
for many peruvian and foreign political experts peru now stands 
at a critical point in its 165year history where an antiquated 
inequitable and inefficient politial structure is crumbling 
for me the shining path is nothing more than the violent 
natural expression of this social explosion said luis lumbreras 
one of perus most important archaeologists if it had not been 
shining path sooner or later there would have been another group 
lumbreras is from ayacucho the impoverished highland province 
where the maoistinspired guerrillas launched their insurgency in 
1980 after 10 years of organizing among quechuaspeaking indians 
in the countryside 
peru covers an area larger than texas new mexico and arizona 
combined and has a population of 21 million but just as it is 
divided by class and race it is sharrply divided by its geography 
into three regions the andean sierra the coastal deserts and the 
amazon rain forest that feel little in common with one another 
in the 1950s highland peasants began to crowd into lima the 
capital looking for a better life and the migration has 
accelerated in recent years as the countryside has turned into a 
battlefield 
with the shining path insurgency and the forced integration of 
lima and other coastal cities perus white class has begun to feel 
challenged for the first time 
once the royal capital of the spanish empire in south america 
lima is surrounded by the bleakest shantytowns on the continent 
home to two thirds of the citys 7 million inhabitants 
limas rich increasingly insecure live behind high walls in 
suburbs to which entry is controlled by gates and armed guards 
the economic collapse regarded as the worst in perus history 
has hit the middle class and the poor the hardest 
the purchasing power of salaries has plummeted by at least 50 
percent in the last year a doctor at a public hospital earns the 
equivalent of 80 a month a public school teacher earns 55 the 
value of an army generals salary has fallen from 1100 a month in 
1980 to 200 today

doctors have found a new way to augment their 
income the sale of prescription drugs but the trend has raised 
the issue of conflict of interest with some questioning the 
propriety of doctors profiting from drugs they prescribe in the 
third article in a continuing series the business of medicine 
science writer daniel q haney and national writer fred bayles 
report on the debate over doctors selling drugs the next story in 
the series will look at the growing business that supplies the 
drugs to the doctors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when family doctors pull out their 
prescription pads they often have a new question for patients do 
you pay for your own medicine 
if they do says dr john garofalo i tell them you can 
purchase your medications here 
doctors are going into the drug business while these physicians 
contend it is good for patients others believe this venture is a 
clear conflict of interest for it can give physicians a financial 
reason to write unnecessary prescriptions 
accurate figures are elusive but experts estimate that perhaps 
8 percent of the 330000 officebased physicians have miniature 
pharmacies on hand 
the business is fast and simple the doctor reaches into a 
cabinet pulls out a singleprescription bottle of antibiotics or 
decongestant fills out the label and sells the medicine on the 
spot usually for about the same price as the neighborhood 
drugstore 
not everyone can buy from their doctors many insurers dont pay 
for physiciansold drugs and most doctors dont accept insurance 
cards but if patients pay their own pill bills they almost always 
buy from their doctors 
those who branch into this new sideline find it easy to justify 
the patient likes the convenience and the doctor can often clear 
10000 or more a year with little extra work 
we dont sniff at the profit said dr edward saltzman but 
its not the path to riches 
while his 12member pediatrics group in suburban miami clears 
70000 to 80000 a year on medicines saltzman views drug sales 
primarily as a marketing tool to build patient loyalty its 
another way of bonding them to us he said 
in most of the country doctors can routinely sell medicine with 
minimal regulation only seven states arkansas massachusetts 
montana nebraska oklahoma texas and utah make it difficult or 
impossible 
the doctors buy their pills from wholesalers called repackagers 
this industry in existence barely a decade puts medicines in 
patientsize bottles and supplies them to doctors along with 
suggested price lists peeloff labels and charts for easy 
recordkeeping 
some are concerned this venture could erode medicines ethical 
underpinnings they worry that doctors might write prescriptions to 
get the 3 profit they make on each one not because sick people 
need them while most doctors undoubtedly are honest the ethicists 
fear physician dispensing as its called will undermine patients 
faith in their doctors 
what matters is whether there is a potential conflict of 
interest and whether this is perceived by patients and therefore 
undermines trust said daniel wikler a university of wisconsin 
bioethicist 
those who dislike the practice cite several potential abuses 
doctors might prescribe only the 20 or 30 medications they keep 
in their offices even though these may not be the best ones in 
particular situations 
patients might feel pressured to buy medicine from their 
doctors for fear of offending them 
doctors might concentrate on drugs with the highest profit 
margins or prescribe unnecessarily to make more money 
at least some doctors do bend to such enticements in the last 
three years about 15 states have taken disciplinary action against 
doctors for dispensing abuses according to a recent survey by the 
inspector generals office of the us department of health and 
human services among the most common problems was overprescribing 
while dispensing doctors say they would never compromise their 
integrity they do agree they view dispensing as one element of a 
more important question economic survival they are squeezed on 
one side by cutrate fees from medicare and medicaid on the other 
by competition from health maintenance organizations and other 
doctors 
with the way things are going especially in primary care we 
have to keep trying to think of more and more ways to make a 
dollar said garofalo a 35yearold family practitioner here in 
maines capital 
garofalo started filling presriptions three years ago two of 
the other three family practices in the city have followed his lead 
now garofalo and two associates net 5000 to 10000 a year on 
medicines while this might be small potatoes to a heart surgeon 
doctors on the front lines of primary care are less grandly paid 
in maine for instance family practitioners average 54000 a year 
you cant survive in medicine these days if you dont let the 
business part influence some of what you do said garofalo 
physicians are not distributed evenly throughout the country or 
across specialties and many places have too many doctors there 
simply are not enough patients to go around so to some doctors 
selling medicine is a tactic that sets them apart from the 
competition so they can attract and hold patients 
its a good service for the patient said dr norman 
glanzman a family practitioner in carmel ind people often come 
in coughing and feeling ill the last thing they want to do is wait 
around at a drugstore 
but dr norman fost head of the ethics committee of the 
american academy of pediatrics believes it is wrong for doctors to 
sell medicines for profit because this may influence their 
prescribing habits 
as it says in the bible where your treasure is there your 
heart will be he said 
several major doctor organizations including fosts 
pediatricians and the american academy of family physicians have 
official policies that uphold physicians right to dispense 
the american medical associations council on ethical and 
judicial affairs came out against regular dispensing because of its 
appearance of impropriety but the amas house of delegates 
later voted in favor of physicians right to dispense drugs when 
it is in the best interest of the patient 
we make countless decisions regarding how long a patient stays 
in the hospital whether he comes back for a revisit how often to 
do laboratory studies said dr daniel w shea a green bay 
wis pediatrician i think that for the practicing physician 
life is one continuum of conflict of interest but you must put the 
the best interest of the patient first 
despite such sentiment and support from various medical 
associations individual doctors such as family practitioner dudley 
phillips of darlington md find the trend unappealing ive 
always felt i might get too interested in selling drugs and not 
taking care of people he said 
and pediatrician william bartholome of the university of kansas 
said any patient walking out of a doctors office with five bottles 
of medicine should ask himself 
are these the drugs i needed or were these the drugs that had 
the best profit margin and that the doc just happened to have on 
hand did i need all five of them or did i get them because my 
doctor needs a new car

a heavy debt load antitrust laws and 
possible labor conflict could be sticking points for 
financiallytroubled pan am corp if it decides to bid for the 
muchlarger nwa inc the parent of northwest airlines and the 
target of several other suitors 
pan am backed by prudentialbache securities inc and an 
investment group including members of texas bass family said 
tuesday it would consider making a buyout offer for nwa 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett told a washington news 
conference that prudentialbache and the airlie group ltd were 
considering providing significant new equity for pan am to make an 
acquisition possible he did not provide any details 
nwa said that pan am the parent of pan american world airways 
stated in a letter that if it made a formal proposal it likely 
would be an allcash offer 
pan ams announcement was in response to nwas general request 
for buyout proposals plaskett said nwa made the request afte 
rejecting oil billionaire marvin davis unsolicited 90ashare or 
27 billion buyout offer 
another potential buyer for nwa is an investment group headed by 
los angeles investor al checchi 
pan ams limited contact with northwest has been cordial and 
friendly plaskett said 
plaskett said in february that pan am with nearly 1 billion in 
debts would need to find a merger partner or otherwise attract new 
investment in order to survive the new yorkbased company lost 
1511 million in the first three months of 1989 727 million in 
all of 1988 and 2653 million in 1987 
by contrast nwa based in eagan minn reported firstquarter 
earnings of 126 million or 43 cents a share and is one of the 
countrys most profitable airlines 
a marriage of pan am and northwest would create one of the 
worlds farthestranging airlines joining pan ams strong atlantic 
and latin american routes with northwests pacific routes to the 
orient 
but some analysts doubted that pan am the eighthlargest us 
carrier could successfully bid for no 4 northwest reaction on 
wall street was cool with pan am stock rising 62 cents a share to 
5 on the new york stock exchange and nwa falling 50 cents to 
10425 a share 
kurt rivard an airline analyst for dain bosworth inc in 
minneapolis said a merger of the two was plausible but it could 
be the kind of highly leveraged deal that northwests pilots and 
machinists have said they would resist 
the machinists have said they are interested in making their own 
bid for northwest the pilots have an open contract and pose a 
strike threat 
the company pan am has a working capital deficiency said 
mike hamilton of piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in minneapolis 
thats not the kind of situation that labor nor nwa managment is 
eager to move into 
there also could be labor turbulence at pan am 
william genoese head of the teamsters local representing 5300 
pan am cargo passenger service workers and stock clerks said his 
union could disrupt a possible bid by threatening to strike and 
scaring away pan ams financial backers the union is trying to 
negotiate a new contract 
were the only ones who can strike pan am right now genoese 
said wall street wont give them money with an open contract 
said plaskett we would expect employees of both companies to 
be a very important part in our evaluation of whether or not to 
proceed 
charles rule a washington dc lawyer who formerly was in 
charge of the antitrust division at the us justice department 
said there is a chance the department would reject a northwestpan 
am merger proposal on the grounds that it would weaken domestic 
competition in the industry 
but he said chances for approval would be increased if the two 
carriers can prove their routes do not overlap 
i wouldnt want to speculate as to what the conclusion is 
going to be rule said 
nwa said pan am had shown previous buyout interest but had not 
signed a confidentiality agreement that nwa has required of all 
suitors seeking nonpublic financial information nwa chairman 
steven rothmeier said northwests board would consider pan ams 
request for information 
pan am will make an offer or back out by the june 2 deadline nwa 
has set for offers plaskett said 
hamilton the piper jaffray analyst said a bid by pan am could 
possibly be intended to lure nwa into a takeover of pan am 
if i had to speculate in either direction it would be that pan 
am is trying to get themselves into play hamilton said pan am 
has been looking for a merger partner for a while 
but plaskett said he has no hidden agenda 
what we think we bring to this transaction is something that a 
pure financial investor cannot bring the opportunity for revenue 
and growth for financial and cost synergies plaskett said 
the combined carriers serve a total of 290 cities worldwide with 
virtually no overlap only eight duplicated routes between the two 
carriers and no duplicated international route authority

as a deadline for bids for strikebound eastern 
airlines approached one prospective buyer trans world airlines 
inc took itself out of the running at least for the time being 
twa said in a statement tuesday it needed more time to discuss 
with its unions the feasibility of integrating the two carriers 
workforces and thus was not prepared to submit a formal bid for 
eastern at this time 
takeover strategist carl c icahn the owner and chairman of 
twa has held numerous discussions with officials of easterns 
unions and was widely expected to make a bid for the miamibased 
airline 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has set a deadline of 5 
pm edt today for all interested bidders to submit offers for 
eastern or its lucrative northeast shuttle service 
eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from its creditors 
since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists union 
strike that was supported by pilots and flight attendants the sale 
of the airline or any of its parts must be approved by the 
bankruptcy court 
although twa said it would not bid for the entire airline it 
reiterated it might submit an offer for easterns airport hub in 
philadelphia and said it might from time to time express an 
interest in other assets of eastern 
however the airline said unless and until twas unions agree 
twa will not be able to make a bid for eastern 
the issue of integrating the two unions and determining 
seniority rankings has been an issue in discussions between icahn 
and easterns unions according to sources close to the situation 
it is an especially sore point for the eastern pilots for whom 
seniority is a more crucial issue than their fellow machinists or 
flight attendants the sources said 
partly for that reason the eastern pilots union has appeared to 
favor billionaire hotel mogul jay pritzker who already has 
submitted a formal bid for eastern 
we believe that the viable offers will come to the table by 
tomorrow afternoon said dan ashby a spokesman in new york for 
the air line pilots association 
other potential bidders include a group led by former airline 
executive william howard and investment firm prudentialbache 
securities inc and another consortium led by joseph ritchie a 
prominent chicago commodities trader 
developer donald trump has agreed to buy easterns profitable 
shuttle service for 365 million but the deal still awaits the 
courts approval america west airlines last week offered 726 
million for the shuttle routes and landing slots along with 10 
boeing 757 jetliners 
eastern management insists the airline is not for sale and is 
proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise 
18 billion by selling aircraft and other assets 
twas announcement reinforces easterns contention that there 
are no bona fide bidders for the airline said art kent a 
spokesman in houston for easterns parent texas air corp 
icahn could be holding back on the assumption that no serious 
offers will be made and he could then pounce on eastern suggested 
some sources who asked not to be identified by name 
others suggested he made the announcement tuesday rather than 
today the deadline day to put pressure on the unions to reach 
agreement with him and allow time for him to change his mind about 
a bid 
some observers expect icahn to bid for nwa inc the parent of 
northwest airlines which is the target of several takeover 
suitors pan am corp announced tuesday it is considering an offer 
for the much larger nwa 
twa general counsel mark buckstein acknowledged the possibility 
that twas unions might reach an accord with the airline in the 
near future and twa might then seek an opportunity to bid 
after the judges deadline however twa would not submit a bid by 
the deadline buckstein told the associated press 
in a separate development tuesday eastern and the american 
society of travel agents agreed on a proposed plan to reimburse 
travel agents for cash refunds on eastern tickets given to 
customers before march 10 the plan must also be approved by the 
bankruptcy court

viacom inc charging that time inc and its 
cable television units are monopolizing paytv has filed a 24 
billion antitrust lawsuit seeking to loosen times grip on the 
cable industry 
viacom parent of the showtime cable television channel filed 
its suit against time and its home box office and other cable tv 
divisions in us district court in manhattan 
viacom charged time and its tv holdings are monopolizing 
conspiring to monopolize and attempting to restrain trade 
practices prohibited by the federal sherman and clayton antitrust 
acts 
the suit contended the violations entitle viacom to recover 
three times the actual monetary damage done to it an amount placed 
at 800 million after trebling the amount sought in damages is 
24 billion 
time blasted viacoms suit as baseless 
many of the allegations rehash issues that have been 
periodically raised for more than a decade stated time one of 
the worlds largest entertainment and publishing conglomerates 
on several occasions the justice department has reviewed many if 
not all of these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no 
action was warranted 
viacom alleged that time and its home box office inc american 
television and communications corp and manhattan cable television 
inc are engaging in an integrated series of predatory and 
exclusionary acts and strategies designed to increase the costs of 
their rivals raise barriers to entry and expansion and otherwise 
entrench themselves as monopolists by anticompetitive conduct 
injuring the competitive process and ultimately consumers the 
suit said 
among the numerous complaints listed viacom said hbo abuses its 
position as the dominant firm in the business of providing pay tv 
programming services 
hbo holds about 65 percent of the nationwide market for these 
services a market share three times larger than its closest rival 
the suit said 
these programming services are competing for access to national 
and local markets hbos dominance allows it to undercut 
competitions prices to such an extent that competitors never 
obtain a large enough subscriber base to survive viacom alleged 
viacom also asked the court to bar time and its pay tv operators 
from further allegedly anticompetitive behavior 
time vice president for corporate communications louis j 
slovinsky said viacoms showtime unit actually engages in some of 
the practices that it has criticized hbo about in the suit for 
instance both hbo and showtime have negotiated exclusive contracts 
with studios for films according to slovinsky 
also he said time is puzzled why viacom has decided to launch 
the legal salvo at this point 
this is the kind of suit they could have brought any time in 
the past 10 years why are they doing it now slovinsky said 
he noted that the issues specified in the suit have been 
examined thoroughly most recently they were addressed when the 
government reviewed the antitrust implications of the proposed 18 
billion merger between time and warner communications inc he said 
a completed merger would make time warner the worlds largest 
media concern with projected annual revenue of 10 billion and in 
all likelihood increase the combined companys clout in every field 
in which it operates 
viacom said that more than a year was spent preparing the legal 
action against time indicating it was not prompted by the 
timewarner merger announcement in march 
slovinsky said time will contest the many charges viacom has 
leveled and he predicted vindication 
this is a suit that includes the kitchen sink and the coffee 
grounds he said

shareholders of texaco inc have approved a new 
poison pill to protect the oil company from unwanted takeover 
attempts 
the poison pill also known as a shareholder rights plan was 
one of several companybacked measures approved tuesday at the 
texaco annual meeting three proposals opposed by the texaco board 
two urging the company to curtail its operations in south africa 
and one to make proxy votes confidential were rejected 
a shareholder vote on a poison pill is rare but texaco agreed 
to the vote after shareholders handed the company a victory in a 
proxy fight a year ago with takeover strategist carl icahn 
the pill had been a point of contention between texaco and 
icahn its largest stockholder until they settled their 
differences aside in late january 
the antitakeover plan entitles stockholders to buy additional 
shares of common stock at a considerable discount within 10 days of 
the announcement that a suitor had acquired 20 percent or more of 
texaco common stock without meeting certain conditions 
the plans intent is to dilute the value of the suitors 
interest and increase the cost of making the offer 
the texaco plan however would not be triggered if an offer for 
the company was considered by the board of directors to be a bona 
fide fully financed allcash offer and meets other conditions 
the takeover offer also would have to give the board reasonable 
time to explore other opportunities 
the plan was approved tuesday by 842 percent of the shares 
voting said texaco spokeswoman anita larsen texaco has 250 
million shares of common stock outstanding 
other proposals approved by shareholders included two special 
dividends worth about 2 billion an employee compensation plan 
tied to performance the hiring of a new auditor and the election 
of five directors 
the meeting tuesday marked the first time officials of the white 
plains nybased company faced the shareholders since texaco 
launched its postbankruptcy restructuring 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company asked a federal 
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from claims by its 
creditors the move followed a 103 billion judgment won against 
texaco by pennzoil co which charged texaco with blocking 
pennzoils plans to acquire getty oil co 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and launched 
a restructuring program that included the projected sale of more 
than 5 billion in operating assets in february the company 
completed the sale of texaco canada inc to imperial oil ltd for 
324 billion 
after several years of some very special challenges a new 
texaco has emerged a company with its own vision for greatness a 
company with its sights set firmly on the future texaco chairman 
alfred c decrane told the shareholders tuesday 
decrane and james w kinnear texacos president and chief 
executive officer served up large helpings of optimism for the 
attentive if lowkey gathering 
the officials said the company is in good financial health and 
is poised to reclaim its position as an industry leader noting the 
recent exxon valdez oil spill in alaska kinnear also stressed that 
texaco is committed to preventing another environmental disaster

americas biggest industry electronics 
still leads japan and the rest of the world but not by much 
japan produced 250 billion worth of electronic goods in 1988 
everything from computer chips to copiers and facsimile machines 
while the united states barely stayed ahead with 2628 billion 
the research firm dataquest inc said tuesday in an annual industry 
analysis and forecast 
as the hightech industry heads into the 1990s it is 
experiencing a shifting balance of power said manny a fernandez 
president of the san josebased firm 
the rapid growth of japan and the rest of asia not only enlarged 
the worlds market for electronics products but reduced american 
and european shares of that market fernandez said 
the move toward a unified european market in 1992 will put 
further pressure on american manufacturers fernandez said 
although he noted that fortress europe is a fear not at 
least yet a fact 
all manufacturers worldwide must take the longer term view and 
make the commitment necessary to be true global players both 
operationally and technologically in europe he said 
the globalization of the electronics marketplace is here to 
stay fernandez said and companies no longer can afford to 
manufacture in just one country and sell everywhere else 
this year we have seen some incredible things take place 
said fernandez who called japans surge toward the top in overall 
electronics production more signficant than its recent dominance of 
the semiconductor industry 
apple computer inc passed international business machines corp 
in unit sales of personal computers in the united states in 1988 
fernandez said but the big news in that arena he said was the 
penetration into the us market of korean and taiwanese computer 
makers 
on a day when apple announced new software and ibm unveiled a 
cheaper personal computer and a portable one dataquest said both 
companies lost us market share in 1988 to foreign vendors whose 
sales grew from 35 percent to 45 percent of the us total 
the personal computer market which grew 27 percent worldwide to 
517 billion and 22 percent in the united states to 287 billion 
will continue to grow impressively in 1989 dataquest said growth 
in the us market will be 25 percent in 1989 and 126 percent 
compounded annually through 1993 the company said 
laptop computers will be the fastest growing part of that 
market said fernandez 
american companies will have to change their marketing 
strategies however to recover lost market share said fernandez 
the era when it was the technology strength of one giant 
company against another those days are pretty much over 
fernandez said it has become a marketing game it has become a 
game of pricing a game of software supply service and 
distribution channels 
apple led us personal computer makers by selling 127 million 
units of its macintosh and apple ii lines in 1988 while ibm sold 
123 million units of all its personal computers said dataquest 
vice president steve j lair 
that trend will reverse in 1989 however according to lair who 
predicts ibm personal computer sales of 148 million units and 
apple sales of 142 million units 
ibm is finally getting its act together said lair who 
cited the companys new products and stronger marketing push 
ibm pulled the plug on its pcat line prematurely and made a 
mistake in focusing on technology instead of marketing over the 
past year or two lair said 
ibm was expecting us industry to respond to technological 
advancement whereas corporate decision makers were really 
interested in productivity lair said 
japanese personal computer makers sold 730000 units in the 
united states while taiwan korea and other asian companies sold 
103 million units european companies accounted for another 
133000 in us sales 
the hottest electronics markets over the next five years will be 
telecommunications which japan already dominates as well as 
software business computer peripherals and workstations said 
dataquest 
the estimated us revenue in the telecommunications market in 
1988 was 1526 billion and is expected to rise to 1595 billion 
in 1989 and 1913 billion by the end of 1993 dataquest said 
among the big winners in that market will be cellular radios 
facsimile machines and data communications equipment fernandez 
said 
fax had a hot year in 1988 and that marketplace grew an 
incredible 78 percent to 18 billion he said no industry is 
going to be capable at the 2 billion level of maintaining that 
kind of growth but fax business is going to grow in 1989 another 
146 percent to 2 billion and then 12 percent every year after 
that through 1993 to a new high of 32 billion 
by the end of this year more than 105 million personal 
computers will be in use around the world creating a huge market 
for addons software and other related items said fernandez 
personal computer software sales totaled 93 billion in north 
america in 1988 and are expected to rise to 107 billion in 1989 
and 193 billion by the end of 1993 
in what dataquest called one of the great boom years for the 
worldwide chip business the overall semiconductor industry grew 
32 percent in 1988 the industry posted 16 billion in sales in 
north america in 1988 and is expected to grow to 183 billion 
this year and 333 billion by the end of 1993 
worldwide chip consumption will grow 153 percent in 1989 
dataquest said workstations also will be a highgrowth area 
taking a bite out of the minicomputer market and putting pressure 
on personal computers said fernandez the proposed merger of 
hewlettpackard co and apollo computer inc announced recently is 
just the beginning of a continuing restructuring of the workstation 
segment of the industry he said

us peanut consumption has jumped 108 
percent since last year proof that good old goobers are becoming 
a posh and fashionable food georgias top peanut official says 
a us department of agriculture report said americans are 
eating 18 percent more peanut butter 72 percent more salted nuts 
and 12 percent more candy bars 
we hope there arent lots of folks out there who arent eating 
peanuts said don koehler executive director of the georgia 
peanut commission but for those who arent eating enough weve 
got a product thats gained a lot of acceptance 
koehler said the usda figures demonstrate the effectiveness of 
the industrys promotional programs the report released on april 
27 compares the first eight months of the peanut marketing year to 
the same period a year earlier 
at that kind of growth rate we could be looking at 85 
million in added sales for producers nationwide koehler said 
to keep pace with increases in consumption and to maintain 
stable prices and supplies the usda increased the national peanut 
quota to 144 million tons this year from 14 million tons last 
year 
koehler is particularly pleased about the 12 percent increase 
in candy consumption 
candy has been kind of flat he said in a recent interview 
it seems we live in a healthconscious society that worries about 
that eating sweets folks are beginning to say wait a minute 
everybody is overkilling food safety food quality and whats 
good to eat once in a while you just like a candy bar 
another reason for the increase in consumption is cost he said 
noting that peanut prices traditionally lag behind the consumer 
price index for food 
you cant buy bologna or hot dogs or any other protein source 
nearly as cheap as you can peanuts he said 
the peanut commission spends more than 1 million annually to 
promote the states top cash crop and cooperates with similar 
groups in florida and alabama in funding the peanut advisory board 
one of the industrys most successful promotional programs has 
been the adultsonly peanut butter club sponsored by the board 
i think we have made it acceptable again for adults to eat 
peanut butter he said its not just kids food any more 
were around 40000 members and they just keep coming in 
this year the commission is focusing on tourists who drive 
through the state the newest official georgia maps at highway 
welcome centers have a picture of a peanut on one side and peanut 
information on the back 
georgia growers who produce nearly half of the nations 
peanuts devoted 688000 acres to the crop last year 
to provide more money for promotion the advisory boards 
headquarters was moved from new york to atlanta where operating 
costs should be about 20 percent less said koehler 
we brought it to the peanut belt he said we felt it was 
a move we needed to make we found we could do an equally effective 
job in atlanta and probably an ever more effective job 
nearly all the peanuts grown in georgia are a type known as 
runners runners account for 801 percent of all the peanuts in 
candy 644 percent of all salted nuts and 757 percent of all 
peanut butter cookies and crackers in addition runners comprise 
865 percent of all peanuts used in peanut butter 
i think people have accepted peanuts as being a good food and 
though theyre reasonably priced we like to think of them as a 
posh invogue food he said we just want people to get out 
there and eat peanuts and know were going to keep growing them 
down here

former gruntal amp co executive robert chestman 
was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading and 
perjury and ordered to pay about 250000 by a judge who wanted 
to send a message to wall street 
his actions corrupted the marketplace said us district 
judge john walker jr ignoring pleas for leniency tuesday from the 
exstockbroker and his attorney 
those who cheat the markets out of greed must pay a price for 
their conduct the judge said 
chestman 41 put his chin on his folded arms and his wife 
susan sobbed as walker passed sentence 
a former gruntal first vice president from the long island 
community of lawrence chestman was convicted march 14 by a federal 
court jury of all counts in a 31count indictment 
walker who could have sentenced chestman to a maximum five 
years in prison on each count and fined him as much as 500000 
also ordered him to pay about 250000 in restitution the final 
amount to be determined by the probation department and the us 
attorneys office 
chestman was convicted of making more than 250000 in illegal 
profits in november 1986 by trading waldbaum inc stock with inside 
information that the new yorkarea supermarket chain was about to 
be sold to rival chain aampp 
according to evidence at trial chestman obtained the nonpublic 
information from one of his clients keith loeb who was related by 
marriage to waldbaum president ira waldbaum loeb avoided 
prosecution by agreeing to testify for the government 
in addition to 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts of 
mail fraud chestman also was convicted of a single perjury count 
for lying to the securities and exchange commission in april 1987 
about his insider dealings with loeb 
noting the perjury conviction walker dismissed defense lawyer 
elkan abramowitzs claim that chestmans illegal activity was one 
single aberrational incident 
this was not a single occurrence this was an ongoing 
situation said walker adding he then compounded his crimes 
by lying to the sec 
abramowitz asked walker to sentence his client to almost 
anything but straight jail time noting that chestman was under 
psychiatric care and was his familys sole support the defense 
lawyer added that chestman not only lost a wellpaying job but 
more importantly hes lost his career 
under the terms of his conviction chestman will be barred 
permanently from the securities industry 
in a choked sniffling voice chestman asked walker to be 
lenient because the agony and the pain that my wife and my 
children and my mother and myself have suffered is unimaginable 
chestman remained free without bail pending appeal

boeing co is close to a revised production 
schedule for the new 747400 jumbojet but will negotiate late 
delivery penalties with at least four customers a company 
executive said 
phil condit boeing commercial airplanes executive vice 
president also predicted tuesday the longrange jetliner would be 
certified for a second engine type next week and for a third next 
month 
with 747400 deliveries initially set to begin late last year 
boeing executives said in october wiring problems would delay 
delivery of the first 20 jets 
a second delay was announced in december when initial 
certification by the federal aviation administration took longer 
than expected 
in january boeing officials spent five days readjusting the 
747 production line at everett north of seattle and again 
examined the production schedule the line went through another 
fiveday readjustment in late march or early april to catch up work 
that had fallen out of sequence said commercial airplanes 
spokeswoman elizabeth reese 
the 747400 which can carry 412 passengers more than 8000 
miles nonstop is an extensively updated version of a model first 
introduced in 1968 the new plane has a computerized cockpit 
designed for a crew of two instead of three is built with advanced 
materials and has a larger wing 
condit and other boeing officials acknowledge they may have been 
overly ambitious in trying to bring out essentially four new 
747400s at once three different engine types plus a combi 
version of the airframe that can carry freight on the upper deck 
in addition they said each airline wants planes customized to 
different needs 
we took on a real task up there at everett in terms of three 
different engine certs a combi 18 customers in the first year 
and we didnt do was well as we would have liked condit said 
were holding very close to the plans that we laid out in 
january he said its not perfect to be honest with you we 
missed by a couple of days but overall im happy with how things 
are going 
boeings latest schedule has been withheld but commercial 
airplanes spokeswoman deane darling said five 747400s have been 
delivered three to northwest airlines and two to singapore 
airlines all powered by pratt amp whitney engines 
approximately a dozen more 747400s have been built and are 
undergoing final preparation before delivery ms reese said 
condit said he expected the plane to be certified with general 
electric engines next week with klm royal dutch airlines and 
lufthansa getting the first two the sixth and seventh off the line 
certification with rollsroyce engines should occur next month 
with cathay pacific and british airways getting the first of those 
models condit said 
the first 747400 combi is to be delivered in early fall to klm 
four 747400s were delivered as of march 31 ms darling said a 
greater number should be delivered in the second quarter but im 
not going to go beyond that at this point condit said 
boeing chairman frank shrontz has said he hopes for production 
of 57 747s this year including other models but added there was 
significant risk in that forecast because more than half those 
planes are scheduled for delivery in the last three months of the 
year 
several airlines including northwest and klm have called for 
compensation for late deliveries 
we have contracts with a whole number of airlines that we have 
not met condit said and so clearly like any good business 
when you dont meet your contract you sit down and reach an 
agreement on how youre going to settle that 
without saying what how the compensation might be made condit 
said boeing would negotiate a settlement with northwest lufthansa 
klm and singapore airlines on an airlinebyairline basis

governor james r thompson and mayor richard m 
daley made what they called a competitive bid to sears roebuck and 
co executives in an effort to keep more than 6000 jobs in chicago 
the two officials met tuesday evening in a closeddoor session 
at sears tower with sears chairman edward a brennan and other 
company executives to discuss the planned relocation of the 
retailers merchandise group 
we are going to be competitive with other cities across the 
country daley said in a press conference with thompson after 
they left the worlds tallest building theyre very aggressive 
other cities and states 
i think some of the states would give their whole state to 
sears just to land it there daley said 
in a major reorganization plan announced last autumn sears said 
it would sell the 110story sears tower and find less costly 
facilities for the merchandise group which operates sears retail 
store and catalog division 
state and city officials since then have pledged to use whatever 
economic incentives are necessary not to lose the retailer whose 
50 billion revenue last year nearly tripled the states 
daley said it would be devastating for chicago if sears 
moved out of the city 
thompson said sears still is considering a number of sites 
both inside and outside the state 
he said illinois was preparing a very aggressive package 
to keep the company in the state and that it would be equally 
applicable whether sears decided to stay in chicago or move to 
another illinois town 
i wanted to assure the chairmanthat if the city of 
chicagos package was one they chose the state would be a very 
aggressive partner with the city thompson said 
thompson and daley declined to give any details of the package 
which is expected to include tax breaks land writedowns 
transportation improvements and other incentives 
daley said there was a number of sites offered reports have 
circulated in the last week that sears was eyeing a site near 
chicagos ohare international airport as well as several suburban 
locations 
i think were highly competitive and we have a good proposal 
by the state and by the city to keep them here daley said 
brennan confirmed the meeting took place but declined to 
comment further on what deadlines sears has for the headquarters 
search brennan and other sears officials are expected to meet the 
media thursday when the retailer holds its annual shareholders 
meeting 
sears officials still maintain that chicago is the best choice 
for a relocation site for the merchandise groups 6700 employees 
although they are also looking outside the area 
thompson called dallas and charlotte nc big tough 
competitors for the sears site 
brennan didnt attend the news conference and the governor and 
mayor declined to say whether the company has given them a deadline 
by which any proposals must be completed 
sears is the states largest employer with a total of almost 
30000 employees

overestimating future sales and the value of its 
assets when it went private led to the demise of fruehauf corp 
which sold the last of its holdings to keep bill collectors at bay 
analysts say 
the ultimate failure of the leveraged buyout attempted by the 
worlds largest maker of truck trailers could foreshadow trouble 
for other companies still trying to pay off debts incurred through 
restructuring analysts said tuesday 
in fruehaufs case the leveraged buyout led to liquidation and 
the end of a 75yearold company once among the top 200 
manufacturing companies in the nation 
the projections on which fruehauf based its leveraged buyout may 
have been fantasy said donald ratajczak director of economic 
forecasting at georgia state university in atlanta 
when youre dealing with the trucking industry projecting 
five years without a downturn is absurd ratajczak said 
fruehauf borrowed 15 billion to restructure itself in 1986 in 
the face of a hostile takeover attempt by investor asher edelman 
the trailer business turned much too slow for them they 
overpaid when they took it private said rolf w wagner an 
analyst with scott amp stringfellow in richmond va 
the sale of fruehaufs kelseyhayes division which produces 
auto and truck wheels will bring in 66 million in cash and 430 
million in notes kelseyhayes is the companys last significant 
asset 
analysts at roney amp co in detroit said it is doubtful fruehauf 
management profited from the liquidation however merrill lynch 
which handled the sale of various fruehauf divisions and 
subsidiaries received a windfall in fees and stock said tony 
viscogliosi a roney analyst who has followed fruehauf for the past 
2 years 
theyve gotten six times their original investment in class a 
shares by selling the company off piecemeal he said 
merrill lynch spokesmen in new york did not return phone for 
comment 
ratajczak said investment companies are calling the shots in the 
leveraged buyout game 
the truth is its being motivated out of downtown manhattan 
theres a network of these firms out there trying to convince 
companies theyre worth more by restructuring after the fees are 
through these guys are out of there he said 
fruehaufs peddling of assets began in 1987 with the sale of its 
fleet of 5000 leased trailers if the sale of kelseyhayes to 
varity of toronto goes through only fruehaufs nameplate on its 
trucks will remain 
also in 1987 fruehauf sold its international and domestic 
trailer rental operations financial subsidiary aerospace unit 
heavyduty auto group 91 percent of its interest in fruehauf of 
canada 60 percent of its european trailer operations 
last year it sold off the balance of its trailer manufacturing 
operations its founding and main business segment and its 
maritime operations which included two ship yards and its heavy 
crane manufacturing and heavy cargo handling equipment 
it was clear that they were selling their businesses to pay 
down their debt to survive viscogliosi said

japans procurement of foreignmade semiconductors 
will fall 2 percent short of the us target of 20 percent of the 
japanese market by 1991 a major japanese economic newspaper said 
wednesday 
the nihon keizai shimbun made the prediction based on annual 
chip consumption by 40 major japanese users in value terms in 1988 
they also looked at the companies own estimates of their chip 
purchases in 1991 
the 40 companies surveyed including electronics autoparts 
precision instrument and other manufacturing firms account for 
about 60 percent of the nations total consumption annually the 
newspaper said it said with the survey it could judge the 
countrys overall marketshare trends 
us officials maintain that under a 1986 usjapan 
semiconductor trade pact japan promised to increase its foreign 
chip market to about 20 percent in 1991 japanese officials say 
there was no such promise 
the share of foreign semiconductor sales in japan stood at 106 
percent in the fourth quarter of 1988 according to figures by the

growing impatience in the united states over trade 
imbalances with japan has created a need for new solutions the 
chief of american express co said wednesday 
the atmosphere in which us trade policy is formulated is 
becoming increasingly difficult pressure is growing especially in 
the congress for new trade strategies to achieve quicker 
results said james d robinson iii who is also chairman of the 
advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations 
old remedies to alter the trade imbalance havent worked 
robinson told reporters at the japan national press club 
american firms disappointed with a lack of progress in 
penetrating japans market also have increased pressure for faster 
results in trade negotiations said robinson american expresss 
chairman and chief executive 
the mood in the business community is changing companies 
are not finding the opportunities they expected so they are 
becoming increasingly active and vocal in criticizing barriers to 
sales in japan robinson said 
while us efforts to reduce trade imbalances with european 
nations through exchange rate manipulations and other methods have 
begun to work the trade deficit with japan remains stubbornly 
high robinson said 
in 1988 the united states posted a 52 billion trade deficit 
with japan down slightly from the 598 billion deficit in 1987 
according to us figures 
japan tops the list of 34 countries that us trade 
representative carla hills in a recent report said have erected 
significant trade barriers against us products if negotiations 
fail to eliminate trade barriers the united states deems unfair 
those nations could become targets for trade sanctions 
adding to pressure for trade action is a popular belief that 
japanese investors are buying up america robinson said many 
amerians see japan as a threat to the united states 
he added the erroneous public perception and related 
emotional backlash clearly must be addressed 
to help ease public concern japanese corporations should avoid 
concentrating their investment in specific areas and should do more 
to demonstrate a sense of corporate responsibility and commitment 
to american communities robinson said 
robinson suggested using businesstobusiness dialogue to tackle 
difficult informal trade barriers such as the wholesale and 
retail distribution system and traditional sourcing patterns 
its time for our two business communities to work together to 
identify practical ways of addressing unsustainable imbalances 
he said 
i believe very strongly that business leadership can 
make a positive contribution to resolving issues before they become 
issues that require action and retaliation he said

congressional critics of the fsx warplane deal 
told a senate panel today that the united states would get the 
worst of the bargain in sharing with japan technology used for 
americas f16 fighter 
the evidence before us is that were really not getting 
anything in return sen alan j dixon dill said in testimony 
before the senate foreign relations committee 
advocates of the fsx agreement which involves coproducing an 
advance version of the f16 have said the united states would gain 
access to japanese composite wing construction and phased array 
radar technologies 
but dixon said a study by the general accounting office an 
investigative arm of congress has found that us companies 
already have such technologies 
sen alfonse damato rny called the arguments on the 
technology flowback from japan total nonsense and a facade to 
cover up the shortcomings of this deal 
the fsx deal was strongly defended at the hearing by a panel of 
senior bush administration officials including commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher 
i am confident that this agreement will not harm the economic 
security interests of the united states mosbacher said 
the comments came on the second day of congresssional hearings 
on the fsx deal 
we will teach the premier japanese aerospace firm how to build 
a worldclass fighter something they cannot do today rep mel 
levine dcalif said at one session tuesday it is a fact that 
enhancing the capabilities of ones competitors will by 
definition decrease ones technological lead 
beyond the issue there is so much wrapped up symbolically 
said sen dan coats rind it is clear to me what the people of 
indiana want they have a deep deep mistrust of the japanese 
the senate foreign relations committee and three house foreign 
affairs subcommittees scheduled additional hearings today 
president bush last month approved a 7 billion agreement under 
which the united states and japan would coproduce an advanced 
version of the f16 fighter 
the agreement calls for the united states to transfer designs 
for the f16 developed by general dynamics to mitsubishi heavy 
industries japans prime contractor 
the united states had urged japan to buy the f16s but the 
asian nation said it wanted to build a new fighter on its own the 
defense and state departments then pushed for a coproduction deal 
lawmakers in the house and senate have introduced resolutions to 
disapprove the deal sen robert byrd dwva introduced a 
resolution of approval tuesday 
the haunting question is why wont they buy our planes 
said sen carl levin dmich at a hearing of senate armed 
services subcommittee on defense industry and technology we buy 
their cars tvs radios vcrs 
senators expressed concerns about how much technology the united 
states will provide and how it will benefit japan in the aerospace 
industry witnesses from the state defense and commerce 
departments sought to assure the lawmakers that the united states 
will not be giving away all its secrets and will retain safeguards 
what were providing to japan was built in 1975 1978 its 
not current state of the art said lt gen ronald w yates 
principal deputy to the assistant secretary of the air force for 
acquisition 
yates said the only updated equipment are engines and avionics 
the united states will sell the engines but not allow japan to copy 
the technology japan will develop its own avionics yates said 
carl w ford deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs noted that the fsx deal was made in the 
interest of us national security 
any suggestion that we are not in command about us 
production base couldnt be further from the truth ford said 
the fsx is our idea 
but sen albert gore jr dtenn complained that any 
farsighted strategy to maintain our lead in aerospace is absent 
in the fsx deal gore noted that at the same time the united states 
is working with japan on an advanced fighter jet funding for the 
national aerospace plane may be cut the highspeed transport a 
joint project with nasa could fly around the world in just two 
hours 
but defense secretary dick cheney has proposed slashing the 
projects fiscal 1990 budget from 300 million to 100 million 
gore also cautioned that rejection of the japan deal would leave 
the united states with serious ongoing disputes with two major 
allies west germany which does not want to modernize 
shortrange missiles and japan 
in the house levine richard gephardt dmo and helen delich 
bentley rmd urged support for the disapproval resolution at a 
hearing before the senate foreign affairs subcommittees on asian 
and pacific affairs arms control international security and 
science and international economic policy and trade

federal regulators said today theyve sued 
wall street brokerage kidder peabody amp co and a californiabased 
investment group for 24 million over activities linked to the 
failure of a savings and loan 
the civil complaint of the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp filed in us district court in los angeles alleges that 
the insolvency of seapointe savings and loan in carlsbad calif 
was the result of the defendants violation of laws and regulations 
governing trading by sampls in securities futures and commodity 
options as well as breaches of duty 
also named in the suit were strategic investment services 
robert peacock an account manager at kidder peabody dirk rose 
president of sis and robert forrest a director of sis 
the complaint charges that rather than hedging to protect 
seapointes assets the trading conducted by kidder peabody and 
sis amounted to risky speculation 
in addition the regulators charged that the defendants knew 
that seapointes directors were inexperienced in securities 
futures and commodity options trading and that sis made 
representations to further its own interests without regard to 
those of seapointe savings 
kidder peabody allegedly abetted sis by failing to warn 
seapointe of siss fraudulent acts according to the complaint

with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact 
on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed 
so far about 45 nations have signed television contracts with 
the expedition abc has bought exclusive us tv rights we want 
the world to know much much more about antarctica after our 
expedition than it did before we set out steger said 
the continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap it rises 
sharply at the perimeter then flattens out in a vast high plateau 
at an average elevation of 9500 feet antarcticas 54 million 
square miles is more than china and india combined it has no 
indigenous people and wildlife is confined to the coast 
a treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations with additional 
signatories in subsequent years put all territorial claims on 
antarctica on hold banned military activity and established 
freedom of scientific inquiry 
but many countries now have designs on the land for strategic 
political and even economic reasons some expect to find oil coal 
and mineral deposits under the ice some want to see the continent 
cut into pieshaped wedges but steger wants the people of the 
world to demand that it be protected intact 
it sounds like a very lofty goal but antarctica is a going to 
play a very important role in the future of the planet he said 
planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice 
caps raising sea level and flooding coastal areas but steger said 
its simplistic to worry about submerged cities with 85 percent of 
the planets fresh water stored in the snow and ice of antarctica 
a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans change ocean 
currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns 
the other environmental nightmare awakening interest in 
antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer 
directly over the continent ozone screens the planet from excess 
ultraviolet radiation 
scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin 
cancer but such thinking is myopic steger said most 
significantly increased solar radiation could disrupt the 
reproduction cycles of plankton the microscopic oceanic plants and 
animals that are the basis of the global food chain 
these ominous changes are most apparent in antarctica making it 
like a canary in a mine steger said 
the team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500 
miles as they cross a 13000foot high plateau known as the area of 
inaccessibility its the worst possible place on earth for 
ultraviolet exposure 
the team will carry a monitor and boyarsky will record ozone 
levels at regular intervals the first crosssection of ozone 
across the continent 
qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across 
antarctica recording temperatures and oxygen content for a 
geological history of the icecap 
etienne a physician will monitor cholesterol levels of the 
team members who will rely on the highfat diet typical of 
cultures in cold regions 
but the experiments that can be done along the way are limited 
by time and weight the trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on 
crosscountry skis and the three dogsleds can carry no more than 
900 pounds of gear 
steger admits they wont attempt pure science but he hopes 
the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier 
we need international cooperation solutions to environmental 
problems must be global

exxon corp under fire from 
environmentalists and the government announced today it will 
sharply increase the number of workers and ships cleaning oil from 
more than 300 miles of alaska shoreline 
the number of people directly employed on the battlefront on 
the shoreline will go from 1475 to 2500 william d stevens 
president of exxon co usa said in a statement issued in 
washington 
on tuesday a top coast guard officer had said exxon must beef 
up its cleanup troops rather than its public relations staff if it 
hoped to meet its sept 15 deadline for sopping up the nations 
worstever oil spill 
what theyll have to do is come back next spring and finish 
the cleanup said vice adm clyde robbins the top federal 
official directly supervising the cleanup 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said exxons increase in 
resources improves the likelihood the company will meet its cleanup 
goal nevertheless said skinner the cleanup might have to 
continue in the spring 
in a revised cleanup plan submitted to the coast guard exxon 
said it will increase the number of people to be involved in the 
summer cleanup from a previously planned 3400 workers to 5000 it 
also said it will bring in seven additional barges and 17 more 
landing craft bringing the number of vessels to 70 
in other spillrelated developments tuesday 
a 50foot landing craft involved in the cleanup sank in valdez 
arm the three people aboard the vessel hummer were rescued 
uninjured the coast guard said the coast guard is investigating 
the sinking of the boat which was under contract to exxon said 
dave haulbrook a coast guard spokesman 
the hightech soviet skimmer vaidogubsky was being sent home 
after exxon declined to renew its 15000aday contract the ship 
had been skimming oil for a month but its pumps and machinery 
jammed frequently on the thick weatherhardened crude 
we shouldnt blame the russians exxon operations manager 
bill rainey said it was just not the type of oil she was good 
in 
in washington a bill that would require oil companies to be 
able to handle spills within five hours was introduced in the house 
authorities extended by five days the deadline for having the 
worst oil damage cleaned off four islands in prince william sound 
a favorite birthing area for seals the new deadline is may 15 
they dont really start pupping until may 20 but with all the 
activity we thought wed give them a chance to reinhabit the area 
and settle down said bill pilcher a state department of fish 
and game spokesman 
during a tour of the islands robbins said exxon appeared to be 
concerned as much with public relations as with cleaning up the 
oil the company must double the number of workers if it hopes to 
meet the deadline he said 
they have sent pr people into the field instead of 
operators he said 
exxon spokesman joe tucker said he couldnt comment on robbins 
statements 
company officials have promised to clean up the spill but say 
they were hampered by government agencies after the exxon valdez 
ran aground march 24 spilling more than 10 million gallons of 
crude 
state and federal officials have said exons complaints are 
groundless and misleading 
earlier this week the company said it had spent about 95 
million on the cleanup robbins said the final price may reach five 
times that 
id be surprised if it didnt cost them 500 million he 
said

striking coal miners and pittston co 
management squared off today at the companys annual meeting 
debating three labor proposals questioning the companys operation 
representatives of both sides traded charges but no vote had 
been taken on the proposals by noon and debate dragged on 
as the annual meeting inside pittston headquarters got underway 
the chants of hundreds of striking coalminers from virginia and 
west virginia could be heard 
united mine workers members at pittston mines in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky have been without a contract since feb 1 
1988 about 1700 miners in virginia and west virginia struck april 
5 over what they called labor practices 
since the strike began about 1300 coalminers and their spouses 
have been arrested including about 140 on felony charges from 
rockthrowing and assault 
the union has placed three proposals on the companys proxy 
ballot that challenge the way the greenwichbased company is 
operated 
one proposal asks that shareholders be allowed to vote on the 
companys antitakeover measures and another seeks to have 
shareholders vote by secret ballot the third measure would force 
the establishment of a committee that would study whether pittston 
should sell any subsidiaries 
the proposals are part of the unions socalled corporate 
campaign the company said it considers the strategy to be 
harassment 
kenneth zinn union director of special projects said the 
companys antitakeover measures adversely affect the companys 
stock value and make it unattractive to potential suitors 
the socalled poison pill is unfair because it was 
implemented by management without a vote by shareholders zinn said 
we think shareholders should vote on whether they want to hand 
over this important right to the board he said we believe it 
may have a negative affect on share price 
paul douglas pittstons chairman and chief executive officer 
disputed the union claim saying the poisonpill measures are not 
entrenchment devices intended to keep management in place 
i think there are some honest differences of opinions about 
it he said 
the pittston co took out a full page advertisement in the local 
newspaper today accusing the union of using violence to bully the 
companies it targets into submission 
the advertisement accused the umw and its leaders of selfishly 
encouraging striking miners to commit serious crimes the ad said 
that striking miners have seriously hurt innocent people and that 
striking miners have also been hurt in picket line violence 
both sides met with a federal mediator for the first time monday 
in new york no details of the talks have been made public 
pittston earned 486 million in 1988 including 364 mllion 
from coal operations the company lost 116 million on coal 
operations in 1987 primarily due to the devaluation of mining 
properties 
besides coal mining pittston is the parent company of 
burlington air express inc brinks inc and brinks home security 
inc

how does a local supermarket chain that 
closes on sundays and doesnt sell beer beat a national chain and 
make it to the top of the grocery store heap 
the personal touch says james e ukrop 
thats why ukrop 52yearold president of ukrops super markets 
inc is carrying a letter in his briefcase from a woman upset that 
her coffee brand is sold in smaller cans 
the letter in which the woman threatens to stop shopping at the 
store is covered with notes from ukrops conversation with the 
district manager about why the store cant satisfy her ukrop says 
hell respond personally to the complaint 
it was addressed to me he said in an interview ill 
answer it i hope she comes back 
getting a personal reply from the president of ukrops wouldnt 
surprise most regular customers of the richmond stores where 
clerks are friendly baggers insist on carrying shoppers 
groceries and a framed statement declares that the stores mission 
is to serve our customers and community more effectively than 
anyone else by treating our customers associates and suppliers as 
we personally would like to be treated 
despite not selling beer wine or liquor staying closed on 
sundays and steering clear of promotions like double coupons the 
familyowned chain has beaten out national leaders such as safeway 
to take the biggest bite of the richmond market 
ukrops had sales of 2735 million or about 30 percent of the 
metropolitan regions grocery sales in 198788 according to the 
industry publication food world 
the stores have a national reputation for excellence said bill 
bishop a food retailing analyst with willard bishop consulting in 
barrington ill 
the people that know them know them as a company that runs 
superb food stores bishop said i think that far and away the 
most important thing that ukrops does is to put their customer 
number one a lot of people say that but its not done all that 
frequently and they do that 
with 19 stores and two more on the way ukrops is still growing 
but not too much safeway has 18 stores in areas where both 
chains compete 
ukrops will continue growing with richmond ukrop sad and is 
expanding in new directions such as its own central bakery and 
central kitchen for prepared takehome foods that are set to open 
soon 
but ukrop doesnt want to expand the stores beyond the richmond 
area where he can keep a close eye on them the farthest store is 
in petersburg about 30 miles away and ukrop said he frequently 
rejects requests to open stores elsewhere 
we have an advantage in being local he said we live 
here we have friends here we talk to our neighbors hear what 
they like and dont like were able to put our arms around our 
business we can do a lot of things that companies with branches 
cant do 
things like bringing employees known as associates together at 
values meetings with ukrop or his younger brother vice 
president robert s ukrop to talk about what customers expect 
workers even parttimers are encouraged to memorize a list of the 
stores corporate values and recite them publicly which gets 
them their name on the values honor roll and a ukrops lapel pin 
people always ask where he finds such good employees ukrop 
said and the answer is the company takes the dollars it doesnt 
spend on promotions such as double coupons and games and invests 
them in its workers 
running the business is a contact sport between management 
and employees said robert ukrop a past cocaptain of the 
university of richmond basketball team eleven years younger than 
his brother he speaks in quick bursts of enthusiasm sprinkling 
the conversation with expressions like its fun 
their father joe ukrop founded the familys first grocery 
store in 1937 the brothers grew up next to the store and neither 
of them has ever considered a different career 
theres never been a conflict between family values and running 
the company they said 
growing up we went to sunday school we knew what the golden 
rule was james ukrop said we never heard it related to 
business but we both saw it 
weve never had to make a decision that wasnt consistent with 
our values he said were very fortunate if we felt we 
couldnt operate our business that way we can sell it i 
personally would opt out 
not selling alcohol goes along with the brothers baptist 
values and they say theyve never considered doing otherwise 
its a nonissue bobby ukrop said the store stays closed 
on sundays he said because if you want to be the best place to 
shop you have to be the best place to work 
we lose some business and gain some business because of 
those policies james ukrop said our friends around the country 
dont think were very bright 
ukrops also gives 10 percent of its pretax profits to charity 
and for the last two years has donated more than 1 million to 
nonprofit groups that get 2 percent of the sales receipts they 
collect 
giving to charity is just the way we think it ought to be 
robert ukrop said 
you cant separate whats family and whats business

the securities and exchange commission said 
today that enforcement director gary lynch who led the agencys 
crackdown on insider trading on wall street would leave the 
commission staff in midjuly 
lynch as the agencys top enforcement officer since 1985 was 
the prime mover behind the commissions biggest cases in recent 
years including the settlements with stock speculator ivan boesky 
and drexel burnham lambert inc 
lynch had joined the commission as a staff attorney in 1976 a 
year after graduating from duke university law school lynch in an 
interview said he had no specific plans after leaving the sec 
ive been director for over four years it just got to the 
point where it seemed like it was the appropriate time to move on 
to something new he said 
sec chairman david s ruder in a statement said during 
garys tenure the commission has undertaken major programs to 
combat securities fraud the culmination of garys very 
successful career is of course the historic settlement 
between drexel burnham lambert and the commission 
that settlement of civil charges announced last month capped a 
twoyear investigation that began when boesky implicated the 
nations fifthlargest securities firm he settled insider trading 
charges with the sec in 1986 
the drexel civil settlement helped pave the way for drexel to 
settle a criminal complaint and pay a record 650 million in fines 
and restitution 
the insider trading scandal uncovered during lynchs tenure 
forced venerable brokerage houses to reevaluate their compliance 
and ethics codes and led congress to increase the penalties for 
insider trading 
i think we went an awful long way to cleaning up some serious 
problems that existed lynch said theres more concern 
now about the possibility of being the subject of an sec 
enforcement action in addition probably more importantly as a 
result of the abuses that were exposed brokerage firms have become 
more alert to possible problems within their own organizations that 
can lead to near disaster and ruin 
lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecy 
surrounding the bahamas branch of a swiss bank where convicted 
inside trader dennis levine maintained an account it was levine 
whose cooperation with the sec led to boesky who in turn 
implicated drexel in the largest securities fraud case ever brought 
by the government 
lynch took over the secs top cop job at a time of turmoil for 
the agency and is credited with restoring morale his predecessor 
john fedders departed amid charges he had beaten his wife now 38 
years old lynch was the youngest enforcement director in the 
agencys history 
as a government employee lynch earned an annual salary of about 
72000 far less than he could earn in private practice however 
he said neither the salary nor the long hours he worked played a 
major role in his decision to leave

soybean futures prices closed moderately lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid rumors that the soviet 
union had purchased as much as 500000 metric tons of soybean meal 
from argentina 
wheat futures advanced slightly while corn prices were mixed 
the soviet union had been widely expected to make a major 
purchase of us soybean meal the talk that they had bought from 
argentina instead prompted selling of futures contracts 
there was no official confirmation of the rumors which 
apparently originated with oilseed traders in buenos aires 
but a soviet purchase of argentine soybean meal shouldnt be a 
major surprise said new yorkbased grain specialist ted mao of 
shearson lehman hutton inc since both argentina and brazil are 
flush with newly harvested soybeans 
the wheat market seesawed in a narrow range as traders 
positioned themselves for thursdays agriculture department 
winterwheat crop estimate 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 426 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to 2 cents higher with may at 279 a bushel oats were 2 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 186 a bushel soybeans

about 10 years ago suburban white lake was 
considered too thinly settled for a new k mart 
now the prospect of future growth has prompted the nations 
secondlargest retailer to open a store in the area surrounded by 
meadows that developers plan to cover with homes 
this store will definitely be a store of the future with the 
growth thats coming in here said manager gary cook weve got 
a big development coming in behind here with townhouses and 
apartments 
the promise of developing neighborhoods like white lake plus 
competitive pressure on from no 1 sears roebuck amp co and no 3 
walmart stores inc keeps k mart corp scrambling to scout new 
sites and rescout old ones as it attempts to place stores in every 
untapped market 
there arent many surprises in the search k mart says it 
already is in nearly every county of the united states 
but the store chain keeps a squad of real estate experts store 
designers and demographers busy looking for ways to squeeze ahead 
including placing stores in suburban fringes where homes are still 
going up 
k mart has more than 2200 stores in 48 states and puerto rico 
it plans to open 70 more this year 
a standard k mart takes up 86000 square feet while a 
freestanding store generally requires eight acres to provide for 
the building and parking lot 
in contrast chicagobased sears large stores with displays of 
spacefilling furniture and appliance lines typically take up 
150000 square feet with some using more than 200000 square feet 
k marts construction and real estate manager mike skiles has 
property experts scouting several hundred potential locations at 
any given time from k marts five regional offices as well as its 
troy headquarters he said 
leads come from their efforts and from shopping center 
developers who want a k mart store to anchor a new mall final 
decisions follow demographic studies and site visits skiles said 
other retailers the state of the economy in that particular 
area the amount of housing growth thats occurring and the quality 
of the particular piece of real estate would all be factors 
skiles said 
although k marts major target is the 25 to 45yearold 
middleincome consumer the demographic profile of the k mart 
shopper is much broader 
for example 
fortytwo percent are high school graduates 23 percent didnt 
finish high school 19 percent have some college 16 percent are 
college graduates 
fortyfive percent are aged 2544 26 percent are 4564 16 
percent are 1824 13 percent are older than 65 
fortythree percent live in households of three or four 30 
percent in twomember households 18 percent live in households of 
five or more 9 percent live alone 
thirtynine percent have household incomes of 2500049999 
25 percent have less than 15000 22 percent have 1500024999 
13 percent earn more than 50000 
were everywhere so the demographics of our shopper are more 
or less like the demographics of the country as a whole said ron 
gellish manager of an operations and research department that 
employs two fulltime demographers 
some new k marts represent back filling in areas where sites 
couldnt be found before skiles said such as a store that opened 
last year in detroits longestablished oak park neighborhood 
k mart had looked at the area over the years but never was able 
to find a suitable building or a new site with enough space to 
meet its needs skiles said 
however a mall developer now wants a k mart to anchor his oak 
park project and the plan fits k marts needs as well 
most new k marts are in growing areas like white lake where the 
expanding pontiac white lake union lake and highland communities 
are beginning to converge about 35 miles northwest of detroit 
the new white lake store stands amid grassy fields although 
builders signboards tout development on the way 
were opening to service the new housing out there skiles 
said 
the 86000squarefoot store also is in sight of the slopes and 
lifts of alpine ski valley in a departure from traditional 
discount decor beams in the facade around the store entrance 
suggest a chalet motif 
that kind of planning is k marts best hope for a competitive 
edge rather than any dramatic attempt to surprise sears or 
walmart gellish said 
we know where their stores are they know where ours are our 
moves are pretty well publicized in the trade journals he said 
theres no secrets we just have to operate as efficiently as 
possible

from batman converses to fuchsiacolored keds 
keeping in step with fashions this season is more comfortable as 
far as feet are concerned 
spurred by the habits of healthobsessed yuppies who go for that 
athletically inspired look variants on the basic sneaker have 
become so withit that sports shoe manufacturers are rushing to 
capitalize on the trend 
sneakers frequently less expensive than alternatives make 
sense from a practical standpoint even if the wearer isnt fixated 
on fitness shoe stylists say 
people are going to wear whats comfortable said kenneth 
cole owner of a shoe company bearing his name women are 
becoming much more practical than they were in the past 
even feet of the wellheeled are shod in canvas several widely 
watched designers have designated sneakers as the shoes to wear 
with their warm weather creations 
influential designer donna karan showed virtually her entire 
spring and summer dkny line including dresses with sneakers 
which retail for about 45 a pair 
other designers are peddling sneakers with their names on them 
including calvin klein and liz claiborne 
several arbiters of whats in and whats out have bestowed their 
approval on a more casual approach to attiring feet 
but ana luisa behrens who tracks shoe fashions for vogue 
magazine doesnt have a completely anythinggoes attitude 
i prefer to see sneakers during the day to me its out of the 
question at night unless you are going to a rock concert she 
saysi think that the sneaker has the right moment its not 
something that could be treated like a leather shoe or a suede 
shoe 
among the main beneficiaries of widersneaker wearing are 
manufacturers of athletic shoes 
converse inc has spiced up its all star collection by 
introducing paprika spinach crocus and other hues wearers 
wanting to get back to the basics in hitops can still select from 
the classic color lineup of white black red and navy 
we feel weve got to visually merchandise our lines more 
aggressively says stephen encarnacao a senior vice president of 
north reading massbased converse what weve got to do is to 
make our all star not just the classic we all grew up with but to 
make it more exciting visually 
dealers are giving converses refurbishments an enthusiastic 
reception 
theyve said gee your timing is perfect encarnacao says 
the companys timing coincides with its sneakers and similar 
ones being sported by popular television and film characters 
in the tv show the wonder years for instance the main 
character and his gradeschool buddies frequently are seen in 
hitops melanie griffith cavorted in rubbersoled canvas as the 
star of the movie working girl 
converse a subsidiary of st louisbased interco inc hopes to 
wow sneaker wearers with its batman line of hitops for adults 
fullscale distribution of the novelty shoes one model dotted 
with the batman yellow and black logo and another featuring 
batmans arch enemy the joker is timed to coincide with the late 
june release of the movie batman starring michael keaton as 
the masked hero and jack nicholson as the joker 
once known as the maker of little white canvas sneakers and 
childsized rubbertoecapped red models keds corp has been 
adding to its repertoire for several years and trying to enliven 
its image 
this year it is pitching offerings on primetime network 
television marking the first such advertising campaign for keds 
this decade the commercials are designed for a broad audience 
specifically intended to tweak teenagers interest while still 
appealing to women 25 to 45years old 
barbara scott director of marketing for keds based in 
cambridge mass and a division of stride rite corp says a key 
change has been an expansion of colors available at any one time 
this season bright ones fuchsia peacocklike blue vivid green 
seem to be the rage pastel tints still have a following among 
keds fanciers scott says 
keds also is introducing a walking shoe in the autumn and has 
expanded into leather lines 
the changes are paying off for keds gross sales are expected to

the name reebok is becoming a generic term for a shoe favored by 
weekend warriors people who want to look like they work out all 
the time but probably only do so on weekends not serious athletes 
thats not to say the company hasnt carved a slice of the 
highperformance shoe market an area which beaverton orebased 
nike inc currently dominates reeboks strong sales plus the 
companys determination to get inventories down to more manageable 
levels after an excessive expansion last year has significantly 
shrunken supplies of reeboks this spring 
i dont think theres any dramatic shortage out there said 
paul r duncan chief financial officer of the company 
headquartered in canton mass its not a big deal as long as it 
gets resolved in a few months theres no shortage and theres 
certainly no real excess either

stock prices finished higher today in lackluster 
trading as investors awaited fridays report on wholesale prices 
the market opened nearly flat and traded in a narrow range 
throughout most of the session 
early in the day investors focused on the bond market and the 
second day of the treasurys 2875 billion quarterly refunding 
it was a very lethargic market with people watching the 
refunding said thomas walsh head of equity trading for nikko 
securities international 
on tuesday stock and bond prices fell in response to the 
treasurys sale of threeyear notes analysts said investors were 
concerned that us and foreign investors bought fewer of the notes 
than expected and feared more of the same in the second round 
but bond prices recovered slightly and stocks followed after the 
950 billion sale of 10year notes on what observers said was 
speculation that at least one foreign investor had made a major 
purchase 
however volume remained light with institutional investors 
staying on the sidelines reluctant to make commitments 
the final day of the sale is thursday when the government will 
auction 30year bonds 
traders said the market also remained cautious ahead of the 
retail sales and producer price reports due out thursday and friday 
respectively investors hope the reports will provide a better clue 
about whether the economy is continuing its robust growth 
signs of continued strength could mean inflation is still a 
problem and that the federal reserve will continue tightening 
credit by raising interest rates higher rates have slowed housing 
and other sectors and raised fears of a recession

house tax writers today rebuffed president 
bushs savings and loan bailout plan and approved an alternative 
that will add 50 billion to the federal deficit over the next 
three years 
on a 2511 vote with two of 11 republicans siding with all its 
democrats the house ways and means committee rejected bushs 
elaborate financing scheme to prevent the most expensive government 
bailout in history from swelling the deficit 
republicans predicted that the vote will upset a delicate no 
new taxes deficit reducing budget agreement with the white house 
that was approved just last week by the house and senate 
weve fairly well destroyed the budget agreement between the 
administration and congress complained rep bill frenzel rminn 
democrats however called it an attempt at honest budgeting 
for a change citing the fact that past deficit reduction targets 
have never been met in reality 
the vote was the first major setback for bushs bailout plan 
which moved through the senate and the house banking committee with 
only minor changes in response to repeated administration vows of a 
veto if it was altered greatly 
reps willis d gradison of ohio and raymnond j mcgrath of new 
york were the two republicans who sided with the panels 23 
democrats in voting for an amendment by rep sam gibbons dfla 
to add the sampl bailout to the deficit 
i have great ethical and moral problems with the way this 
program is financed under bushs plan gibbons said this is a 
mess that ought to be cleaned up without passing the costs on 
to our children and grandchildren 
as a way to prevent the sampl crisis from showing up in the 
federal deficit the administration proposed raising the immediate 
50 billion infusion of cash to cover sampl failures with a sale of 
30year bonds to be issued by a new quasigovernment agency the 
resolution financing corp 
critics including the congressional budget office maintain 
that this approach will cost taxpayers a total of 45 billion more 
in interest payments over the next 30 years than if the money was 
borrowed directly through the us treasury 
treasury secretary nicholas brady spent more than an hour today 
meeting behind closed doors with members of the ways and means 
committee repeating a threat he made earlier to recommend that 
bush veto any plan that would add to the deficit 
brady left the meeting smiling but when asked by reporters if 
bushs plan had sufficient support in the committee he said only 
you never know about that well have to wait and see 
gibbons led the attack on the administrations plan after the 
committees chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill said tuesday 
that he would not mount an offensive against it 
i am not working the committee to achieve any result 
rostenkowski said reasonable people can differ on the issue all 
members should vote the way they want 
richard breeden a white house assistant and the prime architect 
of bushs sampl plan on tuesday repeated earlier threats by 
administration officials to recommend that bush veto any bill that 
would increase the federal deficit 
similar threats earlier stopped an alternative proposed by 
senate democrats and members of the house banking committee cold in 
its tracks both the house banking panel and the full senate 
already have approved bushs plan 
in a walkthrough tuesday of possible ways they could change 
the package several ways and means democrats and one republican 
rep willis gradison of ohio said they still would like to replace 
bushs financing plan with one advocated by the congressional 
budget office 
by including the bailouts cost as part of the budget and 
borrowing the funds directly through the treasury cbo experts 
contend the government could save interest costs totaling 15 
billion over the next 10 years 
however assistant treasury secretary david mullins told the 
lawmakers the required waiver would drive a battering ram 
through the grammrudman deficit reduction law unless taxes are 
increased or offsetting cuts are made elsewhere in the budget 
we dont want it used as an excuse to create a hole in 
grammrudman so that any megafinancing needs can get a waiver 
mullins said citing as an example the hundreds of millions of 
dollars that a nuclear weapons plant cleanup is now anticipated to 
cost 
but rep frank guarini dnj complained that bushs plan will 
make a big winner out of wall street investment houses through 
commissions in handling offbudget bonds that will be used to 
finance the governments share of the bailout 
the ways and means panel also may challenge a provision inserted 
in the bill by the house banking committee to require sampls to 
devote 75 million to 150 million of their annual profits to 
subsidize lowincome home mortgages 
we believe that looks like a tax said ronald pearlman head 
of the joint committee on taxations staff 
the committee also is looking at whether to continue widely 
criticized tax breaks for companies that take failed sampls off the 
governments hands 
investors and corporations such as ford motor co received a 
total of more than 8 billion in tax breaks last year under 
longterm agreements to take some 170 failed sampls off the 
governments hands 
those provisions such as taxfree treatment of government 
subsidies in the mergers and allowing buyers to use the losses of 
the thrifts they bought to offset income from other operations 
are due to expire at the end of this year in its bill the senate 
urged that they be wiped out immediately

trading wednesday with home heating oil rising in price but crude 
oil and gasoline declining 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled 
24 cents lower at 1952 a barrel the contract had risen 32 cents 
tuesday

june heating oil which rose 030 cent tuesday settled at 4748 
cents a gallon up another 049 cent 
peter beutel an energy analyst at elders futures inc 
attributed wednesdays trading largely to internal forces of supply 
and demand 
however he said the market was somewhat affected by the latest 
weekly american petroleum institute report which showed an 
increase in us crude and gasoline supplies and a drop in supplies 
of heating oil 
traders also remain concerned that members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries may be raising daily production 
above the current quota of 185 million barrels beutel said

opec secretary general subroto said wednesday that 
world demand for petroleum was strong and could support a higher 
benchmark price by the cartel 
subroto met wednesday with texas oil officials who he indicated 
had expressed support for the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries attempts to stabilize world oil prices 
the 13nation cartel agreed last november to limit its 
production to levels that would support a benchmark price of 18 a 
barrel about 185 million barrels a day the action has helped 
crude prices recover from their october 1988 lows of near 12 a 
barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled 
24 cents lower wednesday at 1952 a barrel 
opec was to review its production at a meeting scheduled to 
begin june 5 in vienna austria there has been speculation that 
the cartel would increase its selfimposed production limits if 
demand was strong enough to support higher output without 
depressing prices 
subroto said opec nations have been striving for stability at 
18 per barrel but he realized petroleum demand worldwide was 
strong and could support a higher price 
we are all along for cooperation between the major players in 
the oil industry including producers and also consumers because 
we think only by working together and not antagonizingwe can 
bring the stability in the markets that we believe we can said 
subroto 
subroto had a 1hour breakfast meeting with texas railroad 
commissioner kent hance about 10 independent oil producers and 
others at a downtown hotel subroto agreed with hance that the 
meeting had gone well 
he has been instrumental in involving me in the thinking of 
the oil industry in the united states particularly in texas and so 
on subroto said and we are very grateful for him to give an 
indication of the support of the efforts that opec has given to 
achieve stability in the market 
hance said state energy consumers and officials appreciated the 
opportunity to meet with subroto 
one of the important things is that we have to have a dialogue 
with opec because they are the major player they are so important 
not only to producers but to consumers in the united states said 
hance 
subroto was scheduled to address a thursday luncheon sponsored 
by southern methodist universitys institute for the study of earth 
and man in his only planned us talk this year

prices of frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily 
limit of 2 cents a pound for the second straight day wednesday as 
more speculators hopped aboard the markets rally from its lowest 
level in nine years 
other livestock and meat futures finished the day mixed on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
on other markets energy futures were widely mixed precious 
metals were lower and grains and soybeans were mixed 
frozen pork bellies settled 153 cents to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in may at 3580 
the porkbelly market has gained more than 17 percent since last 
thursday when the may contract fell to 3047 cents a pound the 
lowest price for a nearmonth contract since mid1980 
prices for hogs and pork bellies which are sliced to make 
bacon typically rise in may as hog marketings decline due to a 
variety of seasonal factors 
but this years upturn in porkbelly prices is more pronounced 
than usual because the market has been severely depressed for 
nearly a year 
frozen pork bellies averaged about 65 cents a pound from 
mid1981 to mid1988 but prices began falling sharply in the 
spring of 1988 when it became apparent that production was far 
outpacing bacon consumption 
the agriculture department reported last month that as of april 
1 us cold storage warehouses contained 1338 million pounds of 
frozen pork bellies the secondlargest april 1 tally on record 
chuck levitt senior livestock market analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in chicago said the aggressive stockpiling 
continued through april and he estimated that 150 million pounds of 
frozen bellies were on hand as of may 1 
we havent had that many bellies in storage in any month for 
at least 25 years levitt said we are not going to run out of 
pork bellies 
so despite expectations for a seasonal drop in hog slaughters 
the supplyanddemand factors for pork bellies are predominantly 
bearish 
analysts attributed this weeks strong rally to technical 
factors which basically means chart interpreters decided it was 
time for prices to rise 
technically the market got grossly oversold levitt said 
technically it hasnt had a significant rally in god knows how 
many months 
in other livestock and meat trading live cattle settled 35 
cent lower to 07 cent higher with june at 7207 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 43 cent lower to 20 cent higher with may at 
7715 cents a pound and live hogs were 20 cent lower to 22 cent 
higher with june at 4830 cents a pound 
nearmonth crude oil and unleaded gasoline futures tumbled while 
heating oil futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange 
following tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute report 
showing unexpected increases in us supplies of crude and gasoline 
and a drop in supplies of petroleum distillates 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents lower to 17 
cents higher with june at 1953 a barrel heating oil was 28 cent 
to 63 cent higher with june at 4750 cents a pound unleaded 
gasoline was 97 cent lower to 01 cent higher with june at 6455 
cents a gallon 
gold and silver futures retreated on new yorks commodity 
exchange giving up nearly all of tuesdays gains 
gold settled 110 to 170 lower with june at 379 a troy 
ounce silver was 6 cents lower across the board with july at 
5695 a troy ounce 
soybean futures fell moderately on the chicago board of trade 
amid rumors that the soviet union had purchased up to 500000 
metric tons of soybean meal from argentina wheat futures advanced 
slightly while corn prices were mixed 
wheat settled cent to 1 cents higher with may at 426 a 
bushel corn was cent lower to 2 cents higher with may at 279 
a bushel oats were 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 
186 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 8 cents lower with may at

an effort to make the mustang ranch the 
nations first publiclyowned bordello went on hold when a public 
stock offering failed to sell the required number of shares by a 
wednesday deadline 
eric walloga whose american wallstreet securities inc is 
underwriting the offering said the firm had negotiated an 
extension of the stock sale until oct 31 to allow time to 
restructure the offer 
meanwhile the sale of common stock in mustang ranch inc has 
been halted and all the money received for the shares so far will 
be returned to investors walloga said in a statement released by 
his office in tampa fla 
walloga president of american wallstreet was out of the office 
wednesday and unavailable for comment 
plans had called for a 233 million offering of stock in the 
legal bordello at 20 a share walloga said last week about 75 
percent of the 1165 million shares had been sold during the 
threemonth offering leaving the company some 5 million short of 
its goal 
a statement said an amendment would be filed with the securities 
and exchange commission and the states that have approved sale of 
the stock to reflect the terms of the new deal which it said would 
change the types of securities mustang ranch inc would offer 
the statement said details of the restructured offering would 
not be released pending an sec response to a request for a ruling 
on a technical issue over the amended offering 
peter perry a reno attorney and vice president of mustang ranch 
inc said in the statement that he expected the amended 
registration to be filed with the sec by june 15 perry would not 
comment specifically on the offer them 
mustang ranch inc is an investors group composed primarily of 
reno businessmen and attorneys who are making a second attempt to 
turn the brothel public 
a 1985 bid by a group by john davis of irvine calif fell 
through after failing to generate enough interest in the 18 
million proposal 
the money raised in the current sale was to have provided 13 
million to buy the 102room brothel 10 miles east of reno and its 
440 acres of land from joe and sally conforte 5 million in 
exchange for the confortes promise not to set up a competing 
brothel and 53 million for expansion improvements and working 
capital 
conforte has been trying to sell the brothel since 1985 when he 
was released from prison after serving 18 months on a tax 
conviction

steel import quotas have hurt american exports 
by raising steel prices the us international trade commission 
said wednesday as the bush administration weighed the fate of the 
soontoexpire protectionist program 
the itcs 96page report is certain to enliven the debate over 
whether to continue steel import quota agreements with 19 nations 
and the european community 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements or vras in 
1984 with japan south korea brazil south africa and other 
nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the united states 
president bush has pledged to continue the restraints in some 
form beyond their sept 30 expiration but with the steel industry 
newly profitable opponents of the curbs believe they can make a 
case for ending the program or at least narrowing its scope 
the itc said the curbs caused steel prices in the united states 
to rise by as much as 06 percent in 1985 16 percent in 1986 14 
percent in 1987 and 02 percent in 1988 it said the weakening of 
the dollar overseas and other factors also contributed 
significantly to further price hikes 
as a result of the vrainduced price increases the commission 
estimated that american exports in steelconsuming industries 
decreased by 258 million in 1985 673 million in 1986 699 
million in 1987 and 95 million in 1988 
the recent increases in steel prices have been distributed 
unevenly among categories of customers said the study which was 
conducted at the request of the house ways and means subcommittee 
on trade 
price increases were not as great for large steel purchasers 
as for small ones apparently because the larger purchasers buy a 
great deal of their steel through longterm contracts with prices 
set for the duration of the contract and smaller purchasers 
generally buy steel in spot transactions the itc said 
the question of whether the restraints have caused steel price 
increases has divided american manufacturers into rival camps 
last month a coalition of 374 manufacturers headed by chrysler 
corp maytag corp and others was formed to lobby on behalf of 
continuing the quota agreements on grounds that the curbs have 
helped make the steel industry healthier 
the coalition contends that steel price increases have been 
caused by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates 
but a rival group led in part by caterpillar inc asserts that 
had quotas not been in effect steel prices would have risen only 
modestly 
the itc cautioned that the figures reflected an upward bias 
because of the procedures it used that means that the effect of 
the import restraints on prices might have been overstated

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
wednesday that a decision may be made soon on future use of a 
controversial program that subsidizes farm exports 
low us wheat stocks uncertainty over the 1989 crop and 
more competitive us prices in the world wheat market suggest a 
period of more cautious use of the export enhancement program 
yeutter told the house agriculture committee 
he said after the hearing that a review of the program by his 
department and the presidents office of management and budget is 
on a fast track 
he said the department has already done much of its work in the 
review and omb also is working promptly 
congressmen have criticized the bush administration for slowing 
down use of the program which discounts us farm products for 
foreign buyers other countries heavily subsidize their exports and 
the united states has used the eep as a way to compete with them 
yeutter said the administration is concerned about the wisdom of 
using eep on wheat exports in the wake of last years devastating 
drought which drastically cut domestic supplies 
last week president bush approved sale to the soviets of 15 
million metric tons of wheat under the enhancement program it was 
the first use of eep since late february but some members of 
congress said the soviets actually wanted more wheat and should 
have been sold it 
the administration also is considering selling 500000 tons of 
soybean oil to the soviets at subsidized prices the washington 
post reported in thursdays editions 
the subsidy would cost taxpayers about 75 million at todays 
prices the post said 
the eep is a bonus program through which us exporters are 
given extra commodities to enhance the amount they sell thereby 
bringing down the price to the buyer the bonus comes from stored 
commodities that were bought up by the government through other 
farm price support programs 
rep harold volkmer dmo asked yeutter if failure to 
aggressively use the eep with wheat in light of foreign 
competition wasnt similar to a grain embargo 
yeutter said the concern was only about winter wheat eep will 
be available for the new crop of wheat he said 
yeutter also said there had been sensationalized journalism 
regarding some food safety issues 
rep jim jontz dind asked whether all corn should be tested 
for aflatoxin a carcinogen that shows up after a drought and has 
been widely reported by news organizations 
yeutter said there have been misconceptions about the extent of 
the aflatoxin problem and its danger testing of all corn would be 
costly he said 
we shouldnt change public policy because of sensationalized 
journalism he said 
jontz said the government should be responsive to consumers 
we ought to be responsive providing the consumer concerns are 
rational said yeutter 
the agriculture secretary voiced a similar opinion in a 
discussion with rep sid morrison rwash about the use of the 
growth and colorenhancing chemical alar on apple crops 
the health risk is miniscule yeutter said of way alar has 
been used on apple crops
