mutinous military cadets in azerbaijan fired on 
soviet troops patrolling their capital sunday and tens of 
thousands of people mourned victims of a bloody crackdown on their 
republics nationalist uprising 
a general strike was called for monday to protest soviet troop 
presence said a political scientist speaking by telephone from 
baku the azerbaijani capital where the fighting was reported it 
was not immediately clear who called the strike 
the dozens of cadets joined by comrades from the neighboring 
caucasus republic of georgia battled sporadically sunday with 
soviet soldiers at bakus garrison and military academy reported 
arif yunusov a member of the azerbaijani social democratic group 
the downtown garrison was the scene of some of the fiercest 
fighting when thousands of soviet troops saturday broke through 
barricades erected by militants and stormed baku the southern 
republics capital 
the political scientist jahun mulazade who teaches at the 
azerbaijan academy of sciences said from his apartment sunday 
night that he could hear shooting at the garrison he estimated 
about 200 azerbaijani cadets 50 georgians and members of other 
ethnic groups were fighting the soldiers 
early monday mulazade reported scattered gunfire but that 
soviet military forces generally appeared to control the 
situation in baku 
mutinous azerbaijani sailors also reportedly exchanged gunfire 
with soviet troops on sunday mulazade and yunusovs wife leila 
said that battle raged at the naval academy on the outskirts of 
baku 
occasional shots rang out elsewhere in the azerbaijani capital 
sunday yunusov and radio moscow said but it appeared that 
fighting was concentrated at military posts 
rebels threw grenades and molotov cocktails at soldiers 
military vehicles the official news agency tass said a 
correspondent for moscows staterun tv and radio service was 
briefly held hostage 
the interior ministry reported 51 civilians and six soldiers 
dead and 287 civilians and 36 soldiers wounded in saturdays 
action that brought the total number of casualties for the week to 
129 dead and more than 500 wounded 
activists reported much higher figures and interior ministry 
officials said they received too many conflicting accounts to 
confidently update their figures 
foreign reporters were barred from armenia and azerbaijan so it 
was difficult to reconcile the conflicting information 
moscow sent thousands of troops and other forces to baku after 
fighting flared between the moslem azerbaijanis and mainly 
christian armenians this month the neighboring republics are 
locked in a decadesold dispute over the region of 
nagornokarabakh which is inside azerbaijan but populated mainly 
by armenians 
the total number of soviet forces tackling the violence is 
reported to be 29000 including troops police cadets and 
interior forces the number of militants has been reported to be in 
the thousands 
the bloodiest wave of violence erupted jan 13 with 
antiarmenian rioting in baku that killed 67 people by official 
count and forced thousands of armenians to abandon their homes it 
escalated into open warfare elsewhere in azerbaijan and led to the 
worst fighting in the ethnic feud in two years 
a tabloid tv newscast called seven days began a 25minute 
wrapup of the weeks ethnic violence sunday night with red lines 
spreading from the top of the screen simulating dripping blood as 
pictures of soldiers and victims of the violence flashed by 
anchorman eduard m sagalayev told millions of viewers the 
ethnic warfare was the soviet unions biggest tragedy since world 
war ii 
tens of thousands of azerbaijanis gathered outside the communist 
party headquarters in baku to mourn those killed when soviet troops 
moved in yunusov said 
they also demanded that the state of emergency imposed in the 
capital early saturday be lifted and that soviet troops pull out 
according to the azerbaijans peoples front which has organized 
antiarmenian protests 
bakus city council made identical demands 
the republics supreme soviet convened an emergency meeting late 
sunday night and was to remain in session until monday morning 
said namida vitulova whose husband yusif samedogly attended 
she and mulazade said they expected the legislature to show its 
anger over the crackdown by considering secession 
azerbaijans premier ayaz mutalibov said in a baku radio 
broadcast he met saturday with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and discussed what steps were required for troops to be 
withdrawn 
in the address monitored by the british broadcasting corp in 
london mutalibov did not elaborate but said we were promised 
that provocations will be prevented in azerbaijans districts 
bordering armenia 
he appealed to his countrymen to save our people from 
disaster by restoring law and order 
residents said flags with black mourning ribbons were draped on 
cars balconies and windows throughout the city which was in the 
middle of three days of officially declared mourning a mass 
funeral was scheduled monday 
mulazade said the road to bakus airport strewn with corpses 
after the soviet troops stormed through was covered with flowers 
soldiers continued to patrol the caspian sea port of 18 million 
people in armored personnel carriers 
the interior ministry in moscow said extremists massed on a dock 
in baku near the tanker ivan zemnukhov and threatened to blow up 
the ship unless soviet troops were withdrawn from the capital 
ali asker a peoples front member in baku said in a telephone 
interview that workers aboard oil tankers and other ships anchored 
in bakus port threatened to set fire to their vessels unless 
troops were withdrawn 
the seamen also threatened to ignite oil facilities asker said 
the threat could not be immediately confirmed 
in moscow thousands of azerbaijanis many wearing black 
armbands and waving black flags of mourning marched to the 
headquarters of the official tass news agency they claimed 
official news coverage of the events in their republic was 
distorted and they carried signs critical of gorbachev 
hundreds of armenians gathered at a small brick church and 
cemetery in moscow to mourn their dead volunteers sat a table on 
the snowcovered sidewalk outside the church to collect donations 
for the 15000 armenian refugees who fled baku and demonstrators 
held protest signs including one that blamed moscow for the deaths 
irans islamic republic news agency said two helicopters sunday 
flew over barricades erected by residents of the soviet border city 
of lenkoran and fired at a crowd 
irna said a provincial soviet television station that broadcast 
a declaration of independence from moscow was knocked off the air 
apparently by a powerful explosion 
iran reiterated its call on the soviet union to stop the 
violent clashes with moslems in neighboring azerbaijan irna 
said 
tass said armenians fired at an azerbaijani village in an area 
called wolfs gate on the border between the two republics killing 
12 civilians before troops stepped in the dispatch did not say 
when the attack occurred 
on saturday it said people attacked an antiaircraft and 
missile unit near the armenian capital yerevan but that 
government forces repulsed them 
on monday the british broadcasting corp reported talks in 
yerevan aimed at seeking an end to hostility between the rival 
ethnic groups and an exchange of hostages held by both sides

a freighter carrying petroleum coke collided 
with a tugboat sunday off delaware damaging both vessels and 
injuring two people the coast guard said 
authorities said there was no indication any of the coke spilled 
into the atlantic ocean 
the 593foot freighter doo yang leader and the 113foot tug 
socrates collided around 630 pm 35 miles due east of cape 
henlopen in southern delaware coast guard spokesman breck smith 
said in philadelphia 
the freighter stopped because it had a ruptured tank believed to 
be leaking engine fuel said coast guard petty officer richard 
minnich 
when they noticed the leak they transfered that fuel back to 
another tank minnich said 
theres a onemeter hole on the starboard side the hole is 
above the waterline said james graham a spokesman for the coast 
guardss 5th district headquarters in portsmouth va 
the ship was carrying petroleum coke a residue from a process 
that breaks down petroleum products the freighter is owned by doo 
yang shipping lines in south korea 
investigators from the coast guards marine safety office in 
philadelphia were dispatched to the collision site 
graham said the coast guard cutter point franklin with 
emergency medical technicians aboard was in the area and was en 
route to the tug to assist one of the injured but said the injury 
didnt appear to be lifethreatening 
he said authorities believe the other man had a back injury and 
did not require major medical attention 
the tug was towing a 300foot barge of sugar from west palm 
beach fla to yonkers ny just north of new york city 
the tug is owned by allied towing corp of norfolk va minnich 
said 
minnich said the tug received damage to its cabin but was able 
to continue on its route and was being accompanied by another tug 
owned by the same company 
neither ship lost any of its cargo graham said

a sign on a freeway here reads 
little saigon marking an enclave that is home to many of the 
250000 vietnamese settled in southern california 
now the region is receiving the first wave of 100000 political 
prisoners allowed to leave vietnam and experts are calling on 
vietnameseamericans to help the refugees survive and thrive in 
america as government funding dwindles 
my argument to them is look youve been helped by the 
american government the american people and others said loc 
nguyen director of the refugee resettlement program for the 
catholic charities of los angeles 
you keep pushing the government to allow more refugees and 
say we need more help i say they are our people we have to 
take care of them said nguyen 
the refugees themselves are cautioned about economic realities 
we explain to them that real life in the united states does 
not look like on television said rev bao xuan nguyen of the 
saigon christian reformed church in westminster i ask them come 
back with a realistic view if they want to build their own 
life everything must start at the beginning 
the vietnamese community in los angeles is estimated at 150000 
and at up to 100000 in adjacent orange county officials say the 
largest concentration outside vietnam 
about 7000 prisoners of communist vietnams reeducation 
camps some of whom spent more than a decade imprisoned after the 
wars end are expected to be resettled by september 
of the total 100000 or so eligible to emigrate to the united 
states in the next five years most are expected to settle in 
southern california said william gayk demographer for orange 
county 
texas florida and washington dc also have large vietnamese 
populations gayk said 
the amount of federal money available for an individuals 
resettlement in 1983 was 12000 according to dianne edwards 
director of adult and employment services for the orange county 
social services agency in 1989 it was less than 4000 she said 
there are government programs in place to help such refugees as 
the former political prisoners she said including cash 
assistance medical aid and language and job training 
we are not anticipating a major drain on county resources as a 
result of the former pows she said the issue we are seeking 
to address is that refugee funding has gone down considerably in 
the last 10 years 
leaders in the vietnamese community say the decline in funding 
presents an opportunity to unite in support of their newly arriving 
countrymen 
the local and federal government has been doing a lot of work 
to resettle the refugees we feel we should do our part said 
tony lam a businessman who has been active in refugee resettlement 
in orange county since his arrival 15 years ago 
the rev nguyen is working to enlist even recent refugees in the 
cause 
i say you wanted me to sponsor you how about when you have 
a stable life you sponsor others nguyen tells his 
parishioners do for them what people did for you 
those involved in resettlement agree that a number of the former 
prisoners many of whom were military officers who fought for 
south vietnam against the communists and politicians are arriving 
with advantages their predecessors lacked 
this group is the easiest to work with said loc nguyen of 
catholic charities which handles up to 40 percent of the total 
vietnamese refugee caseload in los angeles and works under an 
agreement with the state department as do a dozen other volunteer 
agencies 
they have an aboveaverage education and often are 
collegeeducated their english is much better than other groups 
they may have been government or military officials or been 
associated with us firms he said 
loc nguyen and others said the refugees need help adjusting to a 
lower standard of living than they might have expected here and 
the limits of public assistance 
that might mean a man who was an engineer or highranking 
military officer in vietnam will have to start out here as a 
minimumwage assembly line worker he said 
loc nguyen said he encourages refugees to take such jobs while 
educating themselves for more skilled positions so they can stay 
off welfare 
i tell them with welfare you lose your confidence you lose 
your energy you become merely a welfare receiver who waits for the 
check he said

vice president dan quayle facing a possible 
chilly reception in latin america as he offers to explain the us 
invasion of panama would not be the first presidential emissary to 
run into trouble in the region 
such esteemed former latin america travelers as nelson 
rockefeller richard nixon and rosalynn carter were sent by 
presidents on goodwill trips and all encountered stormy receptions 
in some cases violence 
quayle leaves saturday on a mission to try to quell the 
resentment left in central and south america by president bushs 
dec 20 military invasion of panama 
none of the countries in the region has officially rebuffed 
quayle but some officials have let it be known his visit would be 
less than welcome so soon after the invasion many are upset that 
us invasion troops remain in panama 
instead of receiving quayle at home some leaders plan to meet 
with him at three presidential inaugurations on saturday in 
honduras and in chile and brazil in midmarch 
quayle himself acknowledged theres a matter of timing 
involving diplomatic sensitivities over when he should go 
past efforts by washington to be chummy with latin america have 
encountered problems stemming from a variety of sources including 
latin resentment over the historical us pattern of manipulating 
the regions internal political and economic affairs 
the most volatile trips in recent history were that of vice 
president richard nixon in 1958 and a series of trips by new york 
gov nelson rockefeller in 1969 
in contrast to those times when most of the region was under 
dictatorship and military rule quayle will visit a region that has 
turned overwhelmingly to democratic government 
on an 18day goodwill mission for president eisenhower nixon 
was the target of violent antius demonstrations in peru and 
venezuela and lesser outbursts and heckling by university students 
in argentina uruguay paraguay and colombia 
rockthrowing mobs confronted nixon in lima and caracas rioters 
shattered the windows of his limousine in caracas and tried to drag 
him and his wife from the car before their motorcade managed to 
escape 
eisenhower ordered us military troops to stand by in puerto 
rico and the guantanamo bay base in cuba in case nixon needed 
protection 
in lima shouting demonstrators threw rocks and fruit at his 
speakers platform in bogota police broke up several antinixon 
demonstrations 
when nixon became president he dispatched rockefeller to help 
formulate a new policy toward latin america 
voicing sentiments much like those stated by bush in the first 
year of his presidency nixon talked about the regions importance 
and us hopes for cooperative ties with its hemispheric neighbors 
but rockefellers mission was marked at nearly every stop by 
violence riots bombings gunfights or terrorism eight people 
were killed in incidents directly or indirectly connected to the 
visit 
the first trouble signs came in guatemala where newspapers 
blasted his visit as useless and in el salvador where placards 
read rockefeller go home 
in nicaragua students burned a us flag peru then canceled 
rockefellers trip to lima annoyed that the united states had 
suspended arms sales to peru following seizures of us fishing 
boats 
following violence in ecuador colombia and honduras word came 
that venezuela and chile wanted to be stricken from rockefellers 
itinerary 
in montevideo uruguay rampaging students protesting both 
rockefellers visit and their governments economic austerity 
program smashed car windows and threw firebombs 
after returning home rockefeller submitted to nixon 83 
recommendations on how to improve hemispheric cooperation and help 
solve the regions social political and economic problems 
all but a few were ignored 
when rosalynn carter toured seven nations as her husbands 
emissary on a 13day trip in 1977 the dissension was mostly less 
overt 
but students in quito ecuador threw stones and bricks and 
shouted antiamerican slogans near where she met with government 
officials the noise at times nearly drowned out her voice in the 
legislative palace 
elsewhere on her tour there were private diplomatic rumblings 
complaining that carter had sent his wife rather than a 
highranking official who would have more appropriate stature to 
conduct diplomatic talks 
in brazil mrs carter trod on delicate ground by raising the 
carter administrations unhappiness with the military governments 
human rights record and ruffled feathers by announcing she would 
meet there with two american churchmen who had reportedly been 
beaten by police

when amber yarger arrived at school 
recently she had to sit in the back of her classroom and couldnt 
play with her browneyed friends at recess 
she and the other blueeyed third graders had to drink from a 
fountain with warm water use a restroom without paper towels and 
stand in the back of lines 
it was part of a firsthand lesson in discrimination devised by 
faculty at driscoll elementary school to teach 60 thirdgraders the 
meaning of discrimination as part of the celebration of martin 
luther king jrs birthday 
i had this one friend who had blue eyes and she started 
crying because she didnt know what was happening amber said 
sunday 
blueeyed children were snubbed one day in the program that 
began jan 9 those with brown eyes and those with hazel and green 
eyes were discriminated against on subsequent days 
some children were upset at their separation from friends and 
classmates for a day teacher cathy pedersen said but she hopes 
they learned the lesson 
the goal really was to get them to understand just how unfair 
prejudice is i wanted them to say this is unfair i cant 
help the way i was born if they can grow up without prejudice 
they can carry that on with their children she said

in languages from west african pidgin english 
to the tagalog of the philippines popular music financed by the 
us government aims at discouraging young people from having sex 
critics have long complained that many pop songs promote sex 
but the songs commissioned by the us agency for international 
development seek to do the reverse 
wait for me the title song of a bestselling album in 
nigeria last year says in pidgin english 
dis tin them call love 
na serious affair 
make you think well 
before you gree 
translation this thing they call love is a serious affair 
think well before you agree 
the song was recorded by king sunny ade known in west africa 
for a style called juju and onyeku onwenu he has three wives and 
12 children she is a graduate of wellesley college who tried 
journalism before turning to the stage the agency said she wrote 
both music and lyrics in pidgin and traditional english 
another song choices presents an alternative policy 
yes we shouldnt make children 
we cannot take care of 
there are ways of making love 
without making children 
many people who work to raise the living standards of poor 
countries see the rapid growth of their population as the chief 
obstacle 
growth rates in developing countries will remain high for 
several decades even if couples have fewer children said a study 
by the world bank the chief source of aid for the third world 
absolute annual increases will be close to 80 million 
people a year well into the next century 
the us agencys population program also provides donations of 
contraceptives including 69 billion condoms over the past two 
decades 
the nigerian albums popularity has spilled over into 
neighboring countries the next step will be another record for 
nearby frenchspeaking republics like zaire senegal and the ivory 
coast the agency says 
the agency said it was too early to say what effect the african 
music has had but a study will be made later 
two songs recorded earlier for latin america were the subject of 
an analysis by the population communication service of johns 
hopkins university the idea for the project came from a conference 
of the service in 1983 
with the government agencys support it blossomed into two 
musical videos television commercials radio spots records and 
jackets posters and press materials the songs were recorded by 
tatiana palacios of mexico and johnny lozada correa of puerto rico 
the agency said the songs topped the charts in mexico and peru 
and reached the top 10 in nine other countries 
we made an investment of about 350000 and got about 5 
million worth of free air time said duff gillespie the agencys 
director for population 
the universitys study said that although no data were 
collected attitudes about delaying sexual relations may have been 
strengthened especially among young women in mexico 
one of the most important conclusions from this evaluation is 
that popular songs and the broadcast media can be successfully 
employed to reach young people with a positive social message about 
sexual responsibility even if the message contradicts the theme of 
the majority of competing popular songs it added 
in the philippines one song was called i still believe and 
lea salonga sang in english 
i dont think its right to need me 
just for a lonely night 
to which according to the agency charlie masso replied in 
tagalog 
im willing to wait for a while 
the song was number one in the philippine charts for two months 
the agency said

the dome of his former haunt the us 
capitol looms seven miles up the potomac river as lowell weicker 
his 6foot5inch frame a little thinner than when he patrolled the 
senate ponders returning to politics 
weicker the nixon antagonist and maverick republican from 
connecticut has dropped off the radar screen of politics in the 
year since his upset loss to democrat joseph lieberman 
he has been quietly building a public outreach group research 
america an association of universities hospitals and 
philanthropies devoted to promoting biomedical research where his 
job is to sell the priority of biomedical research to the 
american people in the same way you sell a hamburger or a can of 
beer 
but the 58yearold millionaire says he misses the political 
battlefield and is considering a run for governor of connecticut 
one could compare research america to elba if one wanted 
to said dick foley the connecticut gop chief and no supporter 
of weicker referring to the island where napoleon was exiled 
weicker says he never wanted to use research america as a 
platform for political selfpromotion but as he considers 
returning to politics the organization is preparing a media blitz 
featuring weicker that will promote research for cures for such 
diseases as multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis 
weicker closes out each of the tv ads by saying to me its 
outrageous that a country as prosperous as america doesnt spend 
more on medical research 
the organization has a 1 million budget this year and hopes to 
triple that figure within three years through contributions from 
its member organizations 
the big part of our budget is going to be advertising 
weicker says 
in the meantime weicker says he misses the political fray and 
predicts he could win the states top office but he is also 
realistic 
the last time i asked connecticut how am i doing i didnt 
get a very good answer weicker said 
the speculation about weicker has been fueled by the absence of 
any declared candidates of statewide stature incumbent democratic 
gov william oneill has yet to decide whether he wants another 
term and other potential contenders are either regional 
politicians or businessmen 
weicker who inherited a fortune from his grandfathers 
pharmaceutical business says he could easily stay where he is he 
spends more time with his family has a nice view of the potomac 
and doesnt have to attend late night senate sessions in fact he 
has hardly been on capitol hill since losing his seat 
when i accepted the job for research america i made it very 
clear that i would not lobby period weicker said when i was 
in the senate i used to really look with disdain on my 
excolleagues who used to lurk in the dining room and gymnasium and 
the halls doing their thing 
even if he did lobby the senate weicker wonders whether he 
would have much impact his outspoken often undiplomatic style 
which first gained prominence during the watergate hearings when he 
lambasted president nixon for what he viewed as that 
administrations abuse of the constitution frequently earned him 
enemies 
nevertheless weicker says he doesnt plan to change his manner 
even though he has little doubt it cost him his senate seat 
the approach stays the same he says 
wed all like to go ahead and call the manner of our leaving 
whether its the senate or its the earth weicker said would 
i have preferred to have retired undefeated from the senate sure 
nobody likes to get beat but you dont run the risks that i ran on 
a variety of issues without understanding that somewhere along the 
line youre going to catch a bullet

here are excerpts from mayor marion barrys 
statement to reporters sunday in the wake of his arrest last week 
on drug charges 
the events of the past few days have been the most difficult 
of my life more difficult than fighting my way out of poverty as 
black youth born in the segregated deep south more difficult than 
the fear and hatred i faced as a civil rights leader in the 1960s 
more difficult than i could have imagined 
because this time i have come face to face with my deepest 
human frailties ive had to look my human weaknesses straight in 
the eye i have realized that ive spent so much time caring about 
and worrying about and doing for others i have not worried enough 
or cared enough for myself 
i have realized that god made marion barry the same as he made 
other people a flesh and blood creation who rises and falls just 
like any other human being 
ive just spent the last hour or so with a group of clergy 
people including my own minister david eaton who are friends of 
mine we have prayed and they have counseled me and i have taken 
their counsel 
it helped me feel good about the fact that in the final 
analysis its not the title that a person holds thats important 
its not marion barry mayor that counts its marion barry the 
person a human being with a body mind and spirit like any other 
person 
ive felt for some time that i could do any and everything 
but they have helped me to realize that god put each of us on earth 
for a purpose we may not always understand what that purpose but 
when we put ourselves in gods hands our way is made clearer 
these ministers have helped me keep the strength that i need 
so i announce today i am going to find a way to begin to heal 
my body mind and soul 
to all the people who love me and worry about me the best way 
to show your appreciation for me and our city and our family is to 
join together as a united community we must at this hour be 
willing to forgive to love to reach out to each other and to 
serve our city 
i realize that i am going to have to walk this journey by 
myself its going to take marion barry walking this journey but i 
say to others who are pained and hurt as i am join me brothers 
and sisters we can make it we can make it we will make it its 
going to be a lonely journey but i stand and god stands with me

a democratic plan to cut the social security 
payroll tax poses a problem because it would increase the federal 
deficit says house speaker thomas s foley 
foley dwash said he probably would oppose the plan by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny if he had to make an immediate 
decision on it the bush administration opposes the proposal 
i wouldnt be ready to say that i was in favor of it today 
foley dwash said sunday appearing on nbctvs meet the 
press if i had to make a decision today to do it or not do it 
id probably say dont do it 
moynihans plan is aimed at keeping the surpluses generated by 
the social security system from artificially lowering the federal 
deficit the social security system made 52 billion more last year 
than it paid out allowing the government to report a 152 billion 
deficit rather than a 204 billion shortfall 
rightly or wrongly these funds are used to meet the costs of 
the deficit or part of them and wed have a problem if we cut the 
tax of having a very large increase in the federal deficit 
foley said 
other democrats though taking pleasure in the way moynihans 
politically appealing tax cut has put republicans on the defensive 
have also voiced reservations about what effect it would have on 
the nations deficit 
moynihan appearing on cbstvs face the nation said he 
didnt know why so few democrats had endorsed his plan 
if we cant get behind an issue like this a principle im 
not sure who needs the democratic party he said if we wont 
protect the integrity of the trust funds well what are we 
moynihans plan could provide 111 million working americans with 
a tax cut of up to 600 a year it would benefit lower and 
middleincome americans most of all since the payroll tax does not 
apply to earnings above 51300 
foley said he thought it was wrong for the surplus to be used to 
mask the deficit but he did not want to endanger social security 
benefits for future retirees 
im not ready to oppose it i think we ought to study it very 
carefully foley said 
the speaker noted it took congress more than a years work 
before it agreed on a way to strengthen the systems financial 
structure in 1983 
we shouldnt go running around changing it dramatically 
without time to examine the alternatives foley said 
foley had been silent on the issue before sunday other key 
players in revenue legislation who have not been heard from are 
senate finance chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas and house ways and 
means chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine reiterated 
sunday that he is undecided on moynihans plan and is awaiting 
studies about how it would affect the deficit 
mitchell appearing on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said moynihans plan was significant because it exposed 
how unfair and regressive the american tax system had become 
president bush is pushing for a cut in the capital gains tax 
which is seen by many democrats as benefiting only the rich 
supporters say it would stimulate muchneeded investment 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan appearing with 
mitchell predicted the moynihan plan is not going anywhere 
budget director richard darman also appearing on the abc 
program said congress should be more concerned with lowering the 
nations 3 trillion debt than cutting the social security tax 
senator moynihan has in effect thrown a grenade into the 
middle of the house and senate darman said 
moynihans plan would cut the 765 percent payroll tax paid 
separately by workers and their employers by 014 percent 
immediately and by 096 percent more next january the tax would 
begin to rise again in the year 2015 so the social security system 
could begin building up a reserve to pay for the 75 million baby 
boomers who will begin to retire at around that time

congress returns to washington this week for a 
1990 session preoccupied with two issues that have taken on an 
unusual linkage the federal budget deficit and the starkly 
changing face of eastern europe 
lawmakers will be caught between a desire to reward countries 
emerging from more than four decades of soviet domination and the 
need to shrink spending in an unyielding budget that already is 
being asked to make room for improving programs at home 
the year will be consumed with this discussion of how the 
united states deals with a host of new relationships with poland 
hungary east germany romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia said 
sen richard lugar rind a senior member of the senate foreign 
relations committee 
congress and president bush will have to reach agreement on what 
the us role should be in encouraging and aiding those emerging 
new democracies as they struggle with economic stagnation almost 
certainly there will be a political consensus that some kind of aid 
should be extended as there was last year on aiding poland and 
hungary 
the real question will boil down to the availability of funds 
and what kind of agreement will be reached between the 
administration and congress said rep dante fascell dfla 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
bush has renewed his nonewtaxes vow for this year meaning any 
money for newly eligible recipients in eastern europe and panama 
will have to be found by cutting current programs the aid budget 
is already so tight that some us friends and allies may come away 
emptyhanded 
congress will have to grapple with reducing the budget deficit 
while seeking to pass legislation mandating cleaner air 
subsidizing child care for working parents reforming campaign 
finance laws extending farm programs and stepping up the war on 
drugs there will be fights as well over bushs proposal to cut 
the tax rate on capital gains and over a proposal by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny to cut the social security tax rate 
a key to the budget battle will be how deeply defense spending 
can be cut which in turn depends heavily on progress in talks in 
vienna on a conventional arms control treaty for european forces 
all of these thorny issues will be faced in the context of an 
election year voting will come in november for all 435 house seats 
and 34 senate seats 
to fund new foreign aid needs overseas senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan has suggested trimming large aid recipients like 
israel and egypt which have politically potent lobbies many 
democrats are countering that the money should come from cuts in 
pentagon spending 
we should look carefully at reducing military aid programs 
premised on a communist threat orchestrated from moscow said 
senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell dri 
economic aid to eastern europe is a highly effective form of 
defense spending 
others are saying the united states should be wary of promising 
too much we are not in the situation after the second world 
war when the united states was totally dominant and we 
financed the recovery not only of our wartime allies but our 
wartime enemies said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine we cant do that now and we shouldnt do that now it 
ought to be a multilateral effort 
on the foreign affairs front the year will start on a discordant 
note an attempt to override of bushs veto last year of a bill 
allowing chinese students in the united states to extend their 
stays to avoid political persecution in their homeland 
republicans have abandoned the president in droves on the issue 
saying he has been callous toward the bloody crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last year 
i dont think theres any chance they will be able to sustain 
the presidents veto said rep william broomfield rmich it 
would be obviously sending the wrong signal to the rest of the 
world about what took place just a few months ago 
a house vote on the issue will come wednesday and the senate is 
expected to act soon afterward the white house is putting heavy 
pressure on senators to support bush pointing out that he has 
taken administrative steps to protect the more than 30000 students 
congress also will be keeping a close eye on el salvador where 
soldiers have been charged in the murders of six jesuit priests 
for signs that human rights violations can be dealt with by the 
judicial system and nicaragua where national elections are 
scheduled for feb 25 and the campaign of the usbacked 
opposition coalition has been flagging

gasoline prices rose nearly 2 cents per 
gallon at the pump in the last two weeks primarily because 
refiners cut back on gasoline processing in favor of heating oil 
during the cold weather an analyst said 
the average price of gasoline including all grades and taxes 
rose 197 cents per gallon to 11306 cents per gallon between jan 
5 and jan 19 trilby lundberg said sunday 
thats the highest level since late july 1989 she said 
im attributing this to the effect that home heating oil price 
rises due to extreme cold weather had upon gasoline and other 
refined petroleum products 
the retail gasoline prices on jan 19 according to the biweekly 
lundberg survey of 13000 gas stations 
at selfserve stations premium unleaded 11898 cents per

the revolution in eastern europe may weaken 
but will not cripple the kremlins kgb spy agency say us and 
emigre analysts 
the kgb will have to take over functions now carried out by 
soviet bloc allies said stanislav levchenko a kgb defector who 
lives near washington 
a noncommunist government has been in power in poland since 
august while the east german hungarian and romanian parties have 
changed their names since hardline rulers were toppled late last 
year also bulgarias ruling communist party is attempting reforms 
however the external intelligence services of these warsaw pact 
nations remain largely intact and they still seem to be spying for 
moscow say cia chief william h webster and nongovernment 
analysts 
its much too early to tell how quickly those services will 
erode my own sense is not too quickly webster said in a speech 
on nov 29 after hardliners in all the countries but romania had 
fallen 
some of them are deeply imbedded in the bureaucracies of 
their countries so lets not assume that because we are getting 
friendly and seeing freedom come up from the streets that freedom 
has been endorsed by some of those aggressive intelligence 
services webster said 
soviet spy masters have long relied on east european 
intelligence services to obtain military secrets and advanced 
technology say western officials and warsaw pact defectors the 
east europeans were not as closely watched and could travel areas 
that are closed to soviets 
as evidence of soviet control over warsaw pact 
intelligencegathering webster cited the cases of army master sgt 
clyde lee conrad charged last august with working for hungary at 
soviet direction and army warrant officer james w hall charged 
with spying for the soviets and east germans 
now experts say the east european spy agencies might capitalize 
on friendlier relations with the west particularly in their 
efforts to steal advanced technologies a major kremlin target 
a former chief of romanias external intelligence ion pacepa 
predicted that espionage by that nation might increase after the 
ouster of nicolae ceausescu last month 
they steal technology and now they will steal it much more 
easily because people in the west will want to help the romanians 
and will give them technology and they will give it to moscow 
pacepa said in a telephone interview 
roy godson author of several books on intelligence agreed that 
americans will tend to be much more unguarded with east 
europeans 
in the technology acquisition area i would think that the 
east europeans would have great opportunities not only in the 
united states but in west europe and japan he said 
nonsoviet warsaw pact intelligence agencies cooperated with the 
kgb to varying degrees according to analysts but us government 
officials will not disclose much of what they know about the links 
according to the agreement that led to solidaritys victory in 
polish elections last year that nations military and intelligence 
services remain in the hands of communist party members who were 
trained in the soviet union 
czechoslovakias interior ministry has been transferred out of 
communist control but it is unclear to what degree purges have 
been carried out in the foreign intelligence departments or in 
espionage operations abroad 
soviet control over these operations will erode eventually 
analysts agreed 
the most noticeable change may be in east germany where the 
reform government renamed the security ministry but is now 
defending its existence against angry mobs demanding an end to 
domestic spying 
among warsaw pact allies east germany had been contributing the 
most valuable information to soviet intelligence said jed snyder 
a senior research fellow at the national strategy information 
center 
to take up the slack said kgb defector levchenko the soviets 
must add more agents 
they can expand the number in a year by graduating more 
people from their intelligence academy said levchenko a product 
of that institution 
levchenko said that 35 percent of every soviet community in 
every embassy are professional intelligence officers and that 
percentage is likely to grow

if theres anyone in a position to say i 
told you so he must be david b funderburk who as the us 
ambassador to romania kept peppering the state department with 
descriptions of nicolae ceausescu as an evil tyrant 
it was like beating my head against a brick wall he says 
with no success at all funderburk struggled from 1981 to 1985 
to reverse a us policy that accorded special treatment toward the 
romanian dictator on the grounds that here was one communist ruler 
with an independent streak 
in an interview from his home in buies creek nc the 
45yearold former college teacher says no one listened because the 
state department had put him down as a protege of sen jesse helms 
rnc its longtime critic 
funderburk says george bush who was then vice president former 
president nixon and members of the cabinet senators major 
businessmen all trekked over to bucharest to do homage to 
ceausescu i tried to convince them of the extent of the horrors of 
the ceausescu regime 
but most of these officials had been told to just ignore 
funderburk and what his people at the embassy were saying theyd 
go in and praise ceausescu to the hilt it was very upsetting 
he says he even used his ties to conservatives to go around the 
bureaucracy and met in 1983 with president reagan where he laid 
out his case against doing business with ceausescu 
the president seemed sympathetic and surprised but unless he 
heard the same message day after day he wasnt about to act against 
his own secretary of state funderburk says the groveling 
continued 
the policy had started in the 1970s after ceausescu distanced 
himself from moscow on some issues he maintained ties with west 
germany refused to break with israel following the sixday war 
refused to boycott the 1984 olympics in los angeles and declined to 
support soviet interference in czechoslovakia and afghanistan 
the nixon administration rewarded romania with most favored 
nation trading status ceausescu was courted with visits by 
presidents nixon and ford a lavish welcome to washington from 
nixon and jimmy carter and praise for his courage from a host 
of visiting us officials 
after reagans election funderburk who had studied the 
romanian language in college and worked in that country for the 
us information agency pressed helms and other southern 
conservative senators for the job in bucharest 
upon arriving in bucharest he began warning that ceausescus 
stance as a maverick was a sham that behind the scenes he was 
closely collaborating with the soviets 
no one listened he says because of the departments distaste 
for helms 
career diplomat francis b corry assigned to serve as 
funderburks deputy agrees the ambassador had three strikes 
against him says corry now retired 
corry says the ceausescu policy was based on a dubious 
assumption that romania could be free of soviet domination but 
reversing policy 10 years later would have given washington the 
moral high ground but nothing else he says ceausescu was 
blackmailing us 
with corrys help funderburk says he sent a stream of messages 
to washington detailing ceausescu outrages 
i told them that he was demolishing churches and synagogues 
that he killed pastors and priests on a regular basis says 
funderburk 
ceausescu had a typewriter registration policy a scientific 
diet which left the people malnourished a policy of forcing women 
to have four or five babies or pay a penalty peasants were 
executed for no crime at all for pilfering a few pieces of grain 
because they were on the verge of starvation 
but my reports werent reaching the top people they certainly 
werent being factored into our relations 
frustrated funderburk quit as ambassador wrote a book about 
his experiences and ran unsuccessfully for his states republican 
nomination to the senate 
ultimately in 1988 congress and the administration moved 
toward revoking most favored nation status for romania 
anticipating the rebuke ceausescu renounced the special status 
funderburk remains appalled at us policy we rushed in with 
a new ambassador and recognized the provisional government he 
says most of those characters are people who worked with 
ceausescu here we are propping up a communist government composed 
of people the people hate we dont learn anything

the american farmland trust says soilsaving 
methods of producing crops rate well among many farmers but that 
there is a high degree of skepticism about tougher federal 
restrictions on chemical use 
the private nonprofit conservation group said sunday that 
substantial numbers of farmers across the country are interested 
in and currently employing a variety of environmentally benign 
sustainable agricultural practices 
but the report acknowledged that there are wide variations among 
farmers depending on the kinds of crops involved and on geographic 
locations for example only 20 percent in one area used rotation 
plans while the majority in other areas followed the soilsaving 
practice 
the project was based on personal interviews lasting for more 
than an hour with 489 farmers randomly selected in five major 
production areas in butte county calif whitman county wash 
renville county minn livingston county ill and dooly county 
georgia 
questioners asked about methods used by the farmers in 1988 the 
most recently completed crop season including their views on the 
potential environmental threats that might occur 
the american farmland trust which was founded in 1980 said it 
did not design the questions or interpret results with any 
hostility toward use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides 
it said the study was undertaken in preparation for the 1990 
farm bill debate under way in congress environmental issues 
including potential hazards of agricultural chemical pollution are 
expected to have high priority 
over many years report said chemicals have brought great 
benefits to american agriculture and consumers and are 
essential for financial viability in most farming situations 
today 
however there is widespread evidence that an overdependence 
on chemical use has developed and much effort is today devoted to 
seeking ways to enable farmers to economize on use of chemicals and 
fertilizer the report said 
last september the national research council issued a 450page 
report alternative agriculture which advocated reduced use of 
farm chemicals and more soilsaving practices such as crop 
rotation the nrc report recommended changes in farm policies to 
help encourage the alternative methods of production 
the nrc report has drawn criticism from some quarters on grounds 
that some of its findings and recommendations were based on 
inadequate research and in some cases onesided assumptions 
at its national convention in florida recently federation 
president dean kleckner expressed skepticism of the concept of 
lowinput sustainable agriculture and alternative farming methods 
conventional agriculture so carefully developed through a 
partnership between our landgrant colleges and farmers themselves 
is indicted as inefficient and wasteful he said this simply 
is not true 
the agriculture department was one of the sponsors of the 
american farmland trust study although most of the financing came 
from private foundations the usda currently is developing lisa or 
lowinput sustainable agriculture as an alternative to heavy 
use of crop chemicals and other practices that jeopardize soil and 
water resources 
some research findings show that many farmers apply excessive 
amounts of fertilizers or pesticides because they lack adequate 
information about what their fields really need or because they use 
very high applications as a form of insurance the report said 
moreover it added in some situations the threat or 
actuality of ground water or surface water pollution is high enough 
that a reduction in the use of chemicals may be necessary for 
health reasons 
crop rotation long recognized as a way to build up soils was 
used by a majority of the farmers in four of the five areas with 
54 percent to 82 percent employing the practice in 1988 the report 
said the exception was in butte county calif where only 20 
percent of those interviewed used rotations 
farmers were also asked whether they followed recommendations of 
fertilizer dealers or those of the federalstate cooperative 
extension services 
among interviewed farmers there were many more clients of 
fertilizer dealers than there were takers of advice from the 
cooperative extension service the report said 
although 75 percent to 90 percent of the farmers favored changes 
in usda commodity programs that would permit planting more acres in 
rotation without losing base acres used to compute federal crop 
benefits most drew the line at a regulatory crackdown on excessive 
chemical use 
one option would require farmers have an approved plan for 
managing pesticide use if crop chemicals were found in their well 
water it was rejected in all five survey sites

mayor marion barrys admission that he needs 
help following his arrest on a drug charge is just the 
beginning says his wife effi who promises to stand by him 
during the most difficult time of his life 
marion for you to admit to the world that you have a problem 
is truly a burden that has been lifted from our souls she 
said sunday your admission of the fact that you need help is the 
first step 
at st timothys episcopal church hall the mayor said he was 
facing the most difficult time of his life his wife stood beside 
him gazing at him with a pained but respectful expression 
frequently during the emotional event barry turned to his wife 
took her hand and squeezed it with a faint smile mrs barry 
patted his hand comfortingly and whispered to him 
following her husbands statement mrs barry announced that she 
and their son christopher 9 would stand by him 
for our family this is just the beginning she said and 
we will be with you every step of the way 
the tumultuous events of the past several days have been nothing 
new for her for 12 years she has defended her husband and blasted 
his critics and the media 
although she has complained of the strain of being the wife of 
the mayor of the nations capital she has helped smooth the rough 
spots in her husbands often controversial career 
she has said that the best image was control friends and 
reporters who have interviewed her frequently said her strength was 
derived from spiritualism and the belief that her friends would be 
there when she needed them 
she knows she has a lot of friends to call on and can draw on 
our strengths ruby mczier a lawyer and good friend it is a 
spiritualism plus sisterhood unspoken but deeply felt 
the mayor asked the city of washington on sunday to be willing 
to forgive him as his wife has done many times during his tenure 
effi cowell barry 45 married barry in february 1978 a few 
months before he was elected to his first term as mayor 
a native of toledo ohio she was working as an environmental 
health inspector at the time of their marriage but has also been 
employed as a school teacher and model 
i think what gives her strength is her love for marion and her 
undying love for christopher one of the childs godparents 
peggy cooper cafritz told the washington post 
she would lay down her life for him whether that means 
suffering time holding her family together against all odds or 
shielding him from the public said cafritz chairman emeritus of 
the district of columbia commission on the arts and humanities 
when barry was arrested thursday night in a hotel room he was 
with a woman who was cooperating with authorities during an 
interview with wrctv in 1987 mrs barry talked about barrys 
association with other women 
since day one i mean since the day we got married hes 
always been involved with other women so they say she said 
its difficult and there are there is a caliber of female in 
this world who tend to gravitate towards a power figure this 
kind of involvement is a necessary nuisance that the wife of a 
power figure has to deal with 
during the same interview she discussed her husbands 
relationship with karen johnson a convicted dealer who barry 
admitted was a personal friend 
he states that it was a nonintimate affair and if he chooses 
to describe it as that i will accept it she said what i 
blame him for is indiscretion

career diplomats got twothirds of the 
ambassadorships during president bushs first year and are likely 
to receive almost all the embassy openings for the rest of his 
term the white house personnel director says 
charles g untermeyer said sunday that despite criticism from 
democrats about ambassadorships being awarded as plums to the 
republican partys biggest benefactors bush has achieved his goal 
of putting diplomatic newcomers in no more than onethird of the 
us embassies 
from now on close to 100 percent of ambassadorial 
appointments will go to career foreign service officers untermeyer 
said in an interview 
henceforth for the rest of the first bush term i expect 
very very few noncareer nominations he said 
by untermeyers count 97 of the 145 ambassadorships have gone 
to career diplomats or 67 percent ninetythree are already in 
place one is awaiting senate confirmation and three are still 
getting cleared before they are formally nominated 
fortyeight ambassadorships have gone or will go to noncareer 
people 42 have been confirmed two are awaiting senate 
confirmation and four are in the white house clearance process one 
of bushs appointees ruth washington the ambassador to gambia 
was killed saturday in an auto accident in new york state 
untermeyer said that 10 or fewer of the noncareer envoys were 
what you could call major donors including several who made the 
gops team 100 by giving 100000 or more to the party for the 
1988 election battle they included real estate developers melvin 
sembler now ambassador to australia and joseph zappala now envoy 
to spain 
many of the noncareer people are there for past proven 
loyalty to george bush said untermeyer but their ranks include 
such relatively poor people as evelyn teegan a former 
republican national committeewoman from minnesota who is now 
ambassador to fiji and sally novetzke a party activist and 
longtime bush loyalist from iowa who is ambassador to malta 
sen paul s sarbanes dmd objected to several of bushs 
politically connected nominees last year and managed to block joy 
silvermans nomination to be ambassador to barbados she gave 
180000 to republican causes before the last election 
untermeyer said the white house has not yet decided whether to 
resubmit her nomination 
the percentage of noncareer envoys is down from roughly 40 
percent at the end of the reagan administration said untermeyer 
the 33 percent goal was achieved recently when bush nominated a 
career diplomat edward rowell to be ambassador to luxembourg 
long a post reserved for presidential pals 
originally bush nominated his chief campaign fundraiser 
frederick bush no relation to the luxembourg post but the 
senate batted that nomination back in august after frederick bush 
came under scrutiny for contracts he received from the reagan 
administrations scandalridden department of housing and urban 
development 
theodore s wilkinson president of the foreign service 
association which represents foreign service officers said the 
noncareer appointments have been very uneven theres some very 
good ones and some very inexperienced ones 
by law wilkinson said even the noncareer appointees are 
supposed to be knowledgeable about the history economics politics 
and language of the country they are assigned to some dont seem 
to meet those criteria said wilkinson 
with congress returning from a twomonth recess untermeyer said 
the white house will send up 30 nominations on tuesday 
some democrats accused bush last year of running a swiss 
cheese government and taking too long to fill vacancies 
but untermeyer said only 5 percent of the 659 top jobs in 
cabinet departments and independent agencies now are vacant 
untermeyer said 327 bush nominees have been confirmed or 
appointed 142 jobs were filled by reagan holdovers 42 are 
awaiting senate confirmation 113 are in the white house clearance 
process and 35 are vacant

supreme court justice sandra day oconnor 
sometimes seems to be shaking her head involuntarily from the 
bench and although other people have noticed and mentioned it to 
her she says she is not aware of it 
court spokeswoman toni house said oconnor has not seen a doctor 
about it and she certainly in no way believes it impedes her 
ability to do her job 
attorneys and others attending the courts oral argument 
sessions first noticed oconnors headshaking in 1985 it seems to 
have become more pronounced in recent months 
the justice answered through her spokeswoman several questions 
posed to her by the associated press about the matter 
she has never had it diagnosed she is not personally aware of 
any such headshaking but she has had people tell her so ms 
house said 
the shaking while not constant is noticeable when it does 
occur it is an upanddown motion similar to that made by someone 
nodding in the affirmative 
when asked about the shaking in 1986 oconnor said simply that 
she was unaware of it

a study says college freshmen are becoming 
more conservative about drugs and crime but more liberal about 
legalized abortion environmental issues and student activism 
the 24th annual survey of entering college freshmen conducted 
jointly by uclas higher education research institute and the 
american council on education released sunday found an abrupt 
change in student attitudes about legalized abortions 
support for legalized abortion which had remained fairly stable 
between 53 percent and 59 percent since 1977 jumped sharply 
between the 1988 and 1989 surveys from 57 percent to 647 percent 
an abrupt change in student attitudes of this magnitude in 
just one year is most unusual said alexander w astin professor 
of higher education at uclas graduate school of education and the 
surveys director it may well reflect the students growing 
concern about the current supreme courts position on this highly 
charged topic 
the survey found that six out of every seven of those questioned 
felt the federal government is not doing enough to control 
environmental pollution 
and 782 percent of the students endorsed greater governmental 
efforts to control handguns a new question asked for the first 
time in 1989 
support for abolition of the death penalty continued its sharp 
decline as did student use of drugs and alcohol the survey found 
a growing tendency toward greater student activism 
the 1989 national survey is based on the responses of 216362 
students at 403 of the nations two and fouryear colleges and 
universities these data have been statistically adjusted to 
reflect the responses of the 16 million firsttime fulltime 
students entering college as freshmen in the fall of 1989

a report by the population institute says more 
schools and more jobs for women would do most to hold down massive 
growth in the numbers of people in the third world 
the report released sunday found a link between ignorance and 
overpopulation 
the population explosion is no longer a prediction its 
already here according to the institute an advocacy group on 
this issue 
the study noted that last year the worlds population increased 
by over 90 million people 
wealthy countries like the united states have ignorant people as 
well as the third world though they are fewer the report said 
that among people in some industrial countries one in 10 is 
functionally illiterate meaning they can read and write some 
but cannot follow printed instructions or write a simple letter 
the report said about 900 million of the worlds 55 billion 
people cannot read and that almost two out of every three 
illiterates are women 
the study reported that women who get only one or two years of 
school tend to have more surviving children rather than fewer 
suggesting that even a little education helps a mother keep her 
babies alive women who stay at school longer get married later and 
know more about contraceptives the report 
said 
the study was prepared by harold n burdett the institutes 
director of information and werner fornos its president

the dollar closed at 14642 yen up 009 yen from fridays 
14633yen close it opened at 14635 yen and ranged between 14635 
yen and 14655 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average recaptured the 37000point 
mark gaining a hefty 42047 points or 114 percent to end the 
day at 3725701 
the nikkei which had nearly reached the 39000point level last 
year has fallen below 37000 points after a series of plunges due 
to rumors and declines in japanese bond prices resulting from the 
weak yen 
despite mondays early recovery in the nikkei the market 
condition has not improved much because of uncertainties over the 
coming election dealers said 
prime minister toshiki kaifu is expected to dissolve the 
512member house of representatives wednesday with balloting set 
for feb 18 local media reported 
the recovery is not for real said a trader with nomura 
securities speaking on condition of anonymity the index seems 
to have hit the bottom for now but the market is still vulnerable 
and investors have little incentive to buy this will continue 
until the election 
in currency dealings the dollar opened higher as market players 
bought the dollar as a safe investment amid uncertainties over the 
ethnic disputes in the soviet republic of azerbaijan traders said 
market players in tokyo were inclined to buy the dollar and sell 
the yen ahead of the election said toru kanai a foreign exchange 
analyst with new japan securities co 
the azerbaijan situation is losing impact on the market here 
and wont result in more dollar buying unless something extreme 
happens such as mikhail gorbachevs resigning he said 
but the yen continues to be weak as the election 
approaches he said 
another trader with the bank of tokyo said the yen is a 
currency that many investors will avoid buying this week ahead 
of the scheduled dissolution of japans lower house of parliament 
meanwhile bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said the 
dollars strength will be met with coordinated intervention by 
central banks of the group of seven nations including the united 
states japan britain and switzerland 
speaking at a branch managers meeting monday mieno said the 
yens recent weekness is related to international political 
uncertainties

man and the heavens have teamed up against 
valdez which in march suffered the worlds worst oil spill and is 
buried under record snows 29 feet so far this winter 
on march 24 the tanker exxon valdez piled up on a charted reef 
about 30 miles south of the harbor bleeding about 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude into the ginclear waters of the 
prince william sound 
exxons muchcriticized cleanup ended in september then winter 
came 
by the new year drifts reached stocking cap level plows turned 
city streets into long white trenches and snow crept halfway up 
firstfloor windows you couldnt say the towns 3000 residents 
were surprised however since valdez average annual snowfall is 
303 inches or 25 feet 
only then it really started snowing 
by late friday after many days of nearconstant snowfall the 
white stuff in the middle of town would have buried a bus and 
still it came down 
the weight of the snow was threatening to cave in roofs and the 
city marshaled all ablebodied snow shovelers as quickly as they 
could be found 
im looking out the window said jack chappel manager of a 
gas station in the middle of downtown and every building i see 
except one has people on the roof removing snow 
as of friday afternoon valdez had received 3493 inches 29 
feet since october said tom ward of the national weather service 
office at least two months of winter remain and the valdez 
snowfall record of 3847 inches could be buried under just one more 
mediumsized drift 
on jan 16 alone 47 inches 4 feet of snow fell a 
singleday record the 134 inches so far this month shattered the 
january snowfall record ward said 
one storm after another has blown in from the south and stalled 
over valdez trapped by the wall of mountains that rises above the 
town ward said 
a weather service measuring stick showed the downtown snow depth 
friday at 7 feet but it was deeper than that in other parts of 
town 
the snow is basically up to the bottom of your secondstory 
window sills said police chief bert cottle 
four vessels in the harbor including a 40foot pleasure boat 
have sunk from the weight of snow on decks harbormaster tim lopez 
said 
its all we can do to keep the docks from sinking he said 
valdez building codes require rooftops to withstand loads of 90 
pounds per square foot twice whats required in anchorage 
whenever weights approach the limit the valdez public works 
department goes on the radio to warn people to get busy 
they got on the radio last week 
in a town built on economic booms from the gold rush to the 
pipeline to the oil spill the big snow has been a boomlet 
at the start of winter the going wage for snow shovelers in 
valdez was around 7 an hour said doris giusti manager of the 
state job service office 
now were up around 16 and even higher than that she said 
weve had jobs paying 20 an hour to shovel snow people are 
getting desperate to get snow off 
workers have been imported from unemployment offices in 
anchorage palmer glennallen and tok giusti said 
so much snow has fallen that shovelers are running out of places 
to stack it 
the city which was moved and rebuilt after the 1964 good friday 
earthquake was laid out so most of the streets end in culdesacs 
along a park strip through the middle of town 
loaders and giant blowers pile the snow into mountains at the 
end of the streets by the weekend some snow mountains reached 
almost as high as utility poles residents said 
street signs are buried all over town and cars have collided 
because drivers couldnt see around corners police said 
no one however has been badly hurt 
we did have an individual fall off a roof yesterday said 
cottle the police chief he wasnt hurt very bad when the 
snows nine feet deep theres not very far to fall 
despite the accumulation valdez has maintained its record for 
never closing school because of snow youre not going to believe 
this but it really hasnt caused us that much of a problem said 
harry rogers the school superintendent

the chants of eastern europes 
prodemocracy protesters as they ousted former communist overlords 
have been sweet music to members of longdeposed royal families 
the revolutionary changes of the past year have buoyed their 
hopes nurtured during decades in exile to reclaim their national 
stature and perhaps even return to the throne 
stifled under decades of communist rule their aspirations have 
now even gained some support at home when a crowd spotted otto von 
hapsburg on a street in budapest hungary in april it chanted 
long live the king 
romanias king michael i waits for his peoples call and 
albanias king leka i would like to come home from south africa 
indeed von hapsburg and king michael appear to have a chance at 
public office if only honorary in their homelands 
the prospect of restoring royalty of course is unthinkable to 
many citizens of eastern europe monarchists seem to be in the 
minority 
hungary plans to establish a multiparty democracy this year 
and romania has tentative plans to follow suit 
in romania even the word dynasty smacks of repression 
reminding most people of the clan of executed dictator nicolae 
ceausescu he ruled like an absolute monarch installing family 
members in key positions 
bernd posselt von hapsburgs spokesman seemed to agree with 
public speculation that his boss might stand a chance to become 
hungarys state president this year 
he said all options are being kept open and the matter is 
again under review 
the aide spoke to the associated press in a recent telephone 
interview from strasbourg france hapsburg the eldest son of king 
karl vi of hungary also emperor karl i of austria is now a 
bavarian deputy in the european parliament 
after the collapse of the austrian empire the hapsburg family 
had to leave austria and settled in switzerland two attempts by 
ottos father to restore the kingdom in hungary in 1919 and 1920 
failed 
during his first official visit to hungary in february von 
hapsburg who is fluent in hungarian received a heros welcome 
during the april visit thousands of hungarians cheered him 
again to chants of long live the king as otto and members of 
his family emerged from a church following a requiem for his mother 
zita the last queen of hungary who died in march at age 96 
in romania the return of 67yearold king michael is seen by 
some romanians as a guarantee that the communist party will never 
again come to power 
on dec 22 the day ceausescu was overthrown the exiled king 
said he was ready to return to his country as head of a 
constitutional monarchy 
i have been waiting for this for 40 years he told a hastily 
convened news conference in geneva near his home in exile if 
people want me to come back of course i will come back 
michael was forced to abdicate in december 1947 amid the 
prospect of civil war and pressure from the kremlin and its 
romanian communist allies 
two of king michaels exiled daughters sophie and margarita 
were privately visiting romania on sunday 
margarita was asked at a news conference whether she was 
surprised by being met at the airport thursday by a group of 
romanians shouting long live the king 
i didnt know what to expect she said we were romanians 
coming home thats the one thing that struck me 
she stressed however that she and her sister have not come 
here in any bid to restore the monarchy i want that to be 
absolutely clear 
my father has waited for 42 years to come back to his country 
as a romanian but as to when or how i dont think i can answer 
right now she said 
king simeon ii of bulgaria where the monarchy was abolished in 
1946 said wednesday he believes his return to his homeland would 
be premature 
im no one to dictate or to impose conditions its not up 
to me anyway its too early for this question he said 
and in another way i would at this point be much more useful 
abroad with my contacts and connections the 52yearold exking 
told the ap from his home in madrid 
by contrast the albanian wouldbe king is eagerly waiting for 
his hour of triumph at his home in a suburb of johannesburg 
king leka an exile for all his 50 years believes political 
upheaval in the soviet bloc will ignite an uprising among the 
people of albania the last hardline communist state in the region 
reports in yugoslav and greek news media about recent unrest and 
casualties in shkodra and other albanian cities have been denied by 
albanian officials 
if a revolution comes leka says he would be proud to follow 
the footsteps of his father king zog i 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage the 
british bible of europes bluest blood said last week that this 
upheaval in eastern europe is the last chance in my opinion that 
these contenders have to reestablish their thrones 
the fact that king michael and otto von hapsburg are immensely 
popular with political groups pushing for their restoration has 
moved this from fairytale stage to world stage he told the ap 
in london 
grand duke vladimir 72yearold head of the imperial house of 
romanov and heir to the russian throne has even urged restoration 
of the russian monarchy 
on friday at a ball the russian royal family held in london to 
raise funds for the russian orthodox church there vladimir told a 
reporter russian people would think quite seriously about a 
monarchial form of government a monarchy would be something for 
them to rally round 
during the ball the imperial russian anthem god preserve the 
czar was played over and over

the tokyo stock exchanges key index surged back 
above 37000 points today and the dollar edged up against the 
japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 42047 points or 114 
percent closing at 3725701 
the nikkei which nearly had reached 39000 points at the end of 
last year turned around in early january and fell below 37000 in 
a series of plunges triggered by rumors and declines in japanese 
government bond prices resulting from the weak yen 
today market players were no longer pessimistic about the 
japanese government bond prices and the index finally began 
rising after so many losses said kazuyuki suzuki a dealer with 
daiwa securities co 
suzuki said todays increase came in the absence of active 
selling 
some market players were still reluctant to buy actively and 
the market has just begun to make up for the losses its energy 
hasnt returned to the normal level he added 
trading was extremely thin with only 350 million shares 
changing hands on the first section the volume today was the 
lowest in five months suzuki said 
the recovery is not for real said a trader with nomura 
securities speaking on condition of anonymity 
the index seems to have hit bottom for now but the market is 
still vulnerable and investors have little incentive to buy he 
said this will continue until the election 
the markets are waiting to see the fate of the probusiness 
liberal democratic party in elections for parliaments lower house 
expected feb 18 last july it lost its majority in the upper 
house for the first time in 34 years 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14642 yen up 009 
yen from fridays 14633yen close it opened at 14635 yen and 
ranged between 14635 yen and 14655 yen 
the dollar rose quickly in early trading as market players 
adjusted their oversold dollar positions traders said 
but the market then became concerned about possible central bank 
intervention to support the yen and some players sold dollars to 
take profits said yuji nakao a trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
he said the dollar attracted investors more than any other 
currency amid ethnic troubles in the soviet union and political 
uncertainties here 
the dollar was also stronger against the west german mark 
he said market players sold the mark for profittaking as well 
as for fear of uncertainties in eastern europe 
the german mark had been bought heavily as democratization 
movements progressed in the east bloc but market players believe 
the key to such movements is the stability of mikhail gorbachevs 
leadership in the soviet union nakao said 
about 572 billion changed hands in spot trading today

frantic and prison officials are uneasy davids father who set 
fire to his son in a bungled 1983 murdersuicide plan walks out of 
prison this week 
sixyearold david survived the flames but was horribly 
disfigured the jarring crime was portrayed in david a 1988 
abctv movie starring bernadette peters and john glover 
if convicted under current laws charles rothenberg would be 
imprisoned for life but sentencing laws in place at the time force 
the state to release rothenberg after less than seven years behind 
bars 
we are not comfortable with it said tipton kindel 
spokesman for the state department of corrections the crime was 
absolutely disgusting to the rest of society and we are not 
entirely comfortable with him walking free 
it makes it seem like the department of corrections is letting 
him go but that isnt so we have to let him go 
rothenberg 49 leaves the state prison in san luis obispo on 
wednesday but prison officials are keeping relocation plans 
secret conceding they fear a repeat of the 1987 larry singleton 
hysteria 
singleton who raped a teenage girl and left her for dead after 
hacking off her forearms with an ax was driven from northern 
california communities by an outraged public and eventually served 
his year on parole in a trailer at san quentin prison 
after a telephone argument with his exwife rothenberg set fire 
to his son in a buena park motel room on march 3 1983 if i 
cant have him nobody else can rothenberg said telling 
authorities he was going to kill himself but was too much of a 
coward 
do i deserve to be set free no its an unforgivable act 
rothenberg said in a december letter to the los angeles times 
rothenberg said he didnt know where he was going to live during 
his threeyears parole 
david his mother marie and stepfather richard hafdahl also 
are not being told where rothenberg is resettling except that he 
wont be within 25 miles of them kindel said 
hafdahl a police officer who met david and his mother while 
supervising the fire investigation said marie and her son were 
upset 
she doesnt trust him and david is terrified weve talked 
about it and we have security measures i wont go into hafdahl 
said 
rothenberg had taken david who lived in new york at the time 
on vacation to southern california and checked them into a motel 
near knotts berry farm 
he gave the boy a sleeping pill poured kerosene on the his bed 
kissed him goodbye and struck a match in the doorway he watched 
from a telephone booth across the street as flames consumed the 
motel room 
david dragged from the inferno by motel guests suffered 
thirddegree burns over 90 percent of his body 
the boy now 13 will have to endure periodic skin grafts until 
he is fully grown hafdahl said 
rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder arson and other 
charges and got a maximum 13year prison term that was halved 
because of good behavior he will be closely watched while on 
parole 
although hes not confined to a prison he will be under 
intense scrutiny to make sure he is complying with the conditions 
of parole said kindel 
rothenberg must stay away from his son exwife and hafdahl he 
cannot leave his parole jurisdiction must report regularly to his 
parole officer and he must submit to weekly psychiatric counseling 
sessions 
i dont want to ever see you again because you know im 
afraid that youll try to hurt me again david told his father in

exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood has gotten 
used to the notoriety that came with command of the vessel involved 
in the nations worst oil spill but hes surprised at the tenacity 
of his critics 
im handling infamy reasonably well he told life magazine 
for its february issue but its amazing how it wont go away 
hazelwood who goes on trial jan 29 in anchorage alaska on 
charges stemming from the disaster said he had received death 
threats at his home and was tired of being portrayed as a drunken 
bum with a parrot on my shoulder who drove his ship aground 
the oil tanker captain who has a history of alcoholism has 
been accused of drinking the night of the accident which spilled 
about 11 million gallons of oil into the prince william sound he 
denies the claim and said exxon corp has made him a scapegoat 
prosecutors said he should have been at the helm since he was 
the ships only authorized navigator for the sound his lawyers say 
the coast guard relaxed the rules in 1986 
hazelwood has pleaded innocent he faces more than seven years 
in prison and 65000 in fines if convicted asked if he expected 
justice he replied you mean like a frank capra movie 
the 43yearold skipper said exxon has made him a scapegoat he 
said he was flushed down the toilet in twoaday press 
conferences by officials trying to give the impression that 
containment and cleanup were my responsibility as well 
for three days until easter sunday night when the wind came 
up that big puddle of oil didnt impact the shore i was shocked 
by the lack of response initially angry and amazed 
since getting fired by exxon he has made his living lobstering

people with aids should reach normal life 
expectancy during the 1990s as treatments become available to make 
aids a manageable disease a leading government researcher says 
i have a good deal of confidence that we can look forward 
to the 1990s as the kind of a decade where that goal can be 
realized said dr anthony fauci director of the national 
program to test and evaluate new antiaids drugs he spoke at the 
new yorkitaly medical symposium in new york 
fauci is the director of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases in bethesda md one of the national 
institutes of health the institute operates a national aids 
drugtesting program in which some 10000 people are subjects in 
experimental tests at 46 medical centers across the country 
learning to manage and control aids is not the same as curing 
it fauci said the treatments of the 1990s probably will have to 
be contined for life in people infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv that causes aids he said 
fauci said he based his optimistic prediction for the 1990s on 
the growing understanding of the workings of the aids virus the 
success in aids treatment achieved so far and a philosophical 
shift in the way government makes new drugs available 
until now aids drugs have been developed largely by screening 
available substances for possible antiviral activity he said the 
increasing understanding of how the virus infects cells kills them 
and reproduces is leading to new drugs aimed directly at each of 
those steps in the virus growth fauci said 
already there are several drugs ready to go into human 
clinical trials that have been specifically tailored to hiv 
fauci said 
fauci said researchers scored several successes against aids 
during the 1980s 
first they improved care of the sick in 1985 less than 40 
percent of people diagnosed with aids survived 18 months by 1987 
60 percent lived at least that long after diagnosis fauci said 
second researchers discovered that treatment could be helpful 
in people who are infected with hiv but have not yet become sick 
for example drugs to protect against pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia an often fatal aids complication can now sharply reduce 
its frequency 
azt the current mainstay of treatment in people sick with aids 
has been shown to significantly delay the progression or onset of 
symptoms in people infected with hiv but not yet sick fauci said 
there are now hundreds of thousands who can benefit from early 
intervention he said 
third the government has decided to relax its grip on 
experimental drugs in cases where the drugs offer hope to people 
whose lives are threatened and who have few other options fauci 
said 
he was referring to the socalled parallel track program in 
which promising experimental drugs are made available to patients 
who need them before experiments have conclusively determined their 
effectiveness 
this is a philosophical change that needs to be integrated 
into our way of thinking he said 
it means that the government will not be able to guarantee the 
effectiveness or the safety of those drugs fauci said 
the responsibility for accepting the increased risks associated 
with such drugs is going to shift to the individuals taking the 
drugs he said

new administrations usually shake up 
city hall when they take office but some municipal employees are 
worried its the kids who will turn things topsyturvy 
a few weeks after mayor paul gionfriddo was elected in november 
the liberal democrat announced that municipal employees would be 
allowed to bring their children to work in an emergency 
with three children under age 5 gionfriddo knew he would have 
to let his kids join him at the office occasionally so it was only 
fair that other city workers have that right 
the policy has provoked considerable debate and employees who 
say they might take advantage of the new rule are hard to find 
to be honest i dont think id bring them in here i dont 
think i could get any work done said teresa milardo a tax 
department clerk who keeps pictures of her two daughters ages 2 
and 6 in a plastic frame on her desk 
with the 2yearold where would i change her diaper 
milardo asked besides shed constantly want to go to the water 
fountain it would be a distraction for everyone 
gionfriddos son timothy 4 and 3yearold daughter larissa 
already have visited at least twice they spent most of the time 
coloring or pecking away on typewriters once it was because the 
mayors wife had to take their youngest child a 6monthold to 
the doctor on a day when the two others were not in day care 
even the best daycare arrangements fall short of the need 
when there are sicknesses or holidays you have to have some kind 
of backstop said the 36yearold mayor whose wife is a 
consultant and scholar on child development a police sergeant 
working as a desk supervisor became the first municipal employee in 
this central connecticut city of 43000 to take advantage of the 
policy 
george r dingwalls pregnant wife brought their 3yearold 
daughter alyssa to the station for a couple of hours jan 10 when 
she had to make a visit to the doctors office on short notice 
alyssa showed up with a barbie doll and other toys and spent 
her time quietly watching sesame street munching cookies and 
getting a tour from civilians in parking and records dingwall said 
reaction was generally favorable he said and i wouldnt 
hestitate to do it again if the same circumstances presented 
themselves 
the mayors order stipulates that a child must stay inside with 
his or her parent or grandparent as the case may be and not 
interfere with anyones work when possible the employee is 
supposed to get permission of a supervisor beforehand 
political rivals pounced on the edict as an early sign voters 
erred in choosing gionfriddo an 11year veteran of the 
legislature over the incumbent mayor republican sebastian j 
garafalo 
the policy was lambasted in the hartford courant which accused 
the mayor in an editorial of trying to turn city hall into a 
playpen but the middletown press called the plan a gutsy move that 
was worth a try 
a psychologist at yale university who is a colleague of 
gionfriddos wife also came to the mayors defense 
i think it is a kind of experimental effort that ought to be 
applauded rather than decried said edward f zigler one of the 
architects of the federal head start program 
gionfriddos wife linda rammler is working on her doctorate in 
developmental psychology and is a fellow at the yale child 
development center that zigler directs 
the mayor acknowledged that some workers suggest he instituted 
the policy only to justify the presence of his own children and he 
said he recognizes that many workers have jobs that simply wont 
allow them to bring their children to work 
its clear that a policeman on patrol or a someone riding a 
snowplow wont benefit from this he said but you dont deny 
everyone the opportunity because they cant 
its far better to have the secretary at work with the kids 
than sitting at home

in a campaign marked by charges of 
racebaiting sidney barthelemy a black mayor seeking reelection 
in a mostly black city faces a strong challenge from a white who 
never ran for office before 
donald mintz a lawyer who last year resigned as chairman of the 
local dock board so he could run for barthelemys job is expected 
to carry a majority among whites who make up 444 percent of the 
237342 voters registered for the feb 3 election 
once an ally of the late dutch morial the citys first black 
mayor mintz has worked aggressively to lure black voters away from 
barthelemy 
mintzs campaign first accused barthelemy of trying to separate 
the city along racial lines in november when a coalition of black 
ministers endorsed barthelemy 
the minister that i follow is the rev dr martin luther king 
and he judged a person on the content of their character and not 
the color of their skin said mintz campaign manager michael 
bagneris who is black if racebaiting is wrong when white folks 
do it its wrong when black folks do it 
the issue resurfaced this month when barthelemys campaign ran 
a series of radio advertisements praising his record of promoting 
and appointing blacks let us not be fooled by the claims of a 
white politician two of the ads say 
mintz replied its fraud to stand up here and say im 
against racism and antisemitism and then resort to tactics that 
racially divide the community 
but barthelemys campaign manager reynard rochon said the 
only person who keeps bringing up race in this election is donald 
mintz hes trying to use a psychological thing on the black 
community making them feel like theyre racist if they support 
sidney 
barthelemy said in an interview that the ads just tell the black 
community what he has done for blacks he accused mintz of starting 
the racebaiting by distributing an anonymous flier showing 
barthelemy with a halfwhite face 
i know people in his campaign who said they put them out 
barthelemy said though he would not name his sources 
mintz who was unavailable for an interview has denied anyone 
in his campaign published the flier which he described as trash 
while race has played a part in the campaign high crime low 
employment and the political experience and competence of the 
candidates have been the major issues 
in television ads the mintz campaign touts its man as a 
tough capable leader and cites a fortune magazine article 
describing new orleans as one of the nations five worstmanaged 
cities 
mintz blames barthelemy for the citys loss of 20000 jobs in 
four years and complains that low police morale has contributed to 
a rising crime rate the city had 249 murders in 1989 a record for 
a single year 
barthelemy who took office in 1986 facing a 30 million deficit 
left by the morial administration counters that he has brought new 
orleans back from its worst depression ever brought on by the 
collapse of the oil industry 
he says projects begun under his mandate will bring in 12000 
jobs during the next few years 
barthelemy has hit hard at mintz lack of public experience and 
said the new orleans port lost hundreds of millions of dollars a 
year under mintz 
early polls showed mintz leading barthelemy and also gave 
morial mayor from 1978 until 1986 a good chance of retaking the 
office he was not legally allowed to hold for three consecutive 
terms 
morial decided against running however and died of a heart 
attack the day before christmas without making an endorsement 
a poll taken for wwltv on jan 5 showed barthelemy leading 
mintz 44 percent to 33 percent with the remaining 23 percent of 
the voters undecided

an expert says the christmas freeze may 
be responsible for killing at least 24 bottlenose dolphins that 
were found floating or washed ashore in matagorda bay over the 
weekend 
the kill is the worst on the texas coast in a decade officials 
said 
volunteers on sunday helped pull the carcasses from matagorda 
bay about halfway between galveston and corpus christi on the gulf 
coast 
experts from the texas marine mammal stranding network planned 
to examine the carcasses today to determine what killed the 
animals said mike carvan at the organizations office in 
galveston but tests could take months and the exact cause of death 
may never be known officials said 
the threeday freeze which ruined much of the south texas 
citrus crop and dumped snow on houston killed thousands of fish 
along the texas coast it may have doomed the dolphins as well 
said game warden arthur lawrence 
several acres of this bay was covered with ice a slushytype 
of ice material and apparently it made it hard for these dolphins 
to breathe said lawrence some of them probably became 
disoriented and stunned as a result of this cold and icy weather 
and they can suffocate and suffer pneumonia just like a human 
game wardens worked during the freeze to break up ice in the 
marshy areas around the bay 
a helicopter pilot spotted floating dolphin carcasses in 
matagorda bay late saturday lawrence said after an early morning 
search of the area sunday wildlife officials were unable to find 
any of the dolphins alive 
i came out to check if the animals were in stress and found 
they were already partially decomposed lawrence said 
it aint fair it aint right said hf fuselier a 
matagorda fisherman as he watched coast guard members hoist a 
7foot male dolphins carcass into the bed of a pickup 
rose folmar a bartender at allens landing in matagorda who was 
helping monitor the recovery effort said some volunteers doubted 
the freeze theory because its been so long since the cold snap 
thats whats puzzling ms folmar said if the freeze was 
about a month ago why are the dead dolphins showing up now we 
wont really know until the biologists tell us after the 
autopsies 
others suggested that toxic pollutants from coastal industries 
might have contributed to the kill 
searchers also found thousands of dead mullet tough fish that 
normally remain in the bay during cold weather while prized redfish 
and speckled trout instinctively head for deep water

thousands of mongolians demanding democratic 
reform from communist rulers defied a government ban and rallied in 
their capital for a second straight week a western source said 
today 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said police made 
no attempt to break up the rally on the central square of ulan 
bator despite the ban on such unauthorized assemblies imposed 
thursday 
sundays rally by about 5000 people organized by the mongolian 
democratic union lasted nearly two hours in temperatures of about 
minus nine 
the union which claims 70000 supporters has presented the 
first open organized opposition to a government ruled by the 
communist party since 1921 longer than any other country outside 
mongolias patron state the soviet union 
the reform group organized two small demonstrations in december 
and another on jan 14 that drew about 5000 it had official 
permission for all three of those gatherings 
so far both sides appear to be trying to avoid a confrontation 
although the governments ban and the groups latest protest 
suggests they are hardening their positions 
at sundays demonstration people carried banners reading if 
people are rich the mongolian nation will be rich and calling 
for an end to special privileges for officials 
one banner written in english read we support perestroika and 
glasnost a reference to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
programs of reform and openness 
another group calling itself the democratic socialist movement 
and saying it was more radical than the democratic union passed out 
fliers calling for a free press a multiparty system adherence to 
the un declaration on human rights more independence in the 
economic sphere and greater protection of the national culture 
mongolias economy and culture have long been dominated by the 
soviet union the russian cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted 
in 1946 the traditional mongolian script was banned until about 
five years ago 
many of mongolias 2 million people dispersed across grasslands 
roughly the size of western europe still have deep links to their 
herdsman traditions and the nations small amount of industry 
sprang largely from soviet or east european aid 
the leader of the democratic union 27yearold sanjaasuren 
zorig speaking at a news conference after the rally did not rule 
out confrontation with the government however he said his group 
puts great hopes on the sober minds of government leaders 
according to the western source 
zorig said his group regards itself as a guarantor for 
developing and deepening democracy in mongolia and said it stands 
for a multiparty system 
he blamed mongolias low level of economic development on 
central controls over the economy and state ownership of property

for travel to kennedy space center in florida a nasa spokeswoman 
said 
ground crews were making special efforts to protect the 
shuttles cargo for the voyage atop a jetliner scheduled to begin 
thursday 
the work is proceeding very well the orbiter appears to be 
very healthy as does ldef spokeswoman patricia phillips said

the rescued laboratory satellite 
columbia and five astronauts landed at this mojave desert 
military base early saturday ending a recordlength shuttle flight 
of nearly 11 days 
during the mission the astronauts deployed a navy 
communications satellite then used the shuttles robot arm to 
retrieve the ldef which soon would have fallen into earths 
atmosphere and burned if it had not been rescued 
about a third of the ldefs 57 experiments will help researchers 
learn what materials can withstand long periods in space and thus 
might be suitable for building us space station freedom which 
nasa hopes to operate in the mid1990s 
the satellite will not be removed from columbias cargo bay 
until after the shuttle returns to florida on friday night riding 
piggyback atop a modified boeing 747 
phillips said nasa hopes the piggyback jet ride will start early 
thursday with a refueling stop at davismontham air force base 
near tucson ariz before stopping for the night at kelly air 
force base near san antonio on friday the shuttle will refuel at 
eglin air force base in floridas panhandle before finally arriving 
at kennedy space center she said 
to protect ldef from contamination ground crews started pumping 
cool conditioned air and nitrogen into the cargo bay even before 
columbia was towed off the concrete runway saturday morning 
phillips said 
national aeronautics and space administration and contractor 
employees worked on columbia on sunday while it sat inside the 
large steel girder structure called the matedemate device where 
it will be mounted atop the jet later in the week 
overall the vehicle is in excellent condition any damage is 
minimal phillips said

communist premier hans modrow bowed to 
pressure from opposition groups and agreed today to rebuild the 
east german government to include prodemocracy groups 
modrows concession came one day after the communist partys no 
2 leader quit and called for the partys dissolution 
the resignation followed an emergency meeting of the embattled 
party leadership which made other moves to placate the populace by 
expelling ousted leader egon krenz and 13 other former politburo 
members 
the leadership which replaced communist hardliners last year 
during a peaceful popular revolt has been trying to appease an 
opposition movement that is upset with the pace of promised reforms 
modrow and opposition leaders also showed rare agreement in 
denouncing a report today by the masscirculation west german 
newspaper bild which claimed army and secret police agents were 
jointly planning a coup 
ibrahim boehme of the influential opposition social democratic 
party told politicians a coalition with communists and other 
established parties was possible if all parties and groups are 
prepared to enter the government on an emergency basis without 
weekslong negotiations 
he made the comment at a session of weekly talks on reform 
between the government and opposition groups 
east germanys first free elections are to be held on may 6 but 
broad differences between the communistdominated government and 
opposition groups have delayed economic reform measures and 
hindered the transition to democracy 
modrow today proposed that the fractious political forces meet 
wednesday to consider a new cabinet 
it is my intention to give a new quality to our cooperation 
modrow told representatives of more than a dozen fledgling parties 
and reform movements during todays talks between the government 
and the opposition our expectation of your constructive advice 
underscores this intention 
i appeal to the representatives of the new parties at the 
round table to enter the government as cabinet members in order 
to form a broad coalition modrow said 
with his offer modrow has made clear that the communists are 
willing to give up some of the ministerial posts they control to 
allow groups such as new forum the social democrats and other 
unofficial parties to gain a role in government 
communists now dominate the 27member cabinet led by modrow 
with 16 ministerial posts compared with four for the officially 
approved liberal democrats three for the christian democrats and 
two each for the national democrats and the farmers party 
opposition groups have indicated they would take part in running 
the government only if they are offered ministerial posts 
the communists attempt to keep their party from collapsing were 
compounded by sundays announcement that their no 2 official 
wolfgang berghofer had abandoned the party with an urgent 
demand for the partys dissolution 
berghofer 46 the partys deputy chairman since december and a 
leading popular reformer resigned along with 39 other prominent 
party members from dresden of which he is mayor 
the moves were expected to trigger mass defections from the 
party its membership in the country of 163 million people has 
plunged to 12 million from nearly 23 million in 1987 
in a statement broadcast on west germans ard television 
berghofer said the citizens of the german democratic republic 
need trust and courage for the future since tens of thousands are 
still leaving their homeland 
about 30000 east germans have moved to west germany this year 
following an exodus of more than 340000 in 1989 
in his statement berghofer said he and the other party 
defectors would support social democratic principles he is 
widely reported to be moving to the opposition social democratic 
party 
government television said berghofers move put the partys 
future in extreme danger 
modrow also announced the resignation of communist finance 
minister uta nickel the target of a criminal inquiry into alleged 
financial irregularities ms nickel has denied wrongdoing 
the hamburgbased bild newspaper in contending a coup was in 
the works said a general strike could be used as the pretext for 
an armed takeover 
i must decisively reject as provocation a report in todays 
bild newspaper modrow said at the governmentopposition talks 
today 
boehme of the social democratic party said the bild report 
undermines public confidence in the government new forum delegate 
ingrid koeppe also criticized the report 
about 60000 anticommunist protesters marched across the border 
sunday to west germany and back ard said about 60000 people took 
part in the march across the border at duderstadt near the west 
german city goettingen police in goettingen put the figure at 
between 20000 to 25000 
through their purges the communists appeared to be trying to 
further distance themselves from the repressive rule of erich 
honecker 
at a daylong meeting that ended early sunday the communists 
rejected demands to disband but offered the opposition 
coresponsibility in the government until the may elections 
krenz immediately appealed his expulsion after replacing 
honecker he quickly opened the berlin wall on nov 9 and promised 
democratic reform but he was ousted after six weeks in office

a communist party official today 
called on other disenchanted members to begin talks on forming a 
new political group more willing to embrace democracy 
slobodan lang a delegate to an important party congress to 
discuss the organizations fate is among five delegates who have 
proposed that the party split into a reformoriented socialist 
party and a traditional communist party 
lang called for communists attending the national congress 
which moved into its third day today to meet and discuss the 
measure 
the congress has been marked by bitter debate between 
hardliners seeking to slow the pace of political change and 
liberals who say the communists must give up their guaranteed 
leading role in society or risk intensified popular unrest 
communist government leaders say that whatever the outcome of 
the congress they will press on with the introduction of a 
multiparty system and organize free elections for april in the 
balkan nation of 23 million people 
debate was to begin today on amendments to a key reform document 
that declares the prtys willingness to relinquish its monopoly on 
power 
the daily newspaper vecernje novosti said lang and other 
reformers want the document also to declare the communists 
intention to divide into two parties 
communists from the liberal republic of slovenia have urged that 
the party transform itself into a loose coalition of regional 
communist parties in this nation of six federated republics and two 
provinces 
such a move would radically transform yugoslav politics 
significantly reducing the power of the national communist party 
which has run the country for all its 44 years but is gradually 
losing its grip in more liberal regions 
opponents of ending the communist monopoly in the nonaligned 
country contend party unity is vital to the unity of yugoslavia 
which is facing its worst economic crisis and is beset by ethnic 
rivalries 
they are led by delegates from serbia the countrys largest 
republic who want to maintain strong centralized control of the 
economic and political system 
vice premier zivko pregl warned sunday that the government would 
not allow the fate of the nation to be decided in quarrels among 
people representing 10 percent of the population referring to 
the 2 million party members 
he said the government intends to press ahead with the april 
elections under a multiparty system and that the communists in the 
future will only be relevant to the extent they succeed in 
elections 
a draft of the document outlining changes in the partys status 
declares its willingness to support free elections and the 
formation of independent political groups 
slovenia has long supported greater pluralism and was the first 
to announce plans to hold free elections its delegation wanted the 
reform document adopted immediately 
but serbian delegates said they preferred its adoption in a 
package with other resolutions in an apparent attempt to lessen 
its impact 
the head of the communistled popular organization socialist 
alliance in slovenia joze smole said today that slovenia had a 
mandate from its party to adopt the document 
he said if it were not passed by the congress there was a 
strong possibility the slovenian delegation might walk out of the 
meeting 
in debate sunday serbias populist president slobodan 
milosevic reiterated his support for a strong communist party 
he charged that those seeking decentralization of the party were 
calling for a war among yugoslav communists and a war among 
yugoslav nations 
we dont have a united communist party it is only a farce 
responded slovenian delgate milos ciric we dont want to impose 
our liberal model on serbia and we will not allow serbia to impose 
its model on us either 
delegate branko horvat leader of the newly organized union of 
yugoslavs for democratic initiative suggested the party to divide 
in two groups democratic socialists and nondemocratic 
authoritarians 
he said the party had destroyed unity in the country 
several independent political groups and parties announced their 
formation over the weekend bringing the number of such 
organizations to 70

troops were posted along irans border 
with the embattled soviet republic of azerbaijan to prevent people 
from crossing the frontier tehran radio said today 
the report monitored in nicosia said soviet moslems from 
azerbaijan who had crossed into iran for visits would be allowed 
back but no one else would be allowed through 
it did not specify whether the soviet union or iran deployed 
troops to seal the border 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass said azerbaijanis and 
iranians continue to cross the border en masse in both directions 
on parts of the border but other sections have been stabilized 
it said soviet and iranian frontier guard commissars met at the 
border town of astara to decide what measures should be taken to 
secure the frontier but the report did not specify what agreement 
if any had been reached 
a trickle of visitors from the soviet province who share a 
common language culture and religion with their kin across the 
iranian border began after soviet azerbaijanis demonstrated in 
early january to demand the border be opened 
border guards on both sides ignored the crossings 
the trickle turned into a flood of more than 20000 over the 
past four days the radio reported after clashes between christian 
armenians and moslem azerbaijanis in the southern soviet union 
erupted in violence and the soviet army intervened to stop the 
fighting 
while the earlier crossings were on the western part of the 
400mile border across the araks river over the past week 
thousands have come across at the caspian sea city of astara and 
nearby bilehsavar 
tehran radio said the troops were deployed this morning to stop 
the flow with only those two points open to allow the soviet 
moslems to return home 
iranian leaders had welcomed the soviet visitors with open arms 
and cautioned moscow to use peaceful means rather than violence to 
stem the fighting 
but with thousands of refugees streaming across the border 
tehran fears passions among its own 15 million azerbaijanis could 
be aroused 
nationalists in mineralrich soviet azerbaijan want to secede 
from the soviet union and unite with iranian azerbaijan the ethnic 
region was once part of persia until russian expansion under the 
tsars eventually forced its division in 1828 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on friday blamed moslem 
fanatics for the violence echoing longheld soviet fears that 
irans revolutionary zealots would seek to inflame the 70 million 
moslems who live in the soviet unions southern republics 
soviet media said iran had been supplying arms to the moslems in 
azerbaijan which the iranian media denied 
iran on sunday called on the soviet union to halt violent 
clashes with moslems in azerbaijan iran television reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said president hashemi 
rafsanjani instructed foreign minister ali akbar velayati to take 
serious steps to solve problems and end bloodshed and violence in 
the moslem republic that borders northwest iran 
the violence erupted when a simmering feud between the 
azerbaijanis and the armenians flared again jan 13 over control of 
the armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh the region has been part 
of azerbaijan since 1923 
iran which proclaimed itself to be the beacon for the worlds 1 
billion moslems says harsh measures against the azerbaijanis by 
moscow would anger the worlds moslems 
but the leadership appears to be also reluctant to damage its 
relations with moscow while it seeks to revitalize its battered 
economy following the 1988 ceasefire in the eightyear war with 
iraq

although reynolds officials say they havent given up on uptown 
they concede that theyll have to find another way to market the 
brand if they decide to keep it and other tobacco companies may 
face new criticism over their old strategy of marketing to women 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan who was 
among the strongest critics of uptown said last week that he also 
plans to attack cigarette companies that target women 
we should be doing things to improve the health of our 
citizens not impairing the health he said so that when a 
tobacco company profits from this indeed the rest of society our 
insurance companies our hospitals our companies also hurt 
charyn sutton marketing consultant for the american lung 
association noted that lung cancer recently became the no 1 
cancer in women 
the possibility of a rise in lung cancer among blacks is a 
very scary scary prospect and especially when you look at a 
community already overburdened with smokingrelated diseases 
sutton said if you give black people a cigarette of their own 
death rates will go into the stratosphere 
black men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than 
white men according to the us public health service and 
compared with whites blacks lose twice as many years of life 
because of smokingrelated diseases 
the rev jesse brown president of the philadelphiabased 
committee to prevent cancer among blacks said the uptown protest 
was designed to say to rj reynolds we do not need another 
instrument of destruction to come into the africanamerican 
community 
after dropping the philadelphia test a spokesman for reynolds 
admitted the companys strategy may have been flawed 
maybe in retrospect we would have been better off not saying 
we were marketing to blacks but those were the smokers we were 
going after so why shouldnt we be honest about it david b 
fishel told the new york times 
rather than simply feature black models in its advertisements 
for uptown reynolds openly announced its intentions according to 
brown that may have been uptowns downfall 
brown said he doubted the opponents would have been as enraged 
if the company had taken a more subtle approach quietly putting up 
billboards in black neighborhoods and advertising in black 
publications 
we saw something big coming down the pike and a lot of 
people were incensed about it he said the key was that they 
said they were going to target africanamericans and it the 
cigarette is deadly 
the american cancer society in philadelphia started making plans 
to block the test market around new years shortly after it was 
announced said dr carl mansfield the local cancer society 
president 
within a week the coalition against uptown cigarettes was 
formed nearly 30 religious health and black community groups 
joined 
the uproar reached a peak when sullivan last week asked reynolds 
to halt the campaign of slick and sinister advertising 
but marketing consumer products especially cigarettes to 
specific groups is not new 
philip morris cos virginia slims defined women as a lucrative 
cigarette market 
many have linked the increase in smoking among women with the 
introduction of virginia slims and its competitors in 1986 lung 
cancer surpassed breast cancer as the most prevalent cancer in 
women 
one of the things we felt clearly was this the uptown 
campaign was a replication of a marketing strategy they had 
success with in selling cigarettes to women sutton said 
unlike the uptown protest sutton said womens groups didnt 
oppose virginia slims in part because philip morris underwrote many 
womens activities particularly sports 
the tobacco industry has been vying for the loyalties of smaller 
and smaller segments of a shrinking smoking public by offering 
specialized brands 
reynolds premier a smokeless cigarette that produced few 
ashes failed in test markets in 1989 after some smokers complained 
it had a peculiar taste and aroma 
philip morris later introduced superslims a cigarette the 
company says emits 70 percent less smoke 
with its uptown campaign reynolds ran a risk of reawakening the 
lingering desires to ban all cigarette advertising said jack 
trout a partner in trout amp ries greenwich connbased marketing 
consultants 
for the few tiny dollars they are going to pick up by 
penetrating the black market they are going to enrage everyone 
it just gives ammunition to the antis trout said shortly before 
reynolds canceled the test market 
reynolds spokeswoman maura payne said the company could decide 
on the cigarettes fate sometime this week although it would not 
immediately decide the time or location of a test market

scientists made final inspections of a threestage 
rocket today as japan prepared to become the third nation to send a 
spacecraft to the moon 
our staffs have almost finished the final check of electrical 
systems of the spacecraft so far everythings perfect said 
tadashige takiya a spokesman for the institute of space and 
astronautical science in kagoshima in southern japan 
if tuesdays flight is successful japans musesa would be the 
first spacecraft to visit the moon since the soviet union landed 
the unmanned vehicle luna 24 on its surface in 1976 the united 
states is the only other nation that has sent spacecraft to the 
moon 
the launch is scheduled at 848 pm 648 am est tuesday 
from the kagoshima space center takiya said 
the plan is to send the musesa into a highly elliptical earth 
orbit that will bring it about 10000 miles from the moon on march 
18 
japanese space centers are incapable of tracing the flight all 
the way so centers in canberra australia and at california 
institute of technology will help takiya said 
the craft is to release a smaller satellite just before crossing 
the moons orbit a kick motor aboard the smaller craft will 
propel it into a lunar orbit the institute said 
the smaller satellite is to send data to the mother satellite on 
space temperatures and electric fields while the mother satellite 
continues circling earth swinging by the moon and collecting data 
on space dust and other phenomena 
the governmentfunded flight will be the 13th satellite launched 
by japan and the fifth use of the m3s2 rocket 
the japanese rocket an m3s2 made by nissan motor co is a 
threestage solidfuel rocket that weighs 62 tons 
japans rocket program has shown a high success rate but last 
august the national space development agency had its first failure 
in 20 launchings when the first stage of an h1 rocket failed to 
ignite

three active homosexuals have been ordained 
as lutheran priests an unprecedented act that brought joy to some 
of their parishioners and threats of expulsion from church 
officials 
jeff johnson 27 was installed sunday as assistant pastor at 
the first united lutheran church in san franciscos workingclass 
richmond district ruth frost 42 and phyllis zillhart 32 were 
installed in the same roles at st francis lutheran church near the 
largely gay castro district 
this is not something new we are already part of the church 
and now we want to be recognized for the gifts we offer 
zillhart said at a weekend news conference 
all three of the new ministers were removed from a list of 
ordainable clergy after they refused to agree to celibacy often 
required of known homosexual pastors but not of heterosexual ones 
in the lutheran denomination 
the dissident churches one of them with no known homosexual 
members and both with heterosexual head pastors agreed to hire the 
three last month the congregations have been threatened with 
expulsion by the 52 million evangelical lutheran church in 
america which has warned it will not recognize the new ministers 
we see this as what god is asking us to do said the rev 
john frykman of first united our congregation felt this was a 
social justice issue that gays are part of the rainbow coalition 
of gods creation 
elca spokesman joseph wagner countered that ordination is not 
a civil right it is a privilege granted by the church to those who 
meet its established standards 
the two congregations hope the gay ministers can bring many 
homosexuals back to the flock among other things the three 
endorsed the concept of gay marriages 
their saturday ordinations along with that of a new jersey 
episcopal pastor last month with an acknowledged male mate 
represent a historic foothold in mainstream christianity by 
homosexuals whose sexual orientation generally has been tolerated 
only if it wasnt consummated 
the elca formed two years ago by the merger of three lutheran 
groups bans ordination of selfavowed practicing homosexuals 
it is the largest american lutheran denomination lutherans in 
several northern european countries allow ordination of practicing 
homosexuals 
at the request of sierrapacific synod bishop lyle miller a 
disciplinary committee will consider punitive action against the 
congregations the parishes could be censured suspended 
permanently removed from the church organization or exonerated 
the rev james delange of st francis said his congregation felt 
that to deny the pastoral ministry of a lesbian couple is akin to 
denying a black congregation the right to call a black pastor up 
to 100000 gays and lesbians live within a mile of the centuryold 
church 
we decided that punishment even expulsion is a risk we would 
run for the sake of whats right delange said 
zillhart and frost a couple who studied together at luther 
northwestern seminary and johnson who graduated last year from 
pacific lutheran seminary in berkeley calif also will manage an 
outreach program for northern california homosexuals 
george cooper a 52yearold former roman catholic priest who 
left because of his homosexuality wiped a tear from his eye 
following the ordination saying this is christianity the 
triumph of love for each other over ignorance

moslem snipers fired at indian troops 
from rooftops today and at least two people were killed and 300 
injured in clashes between soldiers and islamic militants 
officials said 
about 500 armed state policemen holed up in a police complex 
after a confrontation with the army and refused to continue the 
crackdown against the militants 
the whole city is up in revolt said srinagar police 
inspector general mohammad nomani 
the islamic militants who want kashmir state to become 
independent or merge with neighboring pakistan marched out of 
homes and mosques in defiance of a curfew 
nomani said at least 40 people most of them militants had died 
since the violence began late saturday night in srinagar a 
predominantly moslem city 
he said a paramilitary policeman was killed today by a moslem 
sniper and one moslem protester was shot to death by the army 
at least 300 protesters were injured today when troops fired on 
a crowd of about 5000 in a suburb of srinagar doctors at the 
soora hospital said 
the doctors speaking on condition of anonymity said all beds 
in the hospital were occupied and the cafeteria had been converted 
into a makeshift hospital 
mohammad aslam a policeman in the state constabulary said a 
fellow officer was killed by army fire 
when soldiers refused to hand over his body to the state police 
about 500 armed officers took up positions in residential quarters 
of the police complex and refused to report for duty aslam said 
state police said they could not confirm the officers death and 
refused further comment 
aslam said the army and the paramilitary central reserve police 
force wanted to disarm the state police most of whom are moslems 
the army and the paramilitary forces are mostly hindu 
we are not slaves he said as his colleagues chanted in the 
background army go back 
thousands of moslems took to the streets starting shortly before 
midnight saturday after government security forces rounded up 
suspected militants the government said it acted to control 
escalating violence 
nomani said 251 people had been detained in raids but that all 
except four had been released in an attempt to stop the violence 
he estimated the militants strength at 1500 and said they had 
at least 1000 weapons mostly automatic rifles 
the city of 1 million was placed under aroundtheclock curfew 
with only military vehicles and troops permitted on the streets 
but bands of 50 to 100 men ignored the curfew today at least 50 
streamed out of one mosque in downtown srinagar some hurled stones 
at the troops while outhers beat their breasts and shouted you 
indians go back

before the weekend 26 people had been killed this year in 
confrontations involving moslem militants and security forces 
in new delhi today foreign minister shabzada yaqub khan of 
pakistan conferred with indian officials during a visit scheduled 
before the latest violence 
india has long accused islamic pakistan of supporting the 
kashmiri separatists a charge routinely denied by pakistan 
the old princely state of kashmir was divided between india and 
pakistan when the two countries were partitioned and became 
independent from britain in 1947 
india and pakistan have gone to war three times since the last 
time in 1971 but the kashmir frontier is still under dispute 
abdul qayyum president of pakistans azad kashmir state told a 
news conference in islamabad pakistan today that more violence 
could spark thousands to cross the 840mile border into india 
people are becoming deaf to reason and logic he said 
he said an alliance of nine political parties in 
pakistanicontrolled kashmir would lead a peaceful movement 
across the ceasefire line if indian troops continued what he 
called a campaign to destroy militant secessionists 
jammukashmir is the only indian state with a moslem majority 
moslem militants led by the jammukashmir liberation front have 
demanded independence for kashmir or union with moslem pakistan 
sixtyfour percent of jammukashmirs 5 million people are 
moslems but nationwide moslems make up only 12 percent of indias 
880 million people

portauprince haiti ap a church leader today accused the 
military government of undermining democratic reforms by ordering a 
wave of arrests beatings and the exile of political opponents 
they have made rubbish of the constitution said roman 
catholic bishop willy romelus on the churchrun radio soleil he 
encouraged his listeners however to keep up their spirits 
of haitis six main radio stations only radio soleil the 
protestant radio lumiere and the staterun national radio were 
broadcasting news this morning under a state of siege declared by 
military ruler lt gen prosper avril radio is the main source of 
news in the country 
in its toughest crackdown on the opposition since taking power 
in a september 1988 soldiers revolt the government arrested and 
forced into exile seven prominent political activists during the 
weekend dozens of others were arrested but were thought to have 
been released 
portauprince the bustling capital of more than 1 million 
people remained calm shops and schools opened as usual and 
traffic was normal 
critics said the crackdown indicates avril intends to renege on 
a promise to hold free elections in october 
at a news conference sunday in miami newly exiled activist 
hubert de ronceray said avril promised the elections only to get 
help from foreign countries 
theres no possibility of a democracy with mr avril hes a 
dictator said the conservative leader 
the state of siege was declared after an army colonel his wife 
and servants were killed friday by unidentified gunmen just 100 
yards from de roncerays home 
de ronceray deported saturday claimed he was the intended 
victim other opposition activists speculated avril was using the 
killings as a pretext to derail the transition to democracy he 
promised after coming to power in a september 1988 soldiers revolt 
de ronceray 65 said that after his arrest he was kicked 
clubbed with guns and had a cigarette jammed in his eye the eye 
was red as he spoke to reporters 
the other exiles were also beaten before they were deported 
according to the activists and other sources 
the government offered no comment on those reports 
in washington the state department condemned the state of siege 
and arrests and urged the haitian government to reiterate its 
commitment to free elections the united states suspended 60 
million in aid to the impoverished country after haitis last 
attempt at democratic elections was thwarted by armed thugs aided 
by soldiers who massacred voters in 1987 
louis roy a prominent civic leader and an author of haitis 
1987 constitution was carrying a small suitcase kissed the 
ground two times and mounted the stairway to exile a relative 
told the associated press 
roy 74 founder of the haitian red cross flew aboard a 
commercial flight to miami i was hit in both ears and full in 
the face in front of the duty officer at the police headquarters 
he said upon arrival 
max bourjolly secondincommand of the haitian communist party 
was arrested at his home and exiled apparently to france said 
party leader rene theodore 
family members and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the others exiled sunday were aby brun of the centerleft 
congress for democratic movement sylvain jolibois of the small 
radical jeanjacques dessalines group and radical activists michel 
legros and max montreuil 
they said brun was flown to miami and the others to the 
dominican republic which shares the caribbean island of hispaniola 
with haiti 
popular radical leader sylvio claude of the haitian christian 
democratic party and gerard philippeauguste head of the movement 
to organize the country party went into hiding 
de ronceray and roy are not new to exile they spent several 
years in montreal during the rule of the late dictator francois 
papa doc duvalier whose son continued the 29year family 
dynasty until fleeing to france in 1986 after a popular uprising 
in announcing the state of siege saturday night the government 
suspended a law forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa 
requirement for haitians returning from abroad 
de ronceray claimed the colonel killed near his house andre 
neptune was shot by attackers sent out to kill him he said he had 
changed his own schedule because of a warning avril wanted him 
destroyed and the officer was slain while in a car similar to 
his 
human rights activist jeanclaude bajeux who arrived in puerto 
rico from haiti on friday said he suspected either army rivals or 
the drug mafia were behind the slayings 
the coincidence is significant for this killing to happen now 
and they immediately use it to round up opposition leaders its 
a typically duvalierist scheme 
he was referring to the network of duvalier supporters left in 
this former french colony where 80 percent of the 5 million people 
live in poverty 
paul latortue a haitian economist at the university of puerto 
rico said the weekend crackdown indicates avril has allied 
himself with the duvalierists whom he accused of killing neptune 
the government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate 
therell be no elections or have elections without the 
oppositions participation with controlled candidates latortue 
said 
avril rose to power in a revolt that ousted lt gen henri 
namphy who oversaw the november 1987 elections that were canceled 
when at least 34 voters were shot and hacked to death by thugs in 
collusion with soldiers 
less than two months later namphy staged armyrun elections 
that were widely boycotted by voters and denounced by most foreign 
observers as fraudulent several months later he took back control 
of the government

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether nuclear industry whistleblowers who say they were 
disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue under state 
personalinjury laws 
the justices said they will review a north carolina case in 
which a federal appeals court said such workers must sue under a 
special federal law 
another appeals courts has allowed such statelaw suits and the 
justices decision is expected to resolve the conflicting rulings 
the decision to be announced by july will carry a significant 
practical effect the federal law does not provide for 
punitivedamages awards often the most lucrative part of a 
successful suit under the corresponding state laws 
bush administration lawyers urged reversal of the appeals 
courts ruling in the north carolina case the federal law does 
not preempt an employees state suit for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress resulting from retaliation for making nuclear 
safety complaints they said 
vera english of wilmington nc worked as a laboratory 
technician for general electric at its nuclear fuels manufacturing 
plant there for almost 12 years before she was fired in july 1984 
earlier that year ms english had complained to both the 
federal nuclear regulatory commission and to her ge supervisors 
about what she considered serious violations of federal safety 
standards 
when no corrective action was taken she deliberately failed to 
clean up radiation contamination at her work station in what she 
said was an effort to prove that such contamination was not being 
detected by safety inspectors 
although her efforts led to corrective action she was 
disciplined and eventually fired 
ms english sued ge in 1987 her suit sought under north 
carolina law reinstatement with back pay and monetary damages for 
wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
despite being based on state law ms englishs suit was filed 
in federal court because ges headquarters are outside the state 
a federal judge dismissed the statelaw suit ruling that it was 
preempted by whistleblower provisions of the federal energy 
reorganization act 
the federal law bars nuclear industry employers from firing or 
otherwise disciplining employees for publicly pointing out alleged 
safety problems 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal of 
ms englishs suit last april 3 
in seeking supreme court review ms englishs lawyers argued 
that she was treated outrageously and unfairly by general 
electric yet she has received no compensation for the very serious 
wrongs she has suffered 
ge lawyers urged rejection of the appeal saying that allowing 
such suits would frustrate a pervasive and delicately balanced 
regulatory scheme created by congress 
in a recent interview one of ms englishs lawyers m travis 
payne of raleigh nc said she no longer has the option of filing 
a suit against ge based on the federal law 
in a separate administrative proceeding a labor department 
administrative law judge ruled for ms english the judge awarded 
her reinstatement with back pay 70000 in damages and lawyer 
fees but the ruling was set aside by the secretary of labor on 
grounds ms english waited too long to file her complaint 
the case is english vs general electric 89152

a bibb county ga school bond referendum 
attacked by blacks as a violation of the federal voting rights act 
was legal the supreme court ruled today 
the court without waiting to hear arguments in the case upheld 
a ruling that permitted the countys voters to approve 29 million 
to aircondition existing schools and build a new high school 
the justices decision was not accompanied by any written 
opinion there was no recorded dissenting vote 
blacks in the county who favored the air conditioning but 
opposed the new school said permitting both proposals to be voted 
on together was racially biased they said the proposed school in a 
predominantly white area would require busing black students to 
attend classes there 
the blacks sought under the voting rights act of 1965 to have 
the us attorney general review the referendum proposal before it 
was placed on the ballot a process called preclearance 
but a special threejudge federal court ruled last year that the 
school boards decision to link the air conditioning and a new 
school in a single bond issue is not the kind of voting change 
requiring preclearance 
the threejudge court acknowledged that the supreme court has 
upheld preclearance for setting election dates changing candidate 
qualifications and altering voting procedures 
but the panel agreeing with legal arguments submitted by the 
justice department said defining the scope of a bond issue 
proposal is a routine matter for the school board to decide 
those who challenged the referendum format said the method 
the board chose submerged the political will of bibb countys black 
voters voters favoring all or none of the bond issues were able to 
cast a fully effective ballot those voters who were divided on the 
issues were not 
the challengers said there was racially polarized voting over 
the bond issue and that the school board scheduled the election to 
reduce the chances of a proportionally larger turnout by blacks 
over whites 
they said the school board rescinded a plan to submit the bond 
issue to voters on march 8 1988 socalled super tuesday in last 
years presidential primaries when the civil rights leader jesse 
jackson was on the georgia ballot 
on that date 11375 blacks and 23706 whites in bibb county 
voted when the bond issue was approved on election day nov 8 
1988 14731 blacks and 35153 whites voted 
the bond issue passed 21915 votes to 21287 
asked for its views in the case the bush administration urged 
the high court to uphold the threejudge courts ruling

the supreme court today agreed to use a 
decadelong dispute over the rights of haitian refugees to decide 
when the government must pay legal fees to people who sue it 
successfully 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal aimed 
at limiting such fees 
the refugees sued the government in 1981 over its policy of 
locking up aliens caught while trying to enter the united states 
illegally 
until 1981 the government generally released aliens on 
parole pending hearings on their applications for official 
admission to the country 
the haitians said they almost never were paroled before their 
applications were acted upon a process that can take longer than a 
year 
the refugees accused the government of discriminating against 
them because they are black and also contended that the 
immigration and naturalization service violated federal rules by 
summarily adopting harsher treatment for haitians than other aliens 
the refugees ultimately won an important though not total 
victory 
they did not win on the discrimination claim but the government 
conceded that the ins may not consider race or national origin in 
determining parole new rules were adopted for handling refugees 
federal courts that reviewed the case said there is no doubt the 
haitians won their freedom because of the lawsuit those refugees 
later returned to custody were detained under new fairer rules 
the lower courts said 
the government has argued that the haitians did not win key 
elements of their lawsuit and should not be entitled to recover 
legal fees under the equal access to justice act 
the act generally requires reimbursement of legal fees for those 
who prevail in suits against the government 
a federal judge ruled against the government on the fees 
question awarding more than 1 million to the lawyers who 
represented the haitians 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last year substantially 
upheld the judges decision while ordering further hearings to 
recompute the amount owed the lawyers 
the appeals court also said the government must reimburse the 
haitians lawyers for fees they incurred litigating the fees issue 
in the first place what the appeals court called the fees for 
fees issue 
we hold that the united states may not oppose a fees for 
fees request solely on the ground that its position in the fee 
litigation was substantially justified the 11th circuit court 
said 
that issue prompted the bush administrations appeal to the 
supreme court acted on today 
justice department lawyers said the 11th circuit court ruling 
conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts 
the case is commissioner of ins vs jean 89601

coast guard officials have decided to let 
nature clean up the estimated 57600 gallons of gasoline that 
gushed into alaskas islandstudded inside passage from a grounded 
tanker 
the canadianowned tanker frank h brown struck burnt island 
reef on saturday night the captain who was not identified blamed 
the grounding on a judgment error coast guard spokesman ed 
moreth said 
the agency said it took blood and urine samples from crew 
members to test for drug or alcohol use 
the 400foot ship was refloated at high tide sunday and 
continued under its own power about 15 miles up a narrow channel to 
scow bay just south of petersburg there divers found a 2foot 
hole in one of its tanks 
lt brian flory of the coast guard said the vessel remained at 
anchor overnight 
it has boom all around it flory said early today the 
remaining cargo was transferred out of the damaged tank theres no 
recoverable gasoline anywhere 
coast guard and state environmental officials said damage to 
fish and wildlife appeared to be minimal the decision not to clean 
up the spill was made sunday as the gasoline quickly broke up into 
several thin sheens the largest a mile long 
its just not recoverable moreth said the stuff seems to 
be evaporating quicker than anyone could pick it up and its only 
in small patches scattered around 
the spill was a fraction of the size of the exxon valdez 
disaster in which nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil 
spilled into prince william sound last march in the nations worst 
oil spill the valdez captain joseph hazelwood goes on trial next 
week 
the site of saturdays spill is about 135 miles south of juneau 
in a channel called wrangell narrows the tanker carried 18 
million gallons of gasoline diesel fuel and heating oil but only 
one tank was ruptured 
its not a heavy fuel so it has a tendency to break up easily 
and it weathers much faster than a heavier oil coast guard 
spokesman greg robinson said 
the tanker is owned by white pass transportation inc of 
vancouver british columbia it was heading from vancouver to 
skagway 210 miles north of petersburg 
wrangell narrows is a windy 25mile long channel between sumner 
strait and frederick sound it is one of the narrowest waterways 
between the thickly forested and mountainous islands that form the 
inside passage 
an estimated 20000 gallons of gasoline remained in the damaged 
tank and was removed sunday night to a nearby barge at scow bay 
boom totaling 1050 feet was placed around the two vessels to 
contain any further leakage 
the vessel may be allowed to continue to skagway with the rest 
of its load today the damage is not enough to affect the tankers 
maneuverability moreth said 
the spill was not expected to pose a health risk to people 
living along the channel said barbara holian a spokeswoman for 
the state department of environmental conservation in juneau she 
said spilled gasoline does not remain highly toxic for long because 
it evaporates quickly 
the states crystal lake hatchery 15 miles south of petersburg 
was not threatened by the spill said fish culturist bill davidson 
at the salmon hatchery there are no fish runs in the area until 
spring he said

the supreme court today refused to require 
arbitration for hundreds of thousands of federal workers when they 
are fired demoted or otherwise disciplined 
the court without comment rejected appeals by a labor union 
and the federal labor relations authority seeking broader job 
protection for federal employees 
at issue were the rights of as many as 450000 employees known 
as excepted workers because they hold their jobs without having 
to take civil service tests 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last may that the 
civil service reform act of 1978 does not require government 
agencies to bargain over creation of grievance arbitration 
procedure for the excepted workers 
congress carefully constructed a scheme that would ensure 
uniformity in personnel decisions and promote efficiency of 
administration the appeals court said requiring arbitration for 
excepted workers would undermine the structure of the law that 
court said 
the may ruling was a defeat for the national treasury employees 
union which sought to extend arbitration protection to employees 
in the chief counsels office of the internal revenue service 
the bush administration supported the appeals court ruling but 
justice department lawyers noted that congress is considering 
amending civil service law to expand job protection for excepted 
employees 
the cases are national treasury employees union vs treasury 
department 89610 and federal labor relations authority vs 
treasury department 89758

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its view as to whether stockbrokers may be 
forced to give investors the option of suing rather than seeking 
arbitration over alleged broker fraud 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
about a ruling that barred massachusetts from requiring brokers to 
make arbitration clauses optional not mandatory in brokerage 
contracts 
the justices are not expected to take any action in the 
massachusetts case until hearing from the government lawyers which 
could take months 
the massachusetts appeal is supported by 30 other states whose 
officials said a federal appeals court ruling leaves them 
powerless to protect consumers from being coerced to enter 
arbitration agreements 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
aug 31 that the massachusetts regulations are preempted by 
federal law 
the prevailing practice in the brokerage industry is to require 
customers to agree to arbitrate all disputes as a condition to 
opening an account 
the justices ruled 54 in 1987 that if such arbitration clauses 
are in the contracts signed by investors disputes over alleged 
fraud are to be resolved in arbitration not in lawsuits 
massachusetts secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations 
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements 
nonnegotiable conditions for opening accounts the regulations 
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of 
mandatory arbitration clauses 
the states action immediately was challenged by the securities 
industry association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it 
a federal judge ruled for the brokers and the appeals court 
upheld that ruling 
the long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a 
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous 
proarbitration mandate of the federal arbitration act in the 
securities field the appeals court said 
in the states appeal massachusetts attorney general james m 
shannon said the august ruling has national implications for 
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking 
health care the automobile and many other industries 
shannon said the federal arbitration act does not preempt all 
state regulation of arbitration 
lawyers for the securities industry urged the justices to reject 
the states appeal 
the case is connolly vs securities industry association 89894

carrying arms to ethiopian government forces sudans official news

border with ethiopia and taken to port sudan the countrys major 
port on the red sea for a flight home on plane provided by the

fell into rebel hands whether the crew was captured after 
abandoning ship or whether they were seized from the ship by the 
guerrillas

anonymity said the released poles are 29 crew members and the wife 
of one of them

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
federal civil rights lawsuit by five people prosecuted for 
antiabortion picketing outside a san diego medical clinic 
the justices without comment let stand a decision dismissing 
allegations that the clinics operators violated the pickets 
freespeech rights 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last june 23 threw out 
11800 awards each of the five pickets had won in a federal trial 
james collins jr tammy lee collins kimberlee huckaby joan 
patton and cheryl sullenger sued over an oct 1 1985 incident at 
the womencare clinic 
on that day a group of protesters demonstrated across the 
street from the clinic some of them were subject to a state court 
injunction issued about a year earlier that barred them from 
demonstrating or picketing any closer than across the street 
from the clinics property 
the five people involved in this case picketed on the public 
sidewalk on womencares side of the street 
two clinic employees summoned police who after talking with the 
pickets decided to take no action but san diego police sgt 
thomas packer told the clinic employees they could make citizens 
arrests under california law charging the pickets with violating 
the 1984 injunction 
the two employees accompanied by police officers placed the 
five pickets under arrest police detained the group long enough to 
issue misdemeanor citations for violating the injunction 
the five pickets were not subject to the 1984 injunction and 
the charges were dropped prior to trial they subsequently sued in 
federal court the clinics owners and the two employees who 
arrested them 
the suit involving a muchused civil rights law alleged false 
arrest and freespeech violations 
a jury ruled for the pickets but the 9th circuit court threw 
out the jurys award 
the appeals court said the arrests made by the two clinic 
employees did not amount to action taken under the color of state 
law and therefore could not be the basis for the civil rights 
suit 
the appeals court sent back the falsearrest claim for a retrial 
the case is collins vs womancare 89819

the supreme court today agreed to settle a 
dispute over how much money pleasure boat owners may be required to 
pay for damages in some boating accidents 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the owner of a yacht 
destroyed in a fire while docked at a lake michigan marina in 
indiana 
the accident occurred sept 24 1985 when a fire broke out 
aboard everett sissons 56foot yacht the ultorian it caused 
extensive damage to the washington park marina in michigan city 
ind and other boats docked there 
the fire was believed to have been caused by a defective washer 
and dryer aboard the yacht 
the owners of the marina and the other damaged boats sued for 
more than 275000 
sisson whose boat was valued at about 600000 before the fire 
said he should be required to pay the others no more than 800 
the ultorians value after the fire 
his arguments for restricting the damages were based on maritime 
and admiralty laws that protect ship owners from having to pay big 
court awards in lawsuits 
but the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that 
the liability limits do not apply when the accident is caused by a 
pleasure boat moored at a recreational marina 
the appeals court said the liability limits only apply to 
cases directly involving commercial maritime activity or to cases 
involving exclusively noncommercial activities in which the wrong 
has a potentially disruptive impact on martime commerce and 
involves navigation 
the appeals court based its ruling in part on a 1982 supreme 
court ruling in a case in which two pleasure boats collided 
this may be too narrow and mechanical an interpretation of the 
supreme court decision the appeals court said but the 
specific language of the court seems to support it if the ultorian 
had been under way in the shipping channel when the fire broke out 
we might reach a different result 
bush administration lawyers urged that sissons appeal be 
granted and his case be used to clear up uncertainty over the issue 
the 1982 decision provides modest guidance with respect to 
cases that do not involve navigation or commercial shipping 
justice department lawyers said 
the case is sisson vs ruby 882041

the supreme court today refused to let public 
employee labor unions get from the government the home addresses of 
federal workers 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the 
workers privacy would be violated if government agencies are 
forced to divulge the information to the unions 
the federal labor relations authority in a series of decisions 
said unions are entitled to the names and addresses of the workers 
they represent in collective bargaining 
the authority said withholding the information is an unfair 
labor practice noting that labor law requires private employers to 
give unions the addresses of workers they represent 
there is little privacy right in keeping ones home address a 
secret from the union since the recipient of union mail is free to 
throw it away unopened the labor authority said 
disclosing the addresses will contribute to the unions 
ability to communicate effectively with its bargaining unit 
employees added the authority which handles disputes between 
government employee unions and their employers 
the us circuit court of appeals here overturned the labor 
authoritys ruling last september saying workers privacy rights 
outweigh the unions need for the information particularly since 
there are other ways for the unions to communicate with employees 
in the appeals acted on today the unions said they should be 
allowed to communicate with members in the privacy of the workers 
homes and be allowed to recruit new members by mail 
in ruling against the unions the appeals court relied in part 
on a 1989 supreme court decision that said the fbi is not required 
by the freedom of information act to reveal rap sheets 
containing arrest and conviction records of millions of americans 
federal employees have privacy interests in their names and 
home addresses that must be protected and the relevant public 
interest in disclosure though not nothing is outweighed the 
appeals court said 
bush administration lawyers asked the justices not to disturb 
the appeals courts ruling 
in a related case last year the high court ordered the st 
louisbased 8th us circuit court of appeals to study the issue 
further 
the cases are american federation of government employees vs 
department of health and human services 89444 national treasury 
employees union vs treasury department 89566 and federal labor 
relations authority vs treasury department 89853

a california church that won a major supreme 
court propertyrights case in 1987 today lost a followup bid to be 
compensated for losing the use of its land 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that los 
angeles county officials are not required to pay the church for any 
losses it suffered 
the church first english evangelical lutheran in glendale 
calif operated a camp called lutherglen on 21 acres of land in 
the mountains north of los angeles 
forest fires in the summer of 1977 burned off much of the 
vegetation there and flooding from heavy rains the next year 
leveled the camps buildings 
floods in the area also killed 10 people swept away bridges and 
other buildings and inflicted million of dollars in damages 
los angeles county enacted an interim ordinance that barred 
reconstruction of the lutherglen buildings while officials looked 
for a permanent solution to the flooding threat 
the supreme court in 1987 used the case to rule that landowners 
can be awarded compensation when government regulations bar them 
from using their property 
but the justices sent the churchs case back to a california 
appeals court to decide whether the church would receive any money 
the state appeals court ruled in may 1969 that the church is not 
entitled to be paid because it was not deprived of all use of its 
property even temporarily and because whatever uses were denied 
were justified by public safety concerns 
the appeals court said lutherglen still could be used for 
various camping and recreational activities 
moreover the state court said the county was justified in 
preventing rebuilding because of the threat to life and property 
from another flood 
what first english can no longer do is rebuild the bunkhouses 
and similar permanent living structures which might house the 
potential victims of a future flood the state court said 
these zoning restrictions represent a valid exercise of the 
police power and not an unconstitutional taking of property 
without compensation 
the church said the state court ruling amounts to willful 
defiance of the supreme courts 1987 ruling 
the california courts do not yet appear to have received the 
message that they are depriving property owners of their rights 
the church said 
the national association of realtors the national association 
of home builders and the conservative pacific legal foundation 
supported the churchs appeal 
the california attorney generals office urged the justices to 
leave the state court ruling intact 
the case is first english church vs los angeles county 89826

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
350000 award a massachusetts hospital was ordered to pay the 
family of a girl who lost sight in her right eye after surgery 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that reduced the 
medical malpractice judgment to 20000 under a state law that 
protects charitable institutions 
new england medical center in boston was sued in 1983 by joseph 
and elizabeth english their daughter kerrie ann underwent 
cataract surgery at the hospital in 1980 at age 8 she developed an 
infection after the operation 
a jury awarded the family 350000 against the hospital but 
returned verdicts in favor of two doctors who treated the girl 
a judge reduced the damages to 20000 under a 1971 
massachusetts law that imposes that cap for personal injury 
lawsuits against charities 
the massachusetts supreme judicial court upheld the reduced 
damages last year 
we are not without misgivings about the paltriness of the 
20000 cap but we cannot correctly declare the statute to be 
unconstitutional the state court said a change in the amount 
of the cap may be appropriate but that is a legislative decision 
lawyers for the english family said the law violates 
constitutional equal protection guarantees only victims of 
injuries caused by charities are subject to the discriminatory cap 
they said 
the statute must be seen as the product of a powerful lobby 
securing unneeded protection from the legislature at the expense of 
an unrepresented and powerless class of victims the lawyers said 
the statute fails to make a distinction between victims to 
whom 20000 would be a boon and those to whom it would barely be a 
beginning the appeal said 
the case is english vs new england medical center 89825

the supreme court today refused to let new 
mexico officials break part of a 1980 pact they say put the states 
four prisons under daytoday federal court control 
the court without comment let stand rulings that upheld the 
10yearold court consent decree 
the dispute dates back to a 1977 lawsuit by inmates of the 
states penitentiary at the time new mexicos only prison the 
suit challenged prison conditions and practices as unconstitutional 
a partial settlement was agreed to in 1979 a broader agreement 
between prison authorities and inmates was reached several months 
after 33 inmates were killed a february 1980 riot at the 
penitentiary 
the 1980 courtapproved pact which covered all future prisons 
and inmates as well set standards for numerous aspects of prison 
life 
some of the standards such as those governing food services and 
medical care were not challenged by state officials 
but others were attacked in a 1987 request seeking to modify the 
1980 agreement 
specifically state officials objected to these requirements 
inmate security classifications must be made by a threemember 
committee representing a prisons psychological program and 
security staffs with participation by the individual inmate 
maximum security may be used only for inmates who have 
committed or been linked to particular acts involving prison 
security 
the states appeal said the requirement makes maximum security 
unavailable for known gang leaders who have not themselves 
engaged in recent misconduct 
inmates may be punished only for certain designated offenses 
and only for specified lengths of time never exceeding 30 days 
all inmates except those in maximum security must receive 
eight hours a day of meaningful activity to include vocational 
training education and work 
no prison may use doublecelling or putting more than one 
inmate in any cell except in the face of dire emergencies such as 
riots or fires regardless of the cells size dormitories must 
provide 60 square feet for each inmate 
liberal visitation policies must be used including allowing 
kissing and embracing when feasible 
us district judge juan g burciaga in 1988 turned down the 
states request to modify the consent decree and the 10th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld his ruling last sept 15 
in the appeal acted on today new mexico attorney general hal 
stratton argued the issues in this case vitally affect the 
ability of the states to administer their prisons free from 
longterm daytoday federal court control over matters not 
governed by federal law 
the states appeal called the 1980 consent decree outmoded 
because more recent high court rulings make clear that the decrees 
standards go far beyond any federal law requirements 
the appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
filed by 39 states and puerto rico

chinas trade figures improved in 1989 but 
economic sanctions imposed after the crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement severely limited access to foreign loans and technology a 
trade official said today 
liu xiangdong spokesman for the ministry of foreign economic 
relations and trade said exports reached 4327 billion up 65 
percent from 1988 while imports declined by 39 percent to 3827 
billion 
but he said economic sanctions imposed by western nations after 
the military crushed the studentled prodemocracy movement in june 
caused foreign loan agreements to drop by 51 percent to 48 
billion 
he said the number of technology import contracts 328 was down 
25 percent due to tougher restrictions on technology transfers to 
china following the crackdown the value of those contracts dropped 
18 percent to 29 billion 
liu noted that some developed countries recently indicated they 
will lift sanctions but he said no action had been taken and we 
do not have any unrealistic fantasies 
china must stress selfreliance in its modernization drive he 
said 
the nations chief economic planning official echoed lius 
sentiments in a speech to businessmen in tokyo today 
the population of china is large and the issues the chinese 
people face are serious and tough said zou jiahua head of 
chinas state planning commission 
we need a stable and united government and a stable 
environment to carry through construction of socialism he told 
the japan association for the promotion of international trade 
zou who arrived in japan last week at the invitation of the 
trade group is the first highlevel chinese official to visit 
since the crackdown 
he said chinas lifting of martial law in beijing on jan 11 was 
evidence of stability 
the move was widely seen as a gesture aimed at bringing foreign 
investors back to china and persuading western governments to drop 
sanctions imposed after the june crackdown 
the united states reacted by dropping opposition to world bank 
loans for basic human needs and japan has indicated it will 
renew talks on a credit package for development projects 
liu said china had not signed one foreign assistance contract 
since last springs political turmoil 
he said imports were down because of the drop in technology 
purchases and austerity policies that have sharply reduced demand 
and economic growth 
as a consequence trade with japan fell 5 percent to about 14 
billion liu said uschinese trade was up 137 percent to 94 
billion however 
liu said not one of the 899 beijingbased foreign firms 
registered with the trade ministry left after the military 
crackdown and that 71 more firms had registered since june 
he said there were 5784 new projects involving foreign 
investment nationwide last year down by 27 percent

the nations fiercely competitive 
longdistance carriers may reach a detente if atampt asks for a 
mutualaid pact to ease the effects of a network failure like last 
weeks massive shutdown 
already the company has told its operators to give out the 
access codes of its two rivals mci and us sprint and other 
carriers in case of a similar problem 
harry baumgartner a spokesman for the american telephone amp 
telegraph co said the company is studying the idea of a backup 
system involving all three companies and a proposal could be ready 
this week 
were still looking at the feasibility and this may never 
come to pass said baumgartner the point is what we are 
interested in at atampt is that our customers dont experience 
anything like this ever again whatever it takes to do that well 
do it 
us sprint and mci appeared to be receptive to the idea 
spokesman for all three major carriers said that the prospect of a 
mutualaid agreement raises some technological questions but none 
that cant be overcome legal experts said it also could be 
challenged on antitrust grounds 
its remarkable because theyve been battling so bitterly 
with the industry so competitive said audrey stevoff an analyst 
with duff amp phelpps inc in chicago it would definately be a 
major change for the industry 
the system failure which hampered long distance calling 
nationwide for nine hours a week ago was a blow that may go deeper 
than merely bruising the prestige of the no 1 carrier analysts 
said but it will help atampts competitors more than it will hurt 
atampt they predict 
i think atampt has been very intelligent about how theyre 
handling this and is minimizing its effects said paul aran an 
analyst with bear stearns in new york theyve taken this very 
very seriously so that it doesnt happen again and theyre working 
to make it up to their customers 
atampt has proposed pending federal communications commission 
approval giving its 80 million customers nine hours of discount 
service on valentines day to compensate for the outage 
aran said no 2 mci communications corp and no 3 us sprint 
stand to gain but the public relations windfall will be 
shortlived 
atampt has been seen as something like americas most invincible 
company but nothing no company is perfect aran said ok 
now the shock wears off people say so theyre not perfect 
he added that atampts handling of the incident has shown that it 
is a strong company with high standards and that signing on with 
its rivals in a backup agreement would be a bold move 
us sprint has pounced on the shutdown to try to increase its 8 
percent of the market the company immediately began running 
fullpage ads in major newspapers with instructions on how to use 
sprint the next time you experience difficulties dialing long 
distance but sprint doesnt rule out cooperating with atampt 
either 
wed welcome anything in the industry that will give people 
better service said sprint spokesman sid courson if we can 
help make sure everybody who wants to call long distance can and 
the logistics are there wed welcome talking to atampt 
the sentiments were echoed at mci which controls about 12 
percent of the longdistance market 
i think it would be nice to have plans like that in place 
said mci spokesman dave thompson we are a service industry and 
should do everything we can to see that that service is not 
interrupted

a 49625 rug installed in the oval office a 
year and a half ago has been replaced by president bush as part of 
an overall redecoration program the white house said today 
the old rug which took two years to design and make and was 
paid for by an anonymous donor was removed last friday 
it was replaced by an oval rug measuring 30 feet 10 inches long 
by 23 feet 5 inches wide 
larry hokanson president of a houston company that made the new 
rug said it cost 28550 plus freight and installation charges 
normally the designing process takes a couple months and the 
normal manufacturing time is about 16 to 18 weeks but because of 
the prestige of this we cut all that back to two weeks on 
designing and 2 months on production hokanson said 
he said every stitch of the new rug was handguided it was 
unclear what would happen to the old rug which was installed june 
6 1988 
it was not terribly attractive the president did not like 
it hokanson said 
the new rug has a grayblue field that centers the coatofarms 
from the presidential seal delineated in shades of gold on an 
ivory ground 
when the old rug was installed press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said president reagan and his wife nancy wanted to leave an 
asset to the white house and they felt this would be an attractive 
asset 
a white house statement said that in addition to the new rug 
the oval office had new draperies a new coffee table and 
reupholstered armchairs 
the entire redecoration cost 62470 and was paid for with funds 
contributed by private donors the statement said

politicians burned a copy of chinas decision in front of the 
headquarters of the xinhua news agency beijings de facto embassy 
to the british colony in london a senior member of hong kongs 
legislative council alan lee arrived today to lobby the british 
government to speed democratic reforms in the colony before it 
reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
conservative business leaders took the unusual step of joining 
with prodemocracy activists in criticizing the plan 
beijing has insisted on a political scheme that has been 
publicly dismissed by virtually every organization and every 
community leader in hong kong said martin cm lee a leading 
voice for democratic change at a news conference lee called on 
britain to continue its push for democracy in hong kong 
the reaction indicated the lack of faith many in this territory 
of 57 million have in communist china beijing has promised to 
maintain hong kongs freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years 
after it resumes control in 1997 
confidence in that promise has evaporated since the june 34 
military crackdown on prodemocracy protesters in beijing further 
blows have been struck as chinas stance has become increasingly 
hardline due to upheavals in eastern europe 
on saturday in the southern chinese city of canton a 
chineseappointed committee decided to limit to 18 the number of 
directly elected seats in hong kongs 60member legislature rising 
to 30 in 2003 the committee is writing the basic law the 
blueprint for hong kongs government after 1997 
the committee also voted to divide the legislature into two 
houses and further restrict who could hold high office in the 
territory after beijing resumes sovereignty 
none of the six committee delegates from hong kong voted for 
beijings plan which passed because all 10 of chinas delegates 
supported it 
raymond wu the leader of the hong kong delegation called 
beijings move dictatorial and vowed to leave politics wu broke 
down in tears during sessions in canton because he said i 
became sad when i thought about the future of hong kong 
hong kong politicians have called for at least 20 seats to be 
directly elected in 1991 with substantial increases after that 
about 1000 hong kong residents leave the territory each week 
and the number is expected to rise analysts fear that if the trend 
continues hong kongs economy will suffer 
critics said chinas decision to split hong kongs legislature 
revealed beijings desire to control political developments in the 
territory 
under the plan laws will have to gain a majority of two groups 
those directly elected and those chosen by special interest 
groups the daily express said such a model would weaken the 
legislature and benefit the executive branch which beijing is 
expected to easily influence

a sharply divided supreme court ruled today in 
the case of a convicted white rapist that fairtrial rights are not 
violated when blacks are excluded from serving as jurors 
but the 54 ruling in an illinois case did not leave white 
defendants powerless to challenge the exclusion of blacks from 
their juries the court left unanswered whether racebased 
exclusions ever discriminate unlawfully against white defendants 
the dissenters said the decision condones racial bias in jury 
selection 
the court in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify 
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th 
amendments ban on discrimination the amendment guarantees equal 
protection under the law 
the 1986 case involved a black defendant and black jurors and 
was not based on the sixth amendments guarantee to be tried by a 
fair crosssection of the community 
that ruling dramatically curtailed the traditionally broad power 
of prosecutors to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using 
peremptory or automatic challenges 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court in todays case 
said race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue in this 
case 
scalia said the constitutions sixth amendment right to be tried 
by a jury representing a fair crosssection of the community was 
not violated by excluding blacks from the trial of daniel holland 
a chicagoarea white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape 
kidnaping and armed robbery 
hollands sixth amendment claim would be just as strong if the 
object of the exclusion had been not blacks but postmen or 
lawyers or clergymen or any number of other identifiable 
groups scalia said 
the sixth amendment no more forbids the prosecutor to strike 
jurors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on 
the basis of innumerable other generalized characteristics he 
said 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said the 
majority today insulates an especially invidious form of racial 
discrimination in the selection of juries the elimination of 
racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is not a 
constitutional goal that should lightly be set aside 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and harry a 
blackmun 
justice john paul stevens in a separate dissent said a jury 
that is the product of such a racially discriminatory selection 
process cannot possibly be an impartial jury within the meaning of 
the sixth amendment 
joining scalia were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor byron r white and anthony m kennedy 
in hollands case the only two blacks among the more than 30 
prospective jurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on 
the allwhite panel that convicted him 
prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial 
considerations when they used their peremptory challenges to 
exclude the two blacks a man and a woman from the jury 
holland was convicted of raping and kidnaping a des plaines 
ill teenage girl on may 4 1980 
the illinois supreme court ruled that because holland is white 
he lacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played 
a part in the exclusion of the blacks 
the us supreme court ruled otherwise today scalia said a 
white criminal defendant has as much legal standing as a black to 
claim a sixth amendment violation in such a case 
but scalia said hollands claim fails because eliminating a 
distinctive group from a jury does not deprive the defendant of a 
representative jury in violation of the constitution 
the court has never held that representativeness cannot be 
diminished by allowing both the accused and the state to eliminate 
persons thought to be inclined against their interests scalia 
said 
the case is holland vs illinois 885050

the supreme court today scuttled a federal 
lawsuit stemming from the collapse of the old court savings amp loan 
association in maryland saying state courts may handle suits based 
on a federal antiracketeering law 
the justices unanimously ruled that lower federal courts rightly 
dismissed the suit because similar suits were being handled by 
state courts in maryland 
old courts collapse helped trigger a savings and loan crisis in 
maryland in 1985 and led to criminal convictions for former owners 
jeffrey levitt jerome cardin and allan pearlstein 
levitt was sentenced to 30 years in prison for stealing 147 
million from the thrift institution cardin 15 years for stealing 
385000 and pearlstein eight years for stealing 640786 
civil suits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars were filed 
against the owners in federal and state courts some of those 
claims have been settled out of court 
old court owners and others including a law firm and an 
accounting firm that worked for the savings and loan were accused 
in the suits of the largest financial fraud in marylands history 
a group of 30 maryland nonresidents old court investors who 
live in seven other states sued in federal court they alleged 
among other things that the defendants violated the federal 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
the law although primarily aimed at fighting organized crime 
has been used increasingly in lawsuits against businesses 
the investors federal suit was dismissed by a federal judge 
because other suits alleging rico violations were then pending in 
maryland state courts 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal and 
todays decision said the appeals court was right the ruling 
resolves conflicting rulings on the issue among the nations 
federal appeals courts 
we hold that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to 
consider civil claims arising under rico justice sandra day 
oconnor wrote for the court 
nothing in the language structure legislative history or 
underlying policies of rico suggests that congress intended 
otherwise she said 
the case is tafflin vs levitt 881650

authorities today released a leading 
palestinian activist after he was arrested last week on suspicion 
of financing palestinian militants 
the proplo activist faisal husseini has been mentioned as a 
likely negotiator in proposed israelipalestinian peace talks 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile threatened to resign 
if he loses a vote of confidence in his middle east peace plan when 
his rightwing likud bloc convenes next month to consider motions 
by hardliners that the plan be dropped 
it is very clear that if the party central committee doesnt 
support me i cannot stand at the head of likud and not at the head 
of the country shamir said in an interview on israel army radio 
also today attorney general yosef harish ordered police to 
investigate suspicions that science minister ezer weizman of the 
leftofcenter labor party held illegal contacts with palestine 
liberation organization figures israel radio reported 
husseini unshaven and wearing a leather coat after leaving a 
police lockup told reporters nothing will stop the peace 
process he was released without bail while the investigation 
against him continues 
about a dozen supporters of the antiarab kach movement tried to 
attack husseini as he left the jail his supporters blocked them 
and the two groups exchanged blows with fists and clubs 
women from the organization victims of arab terror also 
scuffled nearby with palestinian women 
no one was reported injured in the melees and husseini managed 
to push his way into a waiting car 
his arrest friday brought international criticism us state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in washington that 
such actions discourage palestinian confidence in the peace 
process and contribute to the prevailing atmosphere of distrust 
israeli leaders have rejected charges by israeli liberals and 
palestinians that husseini was arrested to placate rightwing 
pressure groups 
authorities have said husseini belonged to a hostile 
organization and paid 450 to palestinian activists to buy 
uniforms 
in a detention hearing friday a district court judge ordered 
husseini held for four days for questioning 
before his release today husseini appeared before a police 
investigator who said the inquiry against him would continue but 
that there was no need to extend his detention 
israel radio said husseini was questioned during the weekend by 
israels domestic security service and that several palestinians 
were arrested as a result the report did not elaborate 
husseini 49 has been involved in behindthescenes diplomatic 
efforts to arrange israelipalestinian talks in egypt on israels 
proposal for elections in the occupied lands 
husseini who speaks fluent hebrew frequently addresses israeli 
audiences calling for a palestinian state alongside israel and 
denouncing violence on both sides 
husseini spent 18 months in prison at the start of the 
2yearold palestinian uprising without being charged 
the reports of an inquiry of weizman comes three weeks after 
allegations that he had plo contacts nearly broke up israels 
coalition government shamir forced him to resign from the 
decisionmaking inner cabinet because of the accusations 
justice ministry officials could not immediately be reached for 
comment 
despite an investigation weizman would be immune from 
prosecution unless parliament lifted his immunity as a legislator 
by a majority vote israeli law bars contacts with the plo as a 
terrorist organization allowing a maximum punishment of three 
years in jail

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
former high school wrestling coachs 15yearold libel lawsuit 
against an ohio newspaper a case that reached the high court twice 
previously 
the justices said they will review an ohio supreme court ruling 
that threw out michael milkovichs 1975 suit against the news 
herald of lake county 
the willoughbybased newspaper is published by the lorain 
journal co it and onetime sports writer ted diadiun now an editor 
with the plain dealer in cleveland were sued over a 1975 column 
that accused milkovich and a former school administrator of lying 
during a court hearing 
milkovich was coaching maple heights high schools wrestling 
team at a 1974 home meet against mentor high school when a melee 
involving both teams and spectators erupted several wrestlers were 
hospitalized 
diadiun who was at the meet wrote several articles criticizing 
milkovichs conduct 
in a jan 8 1975 column diadiun accused the coach and h don 
scott then superintendent of maple heights public schools of 
lying to a judge who had overturned disciplinary measures against 
the maple heights team 
during extensive litigation milkovich won two preliminary 
rounds before the ohio supreme court and both victories were left 
intact by the nations highest court 
in a 1984 decision the ohio court ruled that diadiuns 
statements about milkovich were reported as facts not opinion 
expressions of opinion generally are immune from libel lawsuits 
but in ruling on scotts related libel suit two years later the 
ohio supreme court reversed its 1984 ruling and said diadiuns 
statements were expressions of his opinion 
in an unusual move the ohio court used its aug 6 1986 
decision in scotts case to doom as well milkovichs suit against 
the paper and diadiun 
the state court voting 43 and applying a totality of the 
circumstances test said the suedover column is immune under 
the constitutions freespeech guarantees from liability 
one factor discussed by the ohio court was the columns 
placement on the papers sports page what the court called a 
traditional haven for cajoling invective and hyperbole 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for milkovich urged the 
justices to use his case to clarify how courts should determine 
whether allegedly libelous statements are to be viewed as fact 
or opinion 
but lawyers for the newspaper and diadiun said the appeal should 
be rejected because the ohio court had based its decision not only 
on the federal constitution but on the ohio constitution as well 
a states highest court not the us supreme court is the 
ultimate interpreter of that states constitution 
the case is milkovich vs lorain journal co 89645

the supreme court giving another signal that 
it is willing to allow random drug testing of government employees 
in sensitive positions today rejected appeals by justice 
department employees and civilian army counselors 
the justices in their first drugtesting rulings last march 
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in 
accidents and for us customs service employees applying for jobs 
in drug enforcement or jobs that require carrying a gun 
neither of those rulings however determined the 
constitutionality of randomly administered drug tests 
today the court without comment rejected appeals by justice 
department employees with top security clearance and civilian army 
drug and alcohol counselors who said mandatory random tests violate 
their privacy rights 
in other action the court 
ruled in the case of a convicted white rapist that fairtrial 
rights are not violated when blacks are excluded from serving as 
jurors 
but the 54 ruling in an illinois case did not leave white 
defendants powerless to challenge the exclusion of blacks from 
their juries the court left unanswered whether such racebased 
exclusions ever discriminate unlawfully against white defendants 
the dissenters said the decision condones racial bias in jury 
selection 
agreed to decide whether nuclear industry whistleblowers 
who say they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may 
sue under state personalinjury laws 
the justices said they will review a north carolina case in 
which a federal appeals court said such workers must sue under a 
special federal law 
agreed to use a decadelong dispute over the rights of haitian 
refugees to decide when the government must pay legal fees to 
people who sue it successfully 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal aimed 
at limiting such fees 
refused to require arbitration for hundreds of thousands of 
federal workers when they are fired demoted or otherwise 
disciplined 
the court without comment rejected appeals by a labor union 
and the federal labor relations authority seeking broader job 
protection for federal employees 
in one of the drugtesting cases acted on today the us 
circuit court of appeals here upheld random urinalysis for several 
hundred civilian drug counselors in the army 
the appeals court said requiring them to submit to the tests is 
reasonable because counselors who use illicit drugs are bound to be 
unsympathetic to their mission of helping others overcome drug 
addiction 
the army maintains a legitimate interest in ensuring that its 
employees are allegiant to their essential mission the appeals 
court said 
random testing for thousands of other civilian army workers who 
fly and service planes and helicopters and hold law enforcement 
jobs was upheld by the appeals court also those employees did not 
appeal 
the drug counselors appeal was made by their union the 
national federation of federal employees 
in the case involving topranked justice department employees 
the appeals court said the governments interest in protecting 
topsecurity information outweighs individual privacy interests 
but the appeals court barred the government from imposing random 
tests for other department employees such as federal prosecutors 
and workers with access to grand jury information 
bush administration lawyers did not ask the supreme court to 
permit more widespread drug testing by overturning that portion of 
the appeals court ruling 
but administration lawyers urged the court not to disturb the 
rulings that permit testing of the army drug counselors and justice 
department employees with top security clearance 
the counselors occupy a critical place in the armys 
comprehensive drug program the government lawyers said 
as for justice department employees with top security clearance 
the government said it is reasonable to require those entrusted 
with the governments most closely held secrets to be drug free 
the testing of federal employees stems from a 1986 order issued 
by thenpresident ronald reagan calling for a drugfree federal 
workplace 
the supreme courts 1989 drugtesting rulings and the cases 
acted on today do not bear directly on workers in private 
employment 
congress is reviewing proposed legislation that would set 
federal standards for testing by private businesses a number of 
states already have drugtesting laws some of them give more 
privacy protection to workers than the federal proposal 
army counselors and justice department employees whose tests 
show they have used drugs are subject to disciplinary action or 
even firing but do not face criminal prosecution as a result of 
the tests 
the cases are national federation of federal employees vs 
cheney 89635 and bell vs thornburgh 89679

world chess champion garri kasparov today 
criticized the soviet military crackdown in his hometown of baku 
saying it came too late to help his fellow armenians in the 
embattled republic of azerbaijan 
kasparov a jewisharmenian said he rescued 60 of his friends 
and relatives from the violence wednesday night and that he had 
lost two relatives in the ethnic fighting between azerbaijanis and 
armenians 
he said he used his money to charter a plane virtually 
impossible in the soviet union with the help of the chess union 
and managed to get the people past vigilante squads to the airport 
on a back road 
kasparov said there were plenty of soviet interior ministry 
troops and police in baku before soldiers stormed the capital of 
azerbaijan on saturday to put down a nationalist uprising 
yet they took no armed action against azerbaijanis who roved the 
city in bands and killed armenians in a campaign of terror against 
the minority population kasparov claimed at a news conference 
kasparov said azerbaijanis angry with soviet troops could turn 
on the 100000 russians of baku expanding the ethnic conflict 
beyond the caucasus 
i fear that what is now happening in azerbaijan may lead to a 
terrible bloodbath in the whole country he said 
the mainly moslem republic azerbaijan and the neighboring 
republic of armenia which is predominately christian are locked 
in a decadesold dispute over nagornokarabakh a region of 
azerbaijan that is populated mainly by armenians 
at least 167 people have been killed since the violence began 10 
days ago including 83 since soviet troops entered the city 
saturday morning and were met by firebombs and machinegun fire 
azerbaijani estimates of the death toll are far higher 
kasparov said moscow either was unwilling or unable to solve 
ethnic disputes involving azerbaijan and armenia and he called for 
individuals to begin direct negotiations between the republics he 
volunteered to act as a mediator himself 
officials have evacuated the armenians and kasparov contended 
virtually all had left by the time soviet troops assaulted on 
saturday 
therefore he said he believed the military action was intended 
to crush the azerbaijani independence movement not stop the 
killing as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
kasparov blamed much of the violence on the desperation of 
homeless azerbaijanis many of whom seized armenians apartments 
you do not have to be a politician or a particularly 
farsighted person to see the political danger that lies in homeless 
people who have nothing to look forward to he said

the party contend party leaders are not moving fast enough 
koprinka chervenkova the spokeswoman for a reformminded 
faction within the ruling communist party said if the party 
ignores the various ideological trends platforms and associations 
inside it the alternative socialist society will leave the party

roman catholics reacted with sorrow shock and at 
least one protest to the proposed closing of about 30 churches and 
10 religiousrun schools in the nations second largest archdiocese 
i feel like im losing my faith said ray rean who said he 
was born and baptized 69 years ago in st cyril and st methodius 
parish which is scheduled to be closed 
cardinal joseph bernardin announced the closings and mergers 
sunday to ease a budget defict that has forced the archdiocese to 
borrow from commercial banks for the first time in its 110year 
history the financial rescue plan also includes asking for greater 
donations and higher school fees 
though some schools and congregations knew in advance some 
parish priests broke the news in announcements at services saturday 
night and sunday morning 
for some people this is their whole life anna de santo said 
after learning that her church st john nepomucene may be among 
those that are shuttered my grandson was christened here my 
children educated here my father buried from here im very sad 
parishioner howard holubetz said he was shocked to learn st 
dionysius church in suburban cicero would close 
we were pretty well told if we could keep our nose above 
water and we have that it would not close he said 
bernardin said shifts in demographics have left some churches 
and schools with too few people to meet costs officials say 27 
percent of churches in the archdiocese sit less than half a mile 
from a neighboring one reflecting the practice in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries of providing ethnicoriented parishes to 
serve various immigrant groups 
the archdiocese has experienced several years of deficit 
spending much of it to prop up individual parishes it has 
borrowed 15 million since july 1988 and officials think theyll 
need to borrow at least 5 million more before the end of june 
without measures to stem the red ink archdiocese debt could 
balloon to 142 million in 1993 officials have said 
in the past five years 27 parishes and 20 elementary schools 
have closed or consolidated while five new or consolidated 
parishes and six new or consolidated schools have been created 
declines in numbers of priests and nuns forced the church to 
hire lay employees at higher costs insurance costs have risen as 
has the cost of maintaining church buildings bernardin said 
officials said sunday that the precise number of closings is not 
yet known but they estimated the number at about 30 churches and 
six to 11 schools in the city and several suburbs 
the majority are to close by the end of june and the rest by the 
end of june 1991 
about 200 people demonstrated at the cardinals residence later 
in the day to protest the announcement last week that the 
604student quigley south prep seminary will be closed at the end 
of the school year 
the closings and a planned 10 percent cut in administrative 
costs will save more than 13 million officials said in a news 
release 
the chicago archdiocese has 416 parishes in cook and lake 
counties an area where 235 million of the 57 million population 
is catholic 
it has the largest number of parishes and catholic institutions 
in the nation and is second in parishioners to los angeles 
according to officials it runs the largest catholic school system 
in the country with 343 elementary schools 52 secondary schools 
eight colleges or universities and five seminaries 
in detroit last year cardinal edmund szoka ordered 30 city 
parishes to either close or merge citing a shortage of priests 
declining membership and the increasing costs of maintaining church 
facilities 
today szoka was named by pope john paul ii to a top financial 
post at the vatican he will head the prefecture for economic 
affairs of the holy see which draws up the vaticans budget 
at a news conference called to discuss his appointment he 
reacted to the chicago announcement saying other american cities 
that no longer have the flood of immigrants they did decades ago 
may face the same cutbacks 
as painful as it is we must face the reality szoka said 
we simply cant hang onto the past we have to change we did 
that in detroit 
i was the first to do so on such a grand scale chicago now 
faces a similar situation other cities like philadelphia new 
york and cleveland and cities of that type will face the same 
problem and possibly the same solution

the us governments acceptance of a plea bargain 
by subsidiaries of the worlds seventhlargest private bank for 
laundering millions in drug money is being called a joke by some 
critics 
but other observers say the deal with the bank of commerce and 
credit international may be justified if it helps win a conviction 
against deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
it seems like a light hit but it depends on what the 
government is going to get out of them it could be they are 
sitting on a wealth of information said robert powis a former 
us treasury official 
the divisions of the luxembourgbased bank pleaded guilty 
tuesday to about 30 charges including tax fraud money laundering 
and failing to report currency transactions of more than 10000 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he was seeking an 
explanation about the arrangement from the justice department and 
may initiate a congressional investigation 
i dont believe that the entire criminal justice system in 
america nor all of our efforts to eliminate drugs in america 
revolves just around noriega metzenbaum said 
at the justice department today spokesman david runkel defended 
the plea agreement saying it guarantees the banks cooperation in 
continuing investigations of international money laundering 
runkel also noted it resulted in the largest forfeiture ever 
in a case like this from a financial institution 
were satisfied this is a good deal runkel said adding 
that the agreement contains further penalties if the banks fail to 
fulfill their obligations to the us government 
the subsidiaries of bcci which has assets of about 20 billion 
admitted in tampa federal court to laundering 14 million in drug 
profits for traffickers tied to noriega 
originally charged with laundering 32 million in cocaine 
profits the bank agreed to forfeit only the 14 million that the 
us government was able to freeze during its operation cchase 
investigation that began in 1986 
fines which could have reached 45 million were suspended the 
bank also was placed on five years of governmentsupervised 
probation and promised to cooperate with prosecutors in whats 
left of the moneylaundering trial 
the top remaining defendant is amjad awan a bank officer who 
told a us senate panel in 1988 he had acted as noriegas personal 
banker managing up to 23 million in the dictators secret 
accounts at the banks panama branch jury selection resumed this 
morning at the trial 
us district judge w terrell hodges has imposed a gag order to 
prevent parties in the case from commenting 
the bush administration has backed new initiatives against money 
laundering during the past year amid mounting evidence that 
interdiction efforts have failed to keep drugs from flooding the 
nations borders 
the banks forfeiture is the largest in a moneylaundering case 
against a financial institution in the united states 
mark schnapp a former assistant us attorney who advises banks 
on how to prevent criminals from gaining access to their accounts 
said financial penalties against bcci are less significant than the 
fact that an entire bank has pleaded guilty to money laundering 
i think its a substantial price to pay said schnapp no 
bank or banker would want to step up to the podium and say theyre 
guilty that smell sticks with them a long time 
but floridas comptroller gerald lewis said weve declared 
unconditional war on drug traffickers thats been the rhetoric in 
washington and elsewhere was it all just a joke 
sen john kerry dmass who chairs the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on narcotics said the penalty was too 
lenient 
i think its a very very light sentence its that simple 
kerry said i think it undercuts the war on drugs

the supreme court ruled today that lawyers in 
the nations capital violated antitrust law when they went on 
strike to demand higher pay from the city for representing poor 
criminal defendants 
by a 63 vote the court said the boycott was a plain 
violation of antitrust laws 
the case now goes back to a lower court to consider reinstating 
an order by the federal trade commission that prohibits the lawyers 
from engaging in similar conduct in the future 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court rejected 
arguments that the attorneys boycott is protected by the 
constitution 
the undenied objective of their boycott was an economic 
advantage for those who agreed to participate no matter how 
altruistic the motives may have been he said 
stevens said the case is different from a boycott by blacks in 
mississippi who refused to buy from white merchants the court in 
1982 ruled that the first amendement protected those boycotters 
against antitrust damages 
in a dissenting opinion joined by justice thurgood marshall 
justice william j brennan said todays ruling goes too far in 
limiting freeexpression rights 
brennan said the lawyers may have violated antitrust law but he 
said the ftc must first prove the attorneys exerted market 
power that they were capable of exercising economic control 
through concerted action to determine how much the city paid them 
justice harry blackmun also dissented 
the lawyers are members of the superior court trial lawyers 
association the group organized a boycott in 1983 to pressure the 
district of columbia government to increase the hourly compensation 
paid to attorneys who represent indigent criminal defendants 
the attorneys some 100 lawyers who represent most of the citys 
poor criminal defendants had been receiving 30 an hour for time 
in court and 20 an hour for outofcourt work they won a 25 per 
hour increase after a twoweek boycott in which nearly all of them 
refused to accept new cases 
the boycott created a crisis for the city swamping the city 
public defenders office with criminal cases the city government 
agreed to the higher hourly rate at an annual cost to taxpayers of 
more than 4 million 
the private lawyers who boycotted represent 85 percent of the 
poor defendants the remaining defendants are represented by the 
public defender service thirdyear law students or in a small 
number of cases lawyers volunteering to work free 
the ftc ruled after the socalled strike that the lawyers had 
engaged in price fixing and an illegal boycott and ordered them not 
to engage in similar conduct again 
the us circuit court of appeals here set aside the ftc 
decision and ordered the agency to conduct further study to 
determine whether the lawyers exerted market power 
the case is ftc vs superior court trial lawyers association

declaring india will make no deals over 
human corpses prime minister vp singh rejected a 470 million 
settlement with union carbide in the bhopal gas disaster and vowed 
to pursue 3 billion instead 
the new prime minister also said sunday that his government 
would press criminal charges in the case 
the 1984 gas leak the worlds deadliest industrial disaster 
killed more than 3500 people the 470 million settlement was 
accepted last year by the indian supreme court and by singhs 
predecessor rajiv gandhi 
singh was greeted sunday by surging crowds when he arrived at 
the jaiprakash nagar shantytown where many of the victims had 
lived 
some people draped garlands of flowers around singhs neck or 
knelt to touch his feet as he walked through the narrow lanes of 
huts just across the street from the nowclosed union carbide plant 
at a public rally attended by an estimated 100000 people 
onetenth of bhopals population singh declared we have decided 
to do away with the settlement and pursue the 3 billion suit 
against the company and also the criminal suit against ucc union 
carbide corp officials 
he promised that his government would provide interim relief to 
all people living in affected areas the amount of money to be paid 
will be determined within one month he said 
the prime minister who took office dec 2 did not spell out 
how his government would revive the legal case 
union carbide said today from its headquarters in danbury 
conn that it would have no comment beyond a statement made last 
week by joseph e geoghan the companys vice president and general 
counsel 
the settlement was extremely fair and is a binding agreement 
of the union of india geoghan said at the time 
indias supreme court on feb 15 accepted the 470 million deal 
as full and final settlement of the governments suit which 
had been dragging through a maze of indian court procedures for 
about four years 
the gandhi government originally sought 3 billion in damages 
and later filed criminal negligence charges against top officials 
of union carbide and dissolved its local subsidiary 
when union carbide and the gandhi government agreed on the 470 
million the supreme court absolved the company of further civil or 
criminal liability 
however under indian law the decision is subject to review if 
challenged 
gas victims and activist groups filed petitions with the court 
challenging the settlement on two grounds that the gandhi 
government had no right to declare itself the sole representative 
of all claims arising from the bhopal gas disaster and that the 
compensation of 470 million was inadequate 
the supreme court declared dec 22 that the gandhi government 
did indeed have the right to be the claimants only 
representative 
the second challenge is still pending and the singh government 
announced jan 12 it would support the challengers 
union carbide has maintained the gas leak was the result of 
sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the bhopal plant the 
government maintained the disaster was caused by company negligence 
methyl isocyanate a liquid used in making pesticides leaked 
from a tank and turned into a deadly vapor when it hit the air dec 
3 1984 while most people were asleep 
according to figures compiled by the government of madhya 
pradesh state which includes bhopal the death toll has reached 
3598 about half the victims died immediately or within a few days 
of exposure to the gas the others died later of respiratory and 
other problems caused by the gas according to government records

president bush assured antiabortion marchers 
today of his deep conviction against the supreme court ruling 
17 years ago today that legalized abortion and his steadfast 
opposition to abortion on demand 
bush speaking by telephone to marchers gathered outside the 
white house before their annual march past the capitol and the 
supreme court said the antiabortion movement reminds americans 
of the selfevident moral superiority of adoption over abortion 
bush also addressed the march for life last year on his third 
day as president continuing the tradition of his predecessor 
ronald reagan 
even as he spoke prochoice forces led by the planned 
parenthood federation were urging americans to call the white house 
switchboard to register their support for legal abortions 
bush in remarks that lasted just 90 seconds said before you 
begin the march i want to take a minute to share my deep personal 
concern about abortion on demand which i oppose 
for 17 years the march for life has served as a poignant 
reminder to all americans that human life in all its forms must be 
respected and i think all of you know my deep conviction on roe 
vs wade he added 
the protest movement also reminds americans especially young 
americans of the selfevident moral superiority of adoption over 
abortion we should all be grateful to the families that adopt 
babies giving them care and love and a chance for a wonderful 
life said bush two of whose 12 grandchildren are adopted 
after hearing bush and a handful of congressmen and other 
speakers the crowd planned to march up pennsylvania avenue to the 
us capitol and the supreme court 
leaders of the national right to life committee praised the 
president and said they had no differences with republican national 
chairman lee atwaters statements that the party can support 
candidates on both sides of the abortion debate 
we dont believe hes signaled any change in the republican 
partys position said david osteen executive director of the 
antiabortion group of course the republican party contains and 
is big enough to contain people with both points of view as is the 
democratic party 
earlier backers of legal abortion raised the specter of 
romanias former communist repression in warning against a rollback 
of abortion rights 
the head of the national abortion rights action league told a 
gathering on capitol hill that legalizing abortions was one of the 
first steps romania took after overthrowing its hated dictator last 
month 
romanians know firsthand what most americans can only imagine 
the deadly impact of government bans on abortion said kate 
michelman executive director of the abortionrights lobbying group 
it would be a travesty if the united states the beacon of 
democracy in the world applauded romanias reforms while adopting 
repressive antichoice laws here at home she said 
activists on both sides of the issue sensing 1990 will be a 
pivotal year in the political debate on abortion held competing 
events marking the anniversary of the high court decision that 
legalized abortions 
abortion foes expected tens of thousands of marchers in 
washington and more at smaller events around the country 
abortionrights advocates also gathered on the mall outside the 
capitol where a temporary memorial was erected in tribute to all 
women who have died from illegal botched abortions including 
becky bell a 17yearold indianapolis girl who died in september 
1988 after a selfinduced abortion 
bill bell her father said his daughter died because indiana 
law requires minors to obtain parental consent before they can get 
a legal abortion 
our daughter was punished he said she was denied a 
reasonable and safe choice because she loved her parents and died 
not wanting to disappoint them how many more young women will 
share beckys fate if we allow our government to deny them a safe 
choice 
sen bob packwood of oregon a leading republican supporter of 
abortion rights said his party is being damaged by the strongly 
antiabortion platform and position of bush who vetoed 
abortionrights bills passed by congress last fall 
he predicted the antiabortion plank in the republican party 
platform will be removed in 1992 
activists on both sides of the abortion issue rallied sunday in 
cities across the country from albany ny to sacramento calif 
leaders of the antiabortion movement planned to meet with 
bushs chief of staff john sununu and other administration 
officials but there were no plans for the president to see them 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday sununu is a 
strong opponent of abortion 
others planning to speak to the antiabortion rally included 
republican sens jesse helms of north carolina and gordon humphrey 
of new hampshire 
abortion opponents have held their march for life every year 
since the courts decision 
but this years events had a new significance it was the first 
since the high courts webster decision in july 1989 which opened 
the door for states to impose some restrictions on abortion 
most of the time this is a sad occasion said nancy myers 
spokeswoman for the national right to life committee but theres 
a sense of hope this year because for the first time since 1973 the 
supreme court has said it will allow some reasonable limits on 
abortion 
the march came as political debate on abortion has intensified 
abortion opponents have said they intend to push for new 
restrictions on abortions in many state legislatures but 
candidates who supported abortion rights won key elections last 
fall and prochoice leaders claim public opinion has shifted to 
their side

five months after a high school football 
coach replaced a black quarterback with a lessexperienced white 
player a chain of recriminations has embittered race relations in 
this small town 
racial problems generally had stayed hidden in this bucolic town 
of 14000 residents but the largely black protesters say the 
boycott of the team picketing of the school and weekly marches 
that began in august are partly the result of longstanding 
grievances 
conway very definitely has a problem with racism america has 
a problem with racism said the rev hh singleton a former 
science teacher who was fired by the allwhite school board after 
becoming a spokesman for boycotting black players conways 
population is 41 percent black 
while these kinds of incidents have been happening all along 
the white community thinks its nothing to get excited about 
said dr william gibson a greenville dentist and chairman of the 
naacp national board of directors yes it angers them because 
theyre not used to it they blame the person who is the victim 
every time 
said mayor ike long who is white i dont think that conway 
had a racial problem as such until this thing came up i dont know 
that we have so much of a racial problem now 
the demonstrations began after conway highs white football 
coach chuck jordan switched quarterback carlos hunt who is 
black to defensive back jordan replaced hunt with mickey wilson 
jr a lessexperienced player and the son of an assistant coach 
jordan later said he made the change because hunt refused to 
follow his instructions on the field 
hunt wasnt happy with the switch and neither were many of his 
teammates on aug 22 singleton announced that 31 of the 37 black 
players were boycotting the team to protest the quarterback change 
all but 10 of the striking players stayed out the entire season and 
the team ended up with a 111 record 
less than a week after the walkout began the parents of 61 
white students enrolled in singletons science class at conway 
middle school requested their children be assigned another teacher 
the following day horry county school superintendent john dawsey 
suspended singleton on the grounds he was disrupting school the 
school board fired singleton who also is pastor of cherry hill 
baptist church three months later 
what followed were protest marches through town that drew 
hundreds of marchers on several saturdays regular picketing 
outside the high school a twoday boycott of classes by black 
students and a promise by the naacp to stage a political and 
economic boycott in horry county 
an investigation by state human affairs commissioner james 
clyburn determined the hunt incident was not racially motivated 
long appointed a biracial task force to study the issue 
in general clyburns findings were supported by the white 
community and decried by blacks 
leaders of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people say they will continue their protest until singleton 
is reinstated in his teaching job and will press for other 
changes for one thing they want a change in hiring practices for 
schools in the town which is 15 miles northwest of myrtle beach 
a lengthy investigation by the state human affairs commission 
concluded last month that for the last decade white job applicants 
in horry county schools have had a distinct advantage over blacks 
the investigation was begun before the dispute over the football 
team arose 
on saturday 1000 people turned out for a protest march in 
myrtle beach 
its a process that has to evolve gibson said horry 
county is moving in that direction but it hasnt arrived yet 
were going to march in conway a long time a lot of times

only five volunteers were asked to execute deposed 
dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife last month but the entire 
80man firing squad insisted on shooting a member of romanias 
interim government told a newspaper 
silviu brucan a member of the 11member executive council of 
the national salvation front told the daily newspaper le figaro 
that the enthusiasm of the firing squad reflected the popular 
support for the dec 25 execution 
i can tell you that when the firing squad was formed the 
officer in command asked for five soldiers to step forward and 
prepare to fire the squad was made up of 80 men all fired at the 
same moment they found 120 bullet holes in the bodies of nicolae 
and elena ceausescu brucan said in the interview published 
monday 
some western nations criticized the new romanian leaders for 
conducting the trial of the ceausescus in secret parts of the 
trial later were shown on state television 
brucan said the leaders of romanias revolution would have 
prefered to hold a public trial but in the context of dec 24 
that was utopic 
that sunday was the most dangerous for the romanian 
revolution he said recalling in the interview that the state 
securitate was on the offensive and had attacked the tv station 
we thought there was a risk of the securitate attacking the 
barracks where ceausescu and his wife were being detained if they 
had been freed and retaken by their men it would have been a 
bloodbath in romania brucan told the newspaper 
he added that after it was announced that ceausescu was dead and 
state tv showed pictures of his body the unity of the securitate 
began to fall apart 
brucan said about 10000 people died during the violence in 
december but that life has begun to return to normal but he 
added it could be many years before the country achieved democracy 
and the kind of open political system hoped for by his countrymen 
our people should learn democracy and us as well we should 
learn to govern democratically he told the newspaper in 10 
years social life will achieve an equalibrium but for democracy 
it will take 20 years in any case that is my opinion

taken monday by the supreme court 
 
drug tests 
 
the court giving another signal that it is willing to allow 
random drug testing of government employees in sensitive positions 
rejected appeals by justice department employees and civilian army 
counselors 
the justices in their first drugtesting rulings last march 
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in 
accidents and for us customs service employees applying for jobs 
in drug enforcement or jobs that require carrying a gun

attempt to end clashes that have led to at least 167 deaths tass 
said 
the soviet news agency said the agreement came during a meeting 
of armenian and azerbaijani government officials in the border town 
of yeraskh but it would need the approval of armed militants on 
both sides 
in the azerbaijani capital of baku hundreds of thousands of 
azerbaijanis massed today to bury scores of countrymen killed by 
soviet troops dispatched to end the ethnic violence witnesses said 
the official tass news agency said 83 people were killed 
saturday in an assault by soviet troops in baku or in skirmishes 
the previous day 
the ethnic violence flared jan 13 with antiarmenian riots in 
baku a oilproducing center of 17 million people on the caspian 
sea and spread throughout azerbaijan and armenia 
the neighboring republics are locked in a decadesold dispute 
over nagornokarabakh a region of azerbaijan that is populated 
mainly by armenians armenians are predominately christians said the night 
had 
been peaceful 
a political scientist who teaches at the azerbaijan academy of 
sciences jahun mulazade reported scattered gunfire early today 
but said soviet military forces generally appeared in control of 
the city 
azerbaijani activists claimed the death toll in the military 
assault was much higher than the official figure yusif bagirov an 
attorney and member of an independent investigatory commission 
created by baku lawyers asserted that 1000 civilians were killed 
in the district that encompasses baku 
he said at least 94 bodies were in coffins borne through bakus 
streets for burial today 
an emergency overnight session of the azerbaijani legislature 
demanded the withdrawal of soviet army and interior ministry troops 
from the republic with the exception of border districts with 
armenia said another baku lawyer viliyad mamedov who attended 
the 11hour meeting 
lawmakers also demanded the lifting of the curfew in baku and 
the state of emergency gorbachev declared in much of azerbaijan one 
week ago mamedov said by telephone 
if those demands are not met mamedov said the legislature will 
consider voting to secede from the soviet union 
in baku radio television and means of public transport except 
the citys metro were not working today due to the general strike 
mulazade said 
it was not clear who called the strike but radio moscow blamed 
the grassroots azerbaijani peoples front which it said was 
trying to fan hostility and breed popular resentment toward the 
soviet army 
foreign reporters were barred from armenia and azerbaijan so it 
was difficult to determine the exact death toll 
about 29000 soviet troops police cadets and interior ministry 
forces are reported combating the violence in the southern region 
the number of militants has been reported to be in the thousands 
sheikh ul islam the spiritual leader of azerbaijani moslems 
condemned the saturday assault on baku in an address to world and 
religious leaders sent to azerinform today 
in moscow world chess champion garri kasparov today said the 
soviet assault on his native baku was too late to save the 
terrorized armenian population 
i fear that what is now happening in azerbaijan may lead to a 
terrible bloodbath in the whole country said kasparov of jewish 
and armenian parentage who fled baku with 60 relatives and friends

a graduate student was engaged in no 
juvenile prank when he created a worm program that paralyzed 
thousands of computers throughout the nation in 1988 a prosecutor 
contended this morning 
robert t morris 25 of arnold md is the first person 
brought to trial under a section of the 1986 computer fraud and 
abuse act that makes it a felony to break into a federal computer 
network and prevent authorized use of the system closing arguments 
in his federal trial began this morning 
ellen meltzer a trial lawyer for the us justice department 
said morris deliberately stole computer passwords from hundreds of 
people so the worm could break into as many computers as possible 
and she said morris who had testified that he never intended 
for the worm program to cause such harm took deliberate and 
conscious steps to make the rogue program difficult to detect and 
eradicate 
this was not a mistake she said robert morris worked 
diligently at creating this worm at trying to make it better 
but morris lawyer thomas guidoboni contended in his closing 
arguments that didnt intend to cause and did not cause permanent 
damage to any computer files when he unleased the worm 
there was no work lost work was delayed thats the bottom 
line guidoboni said 
he said that once morris realized the worm had gone berserk he 
took steps to try to stop it when that failed guidoboni said 
morris had friends send out a message on an electronic bulletin 
board with instructions how to defeat the worm 
does a person who intends unauthoritized use or to cause a 
system to crash send out a message to stop it of course not 
guidoboni said 
following this mornings closing arguments us district court 
judge howard munson sent the jury to lunch he was expected to 
instruct jurors and give them the case this afternoon 
there is mixed feeling among those who testified over whether 
the suspended cornell university graduate student should be 
severely punished for what he said was an experiment that ran out 
of control 
i dont think he did anything wrong said paul graham a 
government witness who became friends with morris at harvard and 
knew of morris work on the worm 
graham said morris should not be punished because the worm was 
an intellectual experiment common among computer security 
students and the only practical way to test whether security holes 
they find really exist 
a lot of computer security people while in graduate school 
spend time breaking into systems the government has decided it 
doesnt want them to do this anymore graham said they want 
them to learn about computer security from reading books 
but eugene spafford a purdue university computer ethics 
professor who has written about the worm and testified as a 
government witness said morris committed vandalism and should be 
punished accordingly 
he said morris defense that he didnt mean to paralyze the 
internet network which links computers at major universities nasa 
and several military facilities is like an arsonist saying he 
didnt mean for the fire he started to cause any damage 
most of the nearly dozen computer systems managers from 
facilities attacked by the worm said morris should be convicted but 
should not be dealt a harsh sentence 
id like to see an uncontested conviction and a light 
sentence said michael muuss leader of the advanced computer 
systems team at the us army ballistics research laboratory in 
aberdeen md 
i think the conviction would be a deterrent enough for others 
thinking about something like this he said 
morris admitted last thursday on the witness stand that he 
designed the worm specifically to infect internet he said the worm 
was an experiment that turned into a dismal failure because of 
a programming error he made that caused it to replicate wildly once 
it entered a computer 
it took several days to eliminate the worm the rogue program 
was originally termed a computer virus but unlike viruses it 
did not require a host program to reproduce 
although the indictment charged the worm did about 1000 in 
damage computer experts estimated that the time computers were 
down and the labor needed to combat the worm cost 5 million to 12 
million 
the worm was only supposed to break into a handful of the 
180000 computers on internet and then just leave a single copy of 
itself in all but a few machines morris said 
it was a mistake and im sorry were morris last words as 
he stepped off the witness stand

mayor marion barrys arrest on a drug charge 
could do some good as a cautionary tale for white collar drug 
users especially government officials who might believe theyll 
never get caught criminologists suggest 
indeed private queries at some drug treatment centers increased 
sharply after the arrest 
but people wellversed on the subject say such concern by 
possible users usually doesnt last and no one is predicting much 
if any impact on the drug trade in general 
most drug distributors and sellers are very cynical about the 
way the world operates said criminologist richard r bennett of 
american university theyre going to say mayor barry got 
caught its the price you pay for playing the game they 
expect their leaders to be cunning and deviant and deceptive 
because thats how they operate on their daytoday basis 
at the same time geoffrey p alpert university of south 
carolina criminal justice professor said the arrests impact on 
drug users is a very important one that you cannot be above the 
law 
it gives a message to the white collar user he said it 
also gives a message to government officials and that is that no 
matter how hard you try to hide your use of narcotics and 
particularly cocaine you can get caught you can get arrested 
barry who was arrested thursday night has not commented 
directly on the charge of cocaine possession but his lawyer has 
said he will plead not guilty the mayor left the city monday for a 
treatment center 
dr errol segall director of chemical dependence services at 
dominion hospital in falls church va reported that phone calls 
to the hospital have increased three to fourfold since the 
story broke 
during a crisis time people come forth with questions with 
concerns segall said its a breakthrough of their denial 
systems and so they reach out unfortunately once a crisis like 
this episode is past the denial level sort of goes back up and 
thats what keeps drug problems going is a sense of denial 
roger chapin president of the 300000member citizens for a 
drug free america said he doubts barrys arrest will have much 
impact because an awful lot of people have suspected for a long 
time that he was a user 
if another prominent mayor turned out to be a drug user that 
would shake a lot of people chapin said 
bennett said district of columbia children are likely to be 
rattled by the arrest 
the idea of this guy getting up before us two days before 
saying were doing something were winning the war on drugs 
i think it sends a very confusing message to a lot of inner 
city black kids who look up to marion barry as an idol i think 
that is going to hurt us 
dr alfred blumstein dean of the school of urban and public 
affairs at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh said the 
arrests impact is going to depend critically on how the mayor 
plays it 
if he plays the sympathy angle and i gather thats where hes 
going i think he can use that as an opportunity to dedicate 
himself not only to his own salvation but as part of the message 
to the larger community to say look at the evil that can befall 
one when one gets messed up with drugs blumstein said in an 
interview monday 
the arrest demonstrates that the war on drugs ultimately is 
going to have to get at demand issues blumstein said its 
clear that as long as the demand is maintained the supply side 
will find a way to meet it whether through new sources of supply 
new ports of entry or new drugs

a leading government researcher expressed 
concern about the continuation of a study in which more than 300 
children with aids are not getting the drug azt now widely 
believed to be effective in children 
half the children in the study are getting an unproven drug 
called intravenous immunoglobulin or ivig half are getting only a 
placebo lacking any beneficial ingredients 
in october health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
acted to make azt widely available to children saying there was 
enough preliminary evidence the drug was effective and safe azt is 
the only antiaids drug so far approved for routine use 
dr anthony fauci the director of the national program to test 
and evaluate potential antiaids drugs said he believes the time 
has come to give all patients access to azt and said he has 
expressed his doubts about the childrens study 
i questioned that many many months ago fauci said in an 
interview sunday during the new yorkitaly medical symposium 
fauci also has set up a trial to test intravenous 
immunoglobulin but in his trial the children receiving ivig and 
those receiving a placebo are all receiving azt as well 
i made sure in our own institute that a trial was done which 
included an azt arm said fauci i dont feel comfortable with 
a placebocontrolled trial at this stage he said 
fauci is the director of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases in bethesda md which operates the national 
aids drugtesting program 
the director of the experiment he questioned dr anne 
willoughby of the national institute of child health and human 
development in bethesda has emphasized that children in her trial 
were not being denied azt in fact however few are receiving it 
of the 347 children in the trial 31 are getting azt that 
leaves 316 who are either receiving ivig alone or are receiving 
nothing the children are being treated at more than two dozen 
centers across the country willoughby said 
there is a legitimate difference of opinion about the status 
of this study willoughby said she said she would like to see 
more data on the trials of azt in children before she was convinced 
of its effectiveness 
several researchers interviewed by the associated press were 
critical of willoughbys study agreeing with fauci that children 
should be given azt the most vocal of them was dr philip pizzo 
chief of the pediatrics branch at the national cancer institute 
willoughby said he has more experience than anyone else on the 
use of azt in children 
the issue of immunoglobulin alone might have been timely three 
or four years ago pizzo has said but in 1989 not having azt 
means that the potential benefit of the drug particularly to 
childrens nervous systems is being lost 
pizzos studies have shown that azt can stop or even reverse 
damage to the brain and central nervous system in children as a 
result some children who had lost the ability to speak or walk 
have recovered those abilities pizzo has reported 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
as of nov 30 the latest date for which figures are available 
the us centers for disease control had received reports of 1947 
cases of children with aids and 1059 deaths 
dr keith krasinski a pediatrician at new york university 
medical center who is helping to conduct willoughbys experiment 
disagrees with pizzo 
it would be premature to say that azt is the standard of 
therapy krasinski has said 
willoughby said the studys data safety and monitoring board an 
independent group that could halt the trial if it were considered 
unethical has repeatedly approved its continuation 
researchers disagree over the potential usefulness of 
immunoglobulin some have found that it can help reduce the 
frequency of bacterial infections in children with aids others say 
the studies so far are too preliminary to be conclusive

the head of the naacp today questioned whether 
the cocaine arrest of district of columbia mayor marion barry was 
part of a pattern of harassment of elected black officials and 
the rising tide of racism in this nation 
naacp executive director benjamin l hooks commented to 
reporters after meeting for the second time in two weeks with 
president bush on the recent wave of bombings and threats against 
civil rights targets in the south 
hooks who led a delegation of 17 naacp leaders to the white 
house said afterward he was fairly satisfied with the 
administrations actions in the case 
hooks said the delegation and bush did not discuss barrys 
arrest at a washington hotel last thursday night the president has 
had no comment on it except to say sunday that it was very sad 
im not trying to justify any wrongdoing or condone use of 
cocaine hooks said but i am opposed to selective enforcement of 
the law 
the naacp leader said newspaper accounts of barrys arrest in an 
fbi sting operation made it sound like the search had finally 
paid off we spent all of these years trying to find him with a 
grain of cocaine and by god we did it didnt we 
we havent found all the people whove stolen all the money 
from the savings and loan associations and are driving rolls royces 
and jaguars so obviously many of us in the black community will 
have some peculiar feelings as we go further said hooks 
a reporter then asked youre not saying its wrong to bring 
somebody to justice for violating the law are you dr hooks 
no i think you ought to bring everybody to justice for 
violating the law he eplied that would have meant most of us 
here would be arrested for speeding spitting on the sidewalk or 
something if we can afford to do it lets do it 
i simply said that there will be in the minds of many blacks 
the continued feeling that there has been undue harassment of black 
elected officials to the extent that that fits into this 
conference the rising tide of racism in this nation it is 
something we want to examine hooks said 
hooks did not give any other examples of harassment of black 
elected officials 
bush also met today with actorstrongman arnold schwarzenegger 
the new chairman of the presidents council on physical fitness 
he also planned a midday address by telephone from the oval 
office to support antiabortion activists march for life 
rallying at a park behind the white house 
hooks also visited the white house on jan 9 to discuss the wave 
of bombings and threats against civil rights targets in the south 
he came this time with 16 other officials including dr william f 
gibson a greenville sc dentist and chairman of the naacp board 
also attending the meeting were attorney general dick thornburgh 
and fbi director william sessions 
gibson said the administration officials told them there was 
some movement in finding those who mailed bombs that killed a 
federal judge in birmingham ala and a civil rights lawyer in 
savannah ga as well as others mailed to the federal courthouse 
in atlanta and the naacp office in jacksonville fla 
hooks said he had asked bush for another meeting to discuss 
other concerns of the 600000member civil rights group 
todays march for life came on the 17th anniversary of the 
supreme courts roe vs wade ruling that struck down state laws 
against abortion 
during a similar march in january 1989 bush called abortion on 
demand our american tragedy he said i think the supreme 
courts decision in roe vs wade was wrong and should be 
overturned i think america needs a human life amendment 
when it comes to abortion theres a better way the way of 
adoption the way of life he said then 
bush once took a more permissive view of abortion but changed 
his position by the time he became ronald reagans running mate in 
1980 now he opposes abortion except to save the mothers life or 
in cases of rape or incest and he favors federal funding of 
abortion only to save the mothers life 
newsweek magazine reported sunday that the president and his 
family are deeply divided on the issue with all the women 
prochoice and all the men antiabortion 
the magazine said it had learned that bush and his wife barbara 
discussed the issue at a recent family gathering with their 
children and spouses 
the family split down the middle the magazine said without 
identifying its source all the women were prochoice all the 
men antiabortion 
it added that some of the women including the first lady said 
abortion should not be without controls but they believed in a 
womans right to choose in certain circumstances 
mrs bush has refused to answer reporters questions about her 
personal views on abortion

city administrator carol thompson who will be 
in charge of the district of columbia government while mayor marion 
barry receives treatment said today that there was no management 
vaccuum 
the daytoday management of this government has been and 
continues to be a team effort ms thompson said at a news 
conference the top managers are competent professionals who 
have acted in barrys absence before she added 
barry turned over his administrative role to ms thompson on 
friday the day after he was arrested on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge 
she asked the media and critics to give her time to 
finetune the operations 
top officials will be in contact with barry to provide him with 
information and recommendations on the decisions which could not be 
turned over to her ms thompson said those include the signing 
and vetoing of legislation and signing contracts 
there will be no loss in the quality of existing programs and 
services provided by the government madelyn andrews spokeswoman 
for ms thompson said ms thompson will also underscore the 
strong commitment of the government to maintain stability and 
continuity 
several city council members including chairman david a 
clarke also stressed that governmental services will continue 
unhindered 
the leaders of the council met with the city administrator and 
the corporation counsel said clarke we pledged to the city 
administrator and she pledged to us cooperation 
another council member charlene drew jarvis said what we 
need to do now is to assure some stability and continuity in the 
government 
clarke mrs jarvis and councilman john ray are announced 
candidates for the democratic mayoral nomination 
a thompson aide who asked not to be identified said the city 
administrator was sensitive to the awkward moments barrys 
departure could create 
she does not see herself as acting mayor but more as a city 
administrator with a few extra duties said the aide for 
instance i would be very surprised if she moved from her office 
and started working behind the mayors desk 
one key department head corrections director walter ridley 
said barrys departure from the daily routine will make a lot of 
difference on a feeling level 
hes is going to be missed ridley told the washington post 
you cant lose a marion barry and not expect for there to be some 
trauma 
one of ms thompsons major tasks will be balancing the current 
budget and finalizing the budget for the upcoming fiscal year which 
must be submitted to the council in early february barry has 
estimated the shortfall for the current year at between 70 million 
and 80 million 
ms thompson likely will leave her imprint on the budgets the 
aide said 
she tends to be more conservative than barry said the 
aide she is not going to jump out and say were going to fund 
this program unless she first knows where the money is coming 
from 
aides said she also is scheduled to make a decisio soon on how 
to improve the citys ambulance service which has been plagued by 
reports of slow service and poor medical training for paramedics 
under the city charter ms thompson has all the powers of the 
mayor except the ability to sign or veto legislation and approve 
contracts 
barry has said he will remain in daily contact with her it was 
not known however how much his activities would be restricted if 
he enters a treatment program as expected 
another councilman john wilson who is running for council 
chairman said he was concerned that congress could use the 
opportunity to change the citys home rule powers or deny an 
extension of powers in the future 
one cabinet member suggested that many of the mayors appointees 
will now find themselves in limbo until barry decides what to do 
it will be carols challenge to motivate those people get 
them to do something productive instead of sitting around waiting 
for the other shoe to drop said the barry aide who asked not to 
be identified some of the more politically oriented offices 
ones that are there primarily to give the mayor good exposure on 
issues are going to have less to do for a while

the parents of an indianapolis teenager who 
died from complications of an illegal abortion said monday that 
their daughters case was a tragic consequence of a parental 
consent law 
our daughter was punished said bill bell father of becky 
bell who was 17 when she died sept 16 1988 she was denied a 
reasonable and safe choice because she loved her parents and died 
not wanting to disappoint them 
bill and his wife karen spoke to reporters at a prochoice 
gathering on the mall near the capitol where a temporary memorial 
was erected in tribute to girls and women who have died from 
illegal abortions 
indiana law requires a minor to obtain parental consent or have 
the provision waived by a court before she can have an abortion 
twentysix states have parental consent laws said eleanor smeal 
president of the fund for the feminist majority 
bell said that his daughter did not tell her parents she was 
pregnant and that her best friend told them after becky died that 
their daughter had told her she didnt want to disappoint her 
parents because she loved them 
at home the teenager became ill and when she began 
hemorrhaging her parents took her to a hospital where she died a 
short time later doctors told the bells that becky had had an 
illegal abortion 
the bells said that had their daughter told them she was 
pregnant they would have let her decide whether to have an 
abortion 
our daughters fate was decided by others parental consent

a lonesome moose that wandered south 
into the berkshires where there are no other moose has been smitten 
by a herd of dairy cows 
hes there every day said frank montague who has been 
running bridgmont farm while his son is on vacation 
the moose has been hanging around the farm since jan 10 he 
said and at one point even broke down a fence to get closer to the 
cows 
ralph taylor a state wildlife official said the moose should 
be out of rut by now but perhaps is being kept sexually active by 
the proximity of heifers in heat 
if they scare him away and keep him away from the cows for a 
couple of days it should be ok taylor said 
but montague said that is easier said than done 
they said to make a racket throw something at him 
whatever he said but theres not much you can really do

nebraskans are learning that some of the 
things commonly believed about china especially concerning its 
food are just not true thanks to 18 chinese students attending 
dana college 
for example they never heard of chinese fortune cookies until 
they arrived in america 
the graduate students attending danas english language 
institute also said they found it difficult to adjust to much of 
what passes for chinese cooking in this country because the 
vegetables are cooked too much 
but we are glad to be at dana we like it very much said 
liu ping 
sybille bartels program director of the colleges department of 
languages said its a delight when they invite us to a chinese 
dinner they cook its excellent especially their dumplings 
zhang xian 35 a high school teacher and mother from shanghai 
laughed at the informality of american college life 
in china you cant be as friendly with the school president 
she said here teachers sit on their desks and drink coffee 
people say excuse me to almost anything but teachers dont say 
excuse me when they sit on their table while teaching

country rock musician charlie daniels 
says he isnt the hidebound simplistic person whose views are 
presented in the song simple man 
but daniels has sympathy for him the songs lyrics advocate the 
lynching of anybody involved in drugs and call for a slow death for 
child abusers by leaving them for alligators and rattlesnakes 
when i say im a simple man its simple attitudes daniels 
said obviously im being facetious with the song i certainly 
dont think we should string anybody up from a tree or leave people 
out in the swamp 
during a recent interview at his ranch daniels expressed some 
of the same frustration voiced in the song 
this country is inundated with violent crime and were not 
dealing with it daniels said most things are a lot simpler 
than people want them to be if you got a fire you put it out

world chess champion garri kasparov on monday 
condemned the storming of his native city of baku by soviet troops 
saying too much force was used and it came too late to save the 
armenians 
kasparov who is of armenian and jewish descent and once wrote 
that his roots were in moslem capital of azerbaijan volunteered to 
mediate the ethnic dispute which he said could spread and lead to 
a bloodbath across the soviet union 
at a moscow news conference marked by an evenhandedness seldom 
seen in the twoyear armenianazerbaijani conflict kasparov said 
there were plenty of interior ministry troops and police in baku 
before saturdays attack yet they took no armed action against the 
roving squads who reportedly killed at least 67 armenians and 
ravaged 1200 apartments in a sixday campaign of terror 
instead of halting the murderers officials evacuated the 
armenians and kasparov contended virtually all had left by the 
time soviet troops attacked on saturday 
that is why i cannot accept the official explanation that 
the troops attacked baku to stop the ethnic violence he said 
kasparov said he thought the attack was meant to crush the 
proindependence movement in azerbaijan and warn similar groups in 
other republics 
i fear that what is now happening in azerbaijan may lead to a 
terrible bloodbath in the whole country said kasparov 26 he 
added that he fears angry azerbaijanis could turn on the 100000 
russian residents of baku expanding the ethnic conflict 
if clashes are provoked between russians and azerbaijanis and 
if there are victims or refugees among the russian population just 
think what might happen if they show up in moscow he said 
baku like many soviet cities is home to a variety of ethnic 
groups in his autobiography child of change kasparov wrote 
about his boyhood experiences in the azerbaijani capital my 
roots are in baku that knowledge gives me strength when i go off 
to conquer other worlds and gives me solace when i return 
kasparov spends most of his time now in moscow where he has a 
russian wife 
at least 167 people have been killed since the wave of violence 
began 10 days ago including 95 since soviet troops poured into the 
city saturday morning and were met by firebombs and machinegun 
fire azerbaijanis estimate the death toll is far higher and 
kasparov put it at 500 to 600 
kasparov who rescued 60 of his friends and relatives wednesday 
night said the government has shown it is either unwilling or 
unable to solve the armeniaazerbaijan dispute and called for 
individuals to begin direct negotiations between the neighboring 
republics he offered to act as a mediator 
he declined to lay blame exclusively on president mikhail s 
gorbachev during the news conference but in an interview with the 
spanish newspaper el pais he said the violence was cultivated by 
conservatives to undermine gorbachev and he blamed the soviet 
leader for not taking decisive action 
kasparov who became the youngest world chess champion in 
november 1985 and earlier this month became the highest rated 
player in history has spoken out frequently on domestic problems 
in the soviet union 
he said he used his own money to charter a plane virtually 
impossible in the soviet union with the help of the chess union 
he managed to get his refugees past azerbaijani mobs to the baku 
airport on a back road and 40 of them are staying with him in 
moscow 
in a telephone interview with the associated press kasparovs 
wife maria said the passengers included two of his mothers 
brothers other relatives several of his chess friends and eight 
to 10 strangers who happened to be at the baku airport 
azerbaijani friends helped his group escape kasparov said and 
he expressed sympathy for innocent azerbaijanis killed when the 
troops attacked 
kasparov also blamed the troops themselves for arming both the 
armenian and azerbaijani extremists 
tass reported that militants obtained helicopters tanks and 
even groundtoground missiles armenian activists carried one of 
their fallen leaders to his grave sunday in an armored personnel 
carrier 
my impression is the population of baku would have favored a 
radical and stronghanded curtailment of the repressions against 
the armenian population he said nonetheless the pogroms and 
repressions went on in full view and silent consent of the militia 
and interior troops 
kasparov also criticized authorities for ignoring the 
explosive problem of 160000 homeless and jobless azerbaijani 
refugees from armenia who have been waiting in baku for 
resettlement for as long as two years 
he specifically blamed the killings on the desperation of the 
refugees who terorized the armenian population of baku to grab 
their apartments when they fled a program to find them jobs and 
apartments failed in august 1988 he said 
you do not have to be a politician or a particularly 
farsighted person to see the political danger that lies in 
homeless people who have nothing to look forward to he said 
i lost two relatives in baku so i have serious reasons to cry 
and to shout he said but i dont think it will help i dont 
want to see another 100000 killed its suicide to continue 
no matter what happens the two republics will forever border 
one another no matter how long the war may last sooner or later 
they will have to start negotiations for peace he said 
he suggested that armenians abroad especially in the united 
states and france should work with moslem groups in saudi arabia 
and turkey which must naturally be interested in a peaceful 
solution to this conflict

a congresswoman says she hopes a meeting she 
set up today between the international longshoremens association 
and management would cool tempers in the threeday walkout that has 
disrupted the port of baltimore 
rep helen delich bentley rmd who has been acting as a 
mediator said the two sides would meet this afternoon in new york 
she said the meeting is not expected to end the strike but may 
create a better atmosphere that will help bring about a resolution 
later 
a union official says the governor may be to blame for the 
strike 
the walkout has already caused at least a dozen baltimorebound 
ships to use other ports during the weekend port officials said 
a management proposal to cut the jobs of about 150 clerks also 
known as checkers led to the strike 
national ila president john bowers canceled a contract vote 
scheduled for friday after local 953 president richard p hughes 
complained about the job cuts 
after management refused the terms bowers had set for resolution 
through arbitration bowers ordered dockworkers not to report for 
work beginning at midnight friday 
hughes has suggested that the threat of a state takeover of the 
terminals now run by private companies is what drove management to 
demand deep cuts in the clerical jobs filled by local 953s 430 
members 
hughes has submitted a sweeping request for notes documents or 
other records of all conversations or meetings gov william d 
schaefer may have had in the last two years concerning labor issues 
in the port 
we want to find out as much as we can under the freedom of 
information act hughes said we want to know who our friends 
are who are enemies we want to find out if the state acted in 
good faith 
the governors at fault for this entire situation said rich 
krueger jr a member of local 953 and a delegate to the baltimore 
district council an assembly of top international longshoremens 
association officials in baltimore 
schaefer prompted the work action by putting pressure on the 
steamship trade association the management negotiating group and 
threatening to put them out of business by taking over some or all 
of the port operations krueger said schaefer has said he is 
making such threats because the labor problems at the port are so 
disruptive 
maryland transportation secretary richard h trainor said the 
governor bears no responsibility for the stoppage the blame he 
said lies with local 953s leaders i dont know where else 
youre going to put it trainor said

a prefabricated company town that 
arrived on flatbed trucks 23 years ago is leaving the same way ray 
huseby says 
huseby bought the fire hall the community center and 22 houses 
in taconite harbor as an investment and plans to sell the 
buildings which cost 210 to 4000 as homes once he decides 
where to put them 
he moves houses like other people move cars said his 
daughter cindy lubich who is in on the deal 
the ghost town a relic from the booming 1950s that had become a 
headache for ltv steel mining co will be moved away house by 
house on husebys rig he has until july 1 to finish 
ltv steel inherited the town from erie mining co in 1987 and is 
happy to be rid of it after local laws stopped it from literally 
giving away the homes 
huseby and lubich plan to fix up and resell most of their 
holdings which have been appraised at 11000 to 15000 
taconites two other houses were sold to other bidders 
huseby says how much he invests in the 15ton buildings depends 
on how much money they will command whether he buys lots and 
builds foundations and where they end up 
toivo maki superintendent of operations at ltv steel said in 
in a large city such as minneapolisst paul the bungalows might 
fetch 60000 apiece 
dead towns are nothing new in hardpressed northeastern 
minnesota erected in 1957 by eire mining 50 miles south of canada 
on the shores of lake superior the town wasnt incorporated and 
never had its own mailing address or school 
taconite harbor was on the map but not on the census rolls 
it was never a town exactly said maki im not sure what 
it was 
a line of houses facing each other on a street squeezed between 
the highway and the lake the town was built to house the workers 
needed to run the docks that handled the taconite pellets bound for 
the steel mills it was a cog in the system that fed the nations 
appetite for automobiles from detroit 
for 400 down and 110 a month a couple could buy its first 
house from the company and start a family in a three or 
fourbedroom bungalow company docks and the nowdefunct power 
plant were a few hundred yards away 
later the auto and steel industries sagged and the demand for 
taconite a lowgrade iron ore plummeted today only a few 
workers are needed to work the dock the last family left taconite 
harbor about 19 months ago

health officials trying to block the 
heterosexual spread of aids should promote research on the use of 
diaphragms which could be as effective as condoms and are likely 
to be more widely used a researcher says 
zena stein an epidemiologist at columbia university in new 
york said sunday that diaphragms can prevent the spread of other 
sexually transmitted diseases and have important advantages over 
condoms which are now the most widely promoted means of preventing 
the spread of aids 
the use of diaphragms and antiviral creams or gels could and 
should be promoted among women stein said at the new yorkitaly 
medical symposium its not going to do everything but it will 
do something 
stein said studies of gonorrhea and family planning programs 
suggest that research on diaphragms as an aids preventive is 
warranted 
for example she said diaphragms and spermicides are as 
effective as condoms in preventing the spread of gonorrhea and 
might therefore be as effective in preventing the spread of the 
aids virus research is needed to settle that question 
we need a research program that tests these barriers we 
have she said the socalled barrier contraceptives include 
the diaphragm the contraceptive sponge and the pouch a female 
condom 
research should also be done to determine which spermicide best 
kills the aids virus and whether it should be provided as a cream 
foam or gel stein said we dont know what women want and what 
theyll use she said 
stein said that while condoms can prevent the spread of aids 
they are not used nearly as often as they should be most 
heterosexual transmission occurs from men to women she said and 
therefore it is women not men who have the incentive to use 
condoms 
women can offer them can urge the man to use them can 
persuade but its up to the man we know that thats often not 
acceptable stein said 
in practice condoms are not being widely used she said 
compliance is very far from 100 percent very far from where we 
want it

the forgotten victims of hurricane hugo are 
still struggling to survive in roofless trailers along gravel back 
roads in coastal williamsburg county or in modest cinderblock 
homes on the outskirts of tobacco towns 
life for hundreds some say thousands of south carolinas 
rural poor is not much better than the day after the killer 
hurricane struck 
the storm which crashed ashore last sept 21 at charleston 
claimed 29 lives and caused an estimated 59 billion damage when 
it cut a swath hundreds of miles wide through the state after 
hugo 24 of the states 46 counties were declared federal disaster 
areas 
while relief immediately flowed to coastal areas counties 
dozens of miles inland many of them rural and populated by poor 
blacks were ignored in some cases 
four months after the hurricane there are few offers of help 
even though workers and building supplies are still needed said 
edna hampton the hugo outreach coordinator for williamsburg county 
officials estimate as many as 4000 structures were destroyed or 
heavily damaged in that county one of the poorest in the state 
before the storm came some of the homes were half liveable 
she said now theyre not liveable people are a little bit 
discouraged we feel forgotten in a sense 
she has been trying to locate people who may not have applied 
for disaster assistance yet illiteracy lack of communication and 
transportation and suspicion of government have kept many rural 
residents from seeking aid she said 
in her small cinderblock house on the outskirts of kingstree 
audrey epps fights back tears as she remembers how the storm 
smashed the windows and tore the roof off her home ms epps and 
her 78yearold invalid mother zeal had to seek shelter in the 
only room of the fiveroom house that didnt leak she lost 
clothing and other personal effects 
ms epps lost her job because the pharmaceutical company where 
she worked third shift was shut down by storm damage she cant 
find another thirdshift job and cant afford to pay someone to 
look after her mother during the day when she worked nights a 
relative stayed with her mother 
the only thing i can do is stay here and take care of her 
ms epps said 
nor does she have the funds to adequately repair and refurnish 
her home she received 2750 from the federal emergency management 
agency but supplies to fix the roof alone came to 1800 the 
ceilings and walls are waterlogged and still need repair plastic 
sheeting covers broken windows keeping in heat from a woodburning 
stove 
i didnt want a beautiful home i only wanted a house i could 
live in ms epps said recently 
i thought once i would snap i still think i might ms epps 
said sobbing 
a few miles south down a gravel road near the community of 
lane george bradshaw and his two mentally handicapped sons live in 
a trailer roofed by a plastic tarp without electricity drawing 
water from a pump up the road 
weve been here ever since the storm said bradshaw who is 
retired 
bradshaws insurance company settled by paying off the mortgage 
on the trailer leaving the family with only a few hundred dollars 
not enough to make repairs 
a handful of outofstate volunteers are at work in the county 
such as john nienhuis who arrived with a group from the christian 
reformed church of grand rapids mich 
he said workers many times are trying to repair homes that 
really should be leveled and rebuilt from scratch were putting 
so many good hours into jobs and when theyre done theyre homes 
not worth 5 cents he said 
recovery from the storm wont be measured by how well the 
states beaches are restored or how many tourists return but by 
how all of the states people recover says jt mclawhorn jr 
president of the columbia urban league 
we individually and collectively are going to be held 
responsible for this recovery he said

the israelibacked south lebanon army militia praised the 
militiamen and israeli troops for stopping the killers who tried 
to attack our citizens from the other side of the border

a leading advocate for the homeless said 
monday that he will urge those who live on the streets not to 
cooperate with an upcoming census 
you cant count all the people in the streets said mitch 
snyder of washingtons community for creative nonviolence 
experience quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as 
such is to risk harassment and abuse 
david hayden of the justice house community a shelter in 
roanoke va said he too would decline to cooperate 
the key to survival for homeless people is invisibility 
hayden said if you are a homeless woman with children you deny 
being homeless because you dont want to lose the children 
peter a bounpane assistant census director said he hoped the 
agency could persuade snyder and other homeless advocates to change 
their minds 
major federal programs are targeted and funds distributed based 
on census figures 
snyder contends that both the reagan and bush administrations 
have sought to minimize the problem of homelessness and that 
because many homeless would be missed the census results will lead 
to less money and attention for the needy 
if we were dealing with an honest government and an honest 
administration we would cooperate snyder said 
homelessness has received increasing attention in recent years 
but no accurate figures of the number of people affected are 
available 
the national alliance to end homelessness a private research 
and assistance group estimates that as many as 2 million people 
are homeless for at least a portion of the year and that the number 
has been growing the partnership for the homeless in new york 
issued a similar estimate after a national survey of 46 cities 
however a 1984 study by the department of housing and urban 
development estimated the number of homeless at 250000 to 350000 
a harvard study put the total at 350000 in 1986 and an urban 
institute report in 1988 estimated the total at about 600000 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has estimated the total at 3 
million 
the census bureau plans a special count of the homeless march 
20 about 10 days before the survey of the rest of the nation 
census takers across the country will spend the night visiting 
shelters flophouses hospitals missions and counting people on 
the streets 
advocates for the homeless as well as the homeless themselves 
are being recruited to participate 
snyder burned census envelopes that had been used to send him 
materials concerning the effort he said however that other 
groups are cooperating and that opinion is divided in the national 
coalition for the homeless 
some cities have made special efforts to get their homeless 
counted new york for example compiled an extensive list of 
places where homeless people spend their nights to guide the census 
takers

mayor marion barry facing a misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charge left the nations capital today to check 
into a residential treatment facility in florida a city official 
said 
at this point the mayor is not considering resignation city 
administrator carol thompson told a news conference there will 
be no management vacuum in the mayors absence 
barry who has turned over the daily control of the local 
government to ms thompson did not speak to reporters before 
leaving his home 
the mayor has left the city he has left for treatment 
said ms thompson 
she said it was not appropriate for her to disclose details 
of the mayors treatment she said barry would be doing that 
however a top politial aide to the mayor said barry left for 
the hanleyhazelden treatment center in west palm beach fla 
clinic spokeswoman patricia mcrae said confidentiality rules forbid 
the clinic from revealing the names of patients 
meanwhile naacp executive director benjamin hooks questioned 
whether barrys arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of 
elected black officials and the rising tide of racism in this 
nation 
im not trying to justify any wrongdoing or condone use of 
cocaine but i am opposed to selective enforcement of the law 
the civil rights leader told reporters after meeting with president 
bush about recent racial bombings in the south 
barry his political career in shambles following his drug 
arrest said in an emotional 15minute speech sunday he will take 
steps to heal my body mind and soul 
barry offered no clue during his speech as to what kind of 
assistance he is seeking except to say that social activist and 
selfdescribed nutrition expert dick gregory was helping him 
explore his options 
the washington post today quoted unnamed sources as saying that 
while barry had initially decided to seek treatment at the betty 
ford clinic in rancho mirage calif he was leaning toward an 
alternative program with gregory 
the post also said some of barrys longtime political allies are 
beginning behindthescenes moves to shift their allegiance to 
jesse jackson rather than lose their own influence in city 
government if barrys political career is over 
the washington times meanwhile said an agreement was reached 
friday for barry to throw his support to jackson in this falls 
mayoral election 
you are going to see politicians preachers businessmen come 
out in public in the next few days if not weeks calling for 
jackson to get off the fence for the good of this city the times 
quoted an unidentified source as saying 
a jackson spokesman eric easter told the newspaper however 
that kind of discussion is inappropriate at this time his 
jacksons concern right now is very personal for the mayor his 
family and the city our focus continues to be statehood for the 
city 
barry said sunday that the events of the past several days had 
been more difficult than fighting my way out of poverty or 
struggling in the civil rights movement because i spent so much 
time doing for others that i have not worried enough about 
caring for myself 
us attorney jay b stephens has hinted in interviews that he 
might look favorably on a resignation by barry when deciding 
whether to pursue other phases in an ongoing probe of the mayors 
activities 
after refusing to comment directly on whether barrys 
resignation would lead to a dismissal of the misdemeanor charge 
against the mayor stephens said im very sensitive to the 
concerns of this community to the people in this community and the 
need to have an effective government in place 
there are a broad range of considerations as united states 
attorney that i would consider beyond the simple issue of holding 
mr barry accountable for his criminal conduct stephens said 
however the prosecutor said on nbcs today show this 
morning in a system that requires fairness i think it is 
appropriate that we go forward with the charge that has been lodged 
here 
while barry did not say in his sunday speech that he is 
suffering from drug or alcohol abuse others indicated he was 
herbert o reid sr one of the mayors closest personal 
advisers said he hoped that from barrys travails we can all 
learn something about drug addiction 
the most serious problem is alcoholism barry spokeswoman 
lurma rackley said the mayor has acknowledged that he has a 
health concern and the details are his private matter 
the mayors wife effi said in remarks that followed her 
husbands for you to admit that you have a problem that you 
need to make yourself whole again is truly a burden lifted from our 
souls for our family it is just the beginning 
barry surrounded by clergy in a broadcast appearance in st 
timothys episcopal church near his home clasped his wifes hand 
and said he has come face to face with my deepest human 
failures 
barry said these ministers have helped me to keep the 
strength i need im going to find a way to heal my body mind 
and soul

reforms by the south african government 
and upheaval in eastern europe have caught the exiled african 
national congress groping for new strategies to wage a political 
rather than military struggle 
the anc the main guerrilla movement fighting white rule in 
south africa recently held a policy review conference in lusaka 
but announced no new proposals to counter reforms by president fw 
de klerk that have eased pressure on his government 
the anc continues to focus on hardline strategies such as its 
largely ineffectual bombing campaign and efforts to increase 
sanctions against south africa but these policies are generating 
little enthusiasm at a time when de klerk has been advocating 
negotiations with blacks and raising the possibility that he might 
lift the 30year ban on the anc 
looking at our situation realistically we must admit that we 
do not have the capacity within our country to intensify the 
armed struggle in any meaningful way said anc 
secretarygeneral alfred nzo 
he urged the guerrilla group not to trail behind events with 
our feet shackled by old perceptions and a fear to confront a new 
reality 
the ancs support among millions of black south africans is 
probably as strong as its been in its 78year history including 
the last three decades in exile most observers believe the anc 
would win elections if south africas 28 million blacks were 
allowed to vote 
the group also has good relations with most leading powers in 
the east and west and solid backing from black african states 
however the anc must readjust to changes in eastern europe and 
the soviet union traditionally their biggest backers and main 
weapons suppliers but now moving away from active involvement in 
faraway conflicts 
south african academic philip nel a soviet expert said 
officials in moscow have conveyed to the anc the soviets would 
maintain support for the movement only on condition that the anc 
commit itself clearly to a political program which could lead to a 
negotiated stabilization in south africa 
the anc conference highlighted generational and tactical 
differences among its members and uncertainty about how to approach 
potential negotiations after so many years of rejecting all 
proposals by the government 
many senior anc leaders are in their 60s and 70s and its 
president oliver tambo 71 is recovering from a stroke members 
of the older generation are reserved in demeanor wear suits at 
public events stress the importance of dialogue and stress that 
the armed struggle came about only as a last resort after the anc 
was outlawed in 1960 
most of the 1000 rankandfile members at the conference were 
in their 20s 30s and early 40s and belong to a generation of 
young lions whose political education came during times of 
frequent street clashes between activists and police in south 
africa 
they wear jeans and tshirts with antiapartheid slogans give 
clenchedfist salutes and are quick to burst into militant freedom 
songs 
steve tshwete a highranking anc member in his 40s said we 
must continue to intensify the struggle we are fighting for 
liberation it is a war thats going on its not a game of 
cricket 
but in south africa the battle is being fought less with bombs 
and more along traditional political lines 
sisulu and five other anc leaders freed last year after more 
than 25 years in prison campaign freely on behalf of the 
organization in south africa although it remains outlawed 
the south african government says it is reviewing the status of 
banned organizations including the anc which authorities 
previously depicted as a communistled terrorist group 
de klerk also has eased the governments longstanding 
requirement that the anc renounce violence before it can 
participate in negotiations he now says the group need only commit 
itself to peaceful solutions 
the anc is demanding de klerk legalize the movement and 
institute other reforms before they enter negotiations but they 
have been caught offguard by several of de klerks announcements 
sometimes taking days to respond 
the anc says it has no plans to announce major policy or 
leadership changes until another conference in june 
by that time nelson mandela the ancs best known leader is 
widely expected to be out of prison mandela along with sisulu and 
other recently freed colleagues should give the organization a 
highprofile authoritative voice inside the country 
the government considers the older anc leaders more moderate and 
would prefer to negotiate with them rather than the young lions 
should the two sides end up at the same conference table there 
appears to be little chance of a quick breakthrough 
the anc seeks a oneperson onevote democracy which de klerk 
opposes saying it will lead to black domination of the nations 5 
million whites he envisions powersharing with blacks but with 
whites having some sort of veto power on major policy issues

democratic gov rose moffords decision not to 
run for office this fall announced after weeks of conflicting 
signals has thrown arizona politics and government for a loop 
mrs mofford said she had no idea who might run in her place 
and would not say who she favored 
but with four republicans including impeached gov evan mecham 
already in the race and control of the statehouse during a 
redistricting year at stake the names of a halfdozen democrats 
were being mentioned as possible candidates before mrs mofford had 
finished speaking thursday 
mrs mofford who is recovering from gallbladder surgery said 
health was not a factor in her decision and that she intended to be 
a fulltime governor for the remainder of the term to which she 
was elevated in 1988 from secretary of state when mecham was 
ousted 
lawmakers and lobbyists said it wasnt clear if mrs moffords 
agenda would suffer because she was now a lame duck or would 
prosper because the republicancontrolled legislature no longer 
would worry that adopting her program might help her campaign 
house speaker jane hull a republican said she thought mrs 
moffords announcement would allow her to hold the politicking 
down during this years legislative session 
but republican lobbyist michael smith said that while mrs 
moffords decision could help her with her program it also could 
mean that now no one has to listen to her because she is a lame 
duck 
democratic rep peter goudinoff a political science teacher 
took a completely different tack saying mrs moffords status 
could make her stronger politically by allowing her to veto bills 
without worrying about the political consequences 
the electoral front was equally confused 
mrs mofford and her aides had sent several signals that she 
would including massive fundraising and a state of the state 
message that could have doubled as a campaign platform 
thursdays announcement caught potential democratic candidates 
off guard and three of the likeliest phoenix mayor terry 
goddard former state education czar carolyn warner and chief 
justice frank gordon jr of the arizona supreme court said it 
would take time to test the waters goddard and gordon would have 
to give up their current posts in order to run for governor 
goddard son of state democratic party chairman and former gov 
sam goddard said he was taking a hard look at running but that 
it might take him three weeks to decide 
gordon said friday that he did not know how much time it would 
take him to make a decision 
mrs warner an ally of organized labor and the partys 
candidate in the 1986 election that mecham won said she was 
consulting friends and associates and hoped to have a decision 
within days or weeks 
goddard gets along well with the republican establishment is 
popular statewide and can raise money quickly if he is perceived as 
the likely winner said democrat alan stephens the senates 
minority leader 
gordon presided over the senate trial that resulted in mechams 
ouster as governor 
others mentioned as potential democratic candidates include 
tempe mayor harry mitchell grocery magnate eddie basha and former 
congressman and mecham aide sam steiger 
republican candidates said they believed mrs moffords 
departure and the likelihood of a democratic primary fight would 
alter the whole dynamics of the election and could bring more 
candidates into the gop race as well 
mrs moffords decision creates a level playing field said 
developer j fife symington a gop establishment candidate its 
always difficult to run against an incumbent 
mrs mofford was criticized for lacking leadership and for a 
handsoff approach to government but she fared well in popularity 
polls until recently 
i believe that if she had chosen to run in 1990 she would have 
been a formidable candidate symington said 
mecham agreed i dont believe the democrats will be able to 
field anybody that will be more difficult to beat than her 
in addition to symington and mecham those who have announced 
for the gop nomination are former maricopa county supervisor fred 
koory and maverick school teacher bob barnes 
attorney general bob corbin another republican also has been 
approached about running but has not announced his plans and said 
that he expected to hold off until the end of the month 
mrs mofford said she would support whoever wins the democratic 
primary and that the roughly 375000 that she has collected in 
campaign funds will be returned to contributors where possible

n iranian tv reported soviet troops 
stationed along irans border with strifetorn soviet azerbaijan on 
monday barred people from crossing into iran tass however said 
crossings were continuing 
the tehran broadcast monitored in cyprus said the guards also 
carefully screened anyone wishing to enter from iran and allowed 
through only soviet azerbaijanis returning home 
in moscow the official news agency tass said the situation 
remains complicated on the state border azerbaijanis and iranians 
continue to cross the border en masse in both directions 
thousands of soviet azerbaijanis who are bound by a common 
language culture and religion with their iranian kin had poured 
across the 400mile border into iran following the outbreak of 
violence in their home republic jan 13 
the television reported that 20000 soviet moslems had fled to 
iran since thursday and that arrangements were being made to house 
them 
turkey which has a large ethnic azerbaijani minority on monday 
said it wanted an end to the bloodletting in azerbaijan and has 
asked moscow to allow a medical team to enter the republic to help 
the wounded 
thousands of azerbaijani turks rallied in the eastern town of 
aralik near the point where the iranian turkish and soviet 
borders converge 
official soviet reports have said more than 160 people have died 
since ethnic violence erupted earlier this month between the 
republics predominantly moslem azerbaijanis and christian 
armenians living there 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev blames moslem fanatics for 
the violence the soviets have long feared that irans 
revolutionary zealots who seized power in 1979 would seek to 
inflame the 70 million moslems who live in the soviet unions 
southern republics 
soviet media accused iran of supplying arms to the moslems in 
azerbaijan but iranian media denied the allegation 
nationalists in soviet azerbaijan have been agitating for the 
establishment of a greater azerbaijan an independent oilrich 
homeland for 20 million azerbaijanis on both sides of the border 
the top moslem religious leader of soviet azerbaijan in an 
interview published monday predicted grave repercussions from the 
soviet military intervention 
this mistaken decision will have dire consequences 
sheikhulislam allahshukur pashazade was quoted as saying the 
kuwaiti daily alanbaa said it conducted the interview by telephone 
from moscow 
iranian leaders fearful that any forceful crushing of the 
rebellion in azerbaijan would escalate the crisis and endanger its 
own stability have cautioned moscow to use peaceful means to stem 
the fighting 
the iranian foreign ministry sunday called on the soviet union 
to halt violent clashes with moslems in its caucasus republics 
and warned that the widening crackdown on the nationalists could 
jeopordize moscows reformist policies 
in mondays interview pashazadeh also said gorbachev was 
giving false information about the situation in azerbaijan 
this prompted him to take a precipitous and costly decision as 
the soviet troops did when they occupied afghanistan and when they 
intervened in czechoslovakia in 1968 he added 
but he went on the imposition of a state of emergency and 
the intervention of troops have exacerbated the situation 
i say it frankly i am unable to control the sentiments of 
angry people outraged over the shedding of blood in bakus 
streets

meeting with calfa i come prepared to discuss all matters 
and controversies to bring a new quality to our relations 
he said he hoped for good and close relations between the two 
sovereign nations of poland and czechoslovakia 
i am convinced that such good cooperation could have an 
essential effect for the launching of the new europe at a time when 
centraleastern europe is undergoing such great changes he said 
popular citizens movements in both poland and czechoslovakia 
succeeded in 1989 in breaking the monopoly of power held for four 
decades by the communists mazowiecki a longtime solidarity 
activist became eastern europes first noncommunist government 
leader in august 
calfa a reform communist who assumed the premiership in 
december resigned from the party this month czechoslovakia has 
scheduled fully democratic elections for june

state that supported the democratization process in czechoslovakia 
and openly expressed it calfa said 
the visit comes amid intense diplomatic activity between warsaw 
and prague czechoslovak foreign minister jiri dienstbier visited 
poland jan 1011 and havel is due to visit polish president 
wojciech jaruzelski on thursday 
on mazowiekas agenda monday were talks on easing border 
restrictions for poles visiting czechoslovakia increased 
cooperation to reduce air and water pollution along their border 
closer cultural ties and rights for the polish minority in 
czechoslovakia 
there have been recent suggestions of reviving a 50yearold 
proposal to create a polishczechoslovak federation positioned 
between germany and the soviet union that would be strong enough 
not to be dominated by either 
the proposal voiced last month by former us national security 
adviser zbigniew brzezinski was met with interest by poles 
concerned about a reunified germany the response from czechoslovak 
officials however has been tepid calfa told a polish newspaper 
last week that czechoslovakia may want closer cooperation 
but now we are not ready due to economic reasons to establish any 
formal unions or confederations 
mazowieckis day in czechoslovakia began with a trip to the 
grave of student jan palach who immolated himself 21 years ago to 
protest the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that restored hardline 
communist rule 
it was the first time a government leader had gone to the grave 
during a state visit 
it is not an accident that i begin my trip at the grave of jan 
palach mazowiecki said at the small village cemetery in vsetaty 
about 15 miles north of prague 
his sacrifice has remained in our minds all these years this 
tragic sacrifice this is why when things are better now we 
should return our thoughts to those who could not see these days 
 
this is why when i come to a free and democratic 
czechoslovakia i start in this place 
side by side mazowiecki and calfa bowed their heads and lighted 
candles as a small crowd watched in the birchshaded graveyard 
nestled on a hillside looking out over rolling farmland

president roh taewoo said monday his 
governing party and two moderate opposition groups will create a 
new party a serious setback for the nations most radical leaders 
we agreed to establish a new political order based on 
political stability and create a new popular party of moderate 
democratic forces to meet the needs of the times roh said in a 
televised address after a 10hour meeting with opposition leaders 
kim youngsam and kim jongpil 
the alignment boosted the chances of kim youngsam coming to 
power after roh steps down in feburary 1993 at the end of a single 
fiveyear term 
the two were bitter rivals in the presidential elections in 
december 1987 and kim youngsam accused roh of vote fraud 
the new party will be assured of a twothirds majority in the 
299member national assembly it also will dwarf the largest 
opposition group party for peace and democracy and limit its 
chances of coming to power 
the partys charismatic leader kim daejung denounced the 
alliance as a power grab and radical students called it an attempt 
to prolong what they view as a prous military dictatorship 
students battled riot police with firebombs and rocks at five 
universities in seoul and two other cities and police arrested 
hundreds of demonstrators 
roh said the new party tentatively named the democratic liberal 
party will be inaugurated within six months until then roh said 
he and kim youngsam and kim jongpil will lead a working committee 
he said korea needed a new political order to overcome an 
economic crisis and effectively solve pending problems facing the 
nation 
it will be the first time in koreas history that a new 
political party is formed by ruling and opposition parties 
kim younsam said the three leaders talked about changing the 
countrys current presidential government system to a cabinet 
structure 
roh and kim did not elaborate however apparently in order to 
avoid friction with kim daejung 
kim daejung called the new party a a political coup detat 
aimed at holding onto power he said new elections should be held 
as a referendum on the issue 
governing party officials rejected the criticism saying the 
opposition leader had been asked to form an alliance 
party officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
new party will adopt a collective leadership with roh serving as a 
ceremonial head and kim youngsam likely to be selected chairman 
kim jongpil who once served as prime minister under the 
assassinated autocratic president park chunghee called the 
change revolutionary and said he hoped other political 
heavyweights would join the alliance 
roh defeated the three kims by a narrow margin in the 1987 
presidential election the first democratic balloting in 16 years 
many koreans blamed kim youngsam and kim daejung for losing the 
presidential election by splitting the opposition vote

haute couture was a midsummer nights dream at 
mondays shows very short often flirty styles for summer never 
looked more expensive and yet featherylight 
the clothes costing many thousands of dollars per outfit are 
mainly for show only about 2000 women regularly buy couture 
which is meant to power the houses other activities from 
accessories to perfumes 
diors show by gianfranco ferre was a suite of expensive clothes 
that ended up with mounds of gold ochre and saffron iridescent 
taffetas satin and sparkling sequins on lace 
the italian designer hired last year by financier bernard 
arnault to bring the celebrated couture house out of the doldrums 
reworked some of his strong themes these included huge organza 
bows and bold silkflower corsage effects the clothes were pretty 
but whether their impact will make dior top moneyearning couture 
house in the world is still debatable 
ferres mood was romantic but lowkey the day clothes worn with 
amusing highcrowned smokestack or boater hats turned up in black 
and white or shades of silvery gray in fitted pinstriped suits with 
deep decolletes insets and tuckedin swaths of white organza a 
ferre signature touch 
he is still using organza prodigiously and has already been 
copied all over the place in the cloudlike puffy blouses and 
enormous bows at waist or neck 
lots of trousers here should please highstyled dressers who can 
actually afford a couture outfit impeccable cuffed gray charcoal 
lean pants topped by a fabulous white organza jacket and strapless 
bustier would look at home anywhere from palm beach to paris 
the wickerchair sparkly embroidery on white jackets over simple 
black skirts are also great choices for the moneyed set 
except for violet lilac a flash of red and all that gold 
ferre hardly varied his color palette but the cuts were right on 
target especially when he draped a sexy sheath with a gold 
satinlined long stole 
erik mortensen at balmain proved once again that hes a great 
couturier he produced a teaser of a sexy collection that offered 
plenty of choice besides bare skin in skirts slashed to the hip or 
mere slips of handkerchief chiffons adorning nearly nude bodies 
his day clothes were striking in belted ivory white suits with 
sleeveless jackets in contrasting coral saffron or green soft wool 
the clothes looked both contemporary and clever some of the 
false cutaway suits turning into short shifts in back other 
daytime ideas included split paneled skirts crepe chiffons with 
giant polka dots under enormous halo circle hats 
but from silky biascut paneled dresses to jeweled chiffons and 
strapless dresses topped with clouds of gazar as stoles mortensen 
won on all fronts day to evening in a beautifully edited show that 
was exciting from start to finish 
cardin still knows how to cut and give a fillip to modern 
styles but the impact was watered down by too much of a good 
thing among the memorable newer looks were his billowyskirted and 
eggshaped dressy short models in the softest pastel hues lots of 
violet aqua and linden or sea green 
many of the pretty new outfits were presented by two of his 
favorite new mannequins brought in from the soviet union where he 
has been manufacturing for two years to pep up the fashion scene 
all of cardins favorite ideas were present and sparkling huge 
collars enormous flower effects the dress becomes a flower 
zigzag diagonal or swirly asymmetrical coat fastenings 
batwingsleeve shifts galore 
an intriguing new suit here was cut with step effects on the 
sharply geometrical jackets 
cardin used big floppy bows in profusion draping a whole dress 
from a bow at the neck or ending up a hemline with a bow with 
lots of navy and white or a raft of pretty pastels the palette in 
luxury fabrics was extended to please anyone 
he brought out circular hoop stiffening and chineselantern 
effects in skirts and sleeves a rather extravagant way to use some 
of these lovely flowered fabarics 
jeanlouis scherrer took another of his exotic trips to india a 
favorite theme he uses over and over again the outfits fit for a 
maharanee included some sensational draped dresses with iridescent 
saristyle scarves lots of mirror sequins the lightest of silvery 
paisley patterns on silks 
tulipdraped skirts were beautifully done as were some allover 
pleated and tucked blouses and dresses that were a tour de force 
scherrer kept to the softest palette possible in creams khakis 
light golds sand tones with echoes of pink but he sometimes opted 
for interesting mixes of hot cyclamen and ochre shocking pink and 
indian rose in his silk crepes chiffons and taffetas 
while several of his trouser suits were topped with 
nehrucollared lean jackets others were lean midcalf styles with 
tunic or jacket toppers 
nobody could miss scherrers incredible gray and gold 
cobrapatterned silk taffeta pants suits with an ample jacket 
tightly belted at the waist

the provisional government that 
replaced the toppled dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu may field 
candidates in the april elections a government spokesman said 
monday 
a decision to take part in the elections would be a reversal of 
the governments earlier insistence that it was only a caretaker 
coalition formed to escort romania to democracy after ceausescus 
24 years of harsh rule 
aurel dragos munteanu state radio and television chief said no 
final decision has been made on whether the governing national 
salvation front will field candidates 
the country as a whole feels the national salvation front 
should turn into a movement independent from other political 
parties and nominate its candidates for the forthcoming 
elections munteanu told a news conference according to the 
state news agency rompres 
he sought to qualify earlier comments by interim president ion 
iliescu who had seemed to indicate the government definitely would 
participate in elections 
mr iliescu said we dont know yet we might go that way or 
that way it was not a commitment by mr iliescu said 
munteanu referring to the comments by the acting president in a 
meeting with students sunday 
the national salvation front a group about 150 members gained 
popular support amid the postrevolutionary chaos by disavowing 
electoral ambitions and representing itself as purely an interim 
force until parliamentary elections could be held 
they are tentatively scheduled for april although some 
opposition groups not participating in the interim government have 
said they need more time to mount effective campaigns 
the national salvation front is made up of dissidents military 
leaders intellectuals technocrats and disgruntled communists it 
is led by an 11man council headed by iliescu a former communist 
party secretary who ran afoul of ceausescu in 1971 and was 
ultimately demoted to the job of editor of a technical publishing 
house 
munteanu noted that the leaders said after ceausescu was 
overthrown dec 22 that they did not consider the national 
salvation front to be a political party but then he told the news 
conference that it is a feeling in the country by many people 
that is calling for the front in one way or another to take 
part 
asked a question about romanias economy munteanu noted that 
the fronts governing council may still be running the country 
after elections he did not elaborate 
the national salvation front which has taken enormous powers 
into its own hands governs this nation of 23 million people by 
decree 
acting as an ad hoc legislature the front has repealed the 
regimes most hated laws opened borders for romanians appointed 
ministers and taken over the media 
iliescu and his defense minister gen nicolae militaru command 
the 180000 army troops whose switch of sides turned decembers 
street demonstrations into a successful revolution 
iliescu fired all ceausescu ministers but retained midlevel 
administrators 
critics of the government have complained that some of its 
members were too closely associated with ceausescus government and 
may have plans to continue some form of communist rule 
commenting on romanias future economy munteanu said he favored 
privatization to some extent but added it would be difficult to 
have an economy as privatized as in western countries 
munteaunu also said the first trials of ceausescu aides probably 
would begin next week adding the defendants would include former 
communist party secretary emil bobu third in the ceausescu 
hierarchy after the dictator and his wife elena and former 
interior minister tudor postelnicu who supervised ceausescus 
dreaded special police 
also likely to be tried next week are former premier manea 
manescu and ion dinca a former highranking politburo member 
prosecutorgeneral gheorghe robu said the four have been 
indicted on charges of genocide for their role in violently 
suppressing demonstrations during the december revolution rompres 
reported 
ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad dec 25

more than 3000 high school students 
demonstrated monday for a broader education than the narrow 
curriculum enforced by the regime of deposed dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
the demonstration was also aimed at the abolition of special 
exams at the end of the second year of high school which students 
must pass in their major field of study or face expulsion 
if elena ceausescu can fall down our exam must fall down 
too the students chanted as they marched from the ministry of 
education to the provisional government headquarters 
student leaders said they had given the provisional government 
one month from dec 22 when the ceausescus were forced to flee the 
city to do away with the special exam ceausescu reportedly 
intended to drop the exam this year 
until now they have told us nothing thats why were here 
said rodica guja 16 
we want to study the real history because the history they 
taught us before was a wrong history she said we want to 
obtain culture and we want more subjects we want to study the 
history of art science foreign languages 
there was a sense of exhiliaration as the students wound their 
way along the icy streets of old bucharest behind a romanian flag 
with the communist emblem torn out 
the police just look at us before if we did something like 
this we would be arrested and beaten miss guja said 
the students from about 15 schools walked out of classes monday 
romania has specialized high schools in industrial fields and 
academic subjects such as mathematics and physics language and 
history chemistry and biology 
rosu costin who is studying math and physics said the exams 
were so difficult that students needed private tutoring to pass 
this isnt fair because poor students dont have money to pay 
professors at home said costih 16 adding that the 4450 
needed for a year of tutoring was enough to buy a small car 
engineering student bogdan popescu said he was demonstrating 
because the exam meant students learned only two subjects and 
didnt have a general culture 
ozana ninosu studying at the german high school said i 
dont learn anything in school just a little german 
she said she wanted to study art music and learn the true 
history of her country and the rest of the world 
all the students complained that they had to wear gloves and 
coats in their classrooms because the schools were so cold 
costin said many youngsters were unable to attend sports classes 
because they didnt have enough to eat and had no energy 
at the former foreign ministry building now headquarters of the 
national salvation front provisional government a delegation of 
students was chosen to meet education minister mihai sora 
zosim basir a member of the front told the students that 
romanias economic plight had top priority

fatal choking hazard to young children the government said

a legislator has introduced a bill that would 
allow police to seize and sell vehicles of people engaged in 
prostitution in an effort to bring more pressure on johns 
we believe the crucial point of attack on this issue is the 
john the guy whos waiting in the car looking for a prostitute 
said the legislator rep peter bock 
we want to embarrass that guy and make things harder for 
him he said 
bock said he decided to act after residents had complained of 
finding condoms and needles in their yards he drove through one 
neighborhood in his milwaukee district and found women soliciting 
men on street corners 
at that point i realized there was a problem said bock 41 
who was propositioned before dusk on that evening last summer 
bocks bill would enable police to seize and sell the vehicles 
of people convicted of engaging in prostitution if the vehicle is 
used in the act besides reducing prostitution the bill would help 
prevent the spread of aids 
milwaukees west end community association a community group 
has long urged stiffer penalties for crimes involving prostitution 
especially punishment that focuses on the customer 
unless the fines and penalties are stiffer how can we expect 
to stop this problem said lora gooden director of the 
nonprofit group who said prostitutes have no problem finding 
business in this city 
they customers have been slapped on the hand with these 
mediocre fines and they can get home before anyone knows they were 
arrested she said 
the solution is in targeting the customer not the prostitute 
proponents of the bill say 
as long as the demand is out there those women will be out 
there ms gooden said if the prostitutes get fined theyll 
just be out there working harder to pay it we have to take away 
the demand 
under the proposed law a car that has been confiscated can not 
be sold until a person had been found guilty of having performed a 
sexual act in the car bock said a resolution to the bill will 
urge newspapers to print the names of people found guilty of 
engaging in prostitution 
its a common thing for these men to drive by pick up a 
prostitute drive around the corner have sex and then drop her 
off ms gooden said a lot of the activity has been going on 
in the cars 
ms gooden said she doesnt believe the bill will stop 
prostitution but it would cause them the johns to have to 
explain why their cars arent there 
a similar bill in portland ore drew criticism from the oregon 
american civil liberties union 
the seizure takes place at the sole discretion of the police 
officer said stevie remington executive director of the oregon 
aclu thats a violation of due process 
portland police department spokesman david simpson said the 
department has seized six vehicles since the bill became law in 
december and hasnt had any problems 
public nuisance laws in wisconsin allow the court to seize and 
sell any personal property involved with prostitution creating the 
possibility an entire family could be left homeless if one person 
engaged in sex for pay said eunice edgar executive director of 
the wisconsin aclu 
obviously we see some problems with that ms edgar said 
im not sure how the seizure of vehicles would apply i think 
theres a doublewhammy for women who are married to philanderers 
first theyre subjected to humiliation and then they lose the 
family car and cant go to work she said 
ms edgar said the wisconsin aclu lawyers would review the bill

drug lords released the kidnapped son of 
a presidential adviser monday apparently in another bid to 
persuade the government to end its 5monthold war on cocaine 
trafficking 
alvaro diego montoya had been abducted at gunpoint from his 
office dec 20 in bogota he is the son of german montoya 
president virgilio barcos general secretary 
a statement issued by his family said montoya was freed on a 
bogota street early monday 
montoya was the fifth person released by the drug traffickers 
since thursday another 16 including prominent businessmen or 
their relatives still were being held apparently for use in 
bargaining to get the government to negotiate a truce in the 
nations bloody drug war 
a newspaper reported monday that only some of the nations 
traffickers are willing to negotiate 
a communique issued last week with the release of two kidnap 
victims said the drug lords would dismantle their cocainesmuggling 
empire and release all hostages in exchange for amnesty 
interior minister carlos lemos simmonds said that under no 
circumstances would the government negotiate with the traffickers 
and that they must surrender and face the judicial system 
however the government since has said it is waiting for 
clarification on what the drug lords want and barco has made 
seemingly conflicting statements on his position 
he has said on the one hand that his hardline position of 
fighting the traffickers has not changed but also that the 
government will not be inflexible in looking for a way to end the 
war 
in a letter published in the bogota daily el tiempo on saturday 
he said it would be simplistic to believe that the only two 
alternatives are blind and stubborn repression or wideopen talks 
with the criminals 
the traffickers communique has been widely interpreted by the 
press in colombia but it appears the drug lords want assurances 
that they will not be extradited to the united states 
the government began its crackdown after the cocaine lords 
assassinated a leading presidential candidate on aug 18 
since then the government has extradited to the united states 
13 colombians facing charges of drug smuggling trafficking and 
money laundering 
authorities also killed rodrigo gonzalo gacha a founding member 
of the medellin cocaine cartel 
the traffickers responded with a terror campaign that has killed 
209 people including 106 who died when a bomb blew a colombian 
airliner out of the sky authorities blamed them for 262 acts 
including bombings and arson 
el tiempo said monday there was disagreement among the 
traffickers about whether to surrender or continue fighting 
the traffickers offer wednesday to abandon cocaine smuggling 
came only from the medellin cartels two top men pablo escobar and 
luis ochoa el tiempo said quoting military intelligence sources 
the daily said the army had intercepted a message indicating 
that the cali cartel another big band of traffickers would not 
surrender or negotiate a truce in the war 
the medellin and cali cartels named after two colombian cities 
fought a gang war last year that killed more than 200 people

a judge ruled monday that a bishops 
right to confidentiality under religious law is not sufficient to 
keep the court from releasing pretrial testimony in a case 
involving a priest who molested boys 
i feel that good cause has never been established for the 
sealing of a deposition based upon an argument that it is to 
protect a canonized right alleged to be a first amendment 
guarantee said superior court judge thomas needham 
lawyers for the roman catholic diocese of providence had argued 
that under a theological doctrine called internal forum 
priests must keep secret anything told to them in confidence by 
church members 
the depositions had not been filed by monday afternoon 
the depositions were taken for a lawsuit filed in 1986 by a 
narragansett woman and her son who was one of three boys the rev 
william c oconnell was convicted after pleading no contest of 
sexually abusing while pastor of st marys church 
the 14 million lawsuit contends bishop louis e gelineau and 
auxiliary bishop kenneth a angell were negligent in failing to 
remove the priest from his bristol parish after they knew or 
should have known of his activities 
the plaintiffs contend gelineau knew of concerns involving 
oconnells relationship with young boys as early as november 1983 
the diocese did not remove oconnell from his position until after 
his arrest in 1985 
gelineau cited internal forum in refusing to answer 128 
questions at his deposition last june superior judge john p 
bourcier in september ordered 75 of those questions answered 
lawyer william a curran an attorney for the diocese then 
tried to seal the testimony he argued that its our right under 
the first amendment to free exercise of religion to follow the 
theological rules of internal forum 
the diocese also said the depositions would be used as fuel 
for the fire of publicity surrounding the case 
rhode island is considered by the church to be the most catholic 
state in the country on a per capita basis with 64 percent of its 
population catholic said william halpin a spokesman for the 
diocese 
needham referred to a 1983 us supreme court case involving the 
seattle times co and keith m rhinehart a spiritual leader in 
making his decision in that instance however the court ordered 
depositions sealed because the affidavits of the respondents and 
those members of the religious foundation supported the danger 
that release of their names would bring reprisals or fear of 
reprisals needham said 
needham said there was no indication that people not involved in 
the rhode island lawsuit would be harmed if the bishops 
depositions were made public 
he also said depositions given by two priests monsignor 
salvatore matano and the rev robert evans should be filed with 
the court 
curran had asked those answers be sealed because the priests 
were asked to assess the truthfulness of other priests material 
he said would not be admissible at trial and therefore should not 
be open to the public 
i didnt have anything to give other than my own thinking 
said curran i dont fault the court 
r daniel prentiss a lawyer for the plaintiffs said he had no 
comment 
oconnell pleaded no contest to 26 counts of sexual contact with 
three boys who were 12 14 and 17 at the time in june 1986 he was 
given a oneyear sentence in a work release program and ordered to 
take two years of therapy in a churchrun program

development programs in each state members will include 
representatives of governors and all federal departments 
administering rural development programs locally 
yeutter later told a news conference that the thrust of bushs 
rural development includes farming as the mainstay of rural 
economies 
clearly production agriculture is still by far the most 
important source of earnings for rural america he said and that 
is likely to continue for as long as we can visualize 
thus yeutter added it is most important for rural development 
to make sure that we have a very healthy farm economy 
but yeutter said there was a need to go beyond the farm economy 
in matters of economic development for the small towns and 
communities where about 60 million americans live including only 
about 5 million farmers and their families 
it is not enough to ask rural america to be dependent entirely 
on production agriculture yeutter said that became evident in the 
early 1980s as hard times hit the nations agriculture oil and gas 
areas and energybased industries 
one of the objectives will be to determine which programs and 
how much money are available for rural people from dozens of 
offices scattered among federal agencies 
yeutter and undersecretary roland r vatour who directly 
oversees small community and rural development programs said they 
had no solid estimate on how much federal money might be available 
however vatour said that in usda alone programs operated by 
the farmers home administration rural electrification 
administration and extension service have budgets totaling 8 
billion to 85 billion 
there is ample potential here to get a great deal more bang 
for the buck in rural development yeutter said we certainly 
could devote additional financial resources to this issue just as 
we could devote additional resources to a lot of other things 
other steps ordered by bush included 
a series of rural development demonstration programs to help 
identify regional needs develop action plans bring together 
available resourcesand evaluate the process for possible use on a 
larger scale yeutter said that project had not been formally set 
up 
the agriculture department will set up a rural development 
technical assistance center and hot line to provide detailed 
information on federal programs that serve rural communities the 
center also will link callers with federal state and regional 
program officials 
targeting of limited federal budget resources on activities 
that generate maximum economic benefits 
the economic policy councils working group on rural 
development will become a permanent fixture at the white house to 
implement any rural development initiatives developed by the 
new council and approved by the administration

the military government of gen ibrahim 
babangida announced monday it will begin registering members of the 
two political parties it has created to return africas most 
populous nation to civilian rule 
the statement said the registration will begin in march and will 
be conducted by administrative secretaries appointed by the 
military 
also monday babangida defended the soldiers who have seized 
power several times in nigeria saying they acted against the 
monopolistic interest of our civilian leadership that transformed 
political parties into war machines of the electoral process 
babangidas sixyearold government faces increasing criticism 
from civilians following a december leadership reshuffle that also 
has increased tensions between moslems and christians who accuse 
the military leader of favoring fellow followers of islam 
all former politicians and leading members of babangidas 
government are banned from seeking office 
parties also are banned from creating womens and youth groups 
because the government says those groups were used to break up 
rallies of opponents harass followers of rival parties and in 
some cases beat up rival candidates and their supporters 
public denunciations of the military here have grown since 
babangidas armed forces ruling council in october rejected 
nominations of 13 organizations seeking to register as political 
parties babangida said all were tainted by the corruption and 
ethnic and religious factionalism that he blames for the failure of 
previous civilian governments 
instead the military government itself created two political 
parties one centerright and one leftleaning and is writing 
their platforms 
babangida told an annual conference monday of senior military 
officers that they dont need to be defensive when responding to 
criticisms leveled by civilians of the militarys intervention in 
politics 
those who quarrel about how to share the rooms of a house the 
foundation of which is collapsing can only with extreme charity be 
condemned for lack of wisdom he said soldiers have governed

premier hans modrow said monday he would open 
the cabinet to the prodemocracy opposition and former communist 
party leader egon krenz apologized for his role in secret police 
operations 
they spoke during negotiations on east germanys future between 
the party and opposition groups which immediately accepted 
modrows offer 
prodemocracy activists demonstrated in at least eight cities 
after nightfall including more than 100000 in leipzig the 
official news agency adn also reported rallies in berlin cottbus 
dresden halle potsdam schwerin and suhl 
east german border guards began tearing down a 330yard section 
of the berlin wall in the kreuzberg district to be replaced by a 
metal fence said werner kolhoff a west berlin government 
spokesman he said an east german official told him other sections 
would be dismantled soon 
manfred gerlach of the liberal democratic party interim 
president of east germany said jan 2 the wall would be replaced 
with normal border markings the berlin wall was built in 1961 
modrow bowed to pressure to revise his 27member cabinet which 
previously excluded all but communists and traditional allies 
the leadership which replaced communist hardliners last year 
during a peaceful popular revolt has been trying to appease an 
opposition upset with the pace of promised reform modrows 
declaration came one day after the no 2 figure in the communist 
party quit and joined the social democrats 
until monday reformist groups such as new forum democratic 
awakening and the social democracts had resisted joining modrows 
government partly from fear voters would hold them responsible by 
for the economic mess left by four decades of communist rule 
the social democratic leader ibrahim boehme said a coalition 
was possible if all parties and groups are prepared to enter the 
government on an emergency basis without weekslong negotiations 
modrow proposed political groups meet wednesday to consider a 
new cabinet but did not make clear which or how many ministries 
might be offered the opposition 
communists hold 16 of the 27 seats and the remainder are divided 
among four parties once allied with them the liberal democrats 
with four christian democrats with three and two each for the 
national democrats and farmers party 
east germanys first free elections are to be held may 6 but 
broad differences between the communistdominated government and 
opposition groups have delayed economic reform measures and 
hindered the transition to democracy 
krenz who was ousted from the leadership dec 3 and expelled by 
his party sunday apologized for the old security doctrine he 
imposed on the country 
he appeared before the political forum to answer allegations 
that he helped falsify previous election results and misused the 
secret police service for political aims 
the 52yearold career politician conceded there had never been 
free elections in east germany only ballotfolding and said 
he believed some votes failed to reach the central counting 
facility after elections in may 
but he denied the results were falsified and cast himself as 
one who had fought for change from within 
krenz apologized for his role in leading east germany to its 
crisis and said he hoped the people would forgive him 
as a citizen and christian i accept your apology responded 
wolfgang ullmann of the democracy now reform movement 
in a rare display of unity the opposition groups joined modrow 
in denouncing a west german newspaper report monday alleging that 
soldiers and secret police agents were planning a coup 
the hamburg newspaper bild contended the renegades had held 
joint exercises and said a general strike could be used as the 
pretext for an armed takeover 
i must decisively reject as provocation a report in todays 
bild newspaper modrow said 
he said he had checked with the interior and defense ministers 
who assured him no signs of such preparation had been detected 
wolfgang schnur a leader in the democratic awakening movement 
called the bild report a horror story 
modrow also announced the resignation of communist finance 
minister uta nickel the target of a criminal inquiry into alleged 
financial irregularities ms nickel has denied wrongdoing 
on sunday the communists lost one of their most popular members 
when dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer a party deputy chairman 
defected to the social democrats 
the moves were expected to cause mass defections from the party 
its membership in the country of 163 million people has plunged to 
12 million from nearly 23 million in 1987

the state department accused the nicaraguan 
government monday of using antisemitic remarks to try to discredit 
what the sandinistas contend is a bungled us effort to help 
finance the nicaraguan electoral process 
at issue is an editorial in last thursdays edition of the 
governmentcontrolled newspaper barricada which tried to 
explain why the yankee bureaucracy has had difficulty in 
disbursing the money 
the editorial said there has been an excessive distrust by 
the yankees toward the leading opposition coalition in 
nicaragua and attributes this to the traditional jewstyle with 
which the us congress manages the taxes of the taxpayers 
congress with the stated aim of promoting fair elections has 
approved funds for such politically neutral projects as verifying 
voter registration lists and training poll watchers other funds 
were earmarked for the opposition coalition led by presidential 
candidate violeta chamorro 
with the election just five weeks away however only a small 
fraction of the money has been delivered to the designated 
recipients partly as a result the opposition campaign has been 
far less visible than the sandinistas 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler blamed the 
sandinista government for the logjam in the disbursement of the 
us funds and ridiculed the barricadas comments 
the nicaraguan government is doing everything in its power to 
block moneys designed by congress to help level the playing field 
for the opposition she said 
to resort to antisemitism in its attempt to explain to 
nicaraguans why it has failed to live up to the promises it made 
to the national opposition is contemptible and does a profound 
disservice to the nicaraguan people to congress and to all who 
want open free and fair elections in february 
the funds earmarked for nicaragua are channeled through the 
national endowment for democracy which uses international 
affiliates of the us democratic and republican parties as 
conduits 
the barricada editorial makes references to two officials of the 
national democratic institite ken wollack and barry feierstein it 
claimed that the funds earmarked for the election campaign are 
being diverted by nicaraguan opposition leaders for renovating 
their homes and purchasing new cars 
wollack the executive vice president of the institute refused 
comment on the editorial feierstein was not available for comment 
the reagan administration frequently charged the sandinista 
government with antisemitic activities but was hardpressed to 
back up its allegations 
president reagans allegations were undercut by his own 
ambassador to managua anthony quainton who said in a secret july 
1983 memo that the evidence fails to demonstrate that the 
sandinistas have followed a policy of antisemitism or have 
persecuted jews solely because of their religion 
although most members of nicaraguas tiny jewish community 
have left the country and some have had their properties 
confiscated there is no direct correlation between their jewish 
religion and the treatment they received from the sandinistas 
quaintons memo said

safety insurance medical and police experts 
monday asked nissan not to show a television fantasy commercial for 
its 300zx turbo sports car on grounds it promotes excessive and 
unsafe speed 
this is hitting a new low in automobile advertising said 
brian oneill president of the insurance institute for highway 
safety this is the worst example of an outandout speed ad 
weve ever seen 
the company declined saying it believed the ad would never be 
taken for real 
in the dreamlike commercial set on an automotive speedway the 
300zx turbo outpaces a motorcycle race car and jet plane as its 
driver murmurs some have to dream im in a turbo 300 and these 
guys are after me and they cant catch me 
in the final shot of the commercial scheduled to be shown 
during next sundays superbowl football championship the car leaps 
from the ground all four wheels in the air 
the message in the ad is simple and straight forward look at 
how fast this car can go omeill told a news conference 
oneill said the commercial irresponsibly promotes excessive 
speed and exhibits a blatant disregard for public safety 
he was joined in denouncing the ad by dr howard champion 
director of the medstar shocktrauma unit at the washington 
hospital center lt col cm robinson of the virginia state 
police and retired air force brig gen robert mcdermott chairman 
of usaa insurance group of san antonio 
when youre promoting speed and killing young people youre 
going too far mcdermott said who pronounced himself 
surprised outraged and disgusted with the commercial 
asked if his company would continue to insure the 300zx 
mcdermott replied we may not but later he told a reporter 
i dont want to threaten them i want to wait and see if they 
pull the ad 
dan spetner a nissan spokesman in los angeles dismissed the 
criticism 
we believe that the turbo 300 ad is so futuristic and 
farfetched that it would never be interpreted as representing a 
reallife driving situation spetner said 
it should be up to the american public to decide what can or 
cannot be shown on our airwaves he said 
nissan claims this ad is a fantasy oneill said but what 
isnt a fantasy at ll is that people are dying in highspeed 
crashes involving this car 
he displayed photographs of two demolished 300zx models taken 
after recent crashes in which three people were killed 
oneill also complained that nissans 1990 300zx is not equipped 
with safety airbags but instead features what he said are vastly 
inferior detachable automatic belt systems 
nissans contention that the ad is a fantasy is a transparent 
farce mcdermott said it has only one unmistakable 
overpowering message speed period 
oneill said his institute estimates that the 300zx in the 
commercial was exceeding 150 mph 
if there was a crash at that speed there would be nothing left 
of that car little pieces he said

cardinal edmund szoka known for his costcutting 
and fundraising success as archbishop in the nations 
fifthlargest diocese on monday accepted a papal appointment to a 
post at the vatican 
a vatican announcement said szoka will head the prefecture for 
economic affairs of the holy see which draws up the vaticans 
budget szoka announced his acceptance of the position in a news 
conference 
pope john paul ii and szoka discussed the vatican post in 
december during one of the archbishops visits to rome the 
62yearold prelate has been serving on a special commission 
studying ways to overcome the vaticans chronic budget deficit 
in that conversation the pope said he realized that it 
would be difficult for me to leave detroit and for that reason he 
made it very clear that he was only asking me to consider accepting 
this appointment szoka said 
he said the pope offered to let him both jobs but szoka who 
has undergone angioplasty for a narrowed artery said serving in 
both posts would stretch him too thin and both the prefecture and 
the detroit archdiocese would suffer 
some time in june szoka will succeed cardinal giuseppe caprio 
a 75yearold italian who resigned because of his age 
szokas fiscal skills have brought him praise and criticism 
the latter stemming from the closings of 30 innercity parishes of 
the 15million member archdiocese last year he cited a shortage 
of priests declining membership and the increasing costs of 
maintaining the church buildings 
earlier this month five other innercity parishes were ordered 
to close after failing to show their viability during a oneyear 
reprieve 
the vatican itself has ordered austerity measures 
in 1988 the vatican reported it was 57 million in the red it 
since has cut the deficit by 9 million szoka said he hopes to be 
able to cut the deficit further 
i have some ideas but the question is how do i implement 
them the bureaucracy has been in place for 2000 years

the state department disputing a published 
report said monday it had no evidence that israel was providing 
ethiopia with cluster bombs 
the report in sundays new york times quoted unnamed state 
department and pentagon officials it followed a statement by 
former president jimmy carter a month ago that one of our middle 
east allies had provided cluster bombs to the ethiopian air force 
carter who has been trying to mediate an end to a long civil 
war between the marxist government in addis ababa and eritrean 
rebels did not identify israel specifically 
asked about the times report margaret d tutwiler the state 
department spokeswoman said we have no clear physical evidence 
that israel has provided such weapons to the government of 
ethiopia 
she said secretary of state james a baker iii raised the issue 
with israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin at a meeting here last 
thursday and was told that israel has not provided cluster bombs 
to ethiopia and would not do so 
ethiopia reestablished relations with israel last october after 
a 16year break its friendship with the jewish state goes back to 
the old testament 
in recent years however israel has been unable to arrange with 
the marxist government for the emigration of thousands of 
impoverished black jews others were smuggled out before the 
operation moses exodus was halted 
last week without elaboration israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir voiced confidence that all those remaining in ethiopia would 
be allowed to go to israel 
the united states suspended sale of cluster bombs to israel in 
1982 after they were used during an incursion into lebanon in 
1988 the ban was lifted but ms tutwiler said no american cluster 
bombs had been sent to israel since 
the times story quoted officials as saying they did not know 
whether the cluster bombs reportedly provided to ethiopia were 
americanmade or israelimade 
a cluster bomb dropped from an airplane explodes and releases 
scores of small bombs contained in the canister it can have severe 
tactical and psychological effect because of the series of 
explosions that are set off

with the dow jones industrial average suffering its 10thbiggest 
daily drop ever amid worries about the outlook for corporate 
profits and interest rates 
the widely watched dow average of 30 bluechip stocks finished 
down 7745 points at 260045 its largest oneday point loss since 
a 190point drop last oct 13 
broader market indicators also fell sharply and more than five 
stocks declined in price for each one that rose on the new york 
stock exchange 
analysts said traders remained uneasy about weak corporate 
earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 1988 as well as the 
recent upturn in openmarket interest rates 
the federal reserve board is seen as facing an increasingly 
difficult set of choices in setting monetary policy to stave off a 
recession while trying to keep inflation at bay 
if the fed decides to boost interest rates to quell inflation 
that could hurt profits 
alan greenspan the feds chairman will be making several 
appearances before congressional committees in the near future 
wall streeters will be watching closely to see what positions 
greenspan might take on such matters as the risk that rising 
worldwide interest rates might pose for the us business outlook

authority as reasons why he should win reelection levies placed 
on casino hotels are allocated by the authority toward city and

officials in charge of the 5monthold savings 
and loan bailout are coming under increasing pressure to act more 
quickly on what amounts to the largest thrift institution and real 
estate sale in history 
the resolution trust corp created aug 9 when president bush 
signed the bailout legislation hit the ground running with an 
initial flurry of action within two months it had disposed of 33 
failed sampls out of the 262 it inherited 
but in the three months since then its disposed of only seven 
and its portfolio of failed sampls is growing faster than its list of 
resolutions 
at the end of last week it had sold a total of 40 institutions 
but still held 302 institutions with assets totaling 113 billion 
and in coming months it expects to take control of an additional 
200 bankrupt thrifts 
the house banking committee on tuesday opens three days of 
hearings into the administrations conduct of the bailout the 
senate banking committee is following with a fourth session next 
monday 
legislators and analysts are criticizing the administration for 
not doing more a marked contrast from the generally favorable 
reception bailout officials received during the last big round of 
congressional oversight hearings in october 
speed is crucial said professor paul horvitz of the 
university of houston these insolvent institutions are losing 
money but much more important than that is theyre also 
affecting the market and imposing losses on solvent institutions 
democrats on the banking panel are faulting resolution trust 
corp officials for being too afraid of the kind of withering 
criticism that hamstrung and ultimately forced the resignation of 
m danny wall who as chairman of the now defunct federal home loan 
bank board handled the disposal of 223 institutions in 1988 
its a politically charged area and theyre being extremely 
perhaps overly cautious said rep charles schumer dny a 
member of the banking committee theyre very troubled and 
worried about doing anything and often the bureaucratic response to 
that is dont just stand there do nothing 
the message we have to get across is inaction is not an 
alternative said rep bruce vento dminn who heads a house 
task force overseeing the bailout we didnt appoint them to be 
in a popularity contest we appointed them to do a job 
critics also cite the cumbersome administrative structure 
created by the sampl bill 
policy and purse strings are controlled by a board chaired by 
the secretary of the treasury however the corporations work is 
supervised by the federal deposit insurance corp an independent 
agency that insures bank and sampl deposits 
theres a fundamental structural problem said bert ely a 
financial institutions analyst in alexandria va ultimately 
whos in charge 
l william seidman who is chairman of both the fdic and 
resolution trust corp conceded that the administrative structure 
has slowed the cleanup process but he stressed the enormity of the 
agencys task 
youre setting up a new organization that had zero employees 
five months ago already its the equivalent of the secondlargest 
financial institution after citicorp in the country he said 
this month the corporation put 51 of its institutions on the 
auction block bringing the total for sale up to 70 it also 
released a 3000page inventory of 30000 pieces of real estate 
available in 45 states 
we want to do things rapidly but we also want to do things 
right seidman said overall i think our crew has 
accomplished quite a bit 
the corporation hopes to complete the sales in the second 
quarter but after that says it will face a cash crunch if the 
administration and congress cannot resolve the politically sticky 
question of how to raise working capital for the agency 
the sampl bill provided 50 billion to cover losses in insolvent 
but still open thrifts but the corporation needs an additional 
40 billion to 100 billion in working capital it would be repaid 
as the government sells assets from the failed sampls and would not 
increase the ultimate cost of the bailout 
they need more money and they need it sooner rather than 
later said robert litan of the brookings institution a policy 
research group in washington that sometimes advocates liberal 
positions the problem is the uncertainty over the budget 
treatment 
the administration wants to avoid inflating the budget deficit 
but congressional democrats argue that its is cheapest to borrow 
the money through the treasury which would count toward the 
deficit so far no one has come up with a compromise that will 
satisfy both sides

president bushs spokesman said monday that 
americans are entitled to differing views on abortion based on 
their personal choice of conscience at the same time bush was 
telling antiabortion marchers he stands with them 
white house aides sought to play down the significance of the 
emotioncharged subject as an electionyear issue as well as 
reports of divisions on the subject within the bush family itself 
we all feel there is room within the republican party for 
varying points of view on this issue said marlin fitzwater the 
presidents spokesman 
he said that bushs own antiabortion view was a personal 
choice of conscience he has made and that the president urges 
others to consider their conscience and principles in making their 
own personal judgments 
as to a report in this weeks newsweek magazine that the bush 
family discovered at a recent family gathering that it was split on 
the abortion issue with bush and his wife disagreeing fitzwater 
said such a meeting never took place 
despite longstanding speculation that barbara bush retains the 
prochoice position bush himself once espoused fitzwater said 
the president said no such meeting ever took place 
mrs bush repeatedly has refused to answer interviewers 
questions about her views on the abortion issue 
in a year in which many analysts see a rigid antiabortion 
stance as a political liability bush limited his contact with the 
marchers to a 90second speech by remote telephone hookup he spoke 
to the marchers as they prepared for their annual march past the 
capitol and the supreme court 
let me assure you that this president stands with you on this 
issue of life bush told the marchers on the 17th annivesary of 
the courts roe vs wade decision which legalized abortion 
for 17 years the march for life has served as a poignant 
reminder to all americans that human life in all its forms must be 
respected and i think all of you know my deep conviction on roe 
vs wade bush said 
although bush said in 1980 that he believed the roe vs wade 
decison was right he now supports a constitutional amendment 
to overturn the ruling 
he opposes abortion except to save the mothers life or in cases 
of rape or incest bush opposes federal financing of abortions for 
poor women except to save the mothers life 
fitzwater asked at his daily news briefing whether bush shares 
republican national chairman lee atwaters view that there is 
enough room in the gop for both those who oppose and those who 
favor abortion rights fitzwater said yes he does 
we welcome republicans being republicans and theyre free we 
have people of independent belief and thought here he said 
newsweek reported that bush and his wife discussed abortion at a 
recent gettogether with their children and their childrens 
spouses and found all the men were antiabortion but all the women 
were prochoice said the magazine it did name its source 
mrs bushs press secretary anna perez echoed fitzwaters 
denial that any such meeting took place 
it did not happen as reported she said 
furthermore ms perez said that mrs bush has a longstanding 
policy of not commenting on controversial issues she does not want 
to defuse the ability she has to focus public opinion on those 
areas where she can make a difference literacy teen pregnancy

consumer prices of milk and other dairy 
products may well rise again this year but not at the pace of 1989 
an agriculture department economist said monday 
ralph parlett of the departments economic research service said 
1990 retail prices of dairy products could rise as much as 3 
percent compared with an average gain of 66 percent in 1989 
a few weeks ago parlett figured dairy product prices might go 
up in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent this year but now he said 
in a telephone interview the increase could be more volatile 
ranging from zero to 3 percent 
consumer food prices generally are expected to rise 3 percent to 
5 percent in 1990 according to a forecast announced by usda last 
fall the 1989 average was up almost 6 percent the sharpest gain 
since 1981 
parlett said he is sticking by the 3 percent to 5 percent 
forecast at least for the present 
in an outlook report by the usda agency economists said dairy 
markets are adjusting after the record prices and chaotic 
conditions of last autumn 
the report said dairy prices at the farm and wholesale will drop 
in the first half of 1990 because of cutbacks in nonfat dry milk 
exports likely increases in milk production and consumer reaction 
to higher prices 
another factor will be seasonal increases in milk output the 
flush season of spring when production is at a peak by then 
the report said most wholesale prices are likely to be below a 
year earlier

president bush said monday that he will 
nominate james kolstad as chairman of the national transportation 
safety board ending a 17month stalemate over leadership of the 
agency that investigates air sea and land transportation accidents 
kolstad 50 a former airline executive has been a member of 
the safety board since 1987 and its acting chairman since august 
1988 when jim burnett failed to win senate approval for a fourth 
twoyear term as chairman 
white house action on the nomination had been delayed while 
kolstad underwent an extended background check including scrutiny 
of his interim stewardship of the agency 
the board has been beset with bickering and other difficulties 
exacerbated by a tight budget and shrinking investigative staff 
board member joseph tribbe nall was killed nov 28 in a plane crash 
in caracas venezuela where he had gone to give a speech 
this long interim has been destabilizing and its good that 
the issue has been resolved said stephen hayes vice president 
of the air transport association which represents the major 
airlines we think hes certainly wellqualified and will be a 
very effective chairman of the board 
on capitol hill sen wendell ford dky the chairman of the 
senate aviation subcommittee said he was pleased with bushs move 
i believe mr kolstad has the necessary background 
qualifications and temperament to serve in this capacity mr 
kolstad will continue to promote the smooth operation of the board 
and i look forward to working with him as chairman ford said 
an aide to ford said the panel will schedule confirmation 
hearings on both kolstad and susan coughlin a bush nominee whose 
appointment to the board languished last year without a hearing 
kolstad was a white house aide and presidential advance man 
during the nixon administration he was director of congressional 
relations for the old civil aeronautics board from 197378 and 
later served as public affairs director for frontier airlines

consumer product safety commission staff 
members say adult sleepwear should be labeled according to its 
degree of flammability to help prevent fire deaths among the 
elderly manufacturers argue that a simple warning would do the job 
the commission will soon consider staff and industry 
recommendations for adult sleepwear labeling after postponing a 
vote on the issue monday 
we want to provide the consumer with information on relative 
flammability to build safety into making a choice said james 
hoebel head of the cpsc fire hazard and burn prevention division 
hoebels staff has recommended the commission require labeling 
that would classify adult pajamas nightgowns and robes by degree 
of fabric flammability 
i dont quarrel with their intent said larry k martin 
government relations director for the american apparel 
manufacturers association 
they want to provide some added safety to elderly people but 
you cant segregate nightwear for elderly people from what you and 
i wear added martin 
according to the cpsc there were 179 clothing fire deaths in 
1986 the last year for which figures are available adults aged 65 
and older were victims in all but 40 of those incidents and the 
clothing most frequently involved was sleepwear said hoebel 
were very concerned about trying to prevent those deaths 
said cpsc spokesman ken giles 
but martin said a simple flammability warning would accomplish 
the same goal as a complex system of fabric testing and rating 
weve recommended to the commission that they require a 
warning label that has a logo with a strike through it and a flame 
and language that says warning keep away from flame and other 
ignition source martin said 
labels are not required for childrens sleepwear but garments 
must meet a flammability performance standard that measures how 
quickly a garment stops burning 
cpsc testing includes burning with an open flame at least five 
10by3inch swatches from a garment no sample can burn more than 
seven inches before it stops burning and no one swatch can burn its 
full length for a garment to satisfy the government standard 
the american association of retired persons a lobbying group 
for the elderly prefers a performance standard but would back a 
classification system and a mandatory labeling program aarp 
volunteer james ryan told the commission last week

spokesman said monday 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said a bipartisan 
congressional proposal to make the epa the 15th cabinet agency is 
under serious consideration for white house backing

advantages for the agency the epas in kind of a unique situation 
where its part regulatory part policy fitzwater said

lech walesa met monday with a potential 
leader of the reformed communist party as polish communists begged 
the solidarityled government for protection from revenge 
before holding their last congress 
walesa a founder and leader of solidarity conferred with 
communist tadeusz fiszbach a deputy speaker of parliament who was 
ousted as gdansk party leader after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
here for his solidarity sympathies 
fiszbach has not said if he will bid to head the new party 
expected to emerge when the polish united workers party the 
communist party is dissolved during its 11th national congress 
opening saturday 
the only announced candidate is mieczyslaw f rakowski the 
current first secretary who seeks to bolster the partys dwindling 
role in polish politics with a new name and program 
if the slogans and ideas that mr fiszbach represents were 
valid during the last 10 years we would surely be further in 
reforming poland walesa said after the meeting 
he called fiszbach a man of reconciliation and the 
communist said there are common issues that do not divide us but 
unite us 
the two men did not indicate any agreement however on a major 
issue whether the buildings industries and other property 
accumulated by the communist party during 45 years of total power 
should be reclaimed for the public treasury 
walesa said the partys assets are public property 
one should not have an emotional approach fiszbach said 
i think the government should take up the issue and should 
consider the needs of newly created parties and the newly elected 
local governments 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and his solidaritydominated 
cabinet have stopped government subsidies to political parities 
without moving to regain the property 
but there is considerable public demand to go further up for 
consideration thursday is a draft law submitted by 93 parliament 
members who want to take back party property 
the party congress coordinating committee protested monday and 
asked the government to guarantee us the elementary right to hold 
our congress 
an attempt to confiscate communist party property on the eve 
of its ending its life impedes the shaping of a rational 
arrangement of political forces in the country delegates said in 
a statement carried by the party daily trybuna ludu 
at the decisive moment we are becoming the focus of a 
propaganda and political attack 
in a climate of aggression there are attempts at revenge in a 
style that we assess as a relic of the past recently the slogan 
of nationalizing communist party property became the pretext for 
the attacks 
a commentary in trybuna ludu said parliaments adoption of the 
measure would be a revengeful abuse of freshly won power and 
end the short period of democracy in poland 
it said nationalizing party property would reinforce the 
arguments of the hardliners and be a political blow at the 
reformoriented current in the party 
over the weekend parliament began dismantling polands vast 
cooperative system attacked as a monopolistic bureaucratic 
vestige of communist power that must be pared down and opened to 
competition 
the lawmakers backed by the government voted to dissolve the 
central cooperative unions the top tier of a system that funneled 
small producers wares into a network of distributers ultimately 
regulated by supreme councils 
does a shoemaker in the countryside really need a chief 
manager in warsaw deputy urszula jarosz asked during the debate 
the official news agency pap reported 
the new law will remove regulations and restrictions imposed on 
producers by the central cooperative unions as part of radical 
economic reforms that aim to turn polands staggering socialist 
economy into one driven by market forces 
adoption of the draft law will break up the old structures 
and will encourage grassroots initiative pap quoted deputy 
marian kowal as saying

the bush administration cautioned the soviet 
union on monday against suppressing peaceful political expression 
while quelling violence in azerbaijan 
it also urged moscow to undertake a political dialogue with 
all peoples in the embattled republic 
we hope for an early end to all bloodshed the state 
department said we hope that reason and restraint will mark the 
actions of all parties to the dispute

hatreds 
shifting gears slightly tuesdays statement stressed that us 
support for moscow in using force was limited

of force to restore order and the use of force to suppress peaceful 
and legitimate political expression ms tutwiler said reading 
from a prepared statement

political dialogue can be undertaken it said such a dialogue 
must accommodate the aspirations of all the peoples in the

ms tutwiler replied no we are not saying that 
the spokeswoman said soviet troops along the border with iran 
had been augmented to prevent unauthorized access ms tutwiler

azeris with equipment 
most azeris and iranians are moslems while armenians are 
predominantly christians

opposition leaders meeting with ruling 
communist officials demanded quicker reforms to eliminate communist 
party influence in the government and workplace and called for an 
investigation of the secret police 
also monday the newspaper pogled reported that ousted stalinist 
leader todor zhivkov 78 arrested last week faces a maximum of 30 
years in jail if convicted on a single count misappropriation of 
state property 
todor zhivkovs repressive system has not ceased to exist we 
are its hostages said zhelyu zhelev chairman of the 12party 
opposition union of democratic forces quoted by the state news 
agency bta 
zhelev called for a speedup of democratization because of a 
possible adverse turn of events in the soviet union where 
unrest is wracking several of its republics and because of the need 
for western economic aid bta said 
the opposition says reform has been slow in coming since zhivkov 
was deposed nov 10 in a wave of prodemocracy uprisings that swept 
eastern europe last year communist leader and president petar 
mladenov who replaced zhivkov has pledged widespread reform and 
free elections by may 
politburo member andrei lukanov leader of the communist party 
delegation said i deeply trust the communist party of the 
soviet unions ability to take the country out of the difficult 
stage he said apparently referring to the separatist movements 
that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is facing 
without the soviet unions cooperation bulgaria would be unable 
to find its way out of its economic difficulties bta quoted 
lukanov as saying 
opposition spokesmen at the negotiating table demanded that the 
communist party cells be removed from the workplace and urged that 
activities of the committee for state security be examined at a 
public inquiry bta said 
the opposition also wants the army the interior ministry the 
law courts and the prosecutors office to be depoliticized 
meaning freed of influence by the ruling communist party and other 
parties 
opposition representatives also demanded disclosure of property 
of the communist and agrarian parties and of highranking officials 
in bulgarias nomenklatura bta said 
they demanded the lifting of customs controls on the import of 
literature the news agency said 
the leadership was scheduled to answer the opposition demands on 
tuesday 
the opposition has received the green light to issue an 
independent newspaper which will be titled democracy but the 
government has so far rejected a demand for opposition access to 
the media the disagreement held up the talks last week 
according to the panorama weekend television program zhivkov 
was at his boyana residence on the slopes of mt vitosha south of 
sofia until jan 19 when he was taken into custody 
the report quoted the interior ministry as saying zhivkov was 
being held in a place specially adjusted for the purpose of 
investigative custody there was no elaboration 
conviction of the crime of illegally receiving an especially 
large amount of public property could draw a sentence of 10 to 30 
years in jail said pogled 
the other charge inciting ethnic hostility and hatred 
carries a maximum of three years the third charge an 
especially grave case of abuse of power is punishable by 
imprisonment of three to 10 years

naacp leaders said monday after a meeting with 
president bush there may be some movements in the effort to 
find the terrorists responsible for mail bombings in the south 
their assessment came as fbi agents searched a warehouse in 
enterprise ala in an action a spokesman said could very well 
be linked to the bombing investigation 
dr william f gibson a greenville sc dentist and chairman 
of the naacp board of directors said after meeting with bush 
attorney general dick thornburgh and fbi director william sessions 
we got indications that there are some movements in the cases i 
cant say anything further 
naacp executive director benjamin l hooks said we were 
fairly well satisfied that the federal bureau of investigation and 
the justice department were doing their best 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thornburgh simply 
said that we were making progress that he was hopeful but he 
could not give any specifics at that point 
mail bombs claimed the lives of a federal appeals judge in 
alabama and a savannah ga civil rights lawyers in november 
other bombs were mailed to the federal courthouse in atlanta and 
the naacp branch office in jacksonville fla but were intercepted 
before exploding 
among the 17 naacp officials at the white house meeting were 
willye dennis head of the jacksonville office and erl shinhoster 
director of its atlanta regional office where a tear gas bomb 
exploded last aug 21 
hooks who also met with bush on jan 9 to discuss the attacks 
said we are concerned about the climate that has caused race 
relations to deteriorate and increased acts of violence 
he suggested that last weeks arrest of district of columbia 
mayor marion barry on cocaine charges not discussed at the white 
house meeting may be part of a pattern of undue harassment of 
black elected officials and part of the rising tide of racism in 
this nation 
hooks said the ku klux klan and skinheads have picketed the 
naacps national headquarters in baltimore twice in recent weeks 
were concerned about the mood the kind of relationships that 
are developing schisms between blacks and whites in america said 
gibson 
we encouraged the president to use his office to get the 
word over that we feel that there needs to be more relations and 
negotiations and discussions between black america and white 
america said gibson 
they said they asked bush and thornburgh to use the justice 
departments community relations service and a revised us 
commission on civil rights to promote such a dialogue bush was 
amicable toward those steps gibson said 
hooks said they did not discuss with the president the widely 
publicized barry arrest in a fbi sting operation in a washington 
hotel last thursday 
but hooks said there is no question about the fact that we at 
the naacp across the past few years have felt that there has been 
undue emphasis on harassing black elected officials 
thornburgh asked later about the harassment charge said if 
that were the case it would be intolerable it is not the case 
hooks said newspaper accounts made it sound like the search 
had finally paid off we spent all of these years trying to find 
him with a grain of cocaine and by god we did it didnt we 
we havent found all the people whove stolen all the money 
from the savings and loan associations and are driving rolls royces 
and jaguars so obviously many of us in the black community will 
have some peculiar feelings as we go further 
hooks was asked if he objected to bringing lawbreakers to 
justice 
no i think you ought to bring everybody to justice for 
violating the law that would have meant most of us here would be 
arrested for speeding spitting on the sidewalk or something if we 
can afford to do it lets do it 
bush has said nothing of the barry arrest except that it was 
very sad

there was an analysis of the situation in our country he 
described the atmosphere as cordial 
wali refused to comment directly on reports that president najib 
of afghanistan had agreed to turn over power to an interim 
government led by the former king 
sharing power with the communist party in kabul has 
always been something which is not acceptable he said adding

afghanistan nearly a year after a decadelong effort to sustain 
marxist rule

a transitional government that would lead the country out of civil 
war between the government and moslem guerrillas 
zaher shah who suffers from rheumatism was enjoying the 
thermal spring waters of the italian island of ischia when his 
cousin and former prime minister mohammed daud seized power in 
july 1973 he has lived in italy since then

demonstrators marched with renewed fervor at state capitols and 
cities around the nation monday to commemorate the 17th anniversary 
of the supreme courts roe vs wade ruling which legalized 
abortion 
at least 9000 people marched against abortion at the georgia 
capitol in atlanta while washingtons annual march for life 
carried a similar message to the white house the nations capitol 
and the us supreme court 
it may be a long fight the rev pat robertson told 
demonstrators in atlanta but we will come back this year we 
will come back next year we will come back the year after 
until sooner or later we have victory 
norma mccorvey the woman who was the jane roe in roe vs 
wade was keynote speaker at a prochoice rally that drew about 
1000 people to the steps of the california capitol in sacramento 
were still fighting and will continue to fight as long as the 
fight must go on she said the movement didnt start with me 
i was just the straw that broke the camels back 
sarah weddington the texas lawyer who argued ms mccorveys 
case before the supreme court told a breakfast in dallas we are 
here to say we won 17 years ago today and we will win again 
the roe vs wade anniversary has become an increasingly 
important day to those debating the future of abortion in the 
united states this years commemoration carried special weight 
because of last summers supreme court ruling in missouris webster 
case 
that ruling which opened the door for states to impose some 
restrictions on abortion was the biggest legal victory in decades 
for antiabortion forces and led to speculation that the high court 
would overturn roe vs wade 
it also pumped new life into organizations on both sides of the 
abortion debate and led to a flurry of legislative proposals to 
both restrict and guarantee access to abortions 
those bills helped give added significance to this years 
demonstrations tens of thousands of people marched at rallies 
around the nation on sunday 
the webster case also provided a backdrop for one of the 
stranger incidents in the abortion observances on sunday night 
police in san francisco cited ms mccorvey for illegally posting 
stickers bearing the name roe on city street signs the signs 
were on webster street 
it was just a prank ms mccorvey told reporters monday 
we were plastering webster signs making them roe signs 
in another unusual twist about a dozen prochoice demonstrators 
wrapped 200 feet of purple ribbon around the louisiana statehouse 
in baton rouge to draw attention to their new coalition for 
reproductive freedom the ribbon they said symbolized the purple 
sashes worn by suffragettes who marched for womens rights earlier 
in the century 
in charlotte nc a planned parenthood chapter set up three 
mobile telephones downtown for prochoice supporters on their lunch 
breaks to pay 3 to call gov jim martin and president bush 
many people stopped to take leaflets but a few placed calls 
im prochoice and i vote lyla bendsen shouted into one of 
the cellular phones as she called martins office over the sounds 
of traffic 
in trenton nj about 150 protesters marched in front of the 
new jersey statehouse in support of antiabortion bills including 
one that would require minors seeking abortions to notify their 
parents 
the demonstrators included a group of schoolgirls from 
incarnation school in nearby ewing nj one of whom carried a 
sign that read real women dont kill babies 
all of our parents gave us a chance so why dont we give them 
a chance said another student eighthgrader theresa thoma 
a parental notification bill is also pending in nebraska where 
the legislature chose mondays anniversary to begin its debate on 
the issue state lawmakers in lincoln adjourned for the day without 
voting 
in maine about threedozen antiabortion demonstrators marched 
on the federal courthouse in portland while their opposites 
lobbied legislators in augusta to keep maine a prochoice 
state in the words of prochoice leader betsy sweet 
new york gov mario cuomo appeared with gloria steinem a 
founder of the modern womens movement at a conference of family 
planning advocates in albany 
there is an uprising on the streets and in the voting booths 
on this issue in this country just as there was for democracy in 
eastern europe ms steinem said

usbacked rebels had planned to ambush him in a remote northern 
area where he campaigned for elections 
no attack took place and his claim could not be independently 
confirmed 
ortega spoke at a political rally sunday in san juan de rio 
coco a small town in the northern province of madriz which 
borders honduras a tape of his speech was provided to the 
associated press 
ortega is running for reelection against violeta barrios de 
chamorro the candidate of the usbacked united national 
opposition general elections are scheduled for feb 25 
the leftist government has said the number of clashes with the 
contra rebels increased sharply this month ortega said in an 
annual economic speech monday that he would send a note protesting 
the attacks to the us government the un security council and 
the organization of american states 
ortega addressed a rally in quilali then left for san juan de 
rio coco 
now that we were coming from quilali they contras tried to 
stage an ambush on the road ortega said and the comrades 
military commanders were telling me its not convenient to go 
to san juan de rio coco because the ambush could be waiting for 
you 
but i told them lets go 
there were no journalists with the presidents caravan as it 
traveled from quilali to san juan de rio coco journalists were 
shuttled in a helicopter 
those contras are lurking around there threatening and in 
some way they are threatening the president of nicaragua and the 
candidate of the sandinista front ortega said 
therefore its the yankees i accuse the yankees i give 
responsibility to the yankees of any criminal action against me or 
against the comrades who are traveling with me he added 
ortega said monday the contras desisted from their ambush plan 
because it was daylight and their retreat would have been more 
difficult 
on nov 1 ortega broke a ceasefire that technically had been 
in place since march 1988 he said thousands of contras had begun 
infiltrating from honduras where most of them have been based 
since the ceasefire was signed 
the contras took up arms in 1981 claiming the sandininstas had 
betrayed the goals of the 1979 popular revolution that toppled 
dictator anastasio somoza the united states now supplies them only 
nonlethal aid 
under an agreement between central american presidents in 
august the contras were to return to their homeland or be 
relocated 
thousands of contras remain in honduras and they have refused 
to surrender

up to 2 million wailing blackclad azerbaijanis 
marched through baku on monday to mourn those killed when soviet 
troops put down a nationalist revolt and the republics 
legislature threatened secession if moscow did not pull out its 
soldiers 
in further defiance of president mikhail s gorbachev local 
legislators declared moscows state of emergency void militants 
vowed to keep up crippling strikes in baku an oil center of 18 
million people on the caspian sea until troops leave 
communist leaders from soviet armenia and azerbaijan took a 
tentative step monday toward ending 10 days of ethnic warfare 
agreeing to withdraw armed groups from areas along their border 
tass said but activists in armenia and azerbaijan said they 
doubted the truce would be kept 
the official soviet news agency reported 12 more people killed 
in ethnic clashes monday on the border of the two republics 
raising the toll since jan 13 to 167 soviet officials said 83 of 
those were from the soviet assault on the azerbaijani capital 
saturday including 14 soldiers and members of their families 
more than 500 have been wounded in the conflicts 
tass said the 12 new deaths occurred when armenian militants 
fired on an azerbaijani village in the volchy vorota border area 
azerbaijani activists told a moscow news conference monday that 
3700 died when soviet troops entered baku tass said but it 
emphasized this was an unconfirmed figure 
an emergency overnight session of the azerbaijani supreme soviet 
legislature demanded full withdrawal of soviet troops from the 
republic with the exception of border districts with armenia said 
baku lawyer viliyad mamedov who attended the 11hour overnight 
session 
lawmakers also demanded lifting of the curfew and state of 
emergency in baku and other areas of azerbaijan which moscow 
imposed without the approval of azerbaijani authorities mamedov 
said in a telephone interview 
if those demands are not met mamedov said the legislature will 
consider voting to secede from the soviet union 
at mondays mass rally in baku demonstrators carried posters 
reading gorbachev is the butcher of the azerbaijani people 
and azerbaijanis will not succumb to tanks said shain gajiyev 
a baku journalist 
witnesses said throngs of mourners numbering as many as 2 
million bore coffins of azerbaijanis killed in the weekend assault 
down the narrow streets and major thoroughfares to lenin square 
now renamed freedom square in honor of the azerbaijani nationalist 
cause 
the mourners wearing black and carrying blackbordered 
portraits of some of the victims then buried the victims at kirov 
park overlooking the caspian sea 
all the people of azerbaijan and baku are in tears and 
mourning official baku radio said in a broadcast monitored by 
the bbc in london 
soviet troops and police did not interfere in the funeral said 
leila yunusov a spokeswoman for the social democratic group an 
informal azerbaijani political organization 
foreign reporters were barred from the region so it was 
difficult to determine the exact death toll or reconcile 
conflicting information 
military officials said no one had been killed in baku the last 
two days and residents said the soviet troops seemed to have the 
city under control no armed clashes with troops were reported 
monday gajiyev said although scattered gunfire was heard 
conflicting reports came from the sovietiranian border where 
azerbaijanis have torn down many barriers the government newspaper 
izvestia said 40000 azerbaijanis crossed into iran on sunday 
evening alone but iranian media said soviet troops clamped down on 
the border and were not letting azerbaijanis out 
interfax an affiliate of radio moscow said unidentified 
extremists threatened russian residents of baku with violence 
unless they left and threatened to blow up oil tankers in bakus 
harbor unless troops were withdrawn 
soviet tv on monday evening suggested the government launch 
negotiations with the azerbaijani peoples front the nationalist 
organization behind much of the unrest the evening news program 
said since the peoples front controls some areas of azerbaijan it 
is the logical partner for peace talks 
it was not clear whether the peoples front and armenian 
activists participated in the negotiations in the armenian town of 
yeraskh 
highranking armenian and azerbaijani communist party and 
government officials also agreed to repair disrupted communications 
lines 
in a statement issued monday peoples fronts from the soviet 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia commiserated with 
the azerbaijanis and said moscow with its centralized policies 
was to blame for provoking the conflict they offered riga the 
latvian capital as a site for peace talks 
armenias popular movements condemned moscow for the baku 
deaths when armenians demanded protection for themselves and 
punishment for azerbaijani extremists who victimized them they 
did not mean a deployment of the soviet army in a largescale 
bloody action but the use of civilized methods proper to a 
lawbased state the armenian board of national movements said 
the statement read over the phone by activist rafael popayan 
from yerevan the armenian capital said innocent blood is being 
shed and that cannot leave the armenian people indifferent 
at a protest march by 2000 azerbaijanis in moscow on monday 
one demonstrator carried a sign reading comrades in baku more 
than 9000 people were killed 
a gathering monday in the azerbaijani town of pushkino to mourn 
those slain ended in mass rioting tass said 
the explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility 
between armenia and azerbaijan is considered one of the worst 
crises gorbachev has faced in his nearly fiveyear tenure as soviet 
leader 
moscow sent thousands of troops and other forces to baku after 
fighting flared between the moslem azerbaijanis and mainly 
christian armenians this month the neighboring republics are 
locked in a decadesold dispute over the region of 
nagornokarabakh which is inside azerbaijan but populated mainly 
by armenians 
the total number of soviet forces combating the violence in 
armenia and azerbaijan is reported to be 29000 including troops 
police cadets and interior ministry forces the number of 
militants is reported in the thousands 
violence began jan 13 with antiarmenian rioting in baku that 
killed 67 people by official count and sent thousands of armenians 
fleeing from their homes in panic it escalated into open warfare 
elsewhere in azerbaijan 
sheikh ul islam spiritual leader of azerbaijani moslems 
condemned the assault on baku by soviet troops in an address to 
world and religious leaders sent to azerinform azerbaijans 
official news agency on monday 
the shiite cleric said evil deeds were committed in baku over 
the weekend beyond reason no people are to be talked to with the 
language of guns he said 
he did not mention the armenian deaths in baku the previous week

prime minister charles haughey said 
monday he is willing to talk with protestants about replacing the 
angloirish accord a 1985 pact giving the irish republic a say in 
the affairs of northern ireland 
but haughey reiterated his governments commitment to the 
accord which is aimed at protecting interests of the 40 percent 
roman catholic minority in the strifetorn british colony 
haugheys carefully worded statement came after weekend 
overtures from two leading figures in the ulster unionist party 
the largest party in northern ireland that is adamantly against the 
1985 agreement 
i would welcome hearing unionist concerns at first hand 
haughey said i place no restriction on the agenda 
i would be quite prepared to consider any agreed alternative 
arrangements which would replace the existing agreement if 
britain also agreed he added 
britains northern ireland secretary peter brooke found the 
developments encouraging 
there does seem to be signs of movement he told the british 
broadcasting corp tv in an interview in washington and what 
happened over the weekend seems to me to be further evidence of 
that fluidity 
most protestants favor some form of powersharing with 
catholics but the more vehement loyalists see the angloirish 
agreement as a prelude to being drawn into a united and 
catholicdominated ireland 
the protestant parties anger about the agreement has been an 
obstacle to ending sectarian fighting in the province that has left 
2777 people dead 
in an interview with dublins sunday press jim nicholson 
deputy chief of the ulster unionists and party chairman jack allen 
were quoted as saying they were prepared to put everything on the 
table if haughey publicly indicated he would consider a new 
framework to replace the angloirish agreement 
haughey reiterated dublins continuing commitment to the accord 
unless and until it is transcended by a new and more 
comprehensive arrangement but said it had never been regarded as 
immutable 
the start of a new decade reinforces our sense of urgency 
about bringing to an end the violence that the people of northern 
ireland have endured for the past 20 years haughey said 
haughey who has previously issued invitations to unionist 
leaders to meet him for discussions has come under growing 
domestic political pressure to achieve this during his sixmonth 
presidency of the european community 
in belfast peter robinson a leading member of the smaller 
democratic unionist party said his remarks express fine 
sentiments but very little substance 
the irish republic although it has not relinquished its 
longheld claim to the north is in consensus with the british 
government that nothing can change in northern ireland without 
protestant consent

for the fourth time in six 
months argentina has a new central bank president 
enrique folcini was appointed to the post monday following the 
resignation of rodolfo rossi who lasted five weeks 
analysts said rossi was forced out by private banks troubled by 
the governments decision jan 1 to convert several billion dollars 
of shortterm certificates of deposits to 10year bonds in a bid to 
stabilize the economy 
that move curtailed currency speculation that was devaluing the 
austral daily and reduced skyhigh 600percentamonth interest 
rates by abruptly restricting the money supply 
however private banks said their reserves held by the central 
bank were not enough to cover the new bonds and wrangled with 
economy ministry officials to expand use of the bonds something 
rossi opposed 
rossis resignation rumored for days occurred friday when he 
met with economy minister antonio gonzalez a central bank official 
said 
gonzalez officially accepted it monday and named folcini 
successor 
rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own union of the 
democratic center political party when the central bank this month 
printed 1 trillion australs 500 million an amount that almost 
doubled the money supply 
that monetary expansion which rossi had pledged to quell 
almost certainly will fuel inflation that was 40 percent in 
december and is projected at at least that this month 
folcini 53 is an economist and former university professor he 
was director of the central bank from 197681 during the military 
dictatorship and previously served in highlevel posts in the 
economy and treasury ministries 
hes a bankers kind of guy an economic consultant said 
speaking on condition of anonymity his strength is he knows the 
central bank and treasury inside out 
since carlos menem of the peronist party took office last july 
he has sworn in three economy ministers during a time of 
hyperinflation record interest rates and the threat of social 
unrest 
argentinas foreign debt too remains onerous at 62 billion 
the third highest in latin america after brazil and mexico 
menem 59 has pledged to address argentinas chronic economic 
stagnation by curtailing the budget deficit that is seen as a prime 
cause of inflation selling stateowned moneylosing companies and 
attracting foreign investment 
felipe de la balze a banking consultant said rossi was a 
victim like his predecessors javier gonzalez fraga and egidio 
iannella of the general crisis rather than a specific cause 
its like the titanic when its about to go down is it 
relevant the hundred things that happened just before it did de 
la balze said 
i think rossi was swallowed by the crisis he added a 
specific cause is not relevant the financial and economic crisis 
is so big it swallows people every 30 to 60 days

faisal husseini a leading palestinian activist 
and potential peace negotiator with israel was freed from jail 
monday the united states had called his detention an obstacle to 
middle east diplomacy 
in a related matter prime minister yitzhak shamir threatened to 
resign if he loses a vote of confidence in his rightwing likud 
bloc likud leaders will meet next month on motions by hardliners 
that shamirs peace plan be dropped 
attorney general yosef harish ordered an investigation of 
allegations that science minister ezer weizman met illegally with 
high officials of the palestine liberation organization 
shamir made similar accusations three weeks ago and forced 
weizman out of the powerful inner cabinet 
weizman represents the centerleft labor party which is in a 
tenuous national unity coalition with likud he cannot be tried 
unless parliament lifts his legislative immunity 
husseini was freed after three days of questioning about 
suspicions that he belonged to a hostile organization and gave 
other palestinians 450 to buy military uniforms 
husseini 49 lives in arab east jerusalem which israeli has 
annexed no charges were filed but police said the investigation 
would continue 
several dozen israeli militants scuffled with palestinian 
supporters of husseini as he left the jail they shouted death to 
husseini and death to the terrorists 
riot police with clubs pushed reporters away and dragged off 
several jewish militants 
at a news conference in east jerusalem later husseini said he 
was arrested because israel did not want him in a palestinian 
delegation expected to hold preliminary peace talks with israeli 
officials in cairo 
shamir has said he does not want palestinians from east 
jerusalem included because that would undermine israels claim to 
the city 
mr shamir thinks maybe to put faisal husseini in jail so 
he cannot be part of the delegation husseini said the 
israelis know i will continue to work for peace i hope we are 
near the stage of opening peace talks 
it was husseinis first public confirmation that he wants to 
join the palestinian delegation 
the cairo meeting is supposed to deal with shamirs plan for 
elections among the 17 million palestinians in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip for representatives to negotiate limited 
palestinian autonomy 
a central question in peace efforts is whether jerusalem should 
be on the agenda shamir refuses to negotiate its status 
husseini said palestinians were willing to accept jerusalem as 
one city with two capitals west jerusalem for israelis and east 
jerusalem for the palestinians he made the remark in hebrew 
at a meeting of the likud central committee scheduled for feb 
7 hardliners plan to urge shamir to drop the election idea 
on army radio shamir said it is very clear that if the 
central committee doesnt support me i cannot stand at the head of 
likud and not at the head of the country 
economics minister yitzhak modai a prominent likud hardliner 
dimissed shamirs resignation threat saying on radio 
nobody doubts his position as the head of the movement and 
as our prime minister but privileges also entail responsibilities 
and i dont think the central committee would be impressed by this 
dramatic announcement we are talking about the essence and he is 
talking about personal status 
etti eshed spokeswoman for the justice ministry confirmed an 
investigation of weizman had begun but would not give details 
israeli media have said weizman was suspected of meeting with 
plo official nabi ramlawi in geneva in middecember and of having 
telephone conversations with plo figures in tunis 
israel forbids contacts with the plo which it regards as a 
terrorist organization and violators of the law can be imprisoned 
for up to three years 
in the occupied west bank the body of a 35yearold palestinian 
was found in talouza village he apparently was slain on suspicion 
of collaborating with israeli authorities arab reports said 
farhan salahs death raised to 172 the number of people killed 
by other palestinians during the 25monthold uprising most on 
suspicion of collaborating 
israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 648 palestinians and 
43 israelis have died 
soldiers in the gaza strip shot and wounded seven youths aged 12 
to 17 on monday arab hospital officials reported 
reports in the west bank said a 3yearold boy from turah was 
hit in the head by a plastic bullet and was in serious condition in 
ramallah hospital

the navys search for a quieter nuclear 
submarine is causing a ruckus in this port town 
residents are divided over pentagon plans to measure the noise 
of seawolfclass attack submarines in the rich fishing grounds that 
support the towns economy 
on one side are those who support the project as a contribution 
to national defense on the other are those who say it would 
threaten the regions lucrative sport fishing industry and make 
ketchikan a potential target for nuclear attack the opponents also 
complain that the navy has no plan to deal with a nuclear accident 
in the isolated area 
its going to seriously hurt our economy as far as tourism 
sport and commercial fishing industry goes said resident jack 
lee one of the projects most outspoken critics 
lee added that the community also has some very valid concerns 
about safety about our inability to evacuate in light of the 
navys pathetic safety record 
supporters say those are the unfounded fears of a small but 
vocal minority in a town that has long welcomed visiting navy 
vessels with its fishing fleet and touristfilled cruise ships 
the activists are the kind you normally see on these antinuke 
things these bearded longhaired artists said ralph 
bartholomew a member of the ketchikan gateway borough assembly 
theyre the kind that arent producing much in the community 
theyre living off it 
concerns over the project have been raised far beyond the 
mountainous sprucecarpeted islands of southeastern alaska a 
lawsuit to halt the project is pending in federal court in 
washington dc and objections have been heard in the canadian 
parliament 
although the state has not officially approved the project the 
navy began clearing a site for a 127 million facility on tiny 
back island last fall 
beginning next year the navy plans to use a stretch of behm 
canal near back island for tests aimed at making us submarines 
the quietest in the world the site about 25 miles north of 
ketchikan and 688 miles north of seattle is within one of the most 
popular sport fishing grounds in alaska 
king salmon up to 40 pounds and halibut over 100 pounds are 
frequently caught in the sheltered waters of behm canal charter 
and resort operators fear the movement of submarines will scare 
away the fish and the fishermen 
gene romano a navy spokesman in seattle said the sub tests 
would be conducted periodically in one submarines would move 
between underwater microphones in another a bargemounted crane 
would suspend a submarine under water with its engines off while 
onboard equipment is turned on and off to test its contribution to 
the vessels noise level 
the acoustical testing of submarines is a critical factor in 
maintaining superiority in the submarine force romano said 
the navy argues that the task can best be done in the quiet 
islandprotected waters of behm canal a soundtesting range in 
puget sound near tacoma wash has become too noisy to be 
effective officials say 
development of the alaska site coincides with construction of 
the first seawolf submarine by general dynamics corp in groton 
conn its estimated cost is 17 billion 
romano would not say if back island was designed specifically 
with the seawolf in mind the site will be designed to test all 
types of navy submarines he said 
a lawsuit opposing the testing was filed by the foundation on 
economic trends a washington dcbased technology and military 
watchdog group ketchikan groups representing environmentalists 
sport fishermen natives and a wilderness resort joined the lawsuit 
us district judge joyce hens green declined to issue a 
preliminary injunction two months ago but said it appeared the 
navy had violated the national environmental policy act in planning 
the project her ruling on a request for a permanent injunction is 
expected soon 
romano said the navy has modified its plans to meet community 
concerns in response to fishing interests the navy has changed 
its proposed testing times and created a corridor in which fishing 
boats can move at slow speed and not have to wait for the tests 
obviously in todays age its almost impossible to have a 
major construction project thats not going to upset someone he 
said but we feel the majority of the people are in support of 
the project

the government presented a bill to 
parliament monday calling for a sixmonth extension on the may 
deadline for the united states to dismantle its military 
installations in greece 
under terms of a defense accord that expired in december 1988 
the united states has until may 21 to remove personnel and property 
from four major bases and several smaller installations unless a 
new agreement is reached 
the bill would extend to nov 21 the deadline for dismantling 
the bases which were established in the mid1950s 
the bill signed by foreign minister antonis samaras and defense 
minister tzannis tzannetakis is to be debated by a parliamentary 
committee on tuesday it will then be presented to a full 
parliamentary session for debate and a vote 
the conservative and socialist parties that support premier 
xenophon zolotas threeparty administration decided last month to 
grant the sixmonth extension requested by the united states so 
that negotiations on a new defense pact could continue 
the two parties hold 276 seats in the 300member parliament the 
communistled coalition of the left and progress is opposed to the 
bases remaining in greece but has said it will not withdraw from 
the government in the event of a law postponing their removal 
general elections in november were inconclusive and the zolotas 
administration was appointed to deal with pressing economic and 
foreign policy issues 
new elections are slated for april leaving the next government 
to work toward an agreement with the united states 
the previous fiveyear defense and economic cooperation accord 
negotiated by the former socialist government and washington 
expired in december 1988 it gave the united states 17 months to 
dismantle the bases if no new accord was reached 
after 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations athens and washington 
suspended talks before national elections last june a shortlived 
coalition formed by the conservative and communist parties after 
those elections put the issue on hold 
the socialist government headed by former premier andreas 
papandreou had demanded that any new defense accord include 
guarantees of help in case of aggression by nato ally turkey which 
the united states has been wary of providing 
greece and turkey almost went to war in march 1987 over disputed 
territorial waters in the aegean sea

general motors corp will recall 244000 
fourcylinder pontiac fieros every one ever made because of a 
nagging enginefire problem that contributed to the companys 
decision to scuttle the twoseater 
the fiero was an immediate sales success in september 1983 but 
its demise at the end of the 1988 model year came nearly as 
quickly partly after consumer advocate ralph nader alleged engine 
problems led to fires 
general motors hasnt determined when the recall will take 
effect or what kind of repair work will be performed company 
spokesman tom pyden said monday 
weve notified nhtsa the national highway traffic safety 
administration of our intent to conduct a recall pyden said 
he said gm was working on the procedure for a recall and until 
that point it is premature to come out and notify owners and 
dealers 
tim hurd a spokesman for the national highway safety agency 
said monday the agency received a letter dated dec 28 1989 from 
gm saying the company would recall the cars hurd would not say if 
it was unusual that a month pass between the time the agency was 
notified and the time a recall is issued 
it is the second time the fourcylinder fiero has been recalled 
because of possible engine fires pontiac made about 100000 
sixcylinder fieros which will not be subject to the recall 
it is my understanding that the previous fix has not solved 
the problem of fires in fieros hurd said from his washington 
office im sure that gm is working as hard as it can in good 
faith to get this problem solved 
in 1987 gm recalled 125000 fourcylinder versions produced in 
the 1984 model year after engine fires occurred in one of every 400 
cars the company said engine connecting rods which link pistons 
to the crankshaft could blast through the side of the engine 
causing an oil leak which could cause a fire during that recall 
gm made some alterations including boosting oil capacity to four 
quarts from three and urging motorists to check the engine oil 
every time they got gasoline 
word of the recall was published friday in the national highway 
safety agencys monthly defect report gm was caught unaware that 
the notice would be published said spokesman reggie harris 
this is unusual normally we would make our own announcement 
when we have a program in place harris said 
gm began making the fiero at a plant in pontiac in january 1983 
for the 1984 model year the first car was rolled off the assembly 
line in july 1983 with a base price of 7999 
on march 1 1988 pontiac announced that fiero production would 
end with the 1988 model year when 24621 fieros were sold

fruit exports to the united states from 
the central aconcagua valley resumed monday five days after the 
discovery of mediterranean fruit flies in the area prompted a 
regional quarantine 
authorities said the problem is now considered under control 
and no new findings of flies were reported after fruit was 
fumigated and trees were sprayed with pesticide in the valley 50 
miles northeast of the capital santiago 
mondays shipment from the aconcagua valley was the first since 
authorities reported wednesday that at least 12 mediterranean fruit 
flies the first since 1978 were found in a residential 
neighborhood of los andes 
ronald bown president of the fruit exporters association said 
47000 crates of grapes and other fruit from the valley were loaded 
monday in the neighboring port of valparaiso for shipment to the 
united states 
the aconcagua area fruit was fumigated and stored in cold 
chambers in the boat separated from 300000 crates of fruit from 
other regions in the country the lowtemperature storage for 
periods of three to four days is a common procedure to fight the 
fly and its larvae which are harmless to humans 
experts from the united states department of agriculture 
supervised the shipment bown said 
jorge prado president of the national agriculture society an 
organization of chiles largest private farmers said the main 
problem in the aconcagua valley now is the lack of enough 
fumigation capacity and cold storage facilities 
grapes peaches nectarines and kiwis are grown in the aconcagua 
area about 16 million crates are expected to be harvested this 
year in the valley virtually all for export to the united states 
japan and western europe 
last year chiles fruit exporters suffered a major blow when 
two grapes laced with cyanide were found in a chilean shipment in 
philadelphia 
the finding prompted the us food and drug administration to 
temporarily ban the sale of chilean fruit in the united states 
resulting losses were estimated at 300 million 
fruit exports have boomed in recent years earning about 900 
million annually for chile which as latin americas fourth largest 
foreign debt

a tanker that ran aground and spilled 
57600 gallons of gasoline in alaskas inside passage over the 
weekend struck a submerged boulder and leaked fuel in the same 
channel in 1988 officials said monday 
the tanker frank h brown resumed its trip north to skagway with 
a coast guard escort and a relief captain monday less than two 
days after it struck a charted reef in wrangell narrows 15 miles 
south of petersburg 
the tanker hit a boulder in the channel on jan 26 1988 and 
the coast guard fined the ships canadian owner 500 for leaking 
4094 gallons of gasoline said petty officer bud stevenson at the 
coast guards marine safety office in juneau 
the slow leak was not discovered until the tanker docked at 
skagway and the tanks were unloaded said marvin taylor president 
of white pass transportation inc in whitehorse yukon the boulder 
left a 23 inch crack in the tankers hull he said 
the boulder since has been removed by the army corps of 
engineers coast guard spokesman greg robinson said 
saturdays spill remained under investigation by the coast guard 
and white pass blood and urine samples taken from the crew were 
being tested for alcohol and drugs monday in petersburg robinson 
said such tests are conducted routinely after ship accidents 
the 400foot ship ran into burnt island reef on saturday night 
the reef is marked by a lighted buoy coast guard spokesman ed 
moreth said 
the ships captain john kininmont of vancouver british 
columbia told the coast guard that the grounding resulted from a 
judgment error coast guard spokesman ed moreth said 
taylor said he no indication of what went wrong and had not 
talked to kininmont 
mr kininmont has been employed with us about 25 years and 
hes got an unblemished record hes a very fine employee taylor 
said 
the channel where the grounding occurred is one of the more 
difficult in the inside passage he said 
the coast guard said it decided not to clean up the gasoline 
because it dissipated and evaporated quickly state officials said 
the spill caused minimal damage to the marine environment no dead 
fish or birds were found 
it appeared the strong tidal action and the fact that the tide 
was running out into more open waters did the most to protect the 
resources said william bergmann area management biologist in 
petersburg for the state department of fish and game 
after the ship unloads its 18 million gallon cargo of diesel

the justice department has decided not to try 
to prosecute felix bloch the american diplomat suspected of spying 
for the soviet union abc news said monday night 
the department declined to confirm the report 
bloch was the subject of a massive and highly visible fbi 
surveillance last year after it was learned that he had been 
videotaped passing a suitcase to a soviet agent in paris 
bloch had been the no 2 official of the us embassy in vienna 
for much of the reagan administration before taking up an 
assignment in washington 
though he was placed on administrative leave in june he 
continued to draw his 80000 annual salary 
the visible agents were withdrawn in december and there were 
reports at the time that the department had all but given up hope 
of prosecuting bloch on an espionage charge 
what has not been reported is what if any secrets bloch is 
supposed to have given to the soviet union the necessary 
ingredient for an espionage prosecution 
bloch is said to have been wiretapped telling his wife that he 
accepted payments from the soviets but such a wiretap might not be 
admissible in an american court analysts have noted 
david runkel spokesman for the justice department said monday 
night he understood that the investigation of bloch was still 
continuing he also said it is my understanding that no 
decision had been made one way or another on whether to prosecute 
bloch 
bloch was quoted as telling the network he does not know what 
the government is doing with his case the situation hasnt 
changed he said his lawyer john bray declined to comment 
though the state department has not acted against bloch he will 
have to leave in april if he has not won promotion by then as a 
30year veteran he would be entitled to a pension

panamanian president guillermo 
endara making his first foreign trip since taking office during 
the us invasion said monday that he will abolish panamas army 
in the working session we had in the presidential house this 
morning president oscar arias suggested that panama should take 
advantage of the situation to abolish the army i accepted that 
suggestion and will carry it out endara said at a news 
conference 
costa rica which abolished its army after a 40day revolution 
in 1948 is the only latin american country without a national army 
instead of spending money on military manpower and equipment 
costa rica has devoted its resources to education and health care 
the nation has the highest standard of living in central america 
and has no armed conflicts with its neighbors or opposition groups 
endara was formally welcomed monday by arias and the cabinet 
other latin american nations have been less willing to recognize 
endara as head of state because he was sworn in at the start of the 
dec 20 invasion to oust manuel antonio noriega and spent several 
days in safety on a us base 
endara was leading noriegas handpicked candidate by a 31 
margin and expected to win election when noriega abruptly canceled 
the results of last years presidential balloting 
when asked how long the us troops would remain in panama 
endara said that within a few weeks all 14500 troops that were 
sent in during the invasion would depart leaving only the usual 
contingent of about 12000 soldiers at us bases in panama 
endara also met with security minister hernan garron and 
interior minister antonio alvarez to discuss how costa ricas 
police and rural guard operate 
we want to learn the costa rican model with the material and 
explanation they gave us we will try to implement it because this 
model is what the panamanian people want endara told reporters 
after the meeting arias told reporters he suggested that endara 
take advantage of the new situation in panama to abolish the army 
arias who won a nobel peace prize in 1987 for his efforts to end 
central american conflicts made this suggestion in a recent new 
york times oped piece 
endara is scheduled to return to panama on tuesday

gov jim florio proposed massive reform of 
new jersey automobile insurance rates monday vowing to make good 
on a campaign promise to reduce rates that are among the nations 
highest 
our car insurance system is a disgrace he told state 
lawmakers it costs drivers too much its too generous to 
insurance companies its unfair 
new jersey motorists pay an average insurance premium of 1000 
per car florio a democrat who took office last week said his 
plan would save new jerseys 4 million motorists an average 225 in 
1991 
the governors plan includes disbanding a debtridden state 
underwriting pool for high risk drivers the insurance industry 
would pay off 14 billion of the pools 3 billion debt over seven 
years and it would be replaced with a more limited pool for bad 
drivers 
the joint underwriting pool is funded by an annual surcharge of 
225 per car the fee would be eliminated from new jersey insurance 
policies renewed after march 31 1991 under florios plan 
a variety of state fees including those on automobile 
registration would be increased to pay off 16 billion of the 
pools debt 
florio also wants to raise 7 million a year through a 100 
increase in state fees paid by lawyers doctors body shops and 
others involved in auto insurance claims 
robert gaines vice president of the washington dcbased 
american insurance association said it would be illegal to require 
the industry to help pay off the pools deficit without passing the 
cost on to drivers 
florio said after his speech to a joint session of the 
legislature that the state would be on firm legal ground if the 
idea were enacted and challenged in court

a judge on monday rejected allegations 
that investigators broke the law when they staged a second raid on 
a palestinians apartment to hunt for evidence in the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 
scottish police want to compare clothing seized in the raids 
with shreds found in a suitcase believed to have contained the bomb 
which downed flight 103 over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
swedish police working with scottish investigators confiscated 
the clothes in a jan 12 raid on the apartment of mohammed abu 
talb who was sentenced last month to life in prison on separate 
charges related to terrorist bombings in northern europe four years 
ago 
prosecutor ulf forsberg said after the closeddoor hearing in 
uppsala 42 miles north of the capital stockholm that the clothes 
were overlooked when police took 10 plastic bags of clothing from 
abu talbs apartment in late november 
district court judge gunnar graberg ruled the confiscation was 
justified because talb has been named in the flight 103 
investigation said a court source who declined to be identified 
the source said talbs defense lawyer challenged the latest 
seizure in court claiming it was not legally founded because the 
suspicions against talb were not strong enough 
police have said they investigated the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command and are interested in talb 
a member of another radical palestinian faction 
shreds of clothing found in the lockerbie wreckage were traced 
to a store on malta where abu talb visited two months before the 
bombing 
police also seized clothes belonging to abu talb from the homes 
of two other palestinians in december 
abu talb who immigrated to sweden in 1982 previously belonged 
to the damascusbased guerrilla organization palestine struggle 
front 
scottish detectives met abu talb in december but he refused to 
answer questions about his possible involvment in the pan am 
bombing forsberg said the investigators have not tried to question 
him again 
abu talbs lawyer has appealed the conviction stemming from the 
northern european bombings and a retrial starts in the appellate 
court on feb 12

investigators said manuel antonio noriegas 
fortune could total as much as 300 million though a florida 
newspaper said many assets cited dont belong directly to the 
deposed panamanian dictator 
the los angeles times on monday quoted investigators it did not 
name as saying noriegas property and bank accounts could be worth 
up to 300 million 
the miami herald reported in sunday editions that many assets 
cited by investigators actually belong to panamas defense forces 
or are registered to businessmen close to noriega 
all these properties cited by the us government exist but 
were not his said mario rognoni a former commerce minister with 
the noriega regime its like saying that camp david belongs to 
president bush 
a case in point the herald said was a state department 
allegation that noriega owned a boeing 727 jet three lear jets and 
three luxury boats named macho i macho ii and macho iii 
documents found in recent weeks suggest none of the planes and 
boats may be traceable to noriega unidentified officials of the 
usinstalled panamanian government told the herald 
this may make it more difficult for the newly installed 
administration of president guillermo endara to claim possession of 
any noriega holdings 
controllergeneral ruben carles said in a weekend interview the 
government plans to mount a legal effort to win any possessions 
which the los angeles times reported includes a 27million castle 
in the south of france and a sprawling estate in sweden 
panama is hoping to retrieve some of the fortune to help with 
its 5 billion debt to foreign creditors carles warned panama must 
reduce expenditures by about 17 percent to regain confidence of 
lenders 
carles said the government may have to turn over to creditors a 
significant portion of the 400 million in government funds that 
have been held in us banks since being frozen two years ago 
sources told the times that noriegas fortune was built partly 
through a scheme in which panamanian visas were sold for 10000 to 
as many as 18000 cuban and chinese citizens desperate to leave 
their countries 
in addition noriega allegedly made millions in protection 
payments from colombian drug traffickers who used panama to fly 
drugs to the united states 
the times said members of a drug enforcement administration team 
have gathered 20 tons of documents in panama but could not 
disclose any details 
but sources indicated to the times that noriegas holdings are 
scattered throughout europe latin america and the united states

delegates from the liberal republic 
of slovenia walked out of a communist party congress monday after 
being defeated on several key reform issues and the split in the 
party seemed to be irreconcilable 
the congress adjourned without setting a date for reconvening 
after leaders debated for nearly four hours at an emergency session 
on how to handle the crisis 
delegations from the republics of croatia macedonia and 
bosniahercegovina indicated late monday no possibility existed 
that the congress could continue the state tanjug news agency 
reported 
party president milan pancevski told exhausted delegates early 
tuesday that party leaders would keep working toward a solution and 
asked regional party bodies to do the same 
delegates from slovenia believe more autonomy should be granted 
the six republics and two provinces in a nation that was held 
together for decades by the will of president tito who died in 
1980 serbian communists equate the party with the country and say 
it must remain unified 
the congress was due to end tuesday 
the walkout came as delegates were headed for a vote on a reform 
policy document in which the party was to relinquish its 
45yearold guaranteed monopoly on power 
earlier monday the congress cast a preliminary vote on giving 
up its political stranglehold but that vote was on a proposed 
amendment to the draft text and was dependent on the documents 
final adoption 
the slovenians complained hardliners had watered down crucial 
reform points and the final draft did not take into account the 
republics drive for greater independence 
the split came after three days of bitter debate 
croatian party chief ivica racan demanded the congress suspend 
its work otherwise he said croatias delegation would refuse to 
vote on the reform document and other conference papers 
president slobodan milosevic of serbia largest of the six 
republics said suspending work would cause the party to be 
practically disbanded and decapitated 
the congress took a 30minute recess after milosevic finished a 
speech in which he warned of grave consequences for the communist 
party and the future of the country 
he urged the remaining delegates to adopt the reform document 
and choose a new leadership 
milan kucan a leading slovenian communist told journalists the 
breakup of the communist party is the only possible consequence 
of this action 
slovenian party spokesman peter bekes said his party would have 
a regional party conference feb 2 and establish an independent 
party on the basis of democratic socialism 
he predicted two or three parties would emerge from the split in 
the national organization 
ciril ribicic leader of the slovenian party said before the 
walkout the congress failed to accept any of his delegations ideas 
and we are not going to take part in the agony of the communist 
party in yugoslavia 
the document on which we pinned by far the highest hopes 
turned out to be far below expectations and lagging behind reforms 
offered by reformminded leftist parties in socialist east 
european countries 
ribicic said the congress failed to acknowledge the 
independence sovereignty and equality of slovenias communist 
party 
slovenia is the second smallest republic with 2 million 
residents serbia has 9 million people 
slovenia said it would take an ideological course independent of 
the national party ribicic said the regional party had decided to 
seek independence from the national organization 
communists in slovenia proposed the national party become a

theyre shuffling off to tokyo those broadway 
producers looking for angels to bankroll their shows and theyre 
finding them lots of them of the 18 shows that opened in new york 
since september seven were backed by japanese investors whats 
more broadway musicals a decidedly american form of 
entertainment are finding their way to japan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
during the tony awards last june a parade of 
producers bounded to center stage at the luntfontanne theater to 
accept honors for the best play and then best musical of the 
198889 season 
keizo saji head of japans giant liquor company suntory 
international corp made the trip twice 
he shared the spotlight with such veteran broadway power brokers 
as gerald schoenfeld and bernard jacobs of the shubert organization 
and emanuel azenberg who produces neil simons plays in new york 
sajis presence underscored the increasingly heavy japanese 
involvement on broadway suntory through its coproduction of tony 
winners such as jerome robbins broadway and the heidi 
chronicles which also won a pulitzer prize has been the most 
successful and visible company 
but it isnt the only japanese concern to take a chance on the 
broadway lottery among the foreign investors in new york theater 
production have been tv asahi and the tokyo broadcasting system as 
well as haruki kadokawa owner of kadokawa publishing not all of 
their investments were successful some lost money 
win or lose japanese participation in broadway production is 
growing of the 18 shows that opened on broadway between september 
and the end of 1989 seven productions gypsy city of 
angels a few good men the circle tru the secret 
rapture and 3 penny opera had japanese financial backing 
five by suntory 
i think it flows with all of the investments being made out of 
japan by the japanese in real estate and other businesses says 
producer barry weissler whose smash revival of gypsy starring 
tyne daly has money from tokyo broadcasting 
they would also like to be in the entertainment business 
weissler says so they have invested in records film and now 
live theater and our american musical theater is an area they 
cant duplicate in japan since they want to play these pieces in 
japan it serves them to be first in line for a potential 
presentation there 
suntory japans largest privately held corporation is the 
biggest japanese investor currently on broadway through its equal 
partnership agreement with the shubert organization the agreement 
begun in 1988 runs into 1992 each puts up equal amounts of money 
and will share profits or losses equally 
the shuberts have a similar arrangement with capital citiesabc 
the three organizations reportedly put up 15 million each for 
jerome robbins broadway which had a total price tag of 8 
million suntory plans to take the musical with its american cast 
to japan early next year 
the shubertsuntory partnership has its roots in a 1982 tour of 
japan underwritten by suntory by the broadway cast of 
dancin the show a collection of dances created by bob fosse 
was perfect for a foreign audience no knowledge of english was 
required and much of the music such as sing sing sing 
big noise from winnetka and yankee doodle dandy was 
familiar in many places around the world 
we maintained a contact through the years says schoenfeld 
chairman of the shubert organization which owns a major share of 
broadways theaters and has actively produced shows to fill them 
in 1988 when we announced we were doing jerome robbins 
broadway suntory contacted us they were very very impressed 
with robbins and this was before they saw anything or even knew 
what the show was about that led to a series of meetings and out 
of them evolved a longterm relationship 
the agreement gives the shubert organization the right to select 
the shows and there is no limit on the number of productions that 
can be done each year schoenfeld says suntory in turn will 
decide what shows they want to produce in japan depending on what 
they think will be suitable for japanese audiences 
at this time we dont have the knowledge to judge what 
material will be successful or not successful on broadway says 
kenji kishimoto a suntory vice president for marketing and sales 
maybe if there is a next phase to our relationship we will 
in japan suntory with more than 6 billion in annual sales 
has been aggressive in promoting culture and sponsoring sporting 
events 
about 20 years ago mr saji our president and chairman 
pledged that suntory should be a company that enriches our daily 
life kishimoto says its not only selling alcoholic 
beverages but some dream of enjoying your life

suntory which is a major producer of pharmaceuticals as well as 
whiskey and beer built a major concert hall in downtown tokyo as 
well as an art museum for traditional japanese art it holds annual 
tennis and golf tournaments and sponsors a yearly jazz festival in 
the mountain resort of madarao the company even constructed five 
bird sanctuaries at its facilities throughout japan in cooperation 
with the japanese association for the preservation of birds 
suntory will have money in at least one more shubert show this 
season the steppenwolf theater companys adaptation of john 
steinbecks the grapes of wrath its among the more eagerly 
awaited offerings of the year 
american musicals have been performed in japan with japanese 
casts for years audiences have long been familiar with my fair 
lady and west side story a japaneselanguage version of 
cats was a big success so was big river based on mark 
twains the adventures of huckleberry finn the show even used 
the original american star ron richardson who learned japanese 
for his role but sang most of his songs as the runaway slave jim in 
english 
but broadway musicals with american casts were new to japan in 
the early 1980s enormously expensive to produce because the 
company and scenery had to be flown to japan they nevertheless 
were able to generate prestige and enormous publicity if not 
profits for the sponsoring company 
theres a great promotional aspect to presenting shows in 
japan much more than there is here schoenfeld says there is 
a corporate identification with a show in japan audiences will 
identify jerome robbins as the suntory production of jerome 
robbins broadway when it plays there in 1991 
after dancin suntory among others helped take an 
americancast version of duke ellingtons sophisticated ladies 
to japan tv asahi one of japans biggest television networks 
sponsored a weissler production of my one and only starring 
tommy tune and sandy duncan next fall weissler will send topol to 
tokyo and osaka in fiddler on the roof under the aegis of c 
itoh a major shipping conglomerate 
traditional corporate entertainment was always limited to men 
in japan but with broadway shows they could provide dinner and a 
musical for a husband and wife says kenji kitatani a vice 
president for tokyo broadcasting and a professor in 
telecommunications management at indiana university it became a 
new tool for large corporations to entertain clients or potential 
clients it was a new way of marketing 
there is more money available in japan now than ever before 
and all of those elements accelerated the boom of broadway shows in 
japan 
but an investment in the american theater still remains an 
uncertain opportunity no matter who provides the money several 
japanese companies have been burned the musical blues in the 
night done offbroadway in 1988 with financial backing from tv 
asahi closed after a short engagement 
3 penny opera was one of the seasons biggest critical and 
financial flops it dropped an estimated 45 million including an 
investment from haruki kadokawa head of one of japans largest 
publishing companies the secret rapture by david hare lost 
800000 some of it suntory money during its brief twoweek run 
but suntory does have an investment in city of angels the 
cy coleman musical about a private eye in 1940s los angeles it is 
the seasons biggest new musical hit and the likely tony winner in 
june and the original cast recording rights have been won after a 
spirited bidding by cbs records which now happens to be owned by 
another japanese company sony 
kitatani brought tokyo broadcasting into gypsy through his 
association with one of the producers pace international but 
officials of the big japanese television network only committed 
themselves to the show after careful analysis of the property 
the reason they did gypsy was that they believed in it 
kitatani says they researched the track record of the producers 
barry and fran weissler they looked at tyne dalys level of 
acceptance in the united states and then of course they looked at 
the past performance record of gypsy which has been done twice 
before on broadway 
they felt very comfortable betting their money on the show 
you might think that when they are 5000 miles away from broadway 
they dont study those things but they do

miami beach once a popular playground by the 
sea the jewel of the gold coast fell on hard times in the 80s as 
its elderly retirees died off or moved away and tourists found 
other places to take the sun but dont write off this old dowager 
of resort towns just yet shes spruced herself up and the good 
times are beginning to roll again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ten years ago miami beach officials 
tried to block efforts to preserve the citys art deco hotels and 
apartment houses with their decorative architecture so popular in 
the late 1920s and 1930s 
but the preservationists won out and today miami beach is 
enjoying an economic and cultural renaissance tied to the funky 
colorful buildings 
after the miami vice television series introduced much of 
america to the fanciful art deco revival look in 1983 the city 
poured more than 100 million into renovation projects 
but only recently have developers seen profits in neighborhoods 
recovering from decades of neglect 
now south beach the southernmost part of miami beach is in the 
midst of a fullscale building boom on every block apartments and 
hotels are being repainted or restored 
its very exciting says richard hoberman chairman of the 
miami design preservation league this city has come to 
appreciate the benefits of historic preservation 
a fiveyear 56 million plan to expand scenic ocean drive into 
a promenade lined by cafes and nightclubs was completed in time for 
the annual art deco weekend jan 1214 when an estimated 300000 
people jammed the street dancing to swing bands eating ethnic 
foods and buying antiques 
on lincoln road the miami city ballet the new world symphony 
orchestra and a dozen art galleries have taken up residence in 
buildings left vacant when glamorous stores moved out in the 1960s 
and 70s 
the city is cashing in on this cultural reawakening by making it 
easy for moviemakers and fashion magazines to operate in the 
district any weekday a halfdozen film crews can be seen taking 
advantage of the splashy colors palm trees and nearconstant sun 
its a great industry to have its clean attractive and its 
great advertising you cant buy you cant open a major magazine 
nowadays without seeing the beach says jud kurlancheek miami 
beachs city planner 
kurlancheek smiles now but in his 13 years with the city hes 
seen miami beach at its worst 
the resort town so fashionable in the 1950s was all but 
abandoned when its increasingly elderly residents died off or moved 
away and younger people looked beyond florida for their tropical 
vacations 
the decline worsened in 1980 when cuban vagrants and criminals 
from the mariel boatlift flocked to south beach to take advantage 
of depressed rents 
but economic indicators now show miami beach has turned around 
in the past five years resort tax revenues hotel occupancy 
rates vehicle registrations and the numbers of children going to 
public schools have been rising continually says kurlancheek who 
credits art deco restoration work for the upswing 
and in september the city commission approved zoning changes 
that will accommodate an expansion of the citys nowstrict 
preservation laws to protect almost every building south of lincoln 
road as well as the museum district north of lincoln between the 
miami beach convention center and the ocean 
it adds up to more than 1500 hotels apartment buildings 
stores and homes 70 percent of which have art deco flourishes 
the proposed local historic districts which must survive 
several more public hearings before final approval also would 
allow developers to build huge hotels near the convention center 
gut the inside of some lowrise historic hotels and put trendy 
shops and dramatic spaces behind the facades 
city officials call it a fair compromise that will enable miami 
beach to build the 6000 new firstclass hotel rooms it needs to 
win major conventions 
while some hotels successfully cater to the film crews and 
others target europeans who are tired of the crowds on the french 
riviera and eager to take advantage of a sagging us dollar the 
niche of tourists attracted to the smaller bohemian hotels can 
only do so much for the city officials say 
some preservationists disagree 
its a complete sellout to developers said barbara baer 
capitman who founded the miami design firm mdpl in 1976 and is now 
the president of the art deco societies of america we have no 
reason to compromise when were so strong after so much was won at 
such a cost 
mrs capitman led a small group of preservationists that 
overcame the opposition of the city manager and the chamber of 
commerce and got 20 blocks of south beach listed on the national 
register of historic places in 1979 its the only district on the 
register that has 20th century architecture 
she gave her lifes savings as seed money to her son andrew 
who bought seven rundown hotels for 7 million in the early 1980s 
and began rehabilitation efforts 
the carlyle cardozo tides leslie cavalier victor and 
senator were considered among the finest examples of tropical art 
deco architecture but tourists and additional financing were slow 
to arrive and by 1983 a cash crunch forced them to sell everything 
to the philadelphiabased royale group 
royale drew the wrath of preservationists when it demolished the 
senator to make way for a parking lot the development company has 
been mired in legal trouble with its lenders ever since 
despite 283 million secured from a california thrift 
renovation of the landmark hotels is far from complete unpaid 
interest has increased royales debt to 35 million according to 
fca mortgage the thrifts subsidiary a federal judge recently 
cleared the way for the hotels to be auctioned off 
selling the painted ladies of the historic district could be 
a boon to south beach which has been hampered somewhat by 
uncertainty about royales intentions said denis russ executive 
director of the miami beach development corp 
this may unleash the potential for development russ said 
it will be wonderful if they all come back to life

a profession once dominated by men appears about 
to be taken over by women women have overtaken men enrolled in the 
nations veterinary schools over the past few years and if the 
trend continues they are the ones who will be doing the hiring and 
firing in the future 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dr mary beth leininger her face wet 
from the kisses of a white terrier puppy she is about to vaccinate 
remembers when women were highly outnumbered by men in veterinary 
schools 
now the pendulum is swinging the other way just ask the 
reigning miss america debbye turner who soon will join the ranks 
of women like leininger tending to the medical needs of the 
nations animals 
leininger who owns and operates a veterinary hospital in this 
detroit suburb with her husband dr steven leininger is one of 
about 10000 women veterinarians in the nation according to the 
american veterinary medical association 
though leininger has been a veterinarian for more than 20 years 
her 1967 class at purdue university with its seven women was 
typical about 93 percent male it was a time when openings in the 
schools were scarce and not many women enrolled 
the thought was they are taking the place of a man who would 
practice all his life she says that certainly has not been 
borne out all seven women who were in my class are still working 
in the profession 
women now outnumber men in the nations 27 veterinary colleges 
said dr john tasker dean of the college of veterinary medicine at 
michigan state university 
the trend started in 1983 when 501 percent of the applicants 
were women tasker says the next year for the first time the 
entering class had more women than men the percentage of 
firstyear women students has increased every year since reaching 
589 percent in 1988 
of 8751 students enrolled in us colleges of veterinary 
medicine in 1987 55 percent or 4816 were women and 45 percent 
or 3935 were men if the trend continues the profession could 
become one of the first to change from being predominantly male to 
predominantly female 
the number of women now being trained as veterinarians is 
extraordinary says dr dee jacobson a veterinarian in berkeley 
calif and president of the 400member association for women 
veterinarians founded in the 1940s 
the profession is just beginning to acknowledge the tremendous 
shift that has occurred says jacobson a 1967 graduate of 
california state university at davis 
women in the veterinary profession got some added exposure in 
september when debbye turner a senior studying veterinary medicine 
at the university of missouri in columbia was named miss america 
turner who estimates that about half the students in her class 
are women says the salary gap between men and women veterinarians 
also has begun to close 
i didnt pursue veterinary medicine to get rich and anyone 
who does that is a disillusioned person turner says it is a 
profession based on compassion that was my motivation i loved 
animals 
turner says she decided to become a veterinarian after she spent 
a summer shadowing a veterinarian as a 13yearold and she 
says she wont forsake her ambition even for a lucrative modeling 
contract or a job delivering the evening news on tv 
the average starting salary for veterinarians was 22181 a year 
in 1988 according to a survey by j karl wise of schaumburg ill 
wise whose study was published this year in the journal of the 
american veterinary medical association reported that the average 
starting salary is about 29 percent higher than in 1980 but is 
only slightly higher after inflation is figured in 
the average annual salary for veterinarians in private practice 
in 1987 was 52643 with veterinarians specializing in horses 
earning an average of 60653 
jacobson contends stagnant salaries among veterinarians caused 
potential male students to seek other higherpaying biomedical 
jobs bright women students who traditionally are less concerned 
with salary filled the gap 
the size of the applicant pool for veterinary medical college 
decreased 43 percent between 1980 and 1988 and this year its down 
to 179 applicants per position 
getting in is the easiest its been since world war ii says 
billy hooper executive director of the association of american 
veterinary medical colleges 
dr paul dieterlen in napanee ind where he and his partner 
take care of large and small animals has watched the number of 
veterinarians shrink 
the last time he went looking to hire a newly graduated 
veterinarian he wrote to the veterinary medical colleges at iowa 
state ohio state michigan state illinois and purdue the 
response for the 26000ayear job was disappointing he says 
dieterlen says a male purdue graduate eventually filled the 
opening but one of the agreements in the contract was that his 
wife also a veterinarian would get to do some parttime work 
that was fine with him 
they are saving our skin he says if we didnt have the 
women in veterinary medicine wed have half the students we have 
now or wed have lessqualified men they are going to be a major 
force

stiltsville is on its last legs the cluster of 
rustic vacation homes rising out of floridas biscayne bay will 
have to come down by the turn of the century by decree of the 
government for people like thatcher edmunds it will be a paradise 
lost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thatcher edmunds recalls 
back in the early 1960s when the stilt structures dotting the flats 
of biscayne bay were notorious hangouts for gamblers boozers and 
flashy women 
characters such as plucky pierre and his righthand man 
shipwreck kelly ran a joint called the bikini club where a pink 
card gained entry for members any time of day or night 
seamen found their way to the quarterdeck club which was fully 
equipped with a bar table games and for a time slot machines 
ours though was strictly for family says edmunds who 
calls his dwelling on stilts the a house 
sonamed because of its distinctive aframe architecture the 
faded yellow retreat sits in several feet of water along with 13 
other such vacation homes and weekend retreats off the southern 
coast of key biscayne 
pleasure boaters cruising biscayne bay can hardly miss the stilt 
homes that have become a veritable miami landmark 
curious miamians and visitors alike pass through stiltsvilles 
natural deepwater channels en route to the ocean and sometimes 
leave slashes in the sea grasses after dragging their engines on 
the bay bottom in the clear shallow water around the homes 
but even with its reputation considerably mellowed and more 
family oriented stiltsville will no longer exist at the turn of 
the century 
residents leases for quarteracre underwater sites wont be 
renewed after july 1 1999 by decree of the florida cabinet the 
state allowed the bay bottom to be leased through the next decade 
but prohibited new construction after the legislature passed the 
biscayne bay aquatic preserve act in 1974 
we are taking this area which is close to a large urban area 
and returning it to its natural state says lisa garvin 
spokeswoman for the 173000acre biscayne national park 
although some people have called stiltsville an eyesore and 
environmental concerns have been raised edmunds and others say the 
homes should be saved 
maybe theyre jealous because they cant build edmunds 
says we were there long before it was a national park were not 
bothering anyone 
edmunds 61 a retired trucking company supervisor from pembroke 
pines shares the retreat with three other families the 40by 
50foot threebedroom house about six miles offshore from miami 
and a mile from the cape florida lighthouse has stood for 27 
years hurricane donna leveled the original structure 
residents now can rebuild homes damaged during storms only if at 
least 51 percent of the structure remains intact 
it took about a year for the families to build the aframe house 
themselves towing scrap lumber and materials to the site in small 
outboards 
it was almost like homesteading edmunds says 
in 1965 he says ivan tower studios featured the house as the 
base of operations for an underwater coal mining company in the 
move round the world under the sea church groups and boy 
scouts also have borrowed the place for special retreats 
dont expect any luxuries here edmunds says though its the 
best getaway possible still within sight of the miami skyline 
you never run out of things to do relax fish waterski 
dive or watch the boats go by he says 
there is no television no telephone they catch rainwater for 
showers and washing dishes generators provide electricity and the 
breeze off the bay provides the worlds best air conditioning 
edmunds says as he throws open the wooden doors off the combination 
sitting roomkitchendining area 
the bay its water patches of light green and indigo blue used 
to offer some of the best bonefishing anywhere before miamis 
population boomed edmunds says but despite the decline in marine 
life its still easy to catch a panful of fish for supper 
you can cast off the porch any time you want and catch all the 
fish you want edmunds says 
old pictures from family outings cram a large bulletin board 
inside the wooden house many of them showing bloody sharks bigger 
than the young boys who caught them 
over the course of about 60 years residents of stiltsville have 
often helped boaters who became stranded or got caught in a bad 
storm 
through the years i cant imagine how many ive pulled off the 
flats or helped them repair their boats or towed them in edmunds 
says 
residents pay the state department of natural resources 1000 
annually to lease the site when the first structures began shaping 
stiltsville the bay bottom was leased for 1 an acre the 
community peaked after world war ii with some 20 residences 
today some of the structures have fallen into disrepair after 
years of constant exposure to wind and salt spray 
edmunds says its a constant battle to keep up his retreat 
replacing beams painting and making repairs he worries about 
stiltsvilles possible deterioration in the next decade because 
owners may decide its not worth spending the money for repairs if 
theyll have to move or tear down the residences 
if the state remains committed to eliminating stiltsville 
edmunds says itll do more than just take away a slice of paradise 
for owners in the area 
itll take away a lot of pleasure for people who visit he 
says its just the neatest place in the world

boots boots boots marching up and down again 
but dont take them for granted heres a man who makes his living 
making cowboy boots and if you have a thousand bucks hell even 
make one out of ostrich for you 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
his stubby stained fingers caress the dark 
leather as jim pope slowly forms two pieces together gluing here 
and there under his careful hands a cowboy boot begins to take 
shape 
you cant get rich doing this he says i do it because i 
enjoy doing it and the satisfaction of seeing some old boy who 
says he cant get boots to fit slip on a pair ive made and walk 
out of here with a smile on his face 
but not just anyone can afford a visit to popes shop prices 
start at about 400 half up front but as pope says for the 
exotic leathers you better get out your big checkbook 
the customer has a choice of leathers from calf at the low end 
to shark and snake at around 550 fullquill ostrich at about 
1000 and alligator at 1500 to 1600 
i made one pair out of armadillo and another out of 
bullfrog he says i have enough elephant to make one more pair 
of boots and then thats gone 
pope says he demands a 50 percent deposit because i have to 
buy the leather a fullquill ostrich hide costs about 700 and i 
cant afford to just keep it around 
the amount of stitching on the uppers and whether theres any 
inlay also can run up the cost he just delivered a pair of boots 
to a texas banker that has the outline of that state inset in the 
uppers 
i give the customer four rows of stitching pope says if 
they want more its 25 a row 
pope says that besides looking pretty the stitching helps keep 
the uppers standing straight 
it takes about 40 hours to make a pair of boots he says 
it depends on how fancy they are some more some less but it 
averages out to about 40 hours 
ive had them ask me to include a little hidden place for 
money pope says others want a place to carry a gun 
rows of leather are stacked on an overhead shelf and virtually 
every inch of the portable building that serves as office and 
workshop is filled with some sort of shoemaking machine a 
windowstyle air conditioner at the rear fights a standstill battle 
with the humid 90 degreesplus heat 
pope says he is one of only two custom bootmakers still in 
business in oklahoma city 
the young people coming along they dont want to work this 
hard for no more money than they get he says 
pope says he did some work for movie actors who were in the area 
recently making the film homegrown 
i redid some boots for scott glenn the star pope says 
he had those pointytoed boots and i rounded them off 
pope got into the bootmaking business in a roundabout way he 
worked with leather making belts and wallets and repairing 
saddles when he was a ranch hand 
but if anybody had told me then id be making boots today i 
would have said theyre crazy he says 
pope takes about a halfdozen measurements of a customers foot 
and draws an outline on a piece of paper he uses wooden lasts as 
close to the mans size as possible and either builds up with 
leather or shaves the wood off until he has as near a perfect match 
for the foot as is possible the foot part of the boot is formed 
over that 
i dont give a moneyback guarantee but i do guarantee that 
youll have a boot to fit he says 
there was a time when the bootmaking business was almost as 
good as most people think owning an oil well is that was back in 
the early 1980s when everyone believed there was no top to the 
spiraling cost of oil 
you commonly ran 75 to 100 orders behind several months 
worth the 47yearold pope says 
but with the oil bust the flamboyant oilies and the bankers 
who backed them faded away along with the wild parties where beer 
toasts were drunk from the fancy boots 
now he says he makes five or six pairs a month sometimes 
seven 
the bust has hurt all the custommade leather work says 
pope who learned the trade at the oklahoma state technical 
institute leggings saddles all that sort of thing theyre all 
hurting 
but the repair business has stayed pretty good

choosing the right thermal underwear today 
requires some careful study long johns are no longer just long 
johns a variety of synthetic fabrics has largely replaced the 
cotton and wool garments and what you should buy depends on what 
you plan to do 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
long johns just aint what they used to be and 
thats good news for the consumer 
today there is a wide variety of hightech replacements for the 
old scratchy bulky shrunken underwear 
choices range from silk to polypropylene from trademarked 
synthetic fabrics like lifa thermax and capilene to cotton wool 
and synthetic blends 
underwear is a specialized product today vs what it used to 
be says jim jennings product manager for lands end a direct 
mail retailer based in dodgeville wis you really have to 
determine the activity before you buy 
kevin sweeney of patagonia a sportwear manufacturer in ventura 
calif agrees people used to say underwear is underwear but 
then we said why dont we make it perform and then we said why 
dont we make it fun 
sweeney defines fun as thermals in such untraditional colors as 
neon orange with navy trim or emerald with purple trim 
thermal underwear used to be made of 100 percent cotton with a 
small amount made of 100 percent wool says tom armstrong product 
research and testing manager for ll bean in freeport maine 
but an explosion of synthetic fabrics changed that situation for 
the better about 10 years ago he says 
there has been a trend toward more manmade fibers says bob 
blanchard president of national knitwear manufacturers association 
in morristown nj which tracks national wholesale thermal sales 
it is now well over half the market where 10 years ago it 
would have been at least 80 percent all cotton 
cotton alone is useless in a really cold environment says 
armstrong who oversees a textile lab as well as 400 field testers 
around the world its high absorbency is its downfall in 
essence it freezes if you stop in winter 
wool is great the old expeditions to the arctic or the 
himilayas relied on wool but some people find them itchy and they 
dont dry out very well 
what thermal underwear a person chooses today depends on what 
they do and how cold its going to get around them 
for crosscountry skiers lumberjacks and backpackers or 
anyone who will work up a sweat in the cold armstrong recommends 
polypropylene because of its ability to wick moisture away from 
the body keeping wearers warm and dry 
but ice fishers stadium fans vendors and some hunters or 
anyone who spends several hours still in the cold should get 
heavier doubleply cottonwoolsynthetic blended thermals 
armstrong says 
even sports names like nike and patagonia have entered the 
previously unglamorous field 
people who want to wear the same thermals as space shuttle 
astronauts can choose capilene underwear by patagonia in three 
different weights nike also offers three different weights of 
thermals in its all conditions gear line 
but what weight to choose 
if youre standing still in the cold like a ski race judge 
buy expeditionweight sweeney says if youre crosscountry 
skiing buy midweight 
if youre wearing it under your clothes buy lightweight 
those who do a variety of outdoor activities are a retailers 
dream 
if you are both passive and active you cant use just one set 
of underwear jennings says 
in the natural fibers silk is now king chosen for its soft 
light texture 
silk is the topoftheline jennings says people use it 
to sleep in for layering anywhere you dont want to be 
encumbered 
if the bulk and itch of earlier thermals are gone what about 
the tight fit it seems that shrinkage problems may be a thing of 
the past as well 
normal shrinkage is 5 percent to 7 percent armstrong says 
but we build in that size buffer if you put it on right from the 
box it would be a little big our people fit the garment so it fits 
correctly after washing

during the filming of nbcs murder in 
mississippi in georgia tom hulce slipped away to get a feel of 
the reallife locations where three civil rights workers were 
abducted and killed in 1964 
hulce plays mickey schwerner in the twohour movie which nbc 
will televise on monday blair underwood is james chaney and josh 
charles is andrew goodman jennifer grey also stars as schwerners 
wife rita 
schwerner was a social worker who went from new york to join 
chaney goodman and others in a voter registration drive in 
mississippi 
their deaths near philadelphia miss helped change the course 
of the civil rights movement the story tells of the events leading 
up to the murders during the socalled freedom summer the fbi 
investigation of the deaths and its aftermath was told in the 
feature movie mississippi burning 
blair jennifer and i went to meridian where they were based 
in mississippi hulce says they were having a memorial for the 
25th anniversary and it was a wonderful opportunity to see and hear 
a lot of people in the movement i wanted to travel the same roads 
they had traveled the day they died you just have to look around 
and its much easier to climb into the story 
we shot a good portion of the story in territory that still 
has an active ku klux klan we were very lowkey about what we were 
doing but it got a little real sometimes we recreated a riot to 
integrate employment at a department store not all of the crowd 
activities were scripted its amazing how people know what to 
say 
hulce an oscar nominee for his role as wolfgang amadeus mozart 
in amadeus most recently was seen in parenthood he has 
completed a role in the upcoming movie black rainbow and was 
the braindamaged garbage collector in dominick amp eugene 
after doing murder in mississippi he returned to new york 
where he is now starring on broadway in aaron sorkins a few good 
men a courtroom drama about a marine corps murder 
i wore a goatee for the role because people in mississippi 
called mickey the jew with the beard hulce says i think 
they had a specific agenda for his future he was the one they 
wanted the most because he was an outsider chaney was from 
mississippi and goodman didnt come to mississippi until the day he 
was killed 
mickeys singular ability was to make everyone feel 
comfortable with him he was excellent in making people feel good 
about themselves the segregationists felt threatened by his 
presence 
the movie begins when schwerner arrives in mississippi to help 
organize the black voter drive as an outsider he is immediately 
confronted by suspicion and bigotry schwerner and chaney take time 
to forge a good working relationship in the movie but in reality 
they were already good friends 
segregationists usually tend to be portrayed as morons 
hulce says these were intelligent people who believed they are 
right there were people in positions of influence who were willing 
to help them mickey had been threatened a black church they used 
as a headquarters was burned he knew the risks but he believed 
strongly in what he was doing 
hulce grew up in michigan and studied at the north carolina 
school of the arts he made his broadway debut opposite anthony 
perkins in equus he had begun as understudy to peter firth 
who also played the role in the movie version the play was written 
by peter shaffer and when it came time to cast the movie 
adaptation of his play amadeus hulce became a contender and 
was selected over some heavy competition 
in parenthood he plays the son of jason robards hes a 
guy whos in pursuit of the deal he says he has a gambling 
problem im a parent too in the picture i have an illegitimate 
child 
he also appears with jason robards in black rainbow as well 
as rosanna arquette 
i play the hotshot lawyer in a few good men whos assigned 
to defend a marine accused of murder he says it involves a

leigh lawson and dustin hoffman dreamed up the 
idea of spitting on each other during their performance of the 
merchant of venice 
it wasnt shakespeares idea nor the directors 
lawson plays the merchant antonio and hoffman is the 
moneylender shylock in the shakespearean play at broadways 46th 
street theater 
spitting isnt written in the play lawson says 
before the play opened at londons phoenix theater last june 
lawson and hoffman worked on the scene in which antonio borrows 
3000 ducats from shylock and promises to give the jewish 
moneylender a pound of flesh if he doesnt pay the money back 
we were improvising the scene not doing shakespeares words 
just finding the chemistry of the scene lawson says 
thats when the spitting started the director sir peter hall 
bought the idea 
lawson accepted the title role he says because sir peter is 
brilliant with shakespeare this is a very clear production he 
makes the story very clear all of us feel wed like to do more 
shakespeare as a result of this experience 
lawson considers antonio a product of the antisemitism of his 
times in renaissance italy 
but the play is relevant today he says i was talking to 
dustin the night before last he said wasnt it incredible that 
people started to applaud when i spit on you just before i was 
going to cut your heart out its amazing that feelings run so 
strong and heated after 400 years it would surely give old bill 
shakespeare quite a thrill if he could come back and see it 
some find the play antisemitic which surprises lawson 
it has antisemitic people in it he says but it has that 
brilliant hath not a jew eyes speech to me the people that come 
out the most obnoxious are the christians asked to give mercy 
they take all shylocks money and say he has to convert 
two people end up alone at the end shylock and antonio 
theyre the ones motivated by money 
lawson a native of atherstone in warwickshire 20 miles from 
stratford on avon is playing his first major shakespearean role in 
some 15 years its also his american debut he hopes that he and 
his wife twiggy who starred in my one and only here can play 
broadway together they married in 1988 and her billing now is 
twiggy lawson 
lawson is best known to americans in movies as alec 
durberville opposite nastassia kinski in tess and as ronnie 
blum in madame sousatzka with shirley maclaine 
although he can learn pages of shakespeares dialogue in an 
evening lawson hasnt been in a shakespeare company after 
attending the royal academy of dramatic arts he decided not to go 
to the royal shakespeare company where actors start with tiny 
parts and work up 
i decided i couldnt bear to stand around for two years he 
says so he went to a repertory company in coventry where hed do 
larger parts right away i auditioned for franco zeffirellis 
film brother son sister moon the story of st francis of 
assisi he says i had it written in my repertory contract that 
i could be released at a months notice for this film i managed to 
do two seasons before that film got started that gave me a year in 
italy where i completed my education in wine and food and started 
a film career 
lawson also spent two years in leading roles at the national 
theater 
theres a mystical thing that happens between audience and 
actors on the stage he says 
when hes in an audience lawson wants to hear every word 
to listen to actors who think they can give tv performances in 
the theater drives me potty he says the olivier theater at 
the national is a big space to fill its not a case of shouting 
its a case of articulating so your consonants zing to the back of 
the auditorium 
dame edith evans came to speak to us as students she said 
ones voice should be a powder puff shot by a cannon that image 
often comes to mind when im on stage 
when he isnt performing or attending plays lawson says my 
favorite nights are sitting around talking about theater with 
theater people there is usually somebody funny somebody 
intelligent somebody drunk it does throw up an eclectic crowd i 
find it endlessly fascinating 
lawson has a son ace 13 and twiggy has a daughter carly 11 
we share them lawson says they adore each other 
the lawsons met at a dinner given by an actor friend in london 
we were both unattached he says twigs looked gorgeous i 
was a bit shy to ask for her phone number thinking everybody asks 
for her number she says she was a bit miffed that i didnt 
they next saw each other when he went out for a morning paper 
and she was delivering carly to school across the street from his 
flat their courtship was gentle he says going to the theater 
talking about saving the environment and seeing friends 
it was like the fates were bringing us together

for petar dertliev the changes seeping 
through bulgaria have meant a return to battling communists the 
last time he lost 
that was more than 40 years ago when the communists crushed his 
social democratic party and sent him off to a labor camp and prison 
for 10 years 
the communists still hold an upper hand in bulgaria but in one 
respect the tables have turned for dertliev todor zhivkov 
bulgarias longtime communist party leader is under house arrest 
on charges of incitement of ethnic hostility misuse of state 
property and malfeasance in office 
after zhivkovs ouster nov 10 dertliev now 73 wasted no time 
calling a dozen former mates of the dark stalinist days in 
confinement and reactivating his party which the communists 
through an unexplained oversight simply forgot to ban and now was 
still legal 
membership is already 30000 nationwide 10000 in this capital 
and dertliev has a seat at round table talks where 12 opposition 
groups negotiate with the communists for more democracy 
but dertliev like many bulgarians is skeptical that the 
communists really want to relinquish the power they acquired by 
ruthless repression after world war ii 
we should not fall into the illusion that they will collapse 
immediately even though they are demoralized the trim retired 
physician said in an interview the advantages of having real 
power are keeping them on their toes 
unlike their comrades elsewhere in eastern europe bulgarias 
communists appear confident they can hold on to a good share of 
power after free elections which they promise for may but the 
still weak opposition wants held off until november 
petar mladenov the longtime foreign minister who took over as 
president and party chief from zhivkov has not cut a high public 
profile since losing his temper before an angry crowd of opposition 
backers outside parliament in december 
but his no 2 man andrey lukanov is a skilled political 
operator and third generation communist who speaks six foreign 
languages and was born and educated in moscow lukanov who heads 
the communist team at the round table has exuded confidence that 
his party could win a majority in the elections 
dertliev thinks the communists would get 25 percent to 30 
percent of the vote if elections were held now while some western 
diplomats believe they are just as unpopular as those elsewhere in 
eastern europe and would fail miserably at the ballot box 
the communists are trying hard however they have so far 
refused to relinquish their control over newspapers television and 
radio while promising the opposition a daily publication although 
limiting its circulation to onetenth that of their own newspapers 
lukanov has encouraged the formation of liberal almost social 
democratic factions inside the communist party apparently hoping 
these will attract people who might otherwise join dertlievs party 
or another opposition group 
dertliev and other activists say they have found on more than 
one occasion that the wellinformed communists skillfully 
preempted opposition victories by simply making opposition demands 
their own platform 
recalling one case he said we decided in the morning to call 
for the resignations of certain ministers by afternoon he 
added the communist party announced the ministers were fired 
to some outside the party such tactics could indicate the 
divided communists are following rather than directing the drift 
of bulgarias politics at least at this stage 
dertliev notes however that the bulgarian communist party 
which predates even the soviet communist party has strong 
traditions that go back to the last century and was a 
wellorganized underground body during fascist rule in world war ii 
today the communists number about 900000 or 10 percent of the 
total population but they have formally relinquished their 
guaranteed leading role 
the words socialism and communism however still appear 
throughout the bulgarian constitution an intricate 1971 document 
that outlines strict state controls over everything from foreign 
trade to authors copyrights it even gives a minute description 
mandating the appearance of the national emblem 
dertliev thus sees his fight as one of the stillweak the 
social democrats against the stillstrong the communists 
the communists have at their disposal all the machinery he 
said what we have is the good will of the people on our side 
mindful of the repression that wiped out the popular social 
democratic party and one anticommunist faction of the bulgarian 
agrarian union in the 1940s dertliev and other opposition figures 
now seek legal guarantees that oneparty rule will not return 
the repression descended on bulgaria with terrifying force after 
world war ii with party leader georgi dmitrov ruthlessly doing 
away with opponents before his death in 1949 
some of his victims now are being rehabilitated but it remains 
taboo to link the repression directly to dmitrov whose embalmed 
body lies as lenins does in moscow in a mausoleum where the 
communists hold parades on may day and other important days 
in 1946 dertliev was 30 years old and one of the 101 social 
democrats sitting in a 400member parliament 
he recalled the repression 
massive persecution and rigging elections were already under 
way by 194546 he said the terror then continued and 
increased with the arrest of social democrat krastyo pastuhov 
and other party leaders 
pastuhov was sentenced for five years for just two written 
articles dertliev said while in prison he was strangled by a 
cellmate 
sveta ivanov sent to a labor camp for writing just one article 
urging bulgaria not to sever all its ties with the west was 
another who died so did lyudmila slavova who was reported to have 
committed suicide while awaiting trial in 1947 the year other 
leading social democrats were sentenced to terms of 15 12 and 10 
years 
dertliev got 10 years 
my wife was 21 and my baby 4 months dertliev recalled with 
a smile tinged with bitterness when i came back she was already 
in the third class at school 
although the social democratic party was not formally banned 
dertliev says this was because the communists thought they would 
stay in power forever he and others knew it was impossible to 
return to politics 
dertliev worked for eight years in the obscurity of a sanatorium 
for tubercular children in the mountains of central bulgaria 
little by little he made his way back to sofia where he 
maintained quiet contacts with old cellmates 
now brimming with humor and energy he wants to build a 
democratic bulgaria but is sanguine about the chances of outside 
support and internal willingness to restore the nations shattered 
economy and morale 
bulgaria has fewer friends abroad than other east european 
nations he said and it alienated the west through zhivkovs 
campaign to assimilate its ethnic turkish minority 
we have no false hopes that very soon we will be able to 
change everything dertliev said for most people their own 
initiative is dead they wait for somebody to command them

jeanie karklin says she saved 1500 on her 
mothers funeral because a federal rule required the funeral 
director to give her an itemized price list she calls the rule a 
godsend 
the same rule required funeral director timothy simms to hand a 
price list to the parents of a 4yearold boy killed in a car 
accident simms felt it was a tasteless thing to do in the 
emergency room 
six years after it took effect the socalled funeral rule 
is under review by the federal trade commission and consumers and 
the funeral industry are split on whether it should be renewed or 
repealed the review began in may 1988 and ftc staff 
recommendations are expected this spring 
consumer groups want the rul strengthened arguing it gives 
people important information to help them make one of the biggest 
purchases of their lives at a time of stress and bereavement it 
costs next to nothing provides a great deal of consumer 
information and may have led to prices going down said lee 
norrgard of the american association of retired persons which has 
led the fight to retain and expand the rule 
the nations largest association of funeral directors 
meanwhile says the rule unnecessarily regulates daytoday 
business practices increases costs and hinders funeral directors 
ability to serve grieving customers sensitively 
the rule has placed an undeserved and unwarranted stigma on 
the nations funeral directors as unscrupulous and deceptive 
businessmen the national funeral directors association told the 
ftc calling for repeal 
the rule took effect in 1984 after more than a decade of debate 
and investigation into funeral practices and after the nfda sued 
unsuccessfully to block it but after living with it for more than 
five years some funeral directors and smaller trade groups are 
amenable to retaining it 
our memberships living with it very well said connie ryan 
president of the wisconsin funeral directors association and 
director of ryan funeral home in madison we havent had any 
difficulties 
the rule requires funeral directors to give customers an 
itemized price list at the start of discussions an itemized final 
statement of costs and to give price information over the phone if 
asked it also lets consumers purchase only what they want rather 
than packages that may include unnecessary extras and prohibits 
funeral directors from misrepresenting state requirements for 
caskets for cremation or the embalming of corpses 
americans each year arrange more than 2 million funerals with 
costs averaging 3000 before burial fees a funeral may be the 
third most expensive consumer purchase after a home and a car 
according to the ftc 
mrs karklin of houston said the price list she got as she 
arranged her mothers funeral in granby mo in 1986 helped her 
insist on reasonably priced items when the funeral director kept 
saying her dear departed loved one deserved more 
even though i knew beforehand what my rights were and i knew 
my mother had always been a strong and thrifty woman who never 
approved of excess of expense i felt more and more battered down 
by what he was saying i said to him thank god for your price 
list he didnt look very happy 
when people are aware of their rights under the rule they are 
able to be more selective in their funeral purchases even if they 
decide to spend as much money as they would otherwise said 
clifford brownstein executive director of the continental 
association of funeral and memorial societies 
the association which represents 150 memorial societies 
nationwide that help people get information and make plans is 
calling for better enforcement of the rule and its expansion to 
businesses such as cemeteries and crematories 
for people who are aware of it it has made them more 
knowledgeable consumers brownstein said but most people have 
never heard of it if you dont know its there how can you take 
advantage of it 
a 1988 study by the ftcs bureau of economics found that while 
most people got a price list at some point only about a third of 
funeral directors gave a price list and final cost statement in the 
required timely manner and did not make misrepresentations it 
found that average funeral spending rose 9 percent between 1981 and 
1987 after adjusting for inflation and concluded that while the 
rule did not necessarily cause the increase the data strongly 
suggests that the rule did not contribute to a reduction in funeral 
expenditures 
aarps norrgard questioned the ftcs analysis and said there is 
evidence prices may have gone down after adjusting for inflation 
in addition he said studies show that consumers who get price 
lists early tend to spend less even though they may not compare 
prices between funeral homes 
mary ponder of the national consumers league said the benefits 
have been limited because there is little to no enforcement by 
the ftc 
robert hardin executive director of the nfda said the price 
disclosure requirements have hindered funeral directors done 
nothing to benefit consumers and contribute to higher prices by 
adding paperwork and training demands 
the ftcs own study disproved its theory that consumers would 
spend less and shop around more with the rule he said adding that 
most people select a funeral home because they had a personal 
experience with the home or because of its reputation not based on 
price 
the whole concept of the ftc back in 1984 was to try to change 
the social mores of this country and to try to convince the 
consumer that theyre shopping for a car when theyre shopping for 
a funeral hardin said its not a consumer product its a 
very professional consumer service 
simms who owns the wilbur christensen funeral home in rockford 
ill said compliance with the rule has kept him from handling 
difficult cases such as the 1985 death of the 4yearold boy as 
sensitively as he would like 
to immediately hand someone a price list really becomes very 
awkward the funeral rule lacks the discretion of a judgment call 
by a professional 
aarp is pushing to extend the rule to cemeteries and to expand 
regulation of the booming preneed business in which people 
buy in advance to finance funeral or cemetery goods and services 
some prepaid contracts often sold by telephone direct mail and 
doortodoor arent covered by the funeral rule 
minimum standards would ensure that consumers know what 
contracts cover how the death benefits increase over time how 
secure the investments are and whether contracts can be canceled or 
transferred if people move norrgard said 
at an ftc hearing last year william jones of lucerne calif 
testified that prepaid plans should be better regulated to keep 
unscrupulous businesses from preying on the elderly jones said his 
87yearold mother was despondent and in early stages of senility 
when a salesman visited her home in winnemucca nev and persuaded 
her to pay 3105 over two years for a prepaid funeral 
the ftc has shown little inclination to get involved in 
additional regulation of preneed contracts but norrgard expressed 
hope these sales might be the subject of a separate rulemaking 
procedure later 
the ftc originally faced a november 1989 deadline for a decision 
on its review of the funeral rule but rescinded that because of the 
thousands of pages of comments reports exhibits and 
recommendations that have been submitted

here are major requirements of the rule 
enacted in 1984 by the federal trade commission help consumers

telephone disclosures when consumers call to ask about terms 
conditions or prices the funeral home must state that price 
information is available over the telephone and reasonably answer 
questions 
general price list if consumers ask in person about 
arrangements the home must provide a general price list that 
people can keep and that contains the cost of each funeral item and 
service offered 
embalming information homes must give consumers information 
about embalming to help them decide whether to buy the service and 
must disclose in writing that except in certain cases embalming 
is not required by law 
cash advance sales funeral homes must disclose in writing if 
they charge a service fee for buying cash advance items on the 
consumers behalf such as flowers obituary notices pallbearers 
and clergy honoraria 
caskets for cremation funeral directors who offer direct 
cremation without a ceremony may not state that a casket is 
required and must disclose in writing that consumers have a right 
to buy an unfinished wood box or an alternative container for 
direct cremation 
required purchase consumers do not have to buy unwanted goods 
or services as a condition to obtain those they do want unless 
required to do so by state law 
itemized statement funeral directors must give consumers an 
itemized statement listing the costs of goods and services selected 
preservative claims funeral directors may not tell consumers a 
particular funeral item or service can indefinitely preserve a body 
in the grave they also may not state that certain items such as 
caskets or vaults will keep out water dirt or other gravesite 
substances when that is not true

kent newland a cactus expert grows them mainly 
to enjoy the spectacular flowers and says hes sure that amateurs 
even city apartmentdwellers can do the same by following a few 
simple basics 
they are glorious things to see blooming just gorgeous the 
flowers may not live for more than a day or two but while they 
last theres nothing quite like it newland says and if you 
have enough of them they bloom so often you can have some in 
flower every day of the year 
he has no quarrel with folks who grow cactuses only for their 
unique shapes but says many dont realize flowers are possible 
within a year or so even on the small inexpensive ones sold at 
botanical gardens and nurseries 
newland who cant remember when i havent been in love with 
cactuses spent 14 years with the boyce thompson southwestern 
arboretum in superior and now is water resources specialist for 
phoenixs xeriscape programs 
for home growers he says success with cactus begins with 
selecting the proper types globular kinds as opposed say to 
columnar ones like saguaros or cereus or types like the prickly 
pears which need a lot of light 
better choices are mammillarias pincushions and similar 
types they need good light but not high amounts so theyll adapt 
grow and flower in a southfacing window while the large ones at 
best will exist 
indoors most people will be happiest with cactus that flourish 
in no larger than a 6 to 8inch pot such as hardbodied 
mammillarias like the oldlady cactus mammillaria hahniana or the 
mother of hundreds m cupressa 
after plant selection the trick to growing cactuses is good 
drainage i think more cactus are lost from underwatering than 
overwatering to encourage root systems you need to keep them 
fairly damp not soaking wet of course 
plants dont look very healthy if they havent been watered 
for six months because the root systems die newland says 
so how do you know when to water id put a finger on the soil 
and if it feels moist its probably all right water when it feels 
bone dry when a plant is starting to grow throwing out new spines 
or stems thats the time to encourage it with water and fertilizer 
to initiate flowers 
during such growing periods newland includes an allpurpose 
fertilizer every other watering applying about an eighth to a 
fourth of the recommended dosage to ensure good even amounts of 
growth for flower production while he doesnt use slowrelease 
fertilizers they would be fine in moderation 
growing medium is extremely important he says the big 
thing is to stay away from pureorganic potting soils even if the 
bag is labeled cactus mix theyre very hard to wet up and very 
hard to dry out however if you amend that potting soil with some 
sharp masonry sand and some perlite the plant should grow well 
but first make sure the water drains through the mixture id 
fill a test pot to an inch or so of the top with the mix without 
a plant tamp the mix as usual and fill it with water if you dont 
get water coming out of the drain hole within one or two minutes a 
cactus will slowly dry up and die in it so add more sand and try 
the new batch until it drains right 
a good starting point is about half organic matter 40 percent 
sand and 10 percent perlite blended well 
newland repots each new cactus discarding the former growing 
medium that way i know the soil mix is identical for all my 
cactuses and if there are some hidden insects i get rid of them 
before transplanting he also loosens the root ball to encourage 
the root system to expand 
pot size also is important you dont want to put a 2inch 
cactus in a 6inch pot put it in a 3inch or maybe a 4inch 
moving it along as it grows 
mealybugs have been known to ruin cactus collections almost 
overnight newland will use malathion or diazinon soil drench if 
necessary but believes the best way to avoid pests is to grow 
healthy plants like a human being if youre healthy youre less 
prone to disease

patients in the early stages of alzheimers 
disease suffer damage to a specific type of eye cell explaining 
why they often bump into things and have trouble reading despite 
2020 vision researchers say 
the incurable progressive brain disorder which causes 
premature dementia or senility doesnt substantially affect optic 
cells called p cells that are responsible for visual acuity but 
it causes degeneration of m cells essential for people to orient 
themselves in space according to the study published in the 
january issue of the journal ophthalmology 
just as charts of letters test visual acuity produced by p 
cells dr alfredo sadun said his team at the university of 
southern california developed a test to check the performance of m 
cells sadun said it might be used to help diagnose early stages of 
alzheimers disease which is estimated to afflict 8 percent of the 
us population over age 65 
optic nerves from 10 deceased alzheimers patients and the 
cadavers of 10 people without the disease were examined by sadun 
an associate professor of ophthalmology and neurological surgery 
retinal tissue from three alzheimers patients and two normal 
cadavers also were examined and 15 alzheimers patients with no 
known eye disease were given complete exams of the eyes and related 
parts of the nervous system 
the postmortems found optic nerve degeneration in eight of the 
10 alzheimers patients and none of the control cadavers the 
degeneration was mainly of m cells and related fibers 
the loss of m cells is consistent with the symptoms sadun found 
among living alzheimers patients difficulty in reading and 
spatial orientation despite an ability to see very small objects 
and colors and difficulty in detecting movements of objects and 
differences in shades

baby boomers should help solve problems in 
health care before they reach retirement aarp president louise d

million people in the united states 50 or older that group will 
increase to 76 million by the end of the century and to 113 million

whittle communications which has been 
considering making commerciallysponsored television programs for 
doctors waiting rooms said it has acquired a company that was 
about to launch such a service 
the knoxville tennbased media company said sunday it had 
acquired healthcare television network inc a privatelyheld 
company based in tampa fla healthcare had signed up about 3500 
pediatricians offices and a dozen advertisers for a television 
service terms of the deal were not disclosed 
the acquisition increases chances that whittle will move ahead 
quickly in developing a closedcircuit tv system of its own giving 
advertisers another way to reach a captive audience 
whittle already has magazines and sponsored posters in about 
60000 health care offices and disclosed in november it was 
considering developing tv programs for waiting rooms 
we see the purchase of htn as a real opportunity to quickly 
expand our waitingroom television project said alan greenberg 
whittle vice chairman 
phil cohen the 41yearold chief executive and founder of 
healthcare television said in a telephone interview he has been 
developing the service for about 2 years and was within a few 
weeks of launching it 
he said his company had ordered 3500 television sets and 
videocassette recorders that were to be distributed to 
participating waiting rooms he said the first onehour program 
which included several short segments on topics ranging from sleep 
disturbance to child care safety was ready 
the plan is to have the tapes played continuously in waiting 
rooms on television sets handsomely displayed in custommade 
cabinets 
the programming would be changed every three months advertisers 
including consumer products giants such as procter amp gamble 
bristolmyers squibb co and mattell inc had signed up cohen said 
we were terribly impressed with what they had accomplished to 
date greenberg said in a separate telephone interview he noted 
that whittle does not buy other companies often preferring instead 
to develop its own media properties 
greenberg said he is studying how to incorporate healthcare 
television into whittles operations one possibility is to operate 
healthcare television as a separate subsidiary whittle also could 
accelerate plans for its own system and merge it with healthcare 
one difference between the two systems is that whittle was 
planning to distribute its programs by satellite whittle also had 
planned to change the programming more frequently possibly every 
week 
whittle also was undecided whether its programs would be 
healthoriented or pure entertainment while healthcares shows 
were to be healthbased 
in any case whittle said the service it dubbed waiting room tv 
potentially could wind up in 100000 doctors waiting rooms 
nationwide 
whittles only other tv project to date is the channel one news 
service for use in the classroom scheduled for launch in march in 
1000 schools across the country channel one has been barred from 
public schools in new york and california and has attracted heated 
opposition from some education groupos because each 12minute daily 
news show would include commercials 
cohen who declined to discuss how much he was paid for 
healthcare television or his future plans said whittle has the 
experience and manpower to expand his companys service more 
rapidly 
i know they can take what we started and just multiply it 
exponentially he said 
cohen said he had several partners in the company including 
grey advertising a new yorkbased ad agency that had invested in 
the company last spring whittle acquired complete control of the 
company in the deal

chinas chief economic planner said monday that his 
country has achieved social and economic stability in the past few 
months to ensure progress in its economic reforms 
but zou jiahua head of chinas state planning commission 
acknowledged that china faces considerable economic headaches 
the population of china is large and the issues the chinese 
people face are serious and tough we need a stable and united 
government and a stable environment to carry through construction 
of socialism zou said in a speech to the japan association for 
the promotion of international trade the sponsor of his visit 
since the turmoil of last year we have been effective in 
stabilizing our countrys society government and economy he 
said 
zou who arrived in japan last week is the first highlevel 
chinese official to visit since the bloody crackdown on political 
dissent last june 
japan banned highlevel contacts with china until earlier this 
month to protest the violence in beijing which left hundreds of 
unarmed protesters dead 
zou a member of the state council or cabinet said chinas 
lifting of martial law in beijing jan 11 was evidence of stability 
the move was widely seen overseas as a gesture aimed at bringing 
foreign investors back to china and inducing western governments to 
drop sanctions imposed after the june crackdown 
zou has met with several leading politicians including former 
prime minister noboru takeshita who pledged a package of 56 
billion in loans on a visit to china in 1988 
japanese news reports said takeshita accepted an invitation from 
zou to visit china soon 
japan froze discussions on the loans after last junes 
bloodshed it urged china to ease its hardline stance toward 
dissent and after martial law was lifted a team of japanese 
officials went to china to reopen negotiations on the loans 
chinas economy has been plagued in recent years by 
overproduction of some items scarcities of many resources 
widespread construction of unnecessary or unaffordable buildings 
and facilities and soaring inflation 
we have a few economic problems at the moment but they are 
problems that go along with progress and we will overcome them 
zou said if you look at the overheated tempo of industrial 
growth over a few years it has come down to a more reasonable 
level 
nationwide industrial production was up 68 percent last year 
and agricultural output was up 4 percent he said

becoming increasingly popular among the longtime unemployed as part 
of a trend to create barriers for alltooprying government eyes a 
recent study shows 
in unemploymentprone districts in the netherlands biggest 
cities up to 45 percent of those out of a job for more than two 
years have an unlisted number according to godfried engbersen a

the national unlisted average in this country of 146 million is 
10 percent of 65 million telephones according to fred lemmerink

opting for an unlisted number is an act of defiance of 
escaping from the ubiquitous eye of the government engbersen 
said in a monday interview 
people got the feeling that when they are on the dole for a 
long period of time their lives are being intolerably intruded by 
the social security services

the government today filed preliminary 
charges against a swedish arms manufacturer accusing the company 
of paying 50 million in kickbacks to seal a 1986 arms deal 
investigators said former indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
would be among those questioned 
gandhi has said repeatedly that he did not gain personally from 
the deal and that no indians received kickbacks or commissions in 
the contract with the company ab bofors 
bofors spokesman johnny ericsson said in stockholm sweden that 
the company would have no comment 
rajendra shekhar director of the central bureau of 
investigation told reporters the preliminary charges would form 
the launching pad for an investigation 
the charges identify three people as the accused in the 
case gopichand hinduja a londonbased indian industrialist 
martin ardbo who was president of bofors when the deal was signed 
and win chadha the bofors agent in new delhi 
shekhar said several others including top indian officials 
also were involved but he refused to identify them 
the legal action was the first step by new prime minister vp 
singh toward fulfilling his election campaign promise to root out 
corruption which he said flourished under gandhi 
gandhis government signed the 1986 contract with bofors and 
agreed to pay 14 billion for 410 155mm howitzers but the 
following year charges surfaced in swedish and indian news media of 
kickbacks in the deal 
shekhar said at least 50 million was paid through swiss banks 
to clinch the sale 
newspaper reports have claimed that much of the money was paid 
to intermediaries including people close to gandhi and in the 
ruling circles of his congress party 
the corruption charges dogged gandhi through the rest of his 
tenure giving singh a powerful weapon in last novembers national 
election 
although gandhi outpolled singh in the balloting he could not 
muster a majority of seats in parliament and singh formed a 
minority government with support from other parties 
the preliminary charges filed before a district judge in new 
delhi listed these alleged offenses criminal conspiracy cheating 
and dishonestly inducing delivery of property forgery forgery for 
the purpose of cheating criminal breach of trust and abuse of 
official position by public servants 
the charges carry penalties that include unspecified fines and 
prison terms

an oregon couple seeking to hold onto a farm 
in their family since 1853 today lost a supreme court challenge to 
a banks foreclosure 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the federal 
law myron and jane harper relied on in their legal fight gives only 
the government not farmers the right to sue 
a federal appeals court ruling in the harpers case set binding 
law in nine western states and involves an farmloan program 
totaling over 50 billion nationwide 
the harpers raise hogs corn and small grains on their farm in 
oregons willamette valley 
in 1984 the harpers were unable to make all their loan payments 
on the farm the federal land bank of spokane now the farm credit 
bank of spokane moved to foreclose on the farm in january 1987 and 
a foreclosure sale was scheduled for nov 17 of that year 
the harpers staved off the sale by seeking bankruptcy law 
protection on nov 13 but their bankruptcy petition was dismissed 
in february 1988 and a sheriffs sale of the farm was held march 
18 1988 
in the interim the agricultural credit act of 1987 had been 
signed into law by thenpresident ronald reagan 
the act a major rehauling of the federally created farm credit 
service requires lenders of distressed loans to let borrowers 
know before any foreclosure can take place that their loans may 
be suitable for restructuring 
farm credit system lenders extend about 30 percent of all farms 
loans nationwide that percentage totals over 50 billion 
the harpers sued in federal court in april 1988 seeking to 
postpone final conveyance of their farmland to those who bought it 
at the foreclosure sale 
us district judge owen panner barred the harpers eviction 
from their farm ruling that the federal land bank of spokane had 
a duty under the 1987 law to weigh the costs of foreclosure 
against the costs of restructuring 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals threw out the judges 
injunction last june 24 ruling that the 1987 law does not give 
individual farmers the right to sue lenders who allegedly violate 
it 
in writing the law congress did not say explicitly whether such 
lawsuits were permissible and the appeals court said we hold 
there is no implied private right of action 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the harpers said the 
san franciscobased 9th circuit courts ruling is at odds with a 
ruling last oct 5 by the st louisbased 8th us circuit court of 
appeals 
but lawyers for the federal land bank of spokane noted that the 
8th circuit panels decision has been set aside pending review by 
that entire appeals court 
the case is harper vs federal land bank of spokane 89863

central soya co is taking advantage of 
recent political reforms in eastern europe to pursue projects in 
yugoslavia and the soviet republic of estonia a spokesman said 
monday 
central soya also formed a joint venture earlier this month with 
a hungarian feed manufacturer in a deal that evolved from a 
technical services contract signed 20 years ago 
the fort waynebased agribusiness company will be a minority 
partner in agrkomplexcentral soya feed producer and distributor 
corp agard hungarys stateowned agribusiness will be the 
majority partner and several other hungarian companies also will be 
partners in the venture to produce feed for poultry and livestock 
in this particular venture political reforms would have had 
a fairly minimal impact however some of the other projects in 
eastern europe these developments should be accelerated said 
central soya spokesman barry g collingsworth 
last spring the company formed a venture with the polish 
cooperative osnowo to manufacture animal feed concentrates and 
market livestock the venture is called central soyarolpol ltd 
collingsworth said 
still in development are a possible technical service contract 
in estonia and a soy protein venture in yugoslavia 
were committed to eastern europe as a primary growth area 
said david h swanson central soyas president and chief executive 
officer and we believe that our longstanding business 
relationships form the basis for that growth 
weve sown the seeds by offering expert technology and quality 
products and that dedication continues to be mutually 
beneficial swanson said 
central soya a subsidiary of the italys ferruzzi 
agroindustrial group has sold feed technology mixes and 
concentrates since 1969 to agrokomplex the company said swanson 
and other executives traveled to hungary earlier this month for a 
celebration marking the 20th anniversary of that deal 
agrokomplex holds the second largest single share of the aimal 
feed market in hungary swanson said the manufacturing 
capabilities and market presence of the hungarian entity coupled 
with the technology of central soya should lay a foundation for 
the growth and propserity of this new firm 
jeno vancsa former hungarian minister of agriculture and food 
is chairman of the new venture located near the town of agard it 
will employ about 450 people in producing and marketing premixes 
complete feeds and milk replacers to more than 400 partners or 
business associates throughout hungary soya said 
soya markets products to customers in more than 60 countries 
its major businesses include feed manufacturing soybean 
processing grain merchandising vegetable oil refining and the 
manufacture of soy proteins and lecithins it operates more than 65 
plants and facilities worldwide

the supreme court agreed on monday to resolve 
a procedural dispute over denied social security disability 
benefits 
the court said it will review the case of a new jersey widow 
whose 1983 application for disability benefits was denied by the 
department of health and human services 
but the courts decision expected by july will not determine 
whether marilyn finkelstein 59 is entitled to the benefits 
instead the justices will decide whether a federal trial 
judges order that hhs officials reconsider her application may be 
appealed by hhs to a federal appeals court before any such 
reconsideration 
mrs finkelstein sued and a federal judge in newark ruled that 
hhs had used the wrong standard in determining her eligibility for 
disability benefits 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals dismissed the governments 
ensuing appeal saying the trial judges order was not a final 
decision that could be appealed immediately 
the government then filed the appeal acted on today 
the case is sullivan vs finkelstein 89504

fiscal quarter resulted from higher fuel prices and lower income 
per mile from fares during the period

thanksgiving and christmas usually two of the busiest times for 
the airline also contributed to the decrease

a share during the same period a year earlier earnings were 852 
million or 173 a share

bad weather and a seasonal decline in drilling 
activity sent the number of working us oil and gas rigs tumbling 
by 55 this week baker hughes inc reported monday 
the rig count totaled 964 compared to 1019 a week ago but the 
tally was higher than the 789 total posted this time last year 
texas and oklahoma were the big losers this week accounting for 
more than half of the decline texas lost 23 rigs while oklahomas 
rig count fell by 12 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
ike kerridge a baker hughes vice president and economist said 
he expected the decline and he added it will continue 
this is the time of year when drilling declines kerridge 
said adding that the rig count usually drops by up to 20 percent 
during the first quarter of each year 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
the rig count peaked at 4500 in december 1981 the height of 
the oil boom but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 42gallon 
barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the rig count 
that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began compiling 
figures 
among other major oil producing states colorado lost five rigs 
wyoming lost four and pennsylvania was down by one north dakota 
new mexico michigan and kansas each lost two rigs louisiana

share a year earlier sales totaled 164 billion up from 154 
billion in 1988s fourth quarter 
for 1989 american home products earned 11 billion or 707 a 
share compared to 995 million or 643 a share in 1988 last

the supreme court on monday asked the bush 
administration for its view on whether stockbrokers may be forced 
to give investors the option of suing rather than resolving fraud 
disputes in arbitration 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
about a ruling that barred massachusetts from requiring brokers to 
make arbitration clauses optional not mandatory in brokerage 
contracts 
the justices are not expected to take any action in the 
massachusetts case until hearing from the government lawyers which 
could take months 
the massachusetts appeal is supported by 30 other states whose 
officials said a federal appeals court ruling leaves them 
powerless to protect consumers from being coerced to enter 
arbitration agreements 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
aug 31 that the massachusetts regulations are preempted by 
federal law 
the prevailing practice in the brokerage industry is to require 
customers to agree to arbitrate all disputes as a condition to 
opening an account 
in other businessrelated rulings monday the court 
agreed to decide whether nuclear industry whistleblowers 
who say they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may 
sue under state personalinjury laws the justices will review a 
north carolina case in which a federal appeals court said such 
workers must sue under a special federal law 
ruled against an oregon couple that challenged a banks 
foreclosure on a farm in their family since 1853 the court let 
stand a ruling that the federal law myron and jane harper relied on 
in their legal fight gives only the government not farmers the 
right to sue 
refused to require arbitration for hundreds of thousands of 
federal workers when they are fired demoted or otherwise 
disciplined the court rejected appeals by a labor union and the 
federal labor relations authority seeking broader job protection 
for federal employees 
refused to let public employee labor unions get from the 
government the home addresses of federal workers leaving intact a 
ruling that the workers privacy would be violated if government 
agencies are forced to divulge the information to the unions 
scuttled a federal lawsuit stemming from the collapse of the 
old court savings amp loan association in maryland saying state 
courts may handle suits based on a federal antiracketeering law 
the justices said lower federal courts rightly dismissed the suit 
because similar ones were being handled by state courts in maryland 
on mandatory arbitration clauses the justices in 1987 ruled 54 
that if such clauses are in the contracts signed by investors 
disputes over alleged fraud are to be resolved in arbitration not 
in lawsuits 
massachusetts secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations 
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements 
nonnegotiable conditions for opening accounts the regulations 
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of 
mandatory arbitration clauses 
the states action immediately was challenged by the securities 
industry association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it 
a federal judge ruled for the brokers and the appeals court 
upheld that ruling 
the long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a 
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous 
proarbitration mandate of the federal arbitration act in the 
securities field the appeals court said 
in the states appeal massachusetts attorney general james m 
shannon said the august ruling has national implications for 
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking 
health care the automobile and many other industries 
shannon said the federal arbitration act does not preempt all 
state regulation of arbitration 
lawyers for the securities industry urged the justices to reject 
the states appeal

sen alan cranston said monday he would 
introduce legislation to allow investors to sue the government if 
they fail in other efforts to recover losses from worthless junk 
bonds sold at lincoln savings amp loan association 
the california democrat facing his most serious political 
crisis because of his involvement with lincoln continued an attack 
that began last week blaming a former banking regulator for 
investors losses 
cranston said his legislation to be introduced this week would 
allow bond holders to file suit against the us government if they 
are unsuccessful in suits against lincoln parent american 
continental corp and company chief charles h keating jr 
the government is usually immune from such suits but cranston 
said there were precedents allowing lawsuits in cases of government 
negligence 
documents i have received from the office of thrift 
supervision in washington and the general accounting office are 
clearly enough evidence on which to bring a case of negligence 
against the government cranston said 
cranston spoke at the latest in a series of news conferences 
intended to deflect blame that had been aimed at him for investor 
losses stemming from the failure of the irvinebased lincoln 
cranston the senate majority whip is one five senators under 
investigation by the senate ethics committee for intervening with 
regulators on behalf of lincoln american continental of phoenix 
and keating keating and his family contributed 13 million to the 
senators and their causes 
three recent polls show cranstons popularity with california 
voters has plunged to its lowest level since he came to the senate 
in 1969 but he has promised to seek reelection next year 
nonetheless 
by focusing on the bondholders he hopes to disarm one of the 
most personally damaging allegations against him bondholders 
testimony that his intervention for keating made him partly 
responsible for their losses 
he spent much of last week attacking former chief sampl regulator 
edwin j gray as the main culprit in the failure of lincoln and the 
losses to bondholders many of them elderly people who lost their 
life savings 
cranston tried to paint what he called a picture of negligence 
by gray and his staff when gray headed the federal home loan bank 
board 
as ammunition cranston released a chronology by federal 
regulators that showed the bank board permitted american 
continental to sell its junk bonds at the thrifts offices even 
though regulators questioned the firms ability to repay 
bondholders 
the bonds unlike bank accounts at lincoln were not insured and 
became worthless when american continental filed for bankruptcy 
cranston said investors were victims of baitandswitch tactics 
that regulators should not have allowed 
state and federal officials say the bondholders mostly los 
angelesarea retirees were targeted by lincoln to switch nearly 
200 million of federally insured deposits into the uninsured junk 
bonds after federal examiners first recommended closing the 
irvinebased thrift in may 1987 
the 2 billionplus cost for protecting depositors with insured 
accounts not the bondholders is likely to be the most expensive 
thrift takeover in history

the swedish company ab bofors and 
unidentified officials in the government of former prime minister 
rajiv gandhi were charged with bribery monday in connection with a 
14 million arms deal 
investigators said a full investigation of the 1986 artillery 
contract would be made and gandhi whose congress party lost the 
november elections would be among those questioned 
bofors is accused of paying 50 million in kickbacks to win the 
contract in sweden company spokesman johnny ericsson said 
weve had no direct contacts with indian officials over this 
and have no comments 
preliminary charges filed in a special new delhi court monday by 
the government of prime minister vp singh named three people 
gopichand hinduja an indian industrialist based in london martin 
ardbo president of bofors when the contract was signed and win 
chadha the bofors agent in new delhi 
hinduja issued a statement in london saying i totally deny 
that i am in any way involved in it 
rajendra shekhar new director of the central bureau of 
investigation told reporters that others accused included 
officials of bofors and of four companies through which kickbacks 
allegedly were routed 
he did not name the gandhi government officials suspected of 
involvement or say how many there were shekhar said he needed more 
evidence before revealing identities 
asked whether gandhi would be among those questioned he said 
he would be obviously 
at least 640 million rupees was paid through swiss banks to 
clinch the sale of bofors howitzers to india the charges say the 
sum was worth 50 million in 1986 but now is equivalent to 37 
million 
filing preliminary charges would help establish the principle 
of dual criminality enabling the bureau to seek cooperation 
authorities in sweden and switzerland said shekhar whom singh 
appointed earlier this month 
he said his organization prepared the charges after seeing 
classified documents related to the arms contract access to the 
documents was granted in december a few days after singh took 
office shekhar said 
singhs victory in the nov 2226 general elections capped a 
vociferous campaign in which he described corruption as flourishing 
under gandhi 
some politicians have claimed gandhi shared in the kickbacks 
but lengthy newspaper investigations did not include direct 
accusations against the former prime minister gandhi said in 
parliament neither he nor any member of his family received money 
the scandal began in april 1987 when swedish radio said bofors 
paid top officials and members of the gandhi government to win the 
contract which french and austrian companies also sought 
these offenses are alleged in the 66 pages of charges filed 
monday with a new delhi district judge criminal conspiracy 
cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property forgery 
forgery for the purpose of cheating criminal breach of trust and 
abuse of official position by public servants 
shekhar denied suggestions by some reporters that his news 
conference was politically motivated although the central bureau 
of investigations seldom publicizes its investigations and legal 
actions

housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
told a home builders convention monday to avoid alarm over the 
industrys current slump 
a lot of the current doom and gloom is contrary to the 
facts kemp said i dont believe housing is going to be 
americas next crisis 
in a speech to the national association of home builders kemp 
acknowledged that last months 8 percent decline in housing starts 
the recent softening of real estate prices and the crisis in the 
savings and loan industry are an understandable cause for 
concern 
but he said efforts by the bush administration to lower interest 
rates and the proposed cut in the capital gains tax themes sounded 
by president bush in his speech friday to the nahb could help 
revive the fortunes of the industry 
both measures appear to have strong support in the industry as 
their mention in the speeches by bush and kemp drew applause 
a capital gains tax cut he said will reinvigorate the real 
estate market the equity market the bond market and other 
financial markets 
opponents of the cut say it would favor mainly big investors and 
people making more than 100000 a year 
what some on the left forget is that the capital gains tax 
doesnt just help old wealth its an incentive for the creation of 
new wealth kemp told the home builders 
kemps speech came as the nahb wrapped up its fourday 
convention in atlanta electing martin perlman of houston as its 
new president 
the association also announced monday in conjunction with the 
federal national mortgage association a new program to assist 
lowand moderateincome families in buying their own homes 
five cities will be selected for the pilot program which will 
build on existing projects already under way officials said 
the program will include designing innovative housing and 
lowcost approaches to development encouragement of local 
governments to be more flexible in zoning building standards and 
taxation to make homes more affordable and special financing 
programs

continental airlines chairman frank lorenzo 
announced monday that continental will ask for government approval 
to fly four nonstop weekly flights from houston to tokyo 
the houstonbased airline is among eight us carriers seeking 
the department of transportations approval to fly nonstop to 
tokyo continental officials said at a news conference at a 
japanese restaurant 
despite the intense competition for 24 weekly nonstop flights 
to tokyo lorenzo said he believes continentals chances are 
excellent 
the 24 available flights are the result of an agreement signed 
by the us and japan last november 
continental a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air wants 
permission to fly four weekly nonstop flights to tokyo it already 
has a request pending with the dot to offer three weekly onestop 
flights to tokyo 
continental is very excited to attempt to provide a very 
important service for houston lorenzo said 
there are just so many areas from which direct service from 
houston to tokyo will benefit he said 
lorenzo noted there are 125 japanese companies with houston 
offices and 109 houston companies that do business in the pacific 
rim 
texas air spokesman art kent said he expected a decision on the 
onestop request to be issued sometime in the next few weeks he 
did not know when the dot might decide on the request for nonstop 
service 
lorenzo said if both requests are approved continental could 
begin onestop service in august and nonstop flights beginning in 
early 1991 
last may continental began nonstop service between seattle and 
tokyo continental has 56 weekly departures from japan but only 
seven of them travel to the us mainland

the high cost of nursing home insurance places 
it out of reach for most older americans and demonstrates the need 
for a government program to protect people against the staggering 
costs of longterm care an advocacy group said monday 
the families usa foundation released a study saying that 84 
percent of americans from ages 65 to 79 cannot afford even a basic 
nursing home insurance policy and most companies do not issue 
policies to people age 80 and older 
executive director ron pollack called the findings shocking and 
said they bolster the case for a social insurance solution akin to 
social security spreading the benefits and costs across the 
population any longterm care proposal keyed to private insurance 
is going to be a failed policy he said 
the fact is that grandma cant afford longterm care 
insurance pollack said private insurance that claims to 
protect older americans from the high cost of nursing homes is 
itself so expensive that only the very richest elderly can afford 
the premiums 
don white a spokesman for the health insurance association of 
america said the organization hopes to see a publicprivate 
solution to the longterm care problem with private insurers 
playing a far larger role than that envisioned by families usa 
about 40 percent of elderly people can afford to buy private 
longterm care insurance according to hiaa 
its clear that the government cant do the job by itself the 
private companies cant do the job by themselves weve got to do 
it together white said its the role of the government to 
provide for those who are poor or near poor those who need 
government assistance 
with the costs of nursing home care averaging more than 2000 a 
month older americans and their families have been voicing 
increasing concern about the need for protection against such 
staggering costs 
private longterm care insurance was virtually nonexistent 
before 1980 but the market has grown rapidly in recent years with 
more than 100 companies now offering policies and more than 13 
million policies having been sold by mid1989 
families usa studied the average cost of basic policies issued 
by nine leading insurance companies and found that annual premiums 
averaged 1255 when purchased at age 65 at age 79 premiums 
averaged 3860 
policies were considered unaffordable when annual premiums 
pushed total health care costs to more than 10 percent of a 
persons yearly income and annuitized assets 
the fact is that nursing home insurance is well beyond the 
reach of most elderly couples and the situation is even tougher for 
widows or widowers who are most in need of longterm care 
pollack said some older people who fear the high costs of nursing 
home care purchase insurance that is far beyond their means and 
forego meals and medicine to pay for it he said 
pollack said public opinion surveys indicate most americans 
would be willing to pay extra taxes for longterm care protection 
he said possible financing mechanisms could include added payroll 
taxes or changes in the gift and estate tax 
the foundation said it was sending copies of its report to the 
pepper commission made up of members of congress and white house 
appointees which is trying to come up with a solution to the 
longterm care problem 
the commission estimates 9 million americans currently need 
longterm care with the numbers expected to grow as the population 
ages

orange juice futures prices soared to record highs monday on the 
chicago board of trade following a government report showing far 
more damage to the florida orange crop from last months freeze 
than traders had expected 
on other futures markets stockindex futures plunged along with 
the stock market pork futures surged while livestock futures were 
mixed energy futures fell precious metals were mixed and grains 
and soybeans were mixed 
futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice soared 43 
cents to 755 cents with the spot contract for january delivery 
settling at 19625 a pound and the more heavily traded march 
contract at 20535 
the march settlement price was the highest ever for an orange 
juice futures contract eclipsing the previous high of 20425 set 
july 18 1988 after frost damaged the brazilian orange crop 
the rally was largely a reaction to a report released friday by 
the florida state division of the agriculture department that said 
only 32 percent of the orange crop escaped damage from the 
christmas freeze compared with a previous estimate of 44 percent 
buyers were also reacting to an announcement monday by brazilian 
orange juice processors that they were raising their price for 
orange juice concentrate 20 cents to an effective rate of about 
208 a pound said analyst ernie thomas of merrill lynch consumer 
markets inc in winter haven fla 
brazilian imports are expected to make up for the frostrelated 
shortfall in us supplies 
us processors are asking about 215 for concentrate thomas 
said 
we definitely had more damage than we originally thought and 
it just seems to get worse every day thomas said 
analyst judy ganes of shearson lehman hutton inc said the 
extent of freeze damage is especially disturbing because it 
occurred in citrus groves located further south than in 1983 when 
the last freeze of comparable severity hit and the damage is worse 
stockindex futures prices tumbled on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as the dow jones index of 30 industrials plunged 7745 
points amid worries about the outlook for corporate profits and 
interest rates 
the mercs contract for march delivery of stocks represented by 
the standard amp poors 500 index settled 103 points lower at 
33140 the contract is worth 500 a point 
pork futures rose strongly on the chicago merc amid rumors that 
romania and the soviet union were looking to buy us pork products 
similar rumors circulated last week but so far only sales of 
beef livers and hearts to romania have been announced 
the bottom line is that both the romanians and the russians 
have reasons to buy meat but the real problem is that they dont 
have much money said tom morgan president of sterling research 
corp in arlington heights ill 
cattle futures finished mixed amid positioning ahead of 
wednesday quarterly usda cattleonfeed report 
live cattle futures settled unchanged to 10 cent lower with 
february at 7925 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 45 
cent higher with january at 8430 cents a pound live hogs were 23 
cent to 60 cent higher with february at 5012 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 15 cent lower to 190 cents higher with 
february at 5705 cents a pound 
most petroleum futures fell sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange largely on selling related to the expiration of the 
february crude oil contract which went off the board at 2255 
barrel down 112 
other west texas intermediate crude oil futures ended 31 cents 
lower to 8 cents higher with march at 2177 a barrel heating oil

investment banker jeffrey beck an adviser on 
some of the biggest us corporate takeovers ever lied about his 
past fabricating stories about his background and military service 
and claiming to work for the cia according to a published report 
monday 
beck who cultivated a colorful image that included the nickname 
mad dog rose to stardom on wall street even though one of his 
tales helped kill a planned billiondollar buyout of northwest 
industries inc in 1985 the wall street journal reported 
beck 43 a member of drexel burnham lambert incs mergers and 
acquisitions department allegedly told friends and colleagues over 
the years that he was a decorated veteran of the armys special 
forces in vietnam that he did intelligence work for the government 
and that he would inherit a family fortune of 2 billion the 
journal said 
however the journal said after interviewing friends family 
colleagues and acquaintances of the investment banker none of the 
stories apparently was true drexel and oppenheimer amp co becks 
previous employer kept him in their mergers and acquisitions 
departments although many of his coworkers did not believe his 
stories the journal said 
beck tendered a preliminary resignation to drexel a couple of 
weeks ago drexel spokesman steve anreder told the associated press 
on monday the investment firm agreed to discuss the matter further 
with him but beck has been unavailable anreder said 
beck was said to be out of his office when an ap reporter called 
for comment on the journals story monday 
the journal said that during an interview beck denied that he 
had told most of the stories that were attributed to him by what 
the newspaper called business associates friends and others 
this is getting wilder and wilder he told the newspaper 
i am beyond shock 
beck who claimed his troops in vietnam nicknamed him mad 
dog acknowledged there were no official records of his vietnam 
service but said he had made trips to vietnam the newspaper 
reported 
beck also was said to have claimed he had done years of 
intelligence work but he denied to the journal that he told people 
he worked for the cia or that he would inherit a 2 billion fortune 
beck is a rainmaker one who drums up takeover business for 
investment firms he has been highly successful working as an 
adviser to the buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co on a 
number of deals including its record 2453 billion purchase of 
rjr nabisco inc in 1988 
beck in 1986 had helped bring kkr general partner henry kravis 
and investor donald kelly together in the 62 billion buyout of 
beatrice cos at the time the biggest nonoil company takeover 
ever 
but when beck was with oppenheimer his storytelling 
contributed to the collapse of the northwest industries deal 
in an account confirmed by oppenheimer the journal said the 
firm was putting together a buyout of northwest industries when one 
investor backed out leaving oppenheimer and its partners 75 
million short of their needed financing 
beck pledged to make up the shortfall from his own fortune but 
after oppenheimer colleague stephen mcgrath confronted beck about 
his claims of wealth donald kelly withdrew from the deal and it 
foundered 
northwest later merged with farley industries in a 104 billion 
transaction 
oppenheimer did not dismiss beck until six months later after 
being given an ultimatum by mcgrath the journal said 
when asked why there was a delay between the incident and becks 
firing oppenheimer spokesman john ryan declined comment he also 
refused to say whether any disciplinary action was taken against 
beck 
shortly after his dismissal beck joined drexels mergers and 
acquisitions department at drexel he courted rjr nabisco president 
f ross johnson whobegan the bidding war for the food and tobacco 
giant at their second meeting the journal said johnson brought 
along a box of milk bone dog biscuits as a joke on becks nickname 
and beck at the whole box 
johnson sought the advice of shearson lehman hutton inc and 
drexel ended up advising henry kravis 
because of his dealmaking abilities beck enjoyed great 
notoriety on wall street 
the journal said david aaron an oppenheimer 
employeeturnedauthor used beck as the model for the main 
character of his book agent of influence 
beck also served as a technical adviser and had a cameo role in 
director oliver stones film wall street he befriended the 
films star michael douglas who was impressed by becks war 
stories and became interested in making a film about them the 
journal said 
however the journal quoted people familiar with the project as 
saying douglas and screenwriter david black came to believe that 
becks stories were false and dropped the project 
beck also is the subject of a book rainmaker being written 
by business week reporter anthony bianco the journal said

merrill lynch amp co on monday reported a 362 
million fourthquarter loss including a onetime charge of 470 
million for a drastic restructuring at the nations largest 
brokerage 
the pretax charge which analysts called the largest ever for a 
securities firm comes during a period of wide retrenchment on wall 
street because of slow business since the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
for all of 1989 merrill lynch reported a loss of 213 million 
compared to profits of 463 million the previous year 
merrill chairman william a schreyer blamed the decline on wall 
streets hard times characterized by an exodus of small investors 
a severe drop in the junk bond market low return on some products 
and increased competition 
the firm touted as a breed apart in newspaper and 
television advertisements in november began the restructuring 
which includes layoffs estimated at more than 4000 
while other firms have reduced staff because of a slowdown in 
retail brokerage and investment banking merrills cuts have been 
the most stunning because of the firms preeminence on wall street 
its scary that the costs could run this high to do what 
theyve done here said analyst lawrence eckenfelder of 
prudential bache securities corp in san francisco what it 
suggests is theres an awful lot more to come out there im sure 
at other firms as well 
merrills quarterly loss which amounted to 356 a share 
compared with earnings of 276 million or 269 a share for the 
same 1988 period revenue for the quarter ending dec 29 was 28 
billion up from 267 billion in the 1988 quarter 
merrill reported that quarterly revenue from principal 
transactions declined nearly 50 percent to 169 million from 321 
million the previous year 
for the full year merrill reported a per share loss of 231 
in 1988 merrill reported a profit of 463 million or 429 a 
share revenue for 1989 was 113 billion up 16 percent from 975 
billion in 1988 
but the revenue increase was due mainly to a 35 percent rise in 
interest and dividends revenue sank 186 percent for principal 
transactions and 63 percent from investment banking while 
commission revenue gained 123 percent 
merrill said the two areas of decline reflected markdowns in the 
firms inventory of highyield bonds the junk bond market was 
battered in 1989 because of a series of huge defaults and declines 
in the use of the securities to finance mergers and takeovers 
the firms 1988 fullyear and fourthquarter results included a 
255 million aftertax gain from the termination of a merrill 
pension plan 
merrill said the restructuring charge resulted from divesting 
some products lines and business activities consolidating and 
relocating some domestic and international retail institutional 
and other facilities and reducing the size of other operations 
the bulk of the charge came from paying off office leases 
severance payments and asset writeoffs from reduced operations 
merrill officials said they expected the reductions eventually 
would save the firm 100 million to 200 million a year 
merrill plans to lay off about 3000 workers by the end of 1990 
through layoffs attrition and selling off businesses 
the reductions would drop merrills total work force to about 
36800 compared with 40500 at the end of 1989 and a peak of 
47000 shortly before the october 1987 stock market crash 
merrill recently cut an additional 700 positions by selling its 
canadian retail brokerage operation and eliminated 300 more jobs 
through cuts in its broadcort capital corp accountclearing 
business 
since november merrill also has abandoned the european 
commercial paper business eliminated one equity division at its 
new york headquarters and reduced trading of british stocks 
merrills stock price dropped 62 cents a share to 2412 in 
new york stock exchange trading monday the earnings were announced 
after the market closed 
only drexel burnham lambert inc which has slashed its work 
force by more than 40 percent since resolving securities fraud 
charges has engineered a more dramatic cutback overall wall 
street has eliminated more than 23000 since the crash

the congress returning tuesday from a long 
holiday recess is all but sure to enact tougher airpollution 
controls but battles remain over how much the legislation should 
cost and who should pay 
there will be a long formidable no doubt at times 
contentious debate senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine told reporters monday it is imperative that we act not 
only for ourselves but for the future generations 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the environmental and 
public works subcommittee that originated the bill and chief 
sponsor of the legislation said all interested parties know 
there will be a cleanair bill this year 
the broadreaching cleanair bill that will begin to be 
scrutinized on the senate floor tuesday calls for cutting acidrain 
pollutants in half much tighter controls on automobile emissions 
and greatly reducing toxic chemical releases 
the estimated annual cost of the various proposals ranges from 
14 billion to 100 billion supporters of the legislation argue 
that some of the costs are being exaggerated and that reduced 
healthcare costs will recoup some of the money 
president bush said last week that hes prepared to veto any 
legislation that goes substantially beyond the 19 billion proposal 
he sent to capitol hill last summer 
i want to sign a cleanair bill this year but i will only 
sign legislation that balances environmental and economic 
progress bush said in a letter to the senate 
mitchell said the senate legislation would cost slightly more 
than the bill proposed by the white house but called the 
presidents cost assessment inflated he said it was extremely 
unlikely that the president would veto a cleanair bill even the 
current senate legislation 
a cheaper solution is often not the best solution he said 
congress faces other major issues including reducing the budget 
deficit subsidizing child care for working parents reforming 
campaignfinance laws extending farm programs and stepping up the 
war on drugs 
there also will be fights over bushs proposal to cut the 
capital gains tax and a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to cut the social security tax 
a key to the budget battle will be how deeply defense spending 
can be cut in light of the recent move toward democracy in eastern 
europe and the lessening of eastwest tensions some lawmakers say 
that peace dividend should be used for domestic programs 
with more than 100 million people breathing air the government 
considers unhealthy and growing concern over the destruction of 
streams and lakes by acid rain there is little disagreement over 
the need for tougher federal airpollution controls 
lawmakers argue that while new curbs will be expensive doing 
nothing may be even more costly 
fran dumelle of the american lung association said the annual 
health costs associated to air pollution five years ago was 
estimated at 15 billion to 40 billion today the 40 billion 
figure has become a middle range and the health toll continues 
to rise she said 
the framework of a tougher airpollution law seems set on 
capitol hill but major details continue to be the subject of 
intense behindthedoor maneuvering 
mitchell a longtime advocate of tougher cleanair legislation 
said action is needed this year or the countrys determination to 
deal with environmental problems will questioned worldwide 
a house version not as tough as the senate bill but closer to 
what bush wants remains in committee even after both chambers 
complete their bills there will be tough bargaining before final 
compromise legislation goes to the president 
one of the major disagreements over a cleanair bill involves 
the continuing regional conflict over whether states with the 
dirtiest utility plants should pay all cleanup costs 
saying reduced acidrain pollution benefits everyone senators 
from a string of states from pennsylvania to missouri where the 
dirtiest utility plants are located want the costs spread 
nationwide through an energy tax or fee 
legislators from other states balk at the proposal and bush has 
said he would veto any measure that includes such a costsharing 
tax 
its hard to see why consumers in states that have already 
done their part should be paying a second time for those who have 
dragged their feet said minnesota gov rudy perpich 
cost sharing is dead on arrival baucus said 
nevertheless an accommodation aimed at easing some of the 
midwesterners concerns is expected various proposals are being 
discussed including one that would give the dirtiest utility 
plants extra pollution credits that could be sold to other parts of 
the country to defer cleanup costs 
meanwhile industries most affected including automakers and 
oil companies have unleashed lobbying campaigns aimed at blunting 
the most expensive pollution controls under consideration one 
target has been tough proposed auto tailpipe pollution controls 
that would go into effect in 2003 and for which there is no 
available technology to bring cars into compliance 
supporters of the socalled stage ii controls say automakers 
need to be pushed into developing better technology the estimated 
cost of the provision has ranged from 135 a car to according to 
auto companies at least 500 a car

the bush administration said monday it will 
move to end controls on overseas sales of computers and other 
technology readily available to the public 
the policy overhaul will have an immediate effect on much of 
eastern europe but no immediate effect on the soviet union 
meanwhile sevral us officials have opened talks in london to 
prepare for joint steps by 17 nations to accelerate delivery of 
advanced technology to such countries as poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia 
the political and military environment is changing the 
situation is different today than it was a year ago white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
for more than 40 years the united states and its allies have 
imposed stiff curbs on technology sales to communist countries on 
security grounds but the advent of mikhail s gorbachev as leader 
of the soviet union in 1985 and the spread of reform in the eastern 
bloc spured many western governments to push for an easing of 
restrictions 
at a national security council meeting on friday the bush 
administration decided to take a softer approach as well sources 
said two parallel decisions were made to work out a joint 
agreement at a meeting in paris next month to provide advanced 
technology to eastern europe and to conduct a comprehensive review 
of us policy 
officials of the state department the pentagon and the commerce 
department participated in the decision state and commerce were 
more willing to permit the technology transfers than the defense 
department 
the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the 
underlining us principles were 
support for reform in eastern europe 
strengthening protection for truly strategic goods and 
technologies 
more rapid modernization of the current lists of controlled 
items 
decontrol of offtheshelf commodities readily availble to the 
general public 
she said the administration wanted to take advantage of a 
changing enviornment in eastern europe in the soviet union 
she said the situation has not evolved to the same extent 
fitzwater called the steps being taken a prudent change 
that will not jeopardize strategic interests 
a group of us officials led by allan wendt of the state 
departments office of strategic technology policy flew to london 
over the weekend to meet with british officials 
the officials will go on to the netherlands west germany and 
italy meanwhile delegations from canada and japan will come to 
washington for talks this week and french and danish experts are 
due here next week 
the discussions are in preparation for a meeting in paris in 
midfebruary of cocom the coordination committee for multilateral 
export control there the united states hopes to work out details 
of what kind of equipment will be cleared for eastern europe and 
how much of it 
cocom which includes all 16 nato countries except iceland plus 
japan and australia attempts to coordinate western deliveries of 
technology to eastern european countries the united states has 
been among the most reluctant to provide high technology to allies 
of the soviet union 
the countries likely to be assisted include poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia all of which have shed communist domination nd are 
adopting capitalistic approaches to their weak economies 
the meeting in paris is designed to adopt uniform rules to guide 
technology transfers in this respect the administrations 
decision to liberalize restrictions could be balanced against the 
more eager approaches of some other cocom members and produce a 
compromise 
the net result however would be to deliver better computers 
and telecommunications equipment to members of the eastern bloc 
provided semisensitive technology is not then turned over to the 
soviet union

amoco corp said monday its fourthquarter earnings fell 15 
percent because of special onetime gains in the previous year 
while arco said higher oil prices helped its quarterly earnings 
rise 3 percent and amerada hess corp posted a 7 percent rise in 
profits as exploration and production earnings surged 
for the three months ended dec 31 chicagobased amoco earned 
319 million or 62 cents a share down from 375 million or 72 
cents a share in the comparable 1988 period revenue rose 10 
percent to 68 billion from 62 billion 
amoco chairman richard morrow said 1988 fourthquarter earnings 
benefitted from onetime factors mainly natural gas settlements 
without those factors earnings in the latest quarter would have 
been about the same as in the 1988 quarter 
for the year amocos net income fell 22 percent to 16 
billion or 312 a share from 21 billion or 4 a share in 
1988 revenue advanced 12 percent to 268 billion from 239 
billion 
restructuring costs and provisions for environmental programs 
depressed earnings for the full year 
los angelesbased arco said its earnings rose 3 percent in the 
fourth quarter and 23 percent in the year largely because of 
higher energy prices lower interest expense and sale of a majority 
stake in a petrochemical subsidiary 
the energy company formerly atlantic richfield co said it 
earned 403 million or 238 per share in the quarter up from 
391 million or 222 per share for the fourth quarter of 1988 
quarterly revenues fell by 118 percent to 4 billion from 45 
billion 
for the year arco earned 195 billion or 1126 per share 
compared to 158 billion 878 per share in fiscal 1988 
revenues fell 126 percent to 1602 billion from 1832 billion 
arco chairman lodwrick cook said the company experienced higher 
worldwide crude oil and refined product prices for example the 
average price for domestic crude oil rose to 1313 a barrel last 
year from 990 in 1988 
increased natural gas volumes and lower interest expense also 
contributed to income growth cook said in a statement 
we also realized a 634 million aftertax gain from the sale 
of a majority interest in lyondell petrochemical co in january 
he said at the same time however the 1989 results reflect a 
345 million charge for future environmental expenses and other 
provisions as well as 50 percent less contribution from the 
earnings of lyondell 
the sale of 501 percent of lyondell caused arco to report lower 
revenues in the fourth quarter and 1989 lyondell accounted for 
47 billion of arcos revenues in 1988 
arco also said it spent a total of 827 million to repurchase 
83 million shares of its stock in 1989 
new yorkbased amerada hess earned 708 million or 88 cents a 
share up from 663 million or 80 cents a share in the 
comparable 1988 period revenue rose about 3 percent to 15 
billion from 12 billion 
for the year amerada hess net earnings more than doubled to 
476 million or 587 a share from 124 million or 151 a 
share revenue totaled 57 billion up 33 percent from 43 
billion in the previous year 
exploration and production earnings totaled 339 million in the 
fourth quarter compared with a loss of 300000 in the 1988 
quarter fourthquarter 1988 results also included a charge of 30 
million for capitalized exploration expenses related to properties 
for which the company had no development plans 
while refining and marketing earnings declined in the fourth 
quarter they more than doubled in the year amerada hess reported

czechoslovakia has asked to join the 
international monetary fund a major source of loans to countries 
in financial trouble the fund announced monday 
china poland hungary and yugoslavia are already members 
soviet leaders have said they would like to join the 152 countries 
that make up the organization the us government which holds the 
biggest single block of votes has said it does not consider the 
soviets ready 
the us central intelligence agency estimated czechoslovakias 
debt in 1988 at 61 billion much less than polands 385 billion 
and less than that of most other eastern european countries one 
exception is romania which under the late president nicolae 
ceausescu paid off virtually all its foreign debt 
the funds announcement recalled that czechoslovakia was one of 
the original members when the fund was organized just after world 
war ii but withdrew in 1954 after the communists took over the 
government no difficulty is expected in winning membership 
approval for czechoslovakia to rejoin 
the country probably will need financial help as it shifts from 
state control of the economy to something closer to a market 
system the imf specializes in shortterm loans for countries with 
payments difficulties 
membership in the fund also opens the way to membership in its 
sister organization the world bank also based in washington the 
bank is the largest source of longterm development loans to the 
third world 
a loan from the imf can open the way to borrowing from other 
lenders including individual governments and private banks the 
fund has negotiated a 710 million loan to poland and approval by 
the member governments is expected soon 
the application of czechoslovakia and the prospect that east 
germany romania and bulgaria may follow come as the fund is 
seeking a major increase in its resources now equivalent to about 
117 billion 
michel camdessus the funds french managing director has asked 
for a doubling of quotas as contributions are called and most 
member countrties went along but the united states britain and 
saudi arabia all influential members have argued for a smaller 
increase

exportimport bank predicted monday 
its important because our competitors have about 12 billion 
worth of trade business with the soviets joseph d macomber told 
the bankers association for foreign trade weve got a lot of 
catching up to do 
macomber predicted that the obstacles will be abolished before 
president bush meets the heads of other major industrialized 
nations for their annual summit this year in houston 
the exportimport bank which lends to purchasers in foreign 
countries at subsidized rates to promote the sale of american 
industrial products is barred by law from lending to the soviet 
union 
the bush administration has been waiting until the supreme 
soviet passes a new law on emigration before it moves to lift the 
restrictions imposed by the 1975 jacksonvanik amendment the 
object of the amendment was to encourage freer movement of jews out 
of the soviet union 
another legal provision the stevenson amendment sets a limit 
of 300 million on what the bank can lend or guarantee in loans to 
the soviets macomber quoted one of his analysts as saying 
that ought to get us through the first 30 days 
a third restriction the byrd amendment puts a limit of 40

a jury monday night convicted a suspended 
graduate student of federal computer tampering charges for 
unleashing a worm that crippled a nationwide network of 
thousands of computers 
robert t morris 24 faces up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine he is the first person brought to trial under a 1986 
federal computer fraud and abuse law that makes it a felony to 
break into a federal computer network and prevent authorized use of 
the system 
the jury returned its verdict about 930 pm after nearly six 
hours of deliberation 
us district court judge howard munson did not set a sentencing 
date 
morris from arnold md testified during his trial that he had 
made a programming error that caused a computer worm to go berserk 
and cripple the internet system nov 2 1988 
the worm he designed immobilized an estimated 6000 computers 
linked to internet including ones at nasa military facilities and 
major universities 
morris would not comment as he hurried from the federal 
courthouse but his father also named robert said he did not 
think the verdict was unfair 
i have a great deal of faith in the american judicial system 
and yet im still disappointed in the verdict he said 
morris may not have intended his worm program to paralyze a 
nationwide computer network in 1988 but it was no accident that 
the worm attacked the network us justice department trial lawyer 
mark rasch said in closing statements earlier in the day 
the worm didnt break in by accident or mistake robert morris 
intended for the worm to break in he said 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni argued that the suspended 
cornell university graduate student made a programming error that 
caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the internet system on 
nov 2 1988 
its not the side effects its not the mistakes but what he 
actually intended to do said guidoboni he never intended to 
prevent authorized access 
prosecutor ellen meltzer reminded the jury in her summation that 
testimony showed morris deliberately stole computer passwords from 
hundreds of people so the worm could break into as many computers 
as possible 
she added that morris took deliberate and conscious steps to 
make the rogue program difficult to detect and eradicate he 
unleashed the worm from the computer system at massachusetts 
institute of technology in cambridge and made it look like it was 
sent by the university of california at berkeley so authorship of 
the program could not be traced to him at cornell she said 
ms meltzer said at least six earlier versions of the worm were 
found on morris cornell computer accounts and that his own 
comments on the worm program used the words breakin and 
steal 
she told the jury that morris worm was not a juvenile prank 
in no way was it a legitimate cornell research project gone 
awry 
guidoboni insisted that morris didnt intend to cause permanent 
damage to computer files there was no work lost work was 
delayed thats the bottom line he said 
morris took steps to limit the worms growth guidoboni said 
if he intended to bring the systems down he didnt need to 
control the growth he could have just let this thing go he said 
he stressed that once morris realized the worm had gone berserk 
he tried to stop it 
while guidoboni argued during the trial that internet was 
chiefly a system used by researchers to swap information including 
recipes and love letters meltzer contended it was far more 
important 
she said it also involved research on acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome weapons development artificial intelligence and new 
drugs
