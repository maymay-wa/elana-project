chinas top military official speaking to 
reporters tuesday before meeting with us defense secretary frank 
carlucci said china is not a major arms dealer 
china is a developing country china can only sell a little 
it is only a small fraction of what the united states has sold 
defense minister qin jiwei said 
chinas sales of missiles to middle east nations including 
silkworm missiles to iran have been criticized by the united 
states 
according to us figures china sold about 2 billion worth of 
arms last year mainly to developing countries china does not 
provide information on its arms sales 
qin said china and other third world countries sell only 
conventional arms but the united states is selling advanced arms 
such as the f16 jet fighter we cant compare the two kinds of 
arms he said 
deputy chief of staff xu xin also talking to reporters in the 
great hall of the people insisted china strictly regulates its 
arms sales first they are for defense second they are for 
maintaining stability and peace not war he said 
earlier tuesday the american national anthem echoed off the gray 
walls of the chinese military museum as chinas top military 
leaders welcomed carlucci on his first official visit 
carlucci accompanied by qin reviewed a 120member honor guard 
from the peoples liberation army 
carlucci arrived monday for a fiveday visit to discuss 
international and bilateral issues 
china is expected to call on the united states to remove 
restrictions on technology transfers and approve export licenses 
for us companies wanting to use chinese long march missiles to 
launch satellites 
use of the chinese missiles has been opposed by us defense 
officials concerned about giving china access to us satellite 
technology 
regional conflicts in afghanistan and cambodia and the soviet 
military stance in the far east are also likely to be discussed

fifty people were arrested monday when a 
group trying to distribute free food and leaflets scuffled with 
police who had previously warned the group to get a permit or move 
elsewhere 
a television cameraman was injured when a police officer knocked 
him to the ground at the fracas on the edge of golden gate park 
food and fists went flying when a squad of police officers 
wearing riot gear closed in on about 200 people gathered for the 
food not bombs giveaway 
it was the second time in a week the group had clashed with 
police on aug 29 29 people were arrested in a similar 
confrontation group leaders said they will return each monday 
later monday in warwick mass a group active on behalf of the 
homeless the gandhi peace center gave its annual marie antoinette 
award for community consciousness to the city of san francisco to 
recognize the arrests the tongueincheek award refers to the 
french queens famous remark of let them eat cake when told 
the peasants were without bread 
the latest confrontation took place about 45 minutes after the 
group marched into the southeast corner of the park adjacent to 
the haightashbury district popular in the 1960s among hippies and 
in the 80s among people who buy and restore victorian homes 
police moved in as the groups members began giving food to one 
another 
police spokesman sgt jerry senkir said it was considered an 
illegal giveaway after food was given to 25 people 
as the officers approached food began to fly through the air 
one officer was hit in the face with a plate of rice and another 
was struck in the neck with a tomato 
a police officer grabbed kpix cameraman hank schoepp knocking 
him to the ground the cameraman lay stunned for a few moments with 
blood trickling from his cheek and his camera tossed aside he then 
got up and resumed filming the clash 
some of those arrested were dragged away with their wrists bound 
by plastic ties they were loaded into police vans and taken away 
senkir said they faced a possible misdemeanor count of creating a 
nuisance and two park infractions illegal distribution of food and 
illegal leafleting 
the park infractions carry a maximum penalty of a 50 fine 
senkir said one woman also faced a charge of assaulting an 
officer 
senkir said the giveaway would not be illegal if the group had 
obtained permits he said the group had been offered other sites 
for the giveaway but rejected that idea 
the group had 15 to 20 cartons of food including bread 
carrots lettuce rice melons and corn 
the leaflets said the group had been harassed in recent months 
by police and had been unfairly characterized by mayor art agnos as 
being interested in exploiting the homeless and hungry 
patrisha vestey who was handing out deviled eggs said she was 
a legal assistant in a law office and lived in the neighborhood 
i disapproved of what the police are doing i think the poor 
should be taken care of she said it was not clear if she was a 
member of the group 
lorraine rorke vice president of stanyanfulton association 
said im against this particular giveaway in this particular 
location 
i also feel that they are not so interested in giving away 
food as they are in promoting their particular message said ms 
rorke whose organization is one of several neighborhood 
associations opposed to the food not bombs giveaways 
its a free country and if they want to have their political 
views they can have them i just dont like their means of using 
the hungry and blocking the entrance to the park she said

florida republicans with a good shot at gaining a 
us senate seat two years after losing one will be choosing 
between the archconservative grandson of a baseball legend and the 
brash prosecutor who put a colombian drug lord behind bars 
meantime six democrats are battling in their primary prompted 
by the decision of the popular incumbent lawton chiles not to 
seek reelection an october runoff will be necessary if as 
expected no one gets more than half the votes on tuesday 
seven of florida 19 congressional districts are also holding 
primaries 
raising funds has been the dominant topic of the senate races 
two years after thengov bob graham unseated republican sen paula 
hawkins in a race that cost them a combined 13 million 
chiles chairman of the senate budget committee stunned state 
politicians with his decision in december not to seek a fourth 
term chiles said he was burned out by his senate workload and the 
high cost of campaigns 
rep connie mack iii a threeterm republican had already begun 
piling up funds when chiles dropped out mack whose late 
grandfather managed the philadelphia as and is in baseballs hall 
of fame has spent at least 22 million so far 
democrats were pleased when former gov reubin askew announced 
his candidacy but askew though running well ahead of mack in the 
polls abruptly quit may 7 saying he didnt like all the time 
spent raising funds 
askews withdrawal left rep dan mica the only democrat to 
oppose mack but quickly five others entered the race threeterm 
state insurance commissioner bill gunter rep kenneth buddy 
mackay state sen patricia frank former republican gov claude 
kirk and former senate postal clerk fred rader 
mack got a surprise of his own when robert merkle fresh from 
gaining the conviction of colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder 
rivas quit as us attorney and entered the republican race in 
june 
president reagan and former marine lt col oliver north made 
campaign appearances for mack a 47yearold with one of the most 
conservative records in congress 
the outspoken merkle also a conservative has likened mack to a 
shiny new car with no engine under the hood when mack 
refused to debate him merkle started carrying around a lifesized 
replica of mack he called cardboard connie 
however he did not make an issue of macks admission last year 
that he had used marijuana in his younger days 
merkle 43 has spent only about 100000 but has garnered more 
newspaper endorsements that credit him with more specific stands on 
issues than mack 
still published polls make mack the heavy favorite to win the 
gop nomination and his wellfinanced campaign and the divided 
campaign on the democratic side give him a good chance of 
prevailing in november 
i dont think itll be an easy race but i think its 
winnable said state democratic chairman charles whitehead 
in the democratic primary polls give gunter the lead with about 
40 percent of the vote a candidate needs to top 50 percent to 
avert a runoff oct 4 
gunter who lost to mrs hawkins in 1980 raised 1 million 
within six weeks of entering the race and opponents noted he took 
at least 160000 from the insurance industry he regulates as state 
insurance commissioner mackay campaign manager greg farmer called 
gunters department a saga of sleaze 
polls indicated the race for second was too close to call 
between mackay a threeterm congressman and mica a fiveterm 
congressman 
in the congressional races 10thterm rep bill chappell 
touched by the pentagon procurement scandal faced a littleknown 
engineer in the democratic primary while three republicans are 
vying for the chance to challenge him chappell has denied 
wrongdoing although his name has been mentioned repeatedly during 
the probe 
six republicans are battling to succeed mack former rep la 
skip bafalis who gave up the seat in an unsuccessful run for 
governor in 1982 was expected to be in a runoff with former lee 
county commissioner porter goss or retired army gen james dozier 
who was held hostage by terrorists in italy

us military forces in south korea are helping 
to protect the olympic games the writer the associated press 
bureau chief in seoul went on a us air force flight to get a 
view of the preparations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
capt john vandervalk 
scanned the target and flung the plane in a stomachwrenching 
attack dive into the rocky valley below 
the small us air force ov10 bronco nosedived the force of 
the acceleration forcing its two occupants back against their 
armorplated seats hills flashed past as vandervalk streaked 
toward the target calmly checking the attack coordinates 
white phosphorous rockets flashed from the planes belly and 
slammed into the practice target as the pilot jerked the plane up 
over a rock cliff vandervalk glanced back to check his handiwork 
we do everything as if it were day one of a war except nobody 
shoots at us vandervalk explained after thursdays flight you 
really have a sense of urgency and mission in korea 
us forces stationed in south korea are on increased alert in 
case communist north korea makes any attempt to disrupt the olympic 
games which begin sept 17 in seoul the united states is helping 
guarantee the security of the olympics 
vandervalk and other pilots of the air forces 19th tactical air 
control squadron serve as forward air controllers whose mission is 
to spot and mark targets with smoke for other planes to attack 
their small planes also fly attack missions against ground targets 
we control violence is the motto worn by members of the 
squadron based at osan air force base south of seoul 
hundreds of thousands of troops including 42000 us troops 
face each other in a tense confrontation on the demilitarized zone 
that divides the peninsula 
us forces have been based in south korea since the united 
states intervened to help the south after north korea invaded in 
1950 to begin the korean war an armistice was signed in 1953 but 
the north and south technically are still at war 
col bob hammond commander of the 5th tactical air control 
group said the north korean threat is a daily fact of life 
i think the threat presented by the north koreans is real 
they are not what could be classified as rational actors he said 
south korean and us commanders fear north korea will attempt 
to disrupt the olympics because its demand to be a cohost of the 
games has been rejected the north has a long history of launching 
terrorist attacks against the south 
the north koreans would like to see an embarrassment to the 
republic of south korea and the united states hammond said 
us troops wont be guarding olympic venues but the games have 
increased the sense of tension and spurred greater vigilance 
hammond said 
everyones adrenalin goes up everyone leans forward in their 
foxholes hammond said 
airspace over seoul and all olympic sites has been declared 
offlimits during the games south korean military air controllers 
quickly challenge any approaching plane 
if you get real close to the capital area they threaten to 
shoot you down vandervalk said after being challenged by an air 
controller over the radio 
vandervalk who has been stationed in south korea for three 
years said training is intense because hostile forces are poised 
just a few miles away pilots carry war plans on all missions 
were ready to go to work at a moments notice he said 
flying over nightmare range about 15 miles from the border 
vandervalk pointed out a north korean military air base visible 
across the border 
the north korean migs can be on us in two minutes he said 
vandervalk said he has not seen a north korean jet during his 
tour of duty in the south but he and other pilots often hear the 
norths military radio traffic while they are flying 
the airwaves along the border constantly crackle with south 
korean and us military air controllers giving instructions the 
area routinely is busy with warplanes on patrol or practicing 
south koreans have to live with a constant military presence and 
frequent exercises that can be disruptive but they accept the 
inconveniences as unavoidable vandervalk said 
it shows how lucky people in the west are he said when 
was the last time an american had a tank roll through his garden

when three irish republican army members were 
gunned down in gibraltar on march 6 while allegedly plotting a car 
bombing the british government claimed a victory on the 
battlefield of terrorism 
instead it got a political controversy that is still simmering 
six months later a longawaited inquest into the killings opens 
tuesday in the british colony on the southeast tip of spain 
mairead farrell daniel maccann and sean savage were unarmed 
when they died the car bomb much to the british governments 
embarrassment never materialized although the ira admitted the 
three were on a guerrilla mission and a car full of explosives was 
found 40 miles from the scene two days later 
moreover two british television networks investigating what had 
happened that sunny sunday in gibraltar found witnesses whose 
accounts strongly suggested the three were shot without being given 
any chance to surrender 
it all boiled down to a simple question that confronts every 
democracy facing a terrorist threat did britain bend the rule of 
law 
critics like amnesty international the human rights watchdog 
which demanded an inquiry into the shootings in hopes of answering 
that question were rebuffed by prime minister margaret thatcher 
who said she was outraged that the question was even being asked 
as far as the government was concerned a disaster was averted 
it argued that there was no way of knowing on that day that no car 
bomb was in gibraltar that it had to be assumed a bomb was set to 
blow up a military parade and hordes of onlookers that there was 
no certainty the perpetrators were not armed and did not have 
remotecontrol detonators to explode the bomb the moment they were 
told to surrender 
the government sought to dissuade thames television and the 
british broadcasting corp from broadcasting the documentaries 
arguing that trial by tv would prejudice the inquest 
the broadcasts went ahead confronting viewers with some 
chilling accounts from witnesses 
stephen bullock a lawyer told the bbc he saw a chap with a 
white shirt reeling backward with a man standing four feet away 
from him firing a gun constantly and following him down as he 
fell 
he said it wasnt a question of just putting one or two shots 
into him just to stop him it seemed to me this was a deliberate 
shooting to kill no question 
the bbc also quoted an unidentified witness who saw sean savage 
on his back with another man standing over him with his foot on 
his chest 
i heard no warning before the shots were fired she was 
quoted as saying he continued to fire shots into the man as he 
lay on the ground 
carmen proetta watching from her apartment said she believed 
mairead farrell and daniel mccann had their hands up in surrender 
when they were shot dead by a man who went into a crouch position 
and took deliberate aim at them 
the issues have been debated since 1982 when police in northern 
ireland killed five unarmed suspects and an innocent youth in three 
separate incidents the arguments arose anew after three ira men 
were gunned down in a british army ambush in the west of the 
province last tuesday 
defending the government in the rightwing daily express after 
the tv documentaries lord chalfont denounced any equivalence 
between indiscriminate killing in the course of political 
terrorism and the killing of terrorists by security forces engaged 
in counterterrorist operations 
the liberal guardian on the other hand maintained a state 
that turns to terror itself in desperate recourse in the end 
endorses values of terrorists 
tuesdays inquest which was postponed from june is now the 
focus of attention sixtyfive witnesses have been called and 
gibraltar is in a state of high alert wracked by frequent bomb 
scares 
the seven operatives involved in the march 6 incident are 
thought to belong to the armys special air services a topsecret 
antiterrorist team and they will testify behind a screen to 
prevent their being marked for reprisals 
but the british government has reserved the right to keep them 
away from the inquest 
if the 11member jury returns a verdict of unlawful killings 
attorney general eric thistlethwaite of gibraltar will prosecute 
the perpetrators according to highlevel sources in the colony who 
requested anonymity 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated province with 
the republic of ireland under socialist rule

when a town loses a river the situation 
can become explosive 
it has for grayville a town of about 2300 that until 1985 
sat on the banks of the wabash river 
the town didnt move the river did and now after three years 
of waiting for federal agencies or floods to return the river to 
its rightful course some frustrated residents are threatening 
to use dynamite 
if mother nature doesnt do it man will said john farmer 
who owns the hard times fish market in this southeastern illinois 
town 
if grayvilles economic situation were better residents might 
be more tolerant of the rivers shift several years ago grayville 
was a thriving oil producer but about the time the river changed 
course cheaper imports glutted the market 
and because this years drought dried up anticipated 
agricultural income the stagnant channel has become an unpleasant 
reminder of hard times 
before the river changed course hundreds of fishermen used to 
crowd grayvilles restaurants bars and gas stations every weekend 
the money they spent once would have buffered losses from oil and 
agriculture 
but now like the wabash the anglers dont come around anymore 
when spring floods receded in 1985 residents discovered the 
river had left them a new channel had cut off the horseshoe bend 
upon which grayville was founded 
these days fishermen are lucky to get a flatbottomed boat in 
the shallow waters of the old channel and theyd better be 
prepared to row because a motor will strike bottom residents say 
water that used to flow at 40 feet per second now doesnt move 
at all silt that once was washed downstream is now filling in the 
old channel and tall weeds have taken over the sand bars that 
boaters and swimmers once flocked to grayvilles boat ramp is 
usually empty 
for three years residents pleaded with federal and state 
officials for money to bring the rambling river home federal 
agencies came up with a package that would cost the town 900000 
a quarter of the cost to build a dam to divert the wabash back 
theres no way the town could come up with 900000 said 
mayor jack hagedorn noting that the towns entire annual budget is 
barely over 1 million 
talk at bobs barbershop and other hangouts has focused on 
residents taking care of the problem themselves a recent editorial 
in the mercury independent grayvilles hometown newspaper 
criticized the lack of help from authorities and reported growing 
sentiment among grayville citizens to take matters into their own 
hands 
the editorial refers to a rumored plan to dynamite a trench to 
relocate the river but adds we have no idea this will actually 
be carried out 
its talk said alan ritchey who runs the grayville sewage 
plant no ones got the courage to do it vandalism like that is 
unheard of in grayville 
he hates to see grayville lose its source of pride some of the 
towns most exciting history is tied to the river a paddlewheeler 
once sank there and a train trestle collapsed into the river when 
the town was young 
labor day crowds will pack grayville but theyre coming for the 
towns annual holiday celebration not to fish or swim in the 
wabash 
most of them will drive by the sign that welcomes visitors to 
grayville on the banks of the wabash 
i would start looking for another monument to the town 
ritchey said

evidence of the pugnacious politics of 
teamsters local 560 can be seen in the graffiti spraypainted on 
the concrete base of the pulaski skyways hulking black girders 
remember castellito exhorts a scrawl referring to anthony 
castellito a local 560 official slain in 1961 
reputed genovese crime family figure anthony tony pro 
provenzano and his brothers salvatore and nunzio ran the union 
citybased local until 1979 when anthony provenzano was convicted 
of racketeering and ordering castellitos killing 
in 1984 a federal judge removed 560s executive board and 
placed the local under a trustee to end a quartercentury of 
organized crime domination 
it was the first such action in us history 
this labor day finds local 560 in its 26th month under the 
trustee edwin stier but the trusteeship is scheduled to end dec 
6 the date stier set for 560s first contested election since 
1965 the last year anyone ran against the provenzanos 
whats happening here is exactly what we wanted said stier 
the candidates are going to each barn and campaigning in an open 
election 
but in the barns as the sprawling truck depots are known the 
trusteeship has not pleased many members 
some at first welcomed the efforts to exorcise corruption but 
grew wary when us attorney rudolph giuliani of new york recently 
sued to place a trusteeship over the international brotherhood of 
teamsters 
we are keeping a sharp eye on events over the river said a 
federal prosecutor in new york who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a smooth transition back to union control of the local could mean 
a lot to our case against the international 
three men are running for president of the 8000member local 
the teamsters largest michael sciarra of the teamsters for 
liberty who served on the ousted board russ viggiani a local 560 
business agent and head of teamsters for solidarity and ray 
carney a trucker who ran against anthony provenzano in 1965 and 
leader of the committee for the united ticket 
the government had sought to bar sciarra from running saying 
the local would again be dominated by organized crime under his 
leadership 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise is expected to rule 
soon on the government motion 
after us district judge harold a ackerman ordered the ouster 
of the locals leadership sciarra served as interim president for 
two years until june 1986 when appeals were exhausted 
the goverments case against sciarra rests partly on secretly 
recorded tapes of conversations 
the tapes made public during hearings allegedly depict 
genovese captain matthew matty the horse ianiello telling a 
former local 560 official that sciarra should take over the 
union after the trusteeship 
sciarra has denied any link to organized crime or any intention 
to take orders from anyone once elected though he declined to be 
interviewed he authorized union member and friend al laurie to 
speak for him 
laurie said the tape transcripts are unclear about the subject 
being discussed and who is speaking 
apparently from what we read of the transcripts there is the 
indication that the things being said there were completely 
contrary to some of the things the government is trying to prove 
laurie said 
whether or not the 55yearold sciarra is permitted to run 
laurie said teamsters for liberty will have a candidate 
mike has been president before and hes qualified to step 
right into that job laurie said members may not realize that 
this isnt a personality contest this is about bread and butter 
and about the pension and welfare fund which is now about 230 
million 
stier who has taken no official position on sciarras 
participation agrees sciarra is probably the frontrunner but 
that carney has made inroads 
sciarras two opponents concerned about the possible backlash 
that barring sciarra could create say they would like him to run 
viggiani 48 said he believes the intimidation of the 
provenzano years still remains though more subtle 
there are still members concerned with reprisals who are not 
openly supportive of an opposing ticket he said 
stier said that intimidation has been only minor at this 
point members understand if that starts to develop it could 
seriously hurt the chances for an election he said 
carney 58 admits that sciarra has more experience because of 
his 14 years in union office 
but thats why were where we are today he said im a 
truck driver and i want to give this union back to the members 
they should have a voice and know where their money is going

george bush and michael dukakis are locked in 
an extremely tight race for the white house as the fall campaign 
opens with the vice president hoping to sustain his late summer 
surge and his democratic rival angling to regain the momentum 
according to an associated press survey of the 50 states 
advisers to both men as well as politicians around the country 
say they expect a close race right up to election day on november 8 
its going to be down and dirty to the very end said 
republican state rep tom ryder of illinois a key battleground 
where republicans concede that dukakis maintains a slight edge 
in delaware as in the rest of the country theres been a 
substantial shift in the last three weeks from dukakis to bush 
said the states gop gov michael n castle i think it started 
at the republican national convention as to be expected but 
since the convention its continued even with the problems 
surrounding the dan quayle candidacy 
the latesummer surge by bush eroded dukakis earlier advantages 
in key electoral college battlegrounds from california to new 
jersey with illinois ohio and michigan in between say leaders in 
both political parties the result is a series of tight bigstates 
races whose outcome will likely determine ronald reagans successor 
in the white house 
dukakis selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen as his vice 
presidential running mate transformed bushs adopted home state and 
its 29 electoral votes into an instant tossup but bush has 
countered elsewhere the vice president seemingly has moved ahead 
in florida with 21 electoral votes as well as making up ground in 
the industrial midwest one poll in massachusetts even rated 
dukakis home state a tossup though the ap survey still found the 
state to be solid ground for dukakis 
in small states and large politicians report a close contest 
that is unlikely to be decided until the final few days campaign 
debates and unexpected international events could have a dramatic 
influence on the outcome 
id say right now its a flip of the coin said former iowa 
democratic chairman ed campbell reflecting the sentiment of party 
professionals around the country it could go either way 
senior officials of the two campaigns pronounce themselves 
pleased with the shape of the race 
said susan estrich dukakis campaign manager nationally 
were competitive states will go up and down its exactly where 
we thought it would be this is a very evenly matched contest 
we all felt like wed be lucky if we were in the single 
digits meaning seven eight or nine points behind by labor day 
said lee atwater bushs campaign manager 
officials in both camps agree that the race is subject to sharp 
swings especially since neither candidate is an incumbent that 
heightens the importance of debates the subject of negotiations 
between the two campaigns with dukakis seeking more and bush less 
it also could heighten the effect of any mistakes by either of the 
candidates or their running mates democratic sen bentsen and 
republican sen dan quayle 
rich bond a senior aide in the bush camp says the race shapes 
up this way basically youve got a tight race with the south 
looking pretty much george bushs way the west with the exception 
of the coast california oregon and washington is heading our 
way but cant be taken for granted 
bond estimated that bush heads into the race armed with a solid 
150 to 200 electoral votes principally from southern and rocky 
mountain states and that dukakis probably can count on a base of 
150 electoral votes largely from the northeast 
democrats believe they can win electoral votes from each region 
of the country and note that bentsens addition to the ticket 
makes texas and its 29 electoral votes an extremely competitive 
race dukakis adviser tom kiley puts each candidates reliable base 
at closer to 100 electoral college votes 
even so recent opinion polls indicate a dwindling advantage for 
dukakis in states he has long counted in his column including 
maryland and west virginia as well as massachusetts 
charlie baker who is in charge of dukakis field organization 
said the democratic goal is to keep the race competitive in 45 or 
46 states so that if the republicans have a bad week they can 
lose in any of them and i think we can keep it that close 
he said 
it takes 270 electoral votes to win the white house and 
republicans have won four of the last five elections with solid 
southern and western support jimmy carter a southerner is the 
only democrat to break the republican string of victories in the 
last 20 years 
with nine weeks until election day these are some straws in the 
wind 
california the biggest state with 47 electoral votes is 
viewed by both sides as a tossup with a slight initial edge to 
dukakis the state was a tie in one recent poll dukakis led in one 
recent poll in oregon and washington was a tie in another 
republicans express confidence they can virtually sweep the 
rocky mountain region democrats hope to steal a state or two 
perhaps colorado new mexico or montana 
the deep south looks strong for the republicans but dukakis 
selection of bentsen already has forced bush to devote several days 
to campaigning in texas dukakis hopes to peel away a border state 
or two and maybe even challenge in north carolina 
the northeast is dukakis home region and his strongest from 
new york to massachusetts to maryland both sides give the democrat 
the early edge in pennsylvania new jersey and connecticut have 
recent republican histories but are key targets for both 
candidates 
the midwest is wide open although quayles spot on the 
republican ticket ended any talk of a democratic surprise in 
indiana aside from illinois michigan and ohio dukakis is viewed 
as the strong leader in minnesota and ahead less convincingly in 
wisconsin and iowa bush led by 9 percentage points in a recent 
missouri poll but republicans rushed to say they doubted either 
candidate could carry the state by that much republicans expect to 
carry nebraska and kansas 
democrats say they have spent the past several weeks 
methodically building a field organization preparing television 
commercials and mapping out their fall campaign and that the race 
wont be decided until the final days of the campaign 
but where the democrats sounded optimistic 10 weeks ago now it 
is the republicans who have been heartened by their candidates 
latesummer offensive 
republicans concede dukakis probably has the lead in illinois 
and a narrow advantage in michigan and ohio for the moment

both people and lightningsensitive industries 
may be in more danger than they realize according to a researcher 
who says the hazards of electrical storms have been underestimated 
lightning strikes the earth much more often than weather records 
based on observers reports indicate says stanley a changnon in 
the journal of geophysical researchatmospheres 
those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage 
for example nuclear power plants have had to use data based on 
thunder records to develop their risk analyses changnon said 
in a telephone interview 
its very clear that thunder rather dramatically 
underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point 
changnon discovered by using electromagnetic detectors to record 
actual cloudtoground flashes that between 22 percent and 40 
percent of lightning flashes occurred at times when no thunder was 
heard 
it is not good news he concluded 
changnon a researcher affiliated with the illinois state water 
survey also teaches at the university of rochester in rochester 
ny his report was done in conjunction with his son david 
changnon of colorado state university and richard b pyle of the 
state university of new york at albany 
detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s 
changnon explained but they have always depended on the reports of 
trained observers primarily listening to the thunder generated by 
lightning 
in recent years however electromagnetic detectors have been 
installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes 
the researchers compared reports by weather observers with the 
lightning records from sensors used by the federal bureau of land 
management in western states and by electrical utilities along the 
eastern seaboard 
the degree of relationship is relatively weak changnon 
reported it gives one a lot of pause in many respects about 
how the atmosphere works how good our weather records are and how 
safe we are 
in the west changnon reported between 31 percent and 40 
percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening 
for thunder 
the situation was better in the east with 22 percent to 26 
percent of lightning strokes being missed the report said 
the differences are very marked between the east and west 
changnon said this occurs at least in part because it is more 
difficult to hear thunder in mountainous areas he said 
another batch of the missed lightning strokes occurs before a 
storm is reported in an area he said 
people sometimes say lightning comes out of the blue its not 
necessarily out of the blue just the front edge of a new or 
fastmoving storm he said 
the study also confirmed that lightning varies considerably from 
storm to storm 
more than half of all electrical storms had only a few 
cloudtoground lightning flashes while a small number of storms 
had hundreds of strokes 
indeed in washington dc records for three years showed that 
nearly onequarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted for 
in just two big storms 
the researchers also found a considerable number of 
thunderstorms with no cloudtoground lightning cloudtocloud 
lightning is blamed for the thunder in those cases changnon said 
that is more common in the west where storm clouds tend to be 
higher above the ground than in the east 
lightning killed 86 americans last year the highest death toll 
in this decade according to records kept by the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration 
and the 365 lightningrelated injuries reported across the 
nation were nearly 50 percent more than the longterm average the 
agency said 
as usual florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last 
year tennessee ranked second with six followed by five in new 
mexico and four each in alabama arkansas minnesota mississippi 
new york and north carolina 
colorado georgia illinois louisiana maryland new jersey 
oklahoma and south carolina each recorded three fatalities there 
were two each in arizona kentucky missouri utah and virginia 
kansas montana north dakota pennsylvania south dakota and 
the district of columbia each recorded a single lightning death for 
the year

the next president should set up a water 
council in his executive office to coordinate federal water 
policy which is now fragmented among several agencies a harvard 
university study recommends 
such a council should include representatives of the states and 
should be headed by a chairman free of ties to existing 
departments said a paper from the harvard water policy project 
part of the energy and environment program at the universitys john 
f kennedy school of government 
the new council would derive its principal influence from its 
direct relationship with the president the paper said 
the absence of such an entity at present has led to the 
intolerable situation of no agency within the executive branch 
currently responsible for taking a comprehensive view of federal 
water programs 
the report was written by peter p rogers professor of 
environmental engineering and city planning and charles hw 
foster adjunct research fellow and environment secretary in the 
administration of massachusetts republican gov frank sargent in 
19711975 
the project was supported by grants from resources for the 
future a washington thinktank which released the report last week 
several previous attempts to coordinate federal water policy 
have failed most recently a statutory interagency water 
resources council of cabinet secretaries was formed in 1965 to 
oversee planning but was killed by agreement of the reagan 
administration and congress in 1981 
reagans cabinet council on natural resources which tried to do 
some of the same work proved ineffectual and became essentially 
nonfunctional after its principal enthusiast interior secretary 
james watt left office 
in an interview from cambridge mass rogers said the water 
resources council moved in on agency programs and the agencies 
quite properly went to congress 
the new council he said should stay out of agency turf 
and try to pull the policy debates out of the agencies where 
people are debating themselves and put them in a forum where they 
debate other agencies 
by default the office of management and budget is now the chief 
coordinating agency and omb a white house agency strongly 
opposes creation of a new council on the grounds that everybody 
wants a connection to the president rogers said 
we have a colossal federal establishment 60000 or 70000 
employees working on water subjects he said they ought to be 
doing things that fit into some plan 
its not the most urgent issue facing the incoming president 
but if we dont do something the issues are going to just sit 
there

thousands of protesters battled police 
following the largest antigovernment rally since the military 
nominated rightwing president augusto pinochet as the only 
candidate in a fall presidential referendum 
more than 100000 people packed blocks of a broad avenue in 
central santiago on sunday chanting pinochets going to fall 
police arrested 262 demonstrators and a police officer and eight 
civilians were wounded said gen sergio badiola the governor of 
santiago he said six of the injured including the policeman were 
seriously hurt 
police fired tear gas buckshot and water cannons when tens of 
thousands of people began a march on the government palace after 
the generally peaceful rally had ended 
organizers said 300000 people attended the rally and 
journalists estimated the crowd at more than 100000 
gen pinochet the 72yearold army commander who has ruled 
chile with a military junta since a coup in september 1973 was 
selected last tuesday by himself and the commanders of the navy 
air force and national police as the sole candidate in the 
presidential referendum scheduled for oct 5 
sundays rally was the largest show of force by the opposition 
since pinochet seeking popular support lifted on aug 27 the 
state of emergency that restricted public gatherings 
there had been scattered street demonstrations after pinochets 
nomination was announced tuesday and three people were shot to 
death and hundreds were arrested 
hector moya the main speaker at sundays rally told the 
cheering crowd we can now clearly see that the pinochet regime 
already has been defeated moya is the head of the truckers 
union 
when the rally ended a column of tens of thousands of people 
marched to the citys center blocking traffic police broke up the 
procession and there were skirmishes throughout the area between 
rockthrowing demonstrators and police firing birdshot and tear gas 
pinochet in an open letter to the men and women of my 
country printed sunday in most local newspapers promised full 
democracy if he is returned to office in the referendum 
if chileans call me to govern each one of them will govern 
too the letter said 
in an interview printed sunday in the conservative newspaper el 
mercurio pinochet also promised to resign as army commander and 
govern as a civilian 
chiles 72 million voters are to vote either for or against 
pinochet in the referendum 
if approved pinochet will begin a new eightyear term in march 
if rejected an open presidential election is to be held in 
december 1989 with pinochet remaining in power until an elected 
president takes office 
pinochet led the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected 
government of marxist president salvador allende 
ricardo lagos a socialist opposition leader called the rally 
the first step toward the final defeat of pinochet 
rally participants including chileans who have returned from 
exile sang and danced to political songs 
among the former exiles was isabel allende 44 a daughter of 
the late president who died during the coup she received a huge 
ovation when her name was announced and joined in the dancing with 
lagos 
pinochet on thursday decreed an end to political exile

vice presidential candidates lloyd bentsen and 
dan quayle are in sharp contrast when it comes to two of the more 
valuable congressional fringe benefits speaking fees and free 
trips 
in the last six years quayle a republican senator from 
indiana reported honoraria earnings of 250050 from speechmaking 
and another 4830 from writing articles 
bentsen a democratic senator from texas accepted absolutely 
nothing for outside speaking and writing according to the required 
financial disclosure statements covering 1982 through 1987 
this doesnt mean that bentsen the chairman of the taxwriting 
finance committee isnt popular on the speechmaking circuit its 
because he is one of a handful of senators who decline to take 
honoraria 
quayles receipts put him in the mainstream of the senate where 
most members routinely pick up 1000 to 2000 a speech from trade 
associations corporations nonprofit groups think tanks and 
universities 
the only restriction in the senate on such outside income is 
that if a members speech and writing fees total more than 40 
percent of the official salary 89500 the excess must be given 
to a bona fide charity 
quayles 19821987 disclosure forms also show that he was far 
ahead of bentsen in getting free trips air fare lodging and 
sometimes meals often in connection with a paid speech 
the indianian reported 44 expensepaid excursions including 
destinations in florida and hawaii in the same six years bentsen 
took four free trips three to his home state the fourth to 
modesto calif 
the two rivals showed parity in one fringebenefit area gifts 
bentsen listed two gifts each a steuben glass sculpture with a 
combined value of 2750 quayles 2436 in gifts were in the form 
of golf equipment and clothing including 825 worth in 1987 from 
pro golfer fuzzy zoeller a fellow indianian quayle is an avid 
lowhandicap golfer 
quayles top honoraria year was 1983 when he got 54150 for 50 
speeches and 1500 for an article for the institute for 
socioeconometric studies there was no limit then on how much a 
senator could keep 
quayle gave 1250 of his 1983 speaking fees to charity the 
same amount as in 1982 when his honoraria totaled 40650 
including 1000 from his alma mater depauw university for one of 
his 38 paid speeches 
a 30 percentofsalary limit was in effect for 1984 when he 
made 25 speeches received 26700 and gave 4930 to charity in 
1985 he got 32600 from 28 speeches 40 from one article and 
gave 10277 to charity 
the following year with a 40 percent limit he gave 19991 to 
charity after earning 49400 from 37 speeches and 585 from three 
articles last year he got 46900 from 35 speeches and 2355 
from nine articles and gave 14302 to charity 
during the six years quayle spoke most often to the brookings 
institution a washington think tank his 21 appearances there 
brought him 6600 
quayle was popular with the grocery manufacturers of america 
making a speech to the trade association in 1982 for 1000 and in 
1984 1986 and 1987 for 2000 each of those years 
he also received pay for speaking to defense contractors drug 
companies and health care associations he is a member of the armed 
services and labor and human services committees which handle 
defense and health care issues 
quayle received speaking fees on 35 of the 44 free trips he made 
during the six years 
there was no speaking money on a fiveday stay in hawaii with 
his wife in 1982 compliments of the association of steel 
distributors he did get 1500 for a speech on a trip to palm 
beach fla that year paid for by the independent bankers 
association 
his peak travel year was 1983 with 15 trips including three 
nights in orlando fla and a 2000 honoraria from the 
american medical association other free destinations that year 
included miami with magnavox electronic systems inc and west palm 
beach fla with chase manhattan bank 
six trips in 1984 included three nights in west palm beach with 
his wife united technologies picked up two nights lodging the 
airfares and the third night were paid by the indiana constructors 
association 
after a quiet onetrip year in 1985 he made three in 1986 
including three nights at an arizona tennis resort for the 13th 
annual senators cup charity event from there the outdoor 
advertising association of america flew the quayles to palm 
springs calif for three days 
last year there were eight free trips including charity sports 
events in park city utah and sun valley idaho he also received 
a sixnight stay in monterey calif from atampt four nights in ft 
myers fla from the electronic industries association and a day 
trip to white sulphur springs wva from the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association which paid 2000 for a speech 
each of bentsens four trips was reported as a oneday 
excursion in 1985 the west central texas oil and gas association 
took him to abilene texas the following year he went to modesto 
with the national venture capital association to houston with the 
forum club of houston and to dallas with the national association

archbishop desmond tutu 
saying he was obeying god in defying the government urged 
blacks and whites to boycott next months nationwide but segregated 
municipal elections 
elsewhere on sunday black activist winnie mandela also violated 
state of emergency rules by calling for increased international 
economic sanctions against south africa 
tutu in a service at st georges cathedral in cape town 
described the elections as ludicrous and unjust and said 
the government was attempting to force participation 
i urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the october 
elections and i hope that white anglicans would join their black 
fellow anglicans in that action said tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize 
i am aware of the penalties attached to this call i am not 
defying the government i am obeying god the black churchman 
said 
whites blacks asians and people of mixedrace will hold 
separate elections oct 26 to choose local officials the black 
majority has no vote in national affairs although the nations 26 
million blacks make up about 75 percent of south africas 
population 
under the 26monthold state of emergency it is illegal to call 
for an election boycott in south africa if convicted violators 
may be fined or imprisoned 
in the 1984 municipal elections antiapartheid groups promoted 
election boycotts and only about 10 percent of eligible black 
voters went to the polls 
many black activists view black elected officials as 
collaborators with the whitedominated government and its apartheid 
policies of racial separation 
tutu said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate 
nonviolent way of expressing our opposition to the evil and 
injustice of apartheid 
you cannot get security through the barrel of a gun nor 
through the draconian and oppressive state of emergency he said 
tutu spoke at a special service to install canon colin jones as 
dean of st georges cathedral jones 37 becomes the first black 
to serve in the post he spent last year in portland ore and 
most recently was the chaplin at the university of the western 
cape a mixedrace school 
minister of law and order adriaan vlok has threatened to clamp 
down on antiapartheid clergymen 
we must clip their wings as we clipped those of the 19 
revolutionary and activist organizations vlok said on friday in 
reference to the governments february decision banning most 
leading antiapartheid groups 
antigovernment church leaders were among the few prominent 
resistence figures spared in the crackdown and they now are the 
most visible domestic opponents of the government 
mrs mandela called for increased economic sanctions in a speech 
at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
when we call for sanctions when we call for disinvestment 
from this country it is because we are looking for those peaceful 
measures as an alternative to the structural violence of the state 
we see today she said 
mrs mandela spoke to 400 people gathered to mark the 
publication of a biography on her husband jailed african national 
congress leader nelson mandela the book entitled higher than 
hope was written by south african academic fatima meer who also 
was present 
the 70yearold mandela south africas best known black leader 
is in a cape town clinic recuperating from tuberculosis 
he has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government 
the anc is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule

three years ago susan shapiro refused to 
stand for the pledge of allegiance in her high school class and 
caused a nationwide stir today she still gets hate mail heckled 
on the street and drawn into an occasional fistfight 
shapiro now a 20yearold hairdresser says the memory of her 
yearlong rebellion at randolph high school remains strong 
residents of this town 13 miles south of boston will always 
remember she says 
hostile letters still trickle in every month shapiro says an 
anonymous letter arrives from connecticut with a small flag sticker 
the author usually writes watch out well never forget the 
people never forget said shapiro whose defiance was not 
directly related to gov michael dukakis 1977 veto of an amendment 
that would have required massachusetts teachers to lead their 
classes in the pledge of allegiance 
the controversy began during shapiros junior year in 1984 she 
said one of her teachers explained that students need not stand for 
the pledge of allegiance unless they wanted to 
shapiro said she and half of her class decided to not stand she 
said she considers herself patriotic but does not believe that 
the american flag is a symbol of the american people 
but when shapiro entered her senior year a teacher took issue 
with her decision to remain seated 
she told me i was spitting on the american flag i asked 
her how would you like it if i spit on you shapiro recalled 
during a recent interview at her home in randolph where she lives 
with her parents and her older brother 
the incident found its way into a local newspaper within days 
shapiro was interviewed by national publications and the television 
networks 
but the publicity boomeranged and shapiro found herself the 
target of hate letters death threats and near assaults 
in one incident a grenadelike device exploded on the lawn of 
the shapiro family home a modest ranchstyle house on a treelined 
street the explosion burned a 6inch patch of the front lawn but 
caused no injuries 
for a while i couldnt go to school shapiro said i got a 
lot of death threats 
shapiro skipped her prom and graduation because of the furor 
but all year long when she did attend school she refused to stand 
up during the daily pledge of allegiance 
shapiro and her mother harriet keep a box of the letters from 
the height of the controversy some were supportive such as ones 
from vietnam veterans who encouraged her 
mrs shapiro also backed her daughters defiance were 
patriots we dont hate this country my husband and brother are 
veterans she said 
but feelings against shapiro ran high many letters carried 
swastikas many were obscene the outside of one letter warns that 
the postal carrier might not want to deliver to these people 
you utter creep i hope someone blows you up another said 
shapiro is cynical about the recent political flap between 
dukakis and presidential rival george bush over dukakis 1977 veto 
i just wonder where dukakis was when this was happening to 
me she says 
today shapiro is content to remain in town working at a local 
mall as a hairdresser though she still gets heckled she said she 
now knows how to defend herself she said shes been in four 
fistfights since 1985 
who wins 
me i make my point she said

mayor bud clark says the dress as you 
please day is no longer a fashion hit and decided not to observe 
the day of casual attire this year 
clark proclaimed a day for casual dress his first year as mayor 
and drew nationwide attention similar observances followed in 1986 
and 1987 but fewer and fewer downtown workers took part 
clarks top aide charles p duffy says theres simply been no 
demand for it this year 
if people really wanted it wed do it but weve only had one 
phone call asking about it duffy said last week 
some events are just onetime happenings duffy said and 
dress as you please day probably should have been one of them 
but former police chief ron still clarks challenger in this 
falls election insists clark dropped the event this year in an 
effort to present a more conservative image to the electorate 
though the official observance of casual dress may be dead some 
employees keep it alive at city hall where air conditioning is 
unknown 
the city auditor allows shorts in the office when the mercury 
tops 90 degrees as it did last week

eastern airlines will lay off 4000 workers 
saturday now that the financially troubled carrier has posted a 
47 million bond with a federal court in case unions battling the 
cuts win their case 
the bond was posted late saturday airline spokeswoman virginia 
sanchez said sunday 
the layoffs will be effective september 10 at the end of the 
employees normal shift ms sanchez said we really dont know 
what the exact number of employees will be some may take early 
retirement there are different options 
no union spokesmen could be reached for comment late sunday 
but spokesmen earlier had said they eventually would win their 
case 
we strongly believe that the earlier ruling will be upheld 
said charles bryan president of the miami local of the machinists 
union 
the airline in july announced plans for the layoffs and service 
cutbacks in 14 cities 
the unions however contend that texas air corp easterns 
parent company is stripping the miamibased carriers assets in 
favor of sister carrier continental airlines eastern has lost 
about 1 billion during the past decade 
the three main unions sued when the layoff plans the largest in 
easterns 60year history were announced those affected include 
management about 1000 flight attendants 1000 machinists and 500 
pilots 
on friday the us court of appeals dissolved an order by us 
district judge barrington parker in washington dc who ruled 
that eastern could proceed with the service cuts but could not lay 
off union members 
the appeals court said the carrier would have to post the bond 
to cover a month of paychecks should the unions win 
after the machinists union balked at pay and benefit cuts 
eastern asked federal mediators to declare contract talks at an 
impasse if mediators who have been involved off and on since 
january make the declaration and no agreement is reached after a 
30day cooling off period the unions could strike and eastern 
could impose its terms on workers 
machinists union members are to vote sept 15 on a company

solidarity chairman lech walesa defended 
ending polands most serious strike wave in seven years as the only 
chance to legalize the independent union movement and said he 
would not tolerate wildcat strikes 
walesa before 4000 people in gdansk on sunday responded to 
solidarity supporters who accused him of agreeing too easily to end 
the strikes and should first have secured a firm agreement from 
authorities on legalization 
there is no other way i must take this chance and i will 
he said i put out the strikes and i will put out the next ones 
i have not betrayed the people 
the occupation strikes which began aug 16 ended saturday at 
walesas urging three days earlier senior government officials 
met with walesa and promised roundtable talks on legalizing 
solidarity in exchange for an end to the labor unrest 
the meeting was the first of its kind since communist 
authorities banned solidarity with a december 1981 military 
crackdown that ended the 15month heyday of the only independent 
labor movement ever allowed in the soviet bloc 
walesa spoke to supporters in the courtyard of st brygidas 
roman catholic church after an emotional prosolidarity mass 
to those who criticize me stop it walesa saidsuch 
decisions are demanded by higher necessity they authorities 
spat on me and now i am extending my hand because there is a chance 
to make poland into poland 
walesa met with about a dozen top advisers on sunday to discuss 
the composition of a proposed workers delegation to the government 
talks which in addition to focusing on solidarity also would 
address jointly confronting lifting poland out of economic 
stagnation 
government spokesman jerzy urban has said an end to strikes 
would automatically mean convening the talks 
the strikes ended saturday when about 250 strikers carrying a 
solidarity banner walked out of the july manifesto coal mine in 
upper silesia and 2400 bus and dock workers cut short strikes in 
the northern port of szczecin 
at their peak the strikes affected 20 enterprises with 100000 
employees polands two biggest ports were virtually shut down and 
production of coal from the silesia region a vital source of hard 
currency was sharply reduced 
miners at the july manifesto mine started the wave of strikes 
disgruntled by paychecks they said fell short of expected raises 
they demanded better working conditions and compensation for 60 
percent inflation 
but like other workers around the country who quickly joined in 
the strikes their no 1 demand was the restoration of solidaritys 
legal status 
communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unions 
in an agreement signed aug 31 1980 in gdansk opening the way to 
legal registration of the solidarity trade union federation 
on sunday tens of thousands of supporters of the banned rural 
solidarity union gathered for a mass at the jasna gora monastery in 
the southern city of czestochowa 
farmers orginally belonged to the main solidarity federation 
but won their own union in may 1981 it also was outlawed after 
martial law

a government report says sweatshops thought 
to be a thing of the past in american labor continue to exist in 
the united states 
the general accounting office report released sunday cited 
restaurants and related businesses apparel manufacturing and 
meatprocessing industries as the worst offenders 
i think most americans believe sweatshops vanished generations 
ago but they are here today in all parts of the country said 
rep charles e schumer dny who had requested the study in a 
statement released with the report 
schumer also said he supported the reports conclusion that 
penalties for labor law violations must be increased to deter 
abuses 
the report based on interviews with 100 state and local 
officials nationwide between january and may 1988 said restaurant 
and apparel sweatshops were more likely to be populated by 
hispanics and asians workers 
the report also cited some of the same reasons for multiple 
laborlaw violations that were given in the 19th century a large 
immigrant work force and low profit margins in laborintensive 
industries

a taxpayers group says that more and more 
former members of congress will become millionaires in retirement 
the national taxpayers union said sunday former rep ben reifel 
of south dakota joins a former maine senator this month as the 
first members of congress to receive 1 million in government 
retirement pay 
while most americans can only dream of a million dollars in 
retirement income dozens of retired legislators will soon become 
pension millionaires said david keating executive vice 
president of the taxpayers group in a news release 
keating said reifel will receive a september pension check for 
6966 giving the former fiveterm republican more than 1 million 
since he retired from congress in 1971 
in may former republican sen margaret chase smith became the 
first senator to get a millionaire pension said keating 
congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that 
includes the average congressional salary over the last three 
years and the group predicted that a proposed increase in 
congressional pay to 135000 next year would greatly increase the 
number of milliondollar pensions

flying across this nation it is 
virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally 
ribbon the landscape there are just vast seas of muddy brown water 
and millions of stranded people 
floods have inundated threequarters of bangladesh and cut 
transportation links from its major port to the capital and other 
interior cities officials say though adding today that flood 
waters on three major rivers were receding 
in dhaka flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years 
and covered threefourths of the capital 
dhaka newspapers today reported 60 more deaths bringing the 
toll to at least 942 since june when rivers began overflowing 
their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this impoverished nation 
of 110 million people 
the government count of 333 dead is widely considered low 
millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy 
probably contaminated water and 83000 people nationwide have 
contracted diarrheal diseases said health minister abdul munim 
he said 65 people have died of the diseases so far 
it is a calamity information minister mahbubur rahman told 
reporters sunday night it is a havoccreating menacing flood 
flying in an airplane across bangladesh sunday from the indian 
border to dhaka even the civilian pilot couldnt differentiate 
between the rivers and the flood waters 
ive never seen anything like it before said ghias ahmad 
who has been flying over his country for 19 years 
the waters swallowed up entire villages occasionally tin roofs 
glinted in the sunlight the houses beneath them completely 
submerged 
on a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road 
still above water people milled idly small boats beached beside 
them 
the ganges and brahmaputra rivers and their dozens of 
tributaries flow from india and through bangladesh to the bay of 
bengal 
the rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in 
bangladesh and india last year the flooding in bangladesh killed 
about 1500 people 
this season some refugees have found shelter in relief centers 
or relatives homes said government officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity but they estimated that at least 20 million 
people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small 
outcroppings of high ground with few supplies 
wells and pumps are flooded officials said and flood water 
which is probably impure is the only source of drinking water 
the central government has appealed for foreign aid including 
boats helicopters and 3 million tons of grain 
officials today reported water levels falling on the 
brahmaputra ganges and meghna rivers but relief officials cannot 
reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely 
broken down 
shortages of medicine cooked food and drinking water is 
causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people a relief 
ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
the information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and 
could prevent planting of the winter rice crop he said this might 
lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice 
the minister said bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a 
year to feed its people he said 165 million tons are grown at 
home and 15 million imported 
in dhaka a city of 6 million people gasoline has become scarce 
for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets many gas 
stations are closed 
boats have replaced cars and bicyclepowered rickshaws in many 
parts of the city river boats capable of carrying 100 to 200 
people sail between partly submerged houses in lowlying 
neighborhoods flooded by the buriganga turag and sitalakhya rivers 
that surround dhaka on three sides 
many of the capitals streets are kneedeep and waistdeep in 
murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage and 
adults and children alike wade through it 
over the last week the price of rice nearly doubled from 15 
cents a pound to 28 cents as those who could afford it started 
hoarding

investigators concluded work at the site 
of the delta air lines jetliner crash that killed 13 of the 108 
people aboard refusing to comment about reports that two engines 
may have failed 
some pilots speculated that two of the boeing 727s three 
engines may have failed because the wing flaps apparently were 
retracted at the time of the crash rather than extended for 
takeoff the dallas morning news reported sunday 
when someone says engine failure there are a whole host of 
things that might mean lee dickinson of the national 
transportation safety board said sunday one of the things i will 
not do is speculate on anything 
a recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine 
failure two loud pops were then heard which could have indicated 
a compressor stall but dickinson said a compressor stall 
which occurs when an engine is starving for air is not critical 
keep in mind compressor stall is not serious its a hiccup 
flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff wednesday at 
dallasfort worth international airport on a flight for salt lake 
city 
on sunday workers at the crash site sealed the cockpit in a 
plastic blue tarpaulin the wreckage was to be hauled to delta 
headquarters in atlanta where it would be dismantled and studied 
dickinson said 
two flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and questioned 
but dickinson said he had no information on what they told 
investigators 
the role of the wing flaps which are extended during takeoff to 
provide added lift continued to be discussed 
flight engineer stephen judd has told investigators the flaps 
were extended in the proper position upon takeoff but evidence 
from the wreckage indicates the flaps were completely or almost 
completely retracted 
we have further verification that the flaps were retracted 
dickinson said sunday 
bill melvin a delta pilot participating in the investigation on 
behalf of the air line pilots association said he believes flight 
1141s pilot could have been facing engine failure and decided to 
retract the flaps in a lastditch effort to save the plane 
a 727 will still fly if it loses one engine but all 727 
pilots know if you lose two engines the only way you can fly the 
plane off is to get rid of the flaps melvin said noting the 
manuever is not an approved emergency procedure with two engines 
out theres only one way that plane could fly with the flaps 
up 
dickinson said he didnt know what the procedure for the pilot 
would have been if both engines failed each airline has 
different operations as you know we will be documenting deltas 
procedure 
the 48yearold pilot larry davis remained hospitalized today 
and has been visited at parkland memorial hospital by other 
survivors offering thanks for the way he handled the crash 
enabling 95 people to survive 
davis is scheduled to under surgery tuesday to have a metal 
plate implanted under his left eye said his 21yearold daughter 
christie he suffered numerous facial fractures and a back injury 
he realizes that its god that did the miracle ms davis 
said sunday god is the reason that hes alive theres something 
that god has planned for him

north korea said today that it has no intention of 
disrupting the 24th olympic games which begin in seoul on sept 
17 and said any incident or sabotage will have nothing to do 
with us 
a north korean foreign ministry statement said we hereby make 
it clear that we do not have the slightest intention to obstruct 
the progress of the games or threaten them by force of arms 
if anything happens in south korea during the olympic games 
it will have nothing to do with us and the united states and the 
south korean authorities themselves should be held responsible for 
it said the statement 
it was carried by the norths official korean central news 
agency which was monitored in tokyo 
the statement said north korea announced last saturday that it 
would not participate in the olympics because of south korean and 
us efforts to manipulate the games into permanently dividing the 
two koreas 
the communist north south koreas bitter rival since the 
195053 korean war had demanded to cohost the games the 
international olympic committee has rejected the demand saying the 
games are awarded to only one city 
pyongyang spurned an ioc offer that it host all or part of five 
sports 
south korean authorities have said they fear north korea might 
stage terrorist attacks to interrupt the games which are seen as 
an unparalleled chance for south korea to gain worldwide stature 
and exposure 
several times in recent years shooting has occurred across the 
tense demilitarized zone that divides the two countries 
and in november a korean jetliner disappeared near burma with 
all 115 people aboard believed to have died a selfdescribed north 
korean agent said she helped plant a bomb aboard the plane to 
disrupt south koreas presidential elections and the olympics 
as for terrorism it is utterly alien to us and the united 
states itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already 
exposed to the world the nnorths foreign ministry statement 
said 
we have no intention to invade the south and this is fully 
borne out by the historical facts over the last 35 years since 
the korean war ceasefire the statement said 
it also accused south korea the united states and japan of 
creating tension on the troubled korean peninsula through various 
military exercises as an excuse to invade north korea 
they are abusing the name of olympics for stepping up the 
preparations for a war of aggression against our republic and 
plainly shows their scheme to cause a shocking incident and start 
another war in korea in case the games do not go as they wish 
the statement said 
the united states maintains about 42000 troops in south korea 
and is planning to hold naval exercises off the korean peninsula 
during the games to deter any attacks from outside

a week after disaster struck a west 
german air show europes top aviation event opened with a soviet 
cargo plane aborting takeoff when flames shot from one of its 
engines 100 yards from spectators 
the flames flared 20 feet from a port engine of the 
blueandwhite antonov124 cargo carrier and a loud bang followed 
as the worlds heaviest aircraft began its takeoff sunday before 
10000 spectators 
a pilot cut the three other jet engines and halted the 400ton 
aircraft of the soviet aeroflot state airline no one was injured 
a soviet official speaking on condition of anonymity promised 
that the 400ton plane would fly again at the farnborough air show 
before the end of the week he gave no cause for mishap 
the official soviet news agency tass said today a loud bang 
was heard all of a sudden during the run literally several seconds 
before the takeoff a small flame appearing in one of the engines 
though everything ended smoothly the crew took a decision to put 
off the flight 
experts at air show europes main aviation showcase said the 
engine must have stopped combustion as maximum fuel was pumped 
through for a short takeoff to impress the crowds 
before the aborted takeoff the soviets thrilled firstday 
spectators with displays by their mig29s 
organizers stressed that safety regulations at farnborough 35 
miles southwest of london were stringent 
their comments came after the aug 28 disaster at the us air 
force base at ramstein west germany three italian jets collided 
during an aerobatics display at a ramstein air show and one of the 
aircraft hurtled in flames into spectators killing more than 50 
and injuring more than 300 
the display aircraft at farnborough all had to fly away from the 
crowd and most performed alone all the aircraft were inspected by 
the organizers before takeoff 
the two migs the first advanced soviet combat aircraft to take 
part in a western display took star billing 
one of the twintailed fighters painted in camouflage gray 
zoomed 3000 feet into the sky from takeoff then fell backward 
nose still pointing up before gasping spectators the pilot forced 
the nose down pulling the aircraft into level flight in a maneuver 
known as tailslide 
in a 3hour display in clear balmy weather west european and 
american combat and civil aircraft also went through their paces 
mainly for the benefit of potential buyers flocking to farnborough 
sir frank whittle the 81yearold inventor who first took out a 
patent for his gasturbine jet propulsion system in 1930 watched 
the migs display 
i did that in 1929 he was quoted as saying by the times of 
london it is quite easy provided you have got the strength to 
keep the controls steady until the aircraft falls nose forward 
whittle was at the show to unveil a new rollsroyce jet engine 
the rb211524l claimed to be the most powerful in the world 
manufacturers expect to do more than 167 billion in business 
during the weeklong air show

flying across this nation it is 
virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally 
ribbon the landscape there are just vast seas of muddy brown water 
and millions of stranded people 
floods have inundated threequarters of bangladesh and cut 
transportation links from its major port to the capital and other 
interior cities officials say though adding today that flood 
waters on three major rivers were receding 
in dhaka flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years 
and covered threefourths of the capital 
dhaka newspapers reported 60 more flood deaths today bringing 
the toll to at least 1007 since june when rivers began 
overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this 
impoverished nation of 110 million people 
the government count of 333 dead is widely considered low 
millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy 
probably contaminated water and 83000 people nationwide have 
contracted diarrheal diseases said health minister abdul munim 
he said 65 people have died of the diseases so far 
it is a calamity information minister mahbubur rahman told 
reporters sunday night it is a havoccreating menacing flood 
flying in an airplane across bangladesh sunday from the indian 
border to dhaka even the civilian pilot couldnt differentiate 
between the rivers and the flood waters 
ive never seen anything like it before said ghias ahmad 
who has been flying over his country for 19 years 
the waters swallowed up entire villages occasionally tin roofs 
glinted in the sunlight the houses beneath them completely 
submerged 
on a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road 
still above water people milled idly small boats beached beside 
them 
the ganges and brahmaputra rivers and their dozens of 
tributaries flow from india and through bangladesh to the bay of 
bengal 
the rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in 
bangladesh and india last year the flooding in bangladesh killed 
about 1500 people 
this season some refugees have found shelter in relief centers 
or relatives homes said government officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity but they estimated that at least 20 million 
people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small 
outcroppings of high ground with few supplies 
wells and pumps are flooded officials said and flood water 
which is probably impure is the only source of drinking water 
the central government has appealed for foreign aid including 
boats helicopters and 3 million tons of grain 
officials today reported water levels falling on the 
brahmaputra ganges and meghna rivers but relief officials cannot 
reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely 
broken down 
shortages of medicine cooked food and drinking water is 
causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people a relief 
ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
the information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and 
could prevent planting of the winter rice crop he said this might 
lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice 
the minister said bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a 
year to feed its people he said 165 million tons are grown at 
home and 15 million imported 
in dhaka a city of 6 million people gasoline has become scarce 
for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets many gas 
stations are closed 
boats have replaced cars and bicyclepowered rickshaws in many 
parts of the city river boats capable of carrying 100 to 200 
people sail between partly submerged houses in lowlying 
neighborhoods flooded by the buriganga turag and sitalakhya rivers 
that surround dhaka on three sides 
many of the capitals streets are kneedeep and waistdeep in 
murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage and 
adults and children alike wade through it 
over the last week the price of rice nearly doubled from 15 
cents a pound to 28 cents as those who could afford it started 
hoarding

just one day after chicagos first bullfight a 
city official vowed to put an end to bull baiting but 
hispanics said a ban would deprive them of an important facet of 
their cultural heritage 
during a hispanic festival saturday four matadors confronted 
three bulls in front of about 300 people in a temporary arena 
it was a bloodless bullfight in which matadors used capes 
to attract the 1000pound bulls but the animals had velcro 
patches glued to their backs to catch the matadors velcrocovered 
swords and darts 
this bloodless bullfight is just another form of teasing and 
torment peter poholik executive director of chicagos 
commission on animal care and control said sunday 
the cruelest thing theyre doing is teasing the animal 
its not right but its not physically harming the animal weve 
got enough of animal exploitation we dont need this 
poholik said he plans to ask mayor eugene sawyer and other city 
officials for an ordinance to ban bull baiting 
but an aide to state rep benjamin martinez a festival 
organizer said bullfighting is part of hispanic culture and should 
not be banned 
theyve already taken away our language in schools said the 
aide rodolfo mancilla now they want to take away our folklore 
tradition heritage culture you just cant keep doing that and 
have people stand for it 
while real bullfighting is not permitted in the united states 
three states kansas oklahoma and texas have allowed the 
bloodless variety poholik said 
chicago has an ordinance to prevent bullfights but cook county 
circuit judge albert green on friday ordered the city to grant a 
permit to jaass productions to stage the exhibition because the 
bulls are not killed 
after watching saturdays bullfight with an investigator from 
his staff and state officials poholik said the animals were not 
treated harshly 
the promoters kept their word there was no blood drawn 
poholik said the animals were in excellent condition well fed 
there was a good corral area you could tell they were well cared 
for 
many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals 
most of the people were rooting for the bulls poholik said 
they cheered when the matadors got knocked down 
the bulls ultimate destination is the butcher shop said 
breeder manuel correla the animals learn quickly and can only 
be used for one bullfight he said we use them for hamburger

a 76yearold woman was placed in suspended 
animation nearly an hour as surgeons removed an eggsized aneurysm 
from the base of her brain hospital officials said 
cecilia duffy of pittsburgh remained comatose sunday and listed 
in critical condition four days after the unusual operation said 
judy secreto an allegheny general hospital spokeswoman 
its not uncommon for it to last a couple of days ms 
secreto said 
surgeons removed the aneurysm from ms duffys brain after 
dropping her body temperature by 40 degrees and draining the blood 
from her body her heart was stopped during wednesdays operation 
the coma was induced by barbiturates to protect the brain while 
blood flow was suspended said ms secreto 
dr julian e bailes a neurosurgeon said ms duffy fit the 
legal criteria for brain death during the 51 minutes of suspended 
animation 
the aneurysm a bubble in the blood vessel caused by weakness in 
the vessel wall was suctioned out while ms duffy was on the 
bypass machine 
any more pressure by the aneurysm would have compressed on the 
vital centers of the brain stem and her heart would have stopped 
or she would have gone into a coma and died bailes said 
im still worried about her but objectively speaking there 
is a good chance she may pull through this thing he said 
postsurgical scans showed increased brain activity and ms 
duffy was moving her legs when touched according to bailes but 
he said theres such a fine line between a perfect outcome and 
her never waking up thats the hard thing 
ms duffy had become almost completely disabled during the past 
year because of the aneurysm 
bailes initially had recommended that ms duffy go to the barrow 
neurological institute in phoenix ariz where he learned the 
procedure before coming to pittsburgh in july she did not want to 
leave pittsburgh however 
dr robert f spetzler director of the barrow institute and 
six colleagues published an article on the technique in june in the 
journal of neurosurgery of the seven cases cited all but one 
patient survived and four had excellent results the two other 
survivors reported some weakness but otherwise did well

both the dollar and stock prices lost ground in 
cautious trading in tokyo today 
the dollar opened at 13625 yen down 050 yen from fridays 
close and then declined further to end the day at 13603 yen down 
072 yen the us currency ranged between 13595 yen and 13635 
yen with spot trading estimated at 44 billion 
it was the first daytoday decline in the dollar in tokyo since 
last monday 
foreign exchange traders were in a cautious mood because the new 
york market was closed for the labor day holiday said a dealer 
with mitsubishi bank in tokyo 
in addition today is monday when trading usually gets 
cautious which makes it even harder for investors to figure out 
which direction the market is going to go he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
thats why the dollaryen exchange rate changed frequently 
within a narrow range he added 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which gained 37175 points during saturdays 
halfday session lost 14667 points or 053 percent closing at 
2734158 
although the nikkei index opened the day strongly it then 
reversed directions as trading slowed down 
the dollaryen rate which is getting stable and the 
increased us jobless rate made investors less worried about 
inflation but they couldnt be completely optimistic yet said 
yoshio shimoyama of nikko securities 
after the active trading in the early morning some investors 
started selling stocks for profittaking which was another reason 
that prices went down he said 
but he said the market was regaining its strength as unfavorable 
external factors disappeared the market just needs a little more 
energy but share prices usually dont rise much the day after a 
big rebound anyway he added 
trading on the markets first section was thin with an 
estimated 500 million shares changing hands compared with the 524 
million shares traded during the half day saturday 
among issues losing ground were steels and electricals

the missile cruiser that mistakenly shot 
down an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf is on its way home in 
the first us force reduction in the region since the iraniraq 
ceasefire took hold 
france has also begun its planned naval cutbacks in the gulf 
region british officials said a royal navy destroyer was badly 
damaged when it collided with a british cargo ship it was to escort 
the uss vincennes was officially detached from the navys joint 
task force middle east on sunday for a 13000mile voyage to san 
diego where it had been based until april said us sources in 
the gulf speaking on condition of anonymity 
the vincennes shot down an iranian a300 airbus on july 3 
killing all 290 people aboard it mistook the jet for an iranian 
f14 fighter an official us report blamed the tragedy on crew 
stress in a firsttime combat situation 
the 9600ton warship the first of the navys hightech 
aegis cruisers deployed in the gulf was pulled out of the 
waterway after the disaster and operated in the arabian sea 
sources said the vincennes would not be replaced in effect 
reducing the us fleet from 27 to 26 ships 
us navy sources said the pentagon has given no timetable for 
cutbacks and other us warships are being replaced as planned 
in washington pentagon spokesman maj bill oconnell said 
sunday afternoon that the vincennes was still part of the joint 
task force middle east he declined to say if the ship was 
preparing to leave or would be replaced because we dont discuss 
operations of ships 
hours before it was to sail the vincennes was one of several 
warships that responded to a distress call from the british 
destroyer southampton after its collision with the freighter tor 
bay in the gulf of oman 
the 4100ton destroyer with a gaping 9foot hole in its port 
bow and its bridge crumpled by the impact reached the united arab 
emirates port of fujairah three crewmen were hospitalized with 
broken bones naval sources said

withdrawing the aircraft carrier clemenceau and three other ships 
from its indian ocean fleet which covers the gulf the other 
vessels were the destroyer du chayla the oiler var and the cantho 
one of three french minehunters in the area 
the french move reduces its squadron from 11 warships to seven 
that is the largest single cutback since the aug 20 ceasefire 
by any of the six western governments that have kept naval forces 
in the gulf region during the past year to protect merchant 
shipping from attack 
the defense ministry in a statement from paris said the move 
was made taking into account the evolution of the situation in 
the region and the new perspectives for peace 
western forces in the region have said they intend to reduce 
their numbers which total more than 60 warships of various types 
if the iraniraq ceasefire continues to hold 
italy the first to cut back withdrew a frigate the day after 
the truce began it still has five ships two frigates two 
minehunters and a supply vessel in the gulf region 
other warships include eight british one belgian one dutch and

a plainclothes officer was shot dead in the 
years first gangrelated police slaying and authorities said 
joint local and federal efforts were not stopping the violence that 
may make 1988 the bloodiest ever 
officer daniel pratt was shot in the face during a driveby 
shooting saturday night in southcentral los angeles he and his 
partner were pursuing a car believed to be involved in another such 
shooting minutes earlier that wounded three police said 
pratt 30 died later at a hospital the sixyear veteran leaves 
behind a pregnant wife and three children a 20yearold gang 
member believed to be the triggerman was arrested sunday 
with flags outside police headquarters standing at half staff 
sunday police chief daryl gates lamented the departments loss 
here was a fine officer and family man with a child hell 
never see dead because of some nogood miserable sons of bitches 
out there that society allows to roam the streets gates said 
pratt is the first police officer killed in a driveby shooting 
which has often been used by gangs a police officer in 1987 was 
killed in a gang gun battle 
eleven people were slain in gang shootings in the last weekend 
of august and more than 200 people have died this year the death 
toll should climb to an alltime high of more than 400 by years 
end making 1988 the bloodiest year ever for gang crimes officials 
said there were a record 387 gangrelated murders in los angeles 
county in 1987 
the violence has left law enforcement officials struggling to 
end the rampage 
police launched a fullscale assault in march twice since then 
the lapd has marched 1000 officers into the most ganginfested 
areas on weekends 
overall crime rate declined but the gang murder rate continues 
to climb 
were in a holding action were keeping the flames from 
spreading but were not putting them out said robert 
philibosian former county district attorney and head of the state 
task force on gangs and drugs 
while the carnage mounts los angeles gangs continue to export 
their drug trade to seattle kansas city arizona and philadelphia 
as they expand their rock cocainetrafficking network 
its going to take years the fbi has worked at stopping the 
drug problem for 30 years and still hasnt stopped it said 
lawrence lawler the new fbi chief for los angeles its a form 
of life to some people it may be an entire generation before this 
goes away 
the lapd will continue the sweeps but begin expanding tactics by 
targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful neighborhood gangs 
said deputy chief william rathburn 
prosecutors police and the school district are trying to help 
with such programs as great the gang reporting evaluation and 
tracking rsvp the reduction of street violence program and 
oasis for operation stay in school 
and the community youth gang services an organization of former 
gang members and others gave jobs to 111 gang members this summer

gangbangers a twoday summit last week drew 50 and when it 
ended the members of the rival crips and bloods vowed to lay down 
their guns end their gang affiliations and form a network to 
convince other homeboys to do the same 
we have intelligence and want a quality education i know that 
were running out of time america listen today said gang 
member raymond cook bay who attended the summit 
officials criticized the summits for giving a false impression 
of optimism because the small number of gang members participating 
dont represent the 70000 members from the 600 street gangs but 
organizers say at least theyre doing something 
officials also cautioned it will be a long time before the 
programs and law enforcment efforts take effect 
be patient a little longer said sgt wes mcbride of the 
county sheriffs department it will change well get a handle 
on it but it wont be an overnight thing we will win we will

chinas leading dissident said today that 
antimarxist feeling is widespread in communist china but that 
obstacles to independent labor or political groups remain 
formidable in the authoritarian state 
many people dont agree with marxism even workers and 
students fang lizhi a 52yearold astrophysicist said during 
an interview with four western journalists even people of my 
generation dont believe in marxism 
fang supports a multiparty democracy over oneparty communist 
rule and believes the first step toward political reform should be 
seeking freedom of speech and of the press which is now strictly 
controlled by the state 
taiwan the seat of the nationalist party that still claims to 
be the legitimate ruler of all china could provide an example of 
political reform with the recent end of a ban on opposition 
parties fang said 
although taiwans multiparty system is just getting started 
at least its better than the chinese mainland fang said 
but fang acknowledged conditions are not yet ripe for formation 
of new political groups in china 
they should wait until the private economy becomes dominant 
or at least becomes a larger factor said fang who stressed that 
the emergence of an independent middle class may be key to creating 
new political forces 
in the past decade senior leader deng xiaoping has introduced a 
number of marketoriented economic reforms to stimulate production 
and modernize china after the 196676 cultural revolution nearly 
destroyed the economy 
private enterprise is flourishing in some regions although 
chinas leaders still believe in central economic planning 
fang was purged from the party last year when authorities 
accused him of inciting prodemocracy student demonstrations in 
several cities 
he was forced to resign from his post as vice president of the 
science and technology university in hefei anhui province and was 
transferred to the beijing observatory where he continues his 
research and writing 
workers share many of the students demands for political freedom 
but face a daunting task organizing independent groups such as the 
outlawed solidarity labor movement in poland fang said 
the organization of dissident organizations something like an 
independent union is very difficult because of strong government 
opposition he said 
many chinese students regard fang as a hero for his outspoken 
criticism of the communist government when he spoke informally to 
a group at beijing university earlier this year a crowd of 
students thrust books envelopes and paper money for him to sign 
chinese authorities have allowed fang to travel overseas despite 
his criticism fang acknowledged that beijing may be trying to 
improve its image by allowing him to speak out but added i also 
use the opportunity to say more 
the astrophysicist said he does not want to get into politics or 
form a political party instead he views his role as introducing 
some concepts to china such as democracy 
fang believes democracy can work in china despite the nations 
dynastic history of authoritarian rule and unwieldy size of more 
than 1 billion people he suggests democracy would help reduce many 
of the countrys ills including rampant corruption 
during the interview he harshly rejected marxism as the worst 
thing in china 
fang says it is difficult to know the precise policy position of 
any leader because china has no glasnost a reference to the 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness 
fang and and his wife li shuxian a professor of physics at 
beijing university were briefly in the british colony on the 
southeastern coast of china at the invitation of a local college 
they arrived after visiting australia and singapore

defense secretary frank c carlucci today began 
his first trip to china a fiveday visit expected to include 
discussions on us concerns about chinese arms sales in the middle 
east 
carlucci is to hold talks on global regional and bilateral 
issues with his host national defense minister qin qiwei he is 
also scheduled to meet chinas top leader deng xiaoping and 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang 
he spent two days in guam before flying to beijing where he was 
met at the airport by gen sung wenzhong head of the bureau of 
foreign affairs in the peoples liberation army 
carlucci is expected to restate us concerns about chinas arms 
sales to the middle east which washington says could destabilize 
military balances in that volatile region 
china has reportedly sold silkworm antiship missiles to iran 
and recently agreed to supply saudi arabia with mediumrange 
surfacetosurface missiles us officials say china is also 
trying to sell to syria a shorterrange missile now under 
development 
china which denies selling silkworms to iran is building up 
its arms industry to help finance the modernization of its own 
armed forces 
when secretary of state george p shultz brought up the issue of 
middle east sales during a visit in july the chinese said the 
weapons were of a defensive nature and the sales carried out in a 
responsible manner 
chinese officials are in turn likely to urge washington to 
ease restrictions on sales of high technology items to china 
the chinese say us businessmen are losing business to japanese 
and european competitors because the pentagon is reluctant to allow 
transfer of some types of technology 
in particular china is expected to urge the reagan 
administration to give the goahead for us companies to use 
chinese long march rockets to launch satellites 
reagan is to make a decision on the chinese launches later this 
month the state department has recommended that reagan grant 
export licenses for the satellites but the commerce department has 
objected saying that would undercut us companies trying to 
develop satellite launching services 
carluccis visit is the third by a pentagon chief during the

been waging their separatist struggle on and off for 50 years 
kurdish officials said many of the refugees were injured in 
mustard gas attacks but there was no official turkish confirmation 
kurdish guerrillas are battling an estimated 60000 iraqi troops

the guerrillas claimed the iraqis have carried out scores of 
poison gas attacks in recent weeks against kurdish villages and

the last few days and killed or wounded 7000 government troops in 
recent fighting kurdish casualties were listed as 250 guerrillas 
and 1900 civilians killed with 5000 civilians wounded

barzani denied press reports that he had sought asylum in turkey 
our decision is to remain with our beleaguered people and 
to continue our resistance for the survival of the kurdish people

a former policeman convicted in a pension fund 
scandal surrendered after holding a police official hostage at 
gunpoint for 15 hours and then keeping authorities at bay for 
nearly 10 hours more 
anthony daniele 39 claimed that he was willing to die to show 
he was innocent of involvement in a scheme to defraud the police 
pension fund 
if i had been involved in something like that i shouldnt go 
to jail i should be shot daniele said in an interview with a 
newspaper columnist shortly before he surrendered sunday 
daniele who was sentenced friday to eight years in prison took 
john frank vice president of the city police board hostage about 
1030 am saturday daniele was free on bond pending appeal 
frank had been instrumental in exposing the kickback scheme that 
cost police and fire pension funds an estimated 330000 daniele 
formerly headed the police pension fund 
besides the prison sentence daniele was ordered to make 
restitution of 200000 he was one of six men indicted but the 
only one to stand trial the others pleaded guilty to lesser 
charges 
the ordeal began when daniele walked into franks law office on 
the 15th floor of a downtown office building displayed a 
38caliber revolver and took frank hostage 
daniele apparently wanted to convince frank of his innocence and 
get media attention for what he regarded as an injustice in his 
conviction and sentence officials said 
the former policeman released frank at about 130 am sunday 
he ended the standoff at about 11 am after reaching agreement 
with police that he would not be charged in the hostagetaking 
said his lawyer donald wolff 
us attorney thomas e dittmeier said it was his decision not 
to prosecute daniele but circuit attorney george peach said he had 
made no promises and would have to review the case before making a 
decision 
before surrendering daniele asked to speak to bill mcclellan a 
columnist for the st louis postdispatch who had covered the 
police department and had written about the pension fund case 
i should be hung i wanted my brother officers to know im 
innocent i was willing to die to let them know it i was willing 
to go out of here in a body bag daniele told mcclellan 
daniele was taken to the medical facility at the federal 
penitentiary in springfield mo where he will undergo a 
psychiatric evaluation authorities said wolff said daniele was 
remorseful about the hostagetaking 
dozens of police officers and firefighters surrounded the office 
building during the standoff while a team of negotiators kept in 
touch with daniele by telephone from another floor of the building 
reports that daniele might have a bomb or had boobytrapped the 
door to franks office with explosives turned out to be false 
police said but the police teams work was complicated by the fact 
that daniele an 18year police veteran and former rifleman on the 
hostage team knew their techniques

with solemn ceremony opposition leaders 
today paid tribute to the thousands of martyrs of democracy 
killed by security forces attempting to quell the nationwide 
uprising against 26 years of oneparty rule 
about 50000 people gathered in suburban rangoon on the west 
bank of inya lake where opposition groups say police killed and 
brutally assaulted students during demonstrations march 17 
meanwhile residents of a rangoon suburb said today at least 20 
people including two buddhist monks died during a confrontation 
between looters in a government biscuit factory and members of a 
vigilence committee 
vigilence committees are among the informal groups formed to 
maintain order and handle routine administration in areas where the 
government has been ineffective in wake of antigovernment protests 
residents said members of the vigilence committee rushed to 
the biscuit factory sunday in south okkalapa to stop a reported 
theft but instead were captured by the looters 
residents surged into the factory and discovering eight members 
of the committee had been killed set upon the thieves the mob 
reportedly killed 12 people 
also today the all burma students union printed what it said 
was an official directive to military intelligence agents and their 
informers 
under prevailing conditions in the country intelligence units 
and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and 
confusion among the public said the directive 
a newsletter published by the students union said the directive 
was issued aug 22 by the head of military intelligence the 
authenticity of the directive could not be independently verified 
some western diplomats in rangoon have speculated the government 
is trying to push the country toward anarchy to justify a military 
takeover 
at least six armed officers identified as members of military 
intelligence were apprehended by protesters last month and 
reportedly acknowledged being ordered to carry out bombings and 
other sabotage to create chaos 
meanwhile about 400 employees of the state radio and television 
the last major media under full official control went on strike 
today to protest the suspension of 14 colleagues 
our strike can greatly disrupt normal operations but they can 
go on with a skeleton staff strikers in the information and 
broadcasting department said the department has about 650 
employees 
the 14 officials were suspended for taking part in 
antigovernment protests last month 
the march violence inflamed a public already disillusioned with 
political repression and economic deterioration another major 
demonstration flared in june and unrest has continued over the past 
two months 
my young sons and daughters whose names i had no chance to 
know said opposition leader aung gyi addressing the students 
killed in march your courage and sacrifice for the cause of 
democracy has been recognized and you all will be remembered as 
martyrs of democracy both in the history of burma and abroad 
referring to those killed by military forces last month the 
retired general said thousands from various walks of life 
monks students workers doctors and nurses have also followed 
you for the same cause 
the opposition has called for a nationwide strike thursday to 
press the government for immediate democracy rather than wait for a 
congress of the ruling party sept 12 president maung maung has 
promised the congress would pave the way for a multiparty system 
after a referendum is held 
the whole country has demanded immediate formation of an 
interim government to ease the situation the government has to 
face the reality aung gyi told visiting rep stephen solarz 
dny in rangoon on sunday 
solarz later told reporters in bangkok thailand that burma was 
on the dawn of a new era of democracy but warned that hardline 
government and military moves could still cause a civil war 
i dont think its an exaggeration to say that the fate of 
burma hangs in the balance he said 
solarz suggested the exile of ne win the military leader who 
seized power in 1962 and other top government leaders would help 
defuse the situation 
western diplomats say at least 100 people were killed in the 
march riots while about 1000 died last month in the capital 
following the retirement of ne win and his replacement by hardliner 
sein lwin 
upon sein lwins accession to power aung gyi and some of his 
associates were arrested and jailed they were released when sein 
lwin was replaced on aug 19 by maung maung the first civilian 
leader in burma in 26 years

talks on a new us bases agreement broke 
off today after greek negotiators announced the us air force base 
next to athens airport will be closed the government said 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said the american side 
asked that the talks be temporarily postponed following the greek 
announcement 
the american delegation requested a temporary postponement in 
order to return to washington and take relevant instructions from 
the american authorities kostopoulos said in a statement 
the statement did not say when the talks would resume 
no us embassy spokesman could immediately be reached because 
of the labor day holiday 
the postponement came on the opening day of a ninth round of 
negotiations for a new greekamerican defense cooperation agreement 
to replace a 1983 accord expiring in december 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government said last 
month that hellenikon air base would be shut down at that time 
the united states said its future was still under discussion 
hellenikon is one of four american bases that have operated in 
greece since the 1950s it provides support for planes monitoring 
soviet naval operations in the mediterranean and for another three 
us bases here 
about 1400 american servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 
greeks work at the base located next to athens international 
airport 
the greek government has so far made no threat to close any 
other base but says hellenikons operations cannot be transferred 
to another us installation 
there had been speculation here that a us navy base at souda 
bay on the southern island of crete could be expanded to replace 
hellenikon 
the other american bases in greece are a navy communicatons base 
at nea makri near athens which tracks soviet naval and submarine 
activity and an electronic surveillance base at gournes also on 
crete 
as a form of rent for the bases greece receives 340 million 
annually in us military credits 
talks for the new defense cooperation agreement started last 
november but the regular monthly meetings have made little progress 
the main obstacle appears to be greek insistence that in return 
for a new bases agreement the united states should help toward 
solving greekturkish disputes over military control of the aegean 
and the divided island of cyprus 
papandreou also says a new agreement will be submitted for 
approval in a referendum before it takes effect 
in july the government issued a formal closure notice for all 
four bases but it doesnt necessarily mean the bases will stop 
operating 
if the greek and american negotiating teams fail to reach 
agreement the current accord gives the united states 17 months to 
dismantle the bases after the date the accord expires 
us officials in washington have said they would like to wrap 
up a new bases agreement by december but the government spokesman 
warned again on sunday that the talks are likely to be lenghty 
weve said repeatedly the talks cant be quick and easy we 
predict they will be long and painful kostopoulos said in a 
statement

power was restored to all but one building today 
in a 50block area of downtown that was left without electricity 
for three days by a fire in underground feeder cables 
seattle city light workers completed repairs to a fifth 
13000volt cable sunday night utility spokesman scott forslund 
said repairs to the sixth and last burned out cable should be 
completed today he said 
until the sixth cable is back in service many buildings will 
have only partial power because they are served by a combination of 
the repaired and unrepaired cables said hugh mcintosh of city 
light 
the last building without service was a parking garage with some 
office space near the fire site forslund said 
frozen food thawed elevators wouldnt budge and air 
conditioners were useless during one of the hottest weeks in city 
history after service was cut wednesday by a fire in an underground 
transformer and switching vault 
about half the affected customers began getting power saturday 
evening when the switch was thrown on four repaired feeder cables 
and other customers were hooked up during the night 
the cause of the outage was undetermined but city light 
superintendent randall hardy said the fire apparently started in 
the municipal utilitys cables 
power to those feeders should have been cut by current limiters 
that act when a cable gets hot 
in addition power continued flowing through an adjacent 
aluminum supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus lines 
that cable melted so what you had was molten aluminum cutting 
our cables hardy said sunday night 
had it not been for the lack of a power cutoff on the transit 
cable hardy said it would have been a twobuilding outage of a 
day or so 
as power restoration began fire crews roamed the area to make 
sure no fires were triggered in equipment left switched on when the 
outage began 
it went very smoothly i have no reports of problems other 
than the sprinker in the battery street tunnel which apparently 
began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power 
surge mcintosh said we called the fire department and told them 
it was their problem 
at the westin hotel full service was restored to the 40story 
south tower early sunday while the 47story north tower remained 
on a diesel generator rented for 6200 a week marketing director 
dell schooly said 
city light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power 
or repair damage but mcintosh said he understood the city council 
would consider a special appropriation 
during the height of the blackout city officials estimated that 
90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area which has an 
estimated 130 restaurants 55 shops in the popular pike place 
market the bon marche department store and uncounted hotels 
grocery stores and taverns 
the blackout coincided with a heat wave in which fridays 
temperature was 98 degrees a record for september and saturdays 
high 92 a record for the date sunday was in the low 80s

protest regional pay bonuses an issue that remains unresolved 
the strike has continued in various parts of the country to protest 
the bonuses and the hiring of temporary workers to clear the 
backlog of mail caused by wednesdays strike 
the union objects to the post office offering weekly bonuses of 
75 pounds to 20 pounds 1252 to 3340 to recruit workers in 
london and southeast england those regions are prosperous and the 
postal service has difficulty hiring workers

michael dukakis today celebrated labor day 
by denouncing george bush as the leader of the party of the rich 
and asking voters to look in the mirror and ask whether they 
can afford four more years of reaganera indifference 
dukakis on the workers holiday that marks the traditional 
start of the fall presidential campaign began the day visiting 
families in a workingclass neighborhood of philadelphia and then 
headed for detroit and a rally in the auto capital with labor 
chieftains and michigans democratic leaders 
some 125 antiabortion activists by police estimates staged a 
protest at his philadelphia stop waving signs and chanting life 
yes abortion no duke of death must go 
the massachusetts governor in his chat with the philadelphia 
residents ridiculed bushs call for a ban on ocean dumping 
i dont think mr bush gets it we want to stop ocean dumping 
right that means weve got to treat the sewage right but you 
cant be for an end to ocean dumping when youre also for ending 
federal grants for sewage treatment said dukakis 
mr bush went up to new york and said im for ending ocean 
dumping by 1991 so am i but how are we going to pay for it 
dukakis asked 
he also hit bush on housing saying i dont think ive ever 
heard mr bush talk about housing have you he hasnt he 
doesnt appreciate what average folks are going through 
dukakis in the text of his speech to the detroit rally said 
bush wanted to help the privileged few get richer while making 
it harder for middle class families to send their children to 
college 
the election is a choice etween two kinds of leadership two 
ideas about prosperity and two visions of america dukakis said 
for the past seven years as the census bureau told us this past 
week the rich have gotten richer the poor have gotten poorer and 
those of us in the middle and that means most of us are getting 
squeezed 
my friends i ask you can we afford four more years of that 
dukakis questioned indiana sen dan quayles qualifications to 
be vice president or president while praising his running mate 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as a leader who had proven his compassion 
by sheperding trade and plantclosing legislation through the 
senate 
and he lashed out at bushs proposal to cut the capital gains 
tax which dukakis said could give a 30000 tax break to those 
making more than 200000 a year 
thats more than the average teacher makes dukakis said 
thats enough to send your son or daughter to michigan state for 
four years the down payment young couples could use to buy their 
first home 
and who do you think is going to pay for that new tax break 
dukakis asked look at your kids look at your parents look in 
the mirror and ask yourself can we afford four more years of 
that 
dukakis also took bush to task for calling the rise in national 
unemployment reported last week statistically irrelevant 
thats an interesting phrase dukakis said but not 
surprising coming as it did from the standard bearer of the party 
that thought ketchup was a vegetable my friends were here today 
to tell mr bush that americans are not statistics and we sure 
arent irrelevant 
dukais recalled his saturday trip with his immigrant mother to 
ellis island and paid tribute to the nations ethnic diversity 
we are a wonderful and diverse mosaic of races and creeds and 
ethnic groups bound together by our love for this country by our 
belief in its future and by our deep and abiding faith in the 
american dream he said 
and if anyone tells you that that dream belongs to the 
privileged few and not to all of us tell them that their era is 
over and a new era is about to begin 
aflcio president lane kirkland and united auto workers 
president owen bieber were joining dukakis at the detroit rally as 
were mayor coleman young michigan gov jim blanchard and sens

cleric on incitement charges for allegedly urging worshipers to 
fight jews working at an archaeological dig near two sacred mosques 
in arab east jerusalem 
mohammed jamal deputy head of the supreme moslem council or 
waqf would be the highestranking moslem official to be tried by 
israel since it captured east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war

occupied territories israel has jailed at least 20 moslem

what i did is not incitement it is the right of moslems to come 
to their holy place and defend it i would do this again

enraged by the archaeological dig near the temple mount known in 
arabic as haram eshsharif the mount houses two of islams holiest 
shrines the al aqsa and dome of the rock mosques 
using mosque loudspeakers moslem officials urged palestinians 
to rush to the site and defend the shrines saying israelis planned 
to dig a tunnel to the temple mount 
israeli officials denied the charges saying the dig was 
designed to open an underground staircase running along the western 
wall judaisms holiest site the western wall the last remnant of 
the second temple borders the temple mount 
israeli officials acknowledged they did not coordinate the dig 
with the waqf and excavations were suspended temporarily

journalists have been detained by israeli authorities

with the statue of liberty as a backdrop sen 
dan quayle kicked off his fall campaign today with a tribute to the 
pledge of allegiance and a declaration that the values it embodies 
are not hokey or cornball 
the people of america want to know the kind of values that 
underscore our beliefs and george bush and i proudly and 
unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the pledge of 
allegiance the republican vice presidential nominee said 
the republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the 
campaign attacking democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
for his 1977 veto of a massachusetts bill that would have penalized 
teachers who refused to lead their classes in the pledge 
dukakis cited an advisory opinion by massachusetts highest 
court that the bill was unconstitutional as well as a 1943 supreme 
court decision that students could not be forced to salute the flag 
but quayle said that the same mindset that would impede the 
daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance could well 
sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of 
the values and standards upon which we must rely 
for him and bush quayle said the spirit and values of the 
pledge deserve to be transmitted to our children 
to us they are not hokey or cornball or passe he said 
quayle chose liberty island where the statue stands in new york 
harbor to kick off his fall campaign on this labor day holiday 
he also toured neighboring ellis island where millions of 
immigrants entered the country 
quayles speech was briefly disrupted by a group of 
demonstrators who chanted fortythousand dead from aids where 
was dan quayles supporters surrounded the group and began a 
counterchant yelling we want quayle 
as the protesters were hustled away the senator told his 
audience i believe in freedom of speech they have a right to 
freedom of speech but so do i 
quayle also travels to detroit for an ethnic parade before 
returning to washington to regroup for the heavy campaigning to 
come 
on sunday quayle ended a fiveday southern swing and his second 
week of solo campaigning as the republican vice presidential 
nominee 
the south is going for george bush quayle declared in 
richmond va as several hundred supporters cheered 
the indiana senator was generally well received during his foray 
into the south a region with strong democratic registration but 
which has been republican territory in presidential contests 
but there was a smattering of boos sunday when quayle was 
introduced to nascar racing fans in darlington sc and there 
continue to be small protests at some of his other appearances 
it was a week that saw further refinement of quayles themes of 
jobs peace and prosperity and the emergence of his new fall 
rhetoric defeatist liberal policies of the democrats versus 
the enlightened cando conservatism of the republicans 
it was also a week that saw a profusion of photo opportunities 
for which gop strategists believe quayle is particularly suited he 
relished tossing a football with high school players for example 
and turned it into a metaphor for his campaign his lousy 
passing got better he noted just like his own political 
performance 
the controversies about quayles military service personal life 
and academic record for the most part did not follow him on this 
trip and quayle apparently has become more relaxed with the press 
as has his wife marilyn who has blamed the media for blowing the 
controversies out of proportion 
but quayle still has problems at news conferences aides 
concede he told reporters in atlanta that he supported a gradual 
rise in the minimum wage and then appeared not to know that his 
position was different from that of bush who opposes an increase 
in the minimum wage 
and he criticized the state department for what he said was a 
reluctance to promote us exports aggressively but declined to 
say in what instances the department had failed 
aides said later he was just being cautious unwilling to get 
into specifics from memory

center on labor day today accused republican george bush of 
neglecting the needs of texas and the oil industry he once worked 
in 
the democratic vice presidential nominee starting a 
crosscountry labor day trek in his home state told 250 
supporters theyve sort of turned their backs on us this 
administration has 
speaking outside a former high school converted with government 
and baylor university funds into the business resource center 
bentsen said the republicans have an oilman whos running for 
president but frankly i cant remember anything hes done for the 
energy industry in the past eight years 
bentsen toured the business center and met with local citizens 
trying to revive the struggling economy here in this central texas 
town he said the start up of new business was important because 
texas very much needs that kind of diversification 
the texas senator then planned to fly to beaumont texas to 
speak at a labor day picnic before journeying on to st louis and 
a joint labor day picnic with his running mate michael dukakis 
bentsen spokesman mike mccurry said that in a new campaign 
speech crafted last week while bentsen was on vacation the

patriotism and fairness 
bentsen is stopping in texas on nearly every campaign trip 
fighting to win the state and its 29 electoral votes for the 
democrats even though vice president george bush also calls it home 
the democratic party planned to launch new television spots in 
the state this week with the message you cant afford to vote

under an unusual texas law bentsen also is running for 
reelection to his senate seat which he has held for three terms 
that campaign already has aired advertisements 
after his two texas stops bentsen was flying this afternoon to 
st louis where he was meeting up with dukakis for a democratic 
club picnic missouri is also a battleground and bentsen already 
had visited the city twice since being picked for the ticket

theme on tuesday with visits to a job training center in 
lawrenceville ga outside of atlanta and virginia polytechnic 
institute in blacksburg va before returning to washington that 
night

the trades union congress voted 
overwhelmingly today to expel the electricians union its first 
ouster of an affiliate in 15 years 
delegates of the electricians 336000member union showed their 
disdain by walking out en masse minutes before the trades union 
took its vote the vote by a show of hands came on the opening 
morning of the trades unions weeklong annual conference in this 
south england seaside resort 
the electronic telecommunication and plumbing union was ousted 
for signing two singleunion nostrike deals with management in 
violation of trades union policy 
more than 30 singleunion nostrike deals have been struck in 
britain with one union representing all the workers at a plant and 
disputes submitted to binding arbitration 
the trades union believes such deals weaken union bargaining 
power and lead to competition among unions for representation in a 
shrinking job market 
some predicted the expulsion would create a ripple effect 
confronting the 9million member national labor federation with 
what the financial times called the most serious split in british 
trade union history 
it also raised the prospect of the electricians and other 
rebellious unions forming a rival labor federation among those 
siding with the electricians union is the amalgamated engineering 
union the trades unions second biggest affiliate 
delegates shouted down engineers leader bill jordan and the 
microphone was cut off when he urged a postponement of the 
electricians expulsion saying it would inflict grievous bodily 
harm 
electricians leader eric hammond in a defiant final speech to 
the conference before the vote accused leftwing unions of 
conspiring to bring about the expulsion spoke of witch hunts 
and portrayed his union as a david fighting a goliath 
trades union general secretary norman willis addressing the 
representatives of the 85 affiliate unions denied any witch hunt 
and said the electricians union had refused every opportunity to 
scrap the nostrike deals 
the electricians union was suspended july 8 after accepting 
nostrike deals at two plants in lancashire and south wales 
todays vote converted the suspension to outright expulsion 
in the last expulsion in 1973 10 unions were ousted for 
refusing to oppose government legislation on industrial relations 
eight of the unions rejoined the trades union after the legislation 
was repealed

to protect themselves 
from palestinian stonethrowers jewish settlers operate a radio 
warning system and community patrols and even train bus operators 
to shoot while driving 
many settlers are dissatisfied with army security and their 
anger has grown along with the number of palestinian attacks on 
their settlements during the 9monthold uprising which has killed 
four israelis and nearly 260 arabs 
on sunday 200 settlers protested outside government offices 
where the cabinet was discussing whether to allow them to open fire 
more freely on the stonethrowers authorities have said civilians 
may open fire only when their lives are in imminent danger 
military jeeps escort local buses on their way through 
palestinian towns and refugee camps sites of frequent 
rockthrowing attacks and soldiers patrol the areas but many 
residents say present defenses are not enough and have set up their 
own forms of protection 
a radio attack warning center that covers 15 settlements with a 
population of 10000 is housed in the basement of the regional 
council in gush etzion south of jerusalem said shilo gal 
chairman of the council the center is staffed roundtheclock by 
reserve soldiers most of whom are local residents 
small settlements are guarded by one or two armed settlers 
while larger communities are patrolled by jeeps with sirens and 
radios said david bedein west bank settlers spokesman 
israel television showed how jewish bus drivers in the west bank 
are being taught selfdefense including driving around roadblocks 
helping passengers to jump through bus windows during a firebomb 
attack and caring for the wounded 
the program showed bus drivers firing pistols from moving 
vehicles and trying to drive without flinching while tennis balls 
were thrown at their windshield to simulate rock attacks gal said 
the windows of the buses are being covered with metal grills 
we cant trust the army and it wont allow us to protect 
ourselves and our children said yisrael maler of the teqoa 
settlement last friday we had to wait for 45 minutes for the 
escort we returned to the bus station called the army and waited 
for another 45 minutes not one of us had a gun 
meanwhile soldiers just stand around look at stonethrowers 
and smoke cigarettes said the sovietborn maler who moves 
around with an armyissued m16 rifle some of the other settlers 
carry pistols 
some legislators have expressed concern that settlers given a 
green light to fire on stonethrowers would shoot indiscriminately 
the debate was heightened after a settler accidentally shot and 
wounded two soldiers last week when he opened fire at a palestinian 
who threw a firebomb that missed his car 
but shilo gal says the settlers must rely on government patrols 
and organized defenses we cannot do more because people would 
accuse us of forming militias he said

north korea pledged on monday that it will not 
disrupt the olympic games and said any incident marring the games 
would be part of a ussouth korean plot to create an excuse to 
invade the north 
if anything happens in south korea during the olympic games 
it will have nothing to do with us and the united states and the 
south korean authorities themselves should be held responsible for 
it the north korean foreign ministry said in a statement 
we hereby make it clear that we do not have the slightest 
intention to obstruct the progress of the games or threaten them by 
force of arms said the statement carried by the staterun 
north korean central news agency and monitored in tokyo 
it said various military exercises planned by south korea the 
united states and japan were designed to create tension on the 
troubled korean peninsula and provide an excuse for an invasion of 
north korea 
the joint maneuvers and exercises are designed to cause a 
shocking incident and start another war in korea in case the games 
do not go as they south korea and the united states wish the 
statement said 
the united states maintains 42000 troops in south korea and is 
planning to station naval ships off the korean peninsula during the 
games to deter any attacks from outside the games open sept 17 in 
seoul 
japanese naval and coast guard ships will patrol waters between 
japan and south korea to prevent smuggling of weapons and some of 
the us forces involved in the exercises are based in japan 
the korean central news agency called the moves reckless 
military rackets which are a very dangerous play with fire 
which aggravates the situation and increases the danger of war in 
this region 
north korea has announced it will not participate in the 
olympics because south korea and washington have conspired to use 
the games to divide the troubled korean peninsula permanently 
if we go to seoul for the olympic games under such 
circumstances it will be tantamount to recognizing the us 
imperialists occupation of south korea and colonial rule to 
perpetuate our nations division said rodong sinmun the 
official newspaper of the norths communist workers party of korea 
in a separate commentary on monday 
the north south koreas archrival since the 195053 korean war 
demanded to cohost the games but the international olympic 
committee refused saying each olympiad is awarded to only one city 
in another development a japanese news agency reported that 
north korean president kim il sungs second son was recently 
appointed ambassador to hungary to avoid a possible leadership 
threat to his older brother 
kyodo news service on sunday quoted unidentified japanese 
government officials as saying kim pyong il 34 was 
directorgeneral of the north korean peoples armed forces bureau 
before being named ambassador 
it quoted unidentified eastern european sources as saying kim il 
sungs oldest son and designated successor kim jong il 46 was 
having problems dealing with the nations stagnant economy and the 
controversy over the games 
because of kim jong ils leadership problems the sources said 
people were beginning to favor kim pyong il

despite initial skepticism us officials are 
pleased with an experiment in which 17 american financial experts 
moved into liberian government offices to bring order to the 
african nations chaotic financial system 
liberia a country founded by freed american slaves a century 
and a half ago has always had a special relationship with the 
united states and president samuel k doe turned to washington in 
1987 after his fiscal problems ran out of control 
corruption was rampant government checks were bouncing civil 
servants were being paid months late and bureaucrats were spending 
money without regard to budgetary limits some government 
contractors were not paid for work performed while others received 
checks they were not entitled to 
in january 1987 when secetary of state george p shultz made a 
brief stop in monrovia doe told him i need help 
the two countries worked out a plan to put american accountants 
systems managers and computer experts recruited by the us 
agency for international development inside the liberian 
bureaucracy 
the operational experts nicknamed opex assumed their 
duties in january nine of the 17 went to the finance ministry 
its worked reasonably well one us official said summing 
up the eightmonthold experiment the benefits have been 
considerable already 
the official who insisted on anonymity said the twoyear 
program has exceeded the expectations of a lot of people who 
thought it would never get off the ground among other benefits 
civil servants are now being paid on time he said 
another official also speaking anonymously said before 
there was no government budget everything was entirely ad hoc 
opex has gotten the liberians to adhere to the budget its under 
pretty good control but there are still some financial flows 
outside the budget 
with the americans cosigning checks and taking over much of 
liberias economic management the plan gives the appearance of a 
liberian surrender of sovereignty in a key area which is a 
complaint voiced by liberian opposition leaders 
but the state department says doe still has the final say on all 
financial matters 
liberia may be the only country where it would be politically 
possible for the united states to play such an intrusive role but 
liberia with its red white and blue flag and its use of the us 
dollar as legal tender has always looked on the united states as a 
friend and patron 
the financial crisis can be traced back about 10 years when the 
liberian government decided to build a 200 million convention 
center it couldnt afford the country fell deeply into debt and 
the problems were compounded in 1980 when doe then a 28yearold 
sergeant took power in a military coup bringing with him a team 
of advisers with no government experience 
as prices of liberias principal exports fell foreign exchange 
earnings dropped eventually because of a poor debt repayment 
record the world bank and the international monetary fund declared 
liberia ineligible for new loans 
now as us officials describe it liberias future seems 
brighter and not only because of opex human rights violations are 
down liberias press is once again one of the freest in africa and 
there is increased demand for international demand for latex 
liberias major export 
concern about aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome has 
touched off a boom in sales of latex products such as condoms and 
gloves contributing to the more upbeat mood these days among 
liberians

both major parties have modified their national 
election platforms to include support for talks with palestinians 
from the israelioccupied territories 
it is a major amendment for the rightwing likud bloc but 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs political alliance has little 
choice because jordan does not appear presently to be a partner 
for negotiations likud legislator ehud olmert said in an 
interview 
the centerleft labor partys new platform also represents a 
major shift from its customary position that israel should 
negotiate with king hussein of jordan and palestinians should be 
represented in a jordanian delegation labor is led by foreign 
minister shimon peres 
hussein forced the platform changes by announcing july 31 that 
he would end legal and administrative ties with the west bank and 
gaza strip the israelioccupied lands where 15 million 
palestinians and 68000 jewish settlers live an uprising against 
israeli rule began in the territories dec 8 
avraham burg a peace activist and labor candidate for 
parliament said this week the kings decision was a message to 
israelis and palestinians to make up your minds on resolving 
problems in the west bank and gaza which israel captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
another reason for the platform changes appears to be israels 
desire to preempt any palestine liberation organization effort to 
assume jordans role in the territories 
likud and labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984 
because neither party won a majority that year in the 120seat 
knesset israels parliament how to resolve the conflict with the 
palestinians has become a central factor in each sides effort to 
win control in the election nov 1 
the uprising in which nearly 260 palestinians have been killed 
is the most sustained revolt to date against israeli occupation and 
lends extra urgency to the campaign four israelis also have been 
slain 
in the past the likud linked criteria for peace talks to the 
usbrokered camp david agreement of 1978 which led to the 1979 
peace treaty between egypt and israel 
the agreement called for egypt jordan and israel to negotiate 
an autonomous palestinian government in the occupied lands with 
the palestinians joining later talks on a final resolution 
negotiations between egypt and israel ended in 1981 and neither 
the palestinians nor arab states considers the camp david process a 
viable option 
olmert the likud lawmaker helped draft the likud platform and 
said there is no role for the plo which israel considers a 
terrorist group but dovish labor party members appear to be 
reconsidering that position 
burg the labor candidate told israel radio earlier this week 
once the plo accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 abandons the 
ways of terror and recognizes the state of israel it wont be the 
same entity once it is not the same entity it will make me 
reconsider my attitude toward it 
those resolutions guarantee israels right to exist within 
secure borders in return for its withdrawal from occupied arab 
territory 
the plo has moved in recent months to modify its stance toward 
israel and perhaps win world support for a role in governing the 
occupied lands bassam abu sharif chief plo spokesman has 
advocated recognizing israel and establishing an independent 
palestinian state in the territories 
in israel the future of the west bank and gaza strip has become 
a campaign issue 
benjamin netanyahu israels former un ambassador and a likud 
candidate for parliament said this week the public is concerned 
about the problem of staying in the territories but it is 
significantly more concerned about the vulnerability we will invite 
on ourselves if we get out of the territories 
he said arab control of the occupied lands might threaten israel 
by providing a front door for invasion and such weapons as 
shoulderfired missiles could threaten all israeli air strips 
netanyahu said the uprising should be ended followed by a 
coolingoff period and an autonomy plan that gives israel 
maximum security and the arab residents minimum interference

the younger brother of former 
president chun doohwan was sentenced monday to seven years in 
prison and fined 44 million dollars for embezzling millions of 
dollars during chuns administration 
chun kyonghwan was sentenced by a threejudge panel of the 
seoul district criminal court which also found 11 of his 
accomplices guilty of similar charges and gave them prison terms 
ranging from one to three years six other people were given 
suspended terms of up to 1 years and freed 
chun kyonghwan 46 was convicted of diverting more than 10 
million in official funds taking bribes and abusing power to make 
illegal profits 
the defendants deserve stern punishment for taking personal 
profits by abusing power said senior judge park youngmoo in 
rendering the verdict 
the judge said the defendant as the younger brother of the 
then president who upheld the realization of a society of justice 
actually did what was contrary to that 
it is our belief that the defendant should not be given 
lenient treatment because of his relation to the expresident 
likewise he also should not be punished excessively simply 
because he is the younger brother of an unpopular president he 
said 
the younger chun was convicted for using his position as head of 
the semiofficial saemaul new community development group to 
embezzle official funds extort contributions from businesses and 
peddle government influence 
the prosecution had demanded a 15year term for chun 
prosecutors said chun took bribes and embezzled millions while 
he headed saemaul from 1981 to 1987 he was accused of using the 
money for stock and land speculation 
chun who wore traditional white korean clothing and prisoners 
rubber shoes appeared calm while the judge read a lengthy 
statement on the courts decision after a onehour hearing chun 
and the other defendants were led to a bus to be sent back to 
prison as guards held off jeering protesters 
under korean law chun and the other defendants have one week to 
appeal their cases for trial by a higher court court sources said 
both the defendants and the prosecution are expected to appeal the 
sentences 
in his final testimony the younger chun said he did nothing 
wrong and claimed that he was being used as a political scapegoat 
he emerged from obsecurity to head the saemaul program one year 
after his brother seized power with military backing in 1980 
the former president and his family have come under public fire 
for alleged involvement in major financial scandals 
a parliamentary investigative committee recently demanded the 
expresident and 15 members of his family be forbidden to leave the 
country while an investigation into alleged corruption is under way 
the government imposed a foreign travel ban on some suspects 
but declined to limit the former presidents movements 
the governing democratic justice party has also blocked 
opposition attempts to make the former president testify before the 
national assembly 
following massive antigovernment protest chun stepped down at 
the end of a sevenyear term in february to be replaced by 
president roh taewoo who won presidential elections over rival 
opposition candidates in december

leonid brezhnevs soninlaw went on trial today 
charged with taking 1 million in bribes in a court case expected 
to expose corruption in the highest kremlin circles if convicted 
he could face death by firing squad 
the trial of yuri churbanov 51 a former first deputy interior 
minister is in line with soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs drive 
to break with the cronyism and corruption now seen as endemic under 
brezhnev communist party chief from 1964 until his death in 1982 
the case against churbanov and eight codefendants being heard 
by a threemember military tribunal of the soviet supreme court 
may also have a political aim to discredit remaining members of 
the kremlin old guard who flourished under brezhnev or to signal 
that their time has passed 
as the reading of the charges began a court officer said that 
abusing his official position churbanov repeatedly took bribes 
from interior ministry and communist party officials in 
uzbekistan the central asian republic that has been the center 
of the corruption scandal 
churbanov who worked as a mechanic before taking a lowlevel 
interior ministry job in 1961 was accused of accepting bribes 
totaling 656883 rubles 104 million some of them from 
codefendants 
that sum is the equivalent of 270 years pay for the average 
soviet factory worker churbanov also was accused of accepting a 
carpet tea sets wine cognac grapes and pomegranates that 
reportedly were flown to him from uzbekistan 
during the reading of the charges it was repeatedly alleged 
that churbanov received the bribes due to his connection with 
brezhnev and at one point a codefendant was quoted as telling 
investigators he gave churbanov money because he was a very 
influential man 
churbanov is an example of the stagnation period when a 
person reached high position not because of his merits but due to 
his family connections the party daily newspaper pravda said 
last week 
glasnost and democracy will help to avoid churbanovism and 
anything similar to it pravda said 
court opened at 10 am with churbanov and the others sitting in 
the dock guarded by five young soldiers from the interior ministry 
access to the courtroom was limited with only a few foreign 
reporters permitted to attend the soviet news agency tass reported 
that the eyes of the senior guardsman in his 20s open wide each 
time the figure of another bribe is mentioned 
the darkhaired churbanov dressed in a gray jacket and 
collarless black shirt was pale but stared straight ahead his 
head held high 
asked by the presiding judge army maj gen mikhail marov to 
stand and identify himself churbanov spoke in a barely audible 
voice when he said he was a former communist party member marov 
asked him if he had been expelled and churbanov answered in 
connection with the present case 
churbanovs attorney andrei makarov accused the prosecutor 
maj gen alexander sboyev of prejudicing the case against the 
accused in an aug 14 moscow news article 
in an interview published last week by the same newspaper 
makarov said some soviet media have made churbanov a scapegoat for 
all the ills of the brezhnev era and that the accounts give him 
the impression that brezhnev is being tried under the name of 
churbanov 
the trial is expected to last at least six weeks 
churbanov who married brezhnevs daughter galina in 1971 is on 
trial with eight former uzbekistan officials also accused of taking 
bribes interior minister khaidar yakhyaev 61 his deputies pyotr 
begelman and t kakhramanov and regional police chiefs identified 
only as s sabirov kh norbutaev d dzhamalov m norov and ya 
makhamadzhanov 
the trials first day ended dramatically at 6 pm when 
norbutaev who had complained earlier of feeling ill suffered an 
apparent heart attack norbutaev clutched his chest and writhed in 
pain as two doctors administered to him 
the judge then adjourned the session until tuesday 
according to pravda beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in 
uzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually with the 
government made to pay for the nonexistent crop by corrupt 
officials including uzbek party boss sharaf rashidov who died in 
1983 
today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more 
than 4 billion rubles 634 billion from the state half of which 
they stuffed into their own pockets pravda reported earlier this 
year 
churbanov who held the rank of colonel general in the 
moscowbased ministry responsible for police and law enforcement 
was a powerhungry epicure who became a key actor in shielding the 
racket pravda claimed 
officials announced churbanovs arrest in february 1987 he was 
fired from his toplevel interior ministry job in 1984 but 
reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration 
for the ministrys uniformed security troops until september 1986 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said last week that 
churbanov may get the death penalty if convicted because he is 
charged with serious economic crimes people sentenced to death by 
soviet courts are shot by a firing squad

better or otherwise this mousetrap uses 
neither springs nor poison if that doesnt strike your fancy how 
about a kit for making your own fourseater plane could you use a 
few dozen cow gallstones 
all this and more can be found in a federal government catalogue 
designed to help peddle us goods around the world 
among the other novelties listed in the monthly publication 
commercial news usa is a machine for making miniature 
doughnuts and theres genuine kiowa indian beef jerky 
the department of commerce sends 110000 copies every month to 
us missions in 140 countries but does not distribute them in the 
united states the magazine has an index in french and spanish as 
well as english and some missions translate the entire issue 
the foreign agricultural service of the agriculture department 
takes inquiries from other countries and makes them available 
through computer information networks to americans with farm 
products to sell some are published in the journal of commerce a 
business daily in new york 
earlier in the 1980s the inquiries included such exotic items 
as the cow gallstones for use in chinese medicine as well as 
fourleaf clovers and turtle eggs foreign agriculture 
published monthly by the department says it does not know what the 
clover and turtle eggs were for 
it quotes stan barrett one of the departments marketing 
specialists as saying it now prefers to concentrate on more 
mundane products like wheat wood beef and poultry 
last year the countries with the most requests were taiwan 
japan britain kuwait oman the united arab emirates egypt 
bahrain west germany and canada 
manufacturers pay 150 to get a small blackandwhite photo and 
a brief description of their product in commercial news usa 
the miniature doughnut machine called lil orbits is 
considered one of the magazines success stories janet ebner its 
program director said in an interview that its mention in the 
magazine brought 600000 worth of business for the manufacturer in 
minneapolis he had visits from interested agents in west germany 
and thailand and negotiations with a japanese distributor 
the mousetrap works this way the mouse crawls in to get the 
bait tips the trap and causes the door to lock behind it it costs 
42 to 50 cents wholesale and can be either reused or thrown away 
with the mouse inside 
the doityourself airplane kit costs 40000 the manufacturer 
claims the resulting plane when put together from the instructions 
that come with it has a cruising speed of 200 miles an hour a 
range of 1000 miles and a useful load of 850 pounds 
beef jerky is marinated dried meat in thin pieces about an inch 
wide the word comes from the quechua indians in peru but the 
version now being exported is made by a kiowa indian from oklahoma 
robert rowell 
he sold a contract to harrods department store in london after 
being helped by the foreign agricultural service to exhibit at a 
british food show 
it goes well with beer said dugger harris of the high 
value products division at the service they drink a lot of beer 
over there 
rowell won an award from president reagan as national minority 
business person of the year but then he got into trouble with 
british health authorities who disapproved of the quality of the 
oklahoma water used to prepare the beef before it was dried 
thats all right now harris said in an interview harrods 
is selling it again and hes talking with the japanese

the house democratic leadership has stamped a 
showcase drugfighting bill bipartisan and is trying to secure 
gop support by permitting votes on conservativeinspired issues 
like the death penalty 
the strategy devised by speaker jim wright of texas could 
produce an overwhelming majority for legislation that incumbents 
from both parties could use in their election races 
debate begins wednesday and a final vote could take place 
friday the senate will then follow with its own drug bill and the 
two versions would eventually be merged into final legislation 
the bipartisan approach could blunt any republican plans to 
paint democrats as soft on crime a theme already sounded by vice 
president george bush 
i dont think being tough on drugs means republicans said 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif many democrats feel 
just as strongly as republicans because we think its right 
house republicans on the other hand wont have to rant and 
rave as they often do that democrats use the rules to keep gop 
proposals from house votes 
theyll have guaranteed votes on amendments that advance their 
political agenda many democrats may join them in some votes the 
key issues will be a federal death penalty denial of federal 
benefits and state drivers licenses to drug users and a good 
faith exception to admit illegally seized drug evidence 
the house bill as introduced carries a 15 billion to 2 
billion annual pricetag money that would be added to the 39 
billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug 
abuse 
the legislation includes something for everyone involved in 
fighting illegal drugs more money for education treatment and 
rehabilitation and more resources for state and local law 
enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land in the air and on the 
seas 
but there also are new twists such as controlling the usmade 
chemicals that find their way to foreign cocaine laboratories and 
old controversies like gun control 
the bill contains a sevenday waiting period for handgun 
purchasers that has become the latest cause for both the gun owner 
and proregulation groups 
gun control organizations argue that a national waiting period 
would make it more difficult for drug dealers to obtain handguns 
mainly in the 28 states that now have no waiting period progun 
organizations protest that only lawabiding citizens would be 
harmed by the delay because criminals would not go to legitimate 
dealers 
the key gop amendments would 
provide a mandatory death penalty against those who commit 
murder in the course of a federal drug felony one liberal 
democratic alternative calls for mandatory life imprisonment 
allow admission in court of improperly seized drug evidence if 
law enforcement officers acted in good faith 
deny student loans fha mortgages rent subsidies and other 
federal benefits to convicted drug users until they complete 
rehabilitation programs after rehabilitation benefits would be 
reinstated 
another gopsponsored amendment which some republicans oppose 
would require the revocation or suspension of a drivers license 
for those convicted of a drugrelated offense federal money would 
be withheld from states to force compliance 
rep charles b rangel dny and chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics said he doesnt care much for the 
bipartisan approach once the leadership said bipartisan the 
republicans wanted these draconian measures he said 
rangel said that for conservatives the litmus test for 
commitment is the federal death penalty the death penalty now is 
applied only for state crimes because congress has not adopted the 
constitutional standards required to carry out capital punishment 
however coelho predicted that many democrats would back the 
death penalty and suggested the main party split would come over 
the gop plan to deny benefits to drug users 
to address complaints from local officials who said they never 
received promised antidrug grants the bill would require states 
to automatically pass through antidrug money to local governments 
banking law revisions would allow the government to closely 
watch institutions where drug money might be laundered 
recipients of federal grants or contracts would need to maintain 
a drugfree workplace 
money would be provided for drug education treatment and 
rehabilitation for aids victims and groups with a high risk of 
getting the disease 
the legislation would authorize 10 million for a latin american 
regional antidrug force if one is approved by the organization of 
american states

with uncharacteristic speed congress is 
expected in its final weeks to create a new law to combat what has 
become one of the biggest and most emotional problems of the summer 
of 88 medical waste that has invaded and shut down some of 
americas favorite beaches 
intense pressure from outraged citizens has driven congress to 
hold a series of public hearings including one this week on long 
islands jones beach and at least one measure and maybe more will 
be passed before the legislative year ends lawmakers and 
environmental activists predicted 
separate measures to create a waste tracking system and to 
establish specific criminal penalties for medical waste dumping 
passed the senate before the august recess similar measures are 
pending in various house committees 
with all the publicity this has gotten these will sail right 
through said john catena a science policy analyst at the 
oceanic society a national environmental group that focuses on 
coastal problems 
the fact that you had one of the hottest summers in 50 years 
and tens of millions of people were unable to make use of the 
public beaches really drew the issue right home said andy kass 
a researcher at the natural resources defense council in new york 
rep bruce a morrison a democrat who represents part of the 
connecticut coast along the long island sound said another reason 
for the unusual speed on capitol hill is the clarity of the issue 
theres no reputable other side of the issue said morrison 
no one can excuse the presence of medical waste in the ocean and 
the only way it can get there is from illegal dumping theres 
not a lot of technical debate here we know what we can do lets 
do it 
environmentalists concede that the medical waste problem poses 
much less of a longterm health threat than other issues plaguing 
the nations coastal waters such as sludge dumping that have 
languished in congress for years 
in terms of longterm survival of the ocean its not a 
serious problem in terms of impact on peoples lives it is 
said andrew palmer of the american oceans campaign another 
activist group 
catena said medical waste simply is a much more visible issue 
when it closes your beach down that makes a lot more rumblings 
many environmentalists see a silver lining in the dirty 
syringes vials bandages and other hospital debris that has washed 
ashore from massachusetts to the gulf of mexico 
palmer said public outrage over medical waste has been 
transferred to other less well known but potentially more dangerous 
coastal pollution problems 
were seeing it already and i think thats being translated 
to congress he said 
catena said a bill banning sludge dumping off the new yorknew 
jersey shore was passed by the senate last month because of the 
attention surrounding medical waste 
its helpful no question about it said sen john h 
chafee rri a leader in the medical waste fight in congress 
it has probably been the best single item to draw attention to 
abuse of the oceans 
since incidents of medical waste pollution began making 
headlines around the fourth of july weekend the senate has passed 
a measure by sen frank lautenberg dnj and chafee to require 
hospitals transporters and disposal companies to adhere to a 
manifest system that would give investigators a paper trail to find 
the source of illegal dumping 
the pilot program would cover new york new jersey and 
connecticut states where much of the dumping is suspected of 
taking place a similar measure is pending in the house 
the senate also approved amendments to a sludge dumping bill 
that would create criminal penalties of up to 250000 in fines and 
five years in prison for illegal dumping a house subcommittee has 
approved a similar measure 
other bills still pending would set up a series of rules for the 
handling treatment storage transportation and disposal of 
hospital waste 
but catena warned that proper funding levels must be made 
available to back up any new laws 
its great to have a law issued to address a problem but if 
we dont have the money to enforce it its not worth the paper 
its printed on he said

a congressional bid to grant tennis star ivan 
lendl immediate american citizenship so he could play on the us 
olympic team failed because czechoslovakian officials refused to 
provide waivers for their native son lawmakers said 
lendl the worlds topranked tennis player has lived in 
greenwich conn since 1981 and wanted to represent his adopted 
homeland in seoul this month i am very excited about the 
possibilities of playing in the olympics davis cup and world team 
cup for america the tennis star said earlier this year 
enlisting the help of connecticut lawmakers lendl won house 
judiciary committee approval in april of a special immigration bill 
that would have waived the necessary fiveyear waiting period and 
given him immediate citizenship 
that was a major victory because rep romano l mazzoli dky 
chairman of the immigration subcommittee generally opposes 
olympictied immigration bills proponents considered the 
subcommittee vote lendls biggest potential stumbling block 
but on the house floor rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis 
blocked the measure and said he would drop his opposition only if 
the proponents could secure a guarantee from the czech government 
that it would provide a waiver for lendl to represent the united 
states in the olympics 
olympic rules required a waiver because lendl previously 
represented czechoslovakia in international competition at the 
davis cup 
rep christopher shays rconn who represents greenwich and 
rep bruce a morrison dconn a member of the house judiciary 
committee urged czech officials to grant the waiver they refused 
in a terse dispatch to shays relayed through the embassy the 
czechoslovak association of physical culture wrote the 
czechoslovak olympic committee does not have any reason to agree 
with the representation of ivan lendl in the team of the united 
states at the olympic games in seoul 
we pressed the issue morrison said in a telephone interview 
last week maybe we could have succeeded with more time but 
time has basically run out 
morrison said he shays and sen lowell p weicker jr rconn 
pushed the legislation solely in the hopes of getting lendl on the 
us olympic team with that ruled out legislation to give him 
fasttrack citizenship will be abandoned 
lendl 28 received his permanent residence status last year he 
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in 
1992 his attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls 
last week

always looking for ways to improve 
security the marine corps has planted a hedge that will sprout 
thousands of razorsharp thorns said to be strong enough to stop a 
speeding jeep 
about 60000 bushes bearing the brand name living fence have 
been planted at the marine air station at cherry point to increase 
security around flight lines storage areas for explosives and the 
military kennel 
once the hedgerow is fully grown youd have to use a chain 
saw or explosivespacked bangalore torpedo to get them out 
said lt col stephen shivers provost marshal of cherry point 
the plants scientific name is trifoliate orange the bushes 
which grow abundantly in the hills of east tennessee sometimes 
extend to a height of 20 feet and are used by farmers to protect 
cattle and hogs 
when shrubs mature about five years after planting 
harmlesslooking green hedgerows at cherry point will conceal 3 to 
5inch thorns that make the barrier nearly impossible to climb over 
or cut through 
to enhance our overall security program we thought wed give 
these bushes a try shrivers said 
he said a common nickname for the bush is pt that stands for 
the pain and terror inflicted on anyone who tries to break 
through the hedge he said the marines that work on it have some 
unquotable names for it shivers said 
the bushes which are marketed by barrier concepts inc of oak 
ridge tenn cost about 150 apiece the marketer boasts they are 
strong enough to stop a jeep 
cherry point officials have invested 82000 in the project 
most of the shrubs at cherry point were planted about a year 
ago barrier concepts officials said the plants last up to 35 
years three times as long as metal barriers 
shrivers said the project is a local marine initiative and 
hasnt been condemned or blessed by his superiors 
barrier concepts officials say the plants seeds were first 
brought to the united states in the 1860s by chinese coolies 
working on western railroads 
the chinese didnt use the hedge for security reasons they used 
the thorns for acupuncture

according to figures from the railway ministry daily passenger 
load was 344 million people an increase of 251000 people from

worlds first triangular 2 coin last year it was advertised as 
money from paradise 
apparently the campaign worked too well 
radio cooks monitored in sydney said monday that investors 
mostly from new zealand have scooped up virtually all the 90000 
coins that were minted 
richard mcdonald director of the cook islands numismatics 
bureau blamed the run on the widely distributed brochures that 
advertised the coin 
the cook islands population 20000 is a selfgoverning 
dependency of new zealand the coral islands in the south pacific 
lie nearly 1900 miles northeast of auckland new zealand

a former ashland oil executive who won a 
167 million settlement after charging he was wrongfully fired for 
refusing to offer bribes to foreign officials says he has not 
decided how to use his wealth 
the majority of the settlement the 1225 million former 
ashland vice president bill e mckay jr was awarded for being 
wrongfully discharged is taxfree 
he and fellow former vice president harry williams filed suit 
claiming they were illegally fired for refusing to offer bribes to 
foreign officials or to cover up such bribes 
an eightweek jury trial of their case in covington ended june 
10 with a 695 million decision against ashland and a finding 
that ashland violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act by engaging in a pattern of illegal interstate 
activity to obtain oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
ashland later sought a new trial or a different judgment and 
finally agreed to pay the two men 25 million 
as part of the settlement mckay williams and the court agreed 
to set aside the rico finding 
mckay said last week he was still trying to recover from the 
stress of intense negotiations that led up to the settlement 
among the settlements numerous terms is one providing that 
mckay and williams cannot portray themselves in any future movie 
versions of the case that point wasnt hard to give up 
mckay said 
after the trial mckay had said that his expenses were enormous 
and that he had been unable to find employment equal to his 
sixfigure position at ashland oil 
he is paid 50000 a year as a consultant to englehard corp a 
new jersey company which supplies catalysts to refineries and he 
hopes to land other consulting contracts 
williams has moved to boca raton fla 
in addition to his share of the 25 million mckay and his 
attorneys received a taxable 2 million for breach of contract 
they also won almost 25 million for various expenses the 
agreement did not make clear whether that money was taxable 
ashland oils 25 million settlement was paid aug 26 
the settlement agreement also gave mckay and his attorneys 165 
million for expenses related to the case 
mckay said last week that money did not cover legal fees but was 
for related costs such as depositions copying documents and hotel 
bills 
mckay and tachau declined to discuss details not included in the 
written agreement such as the attorneys percentage of the 
settlement 
tachaus law firm brown todd amp heyburn had as many as nine 
attorneys and several staff members working on mckays case tachau 
said the firm also opened a temporary office in covington during 
the eightweek trial

provincetownboston airlines the nations first 
regional commuter carrier and once the largest officially dies 
tuesday 
in reality it died four years ago 
whats happening now is like watching a patient catching 
cancer said john c van arsdale jr who had to resign as pbas 
chairman after the federal aviation administration stripped his 
pilots license in disastrous 1984 when the patient dies its 
merciful 
some industry analysts say the demise of the 39yearold airline 
is an example of how deregulation has crippled small commuter 
airlines partly by spurring fare wars and unchecked growth 
john van arsdale sr started the carrier on nov 30 1949 with 
just a twoseat cessna 140 
over the years pba routinely ran extra planes to cape cod and 
area resort islands if more passengers showed up and it grew in 
the early 1980s after van arsdale turned control over to his 
expansionminded sons 
then came backtoback fatal accidents in 1984 the federal 
government shut down the airline because of safety and training 
violations two weeks after it was flying again 13 people died in 
a crash in florida bankruptcy and takeover followed close behind 
the bitter van arsdale sons say the faa overreacted to minor 
problems the father says his sons too brashly expanded what was a 
cozy and profitable regional service 
we didnt overreact at all said faa spokesman jack barker 
we reacted properly and in the interest of aviation safety 
pba formally ceases to be an airline tuesday when its parent 
bar harbor airways of bangor maine a tiny part of the giant texas 
air corp retires its federal operating certificate 
pbas planes are being sold including n136pb a dc3 flying 
since the durable breed went out of production in the 1940s and 
service on some routes will be reduced or canceled bar harbor 
sales director steven mason said 
you might lay the whole thing at the door of deregulation 
said jon hurdle associate editor of travel weekly who has written 
about pba van arsdale jr was worried about the competitive 
effects of deregulation so he expanded arguably more than he 
should have 
over the years van arsdale conservatively expanded service in 
the late 1950s he worked out a innovative deal with naples 
airlines in florida under which the two carriers borrowed each 
others services in the offseason naples sent its planes and 
crews north in the summer while pbas operations migrated south in 
winter 
then he retired in 1980 turning pba over to his sons peter and 
john jr who bought more planes acquired another small airline 
and bulked up operations flights were added around new england and 
the south 
i had reservations said the elder van arsdale 68 i felt 
they were moving a little too fast on the other hand everything 
seemed to be going well 
by 1983 pba was the largest regional commuter in the nation it 
carried 220000 passengers in 1979 and saw its load grow six times 
to 13 million in the first nine months of 1984 a period in which 
pba reported profits of 33 million on revenues of 584 million 
by the end of 1984 pba had 1600 employees 500 daily flights 
and 104 planes 
in order to survive in a deregulated environment we had to 
grow said john jr 43 
they were the envy of some carriers for some time because they 
made money said george james president of airlines economics 
inc a washingtonbased aviation consultant 
then came the crashes and the faa scrutiny 
public confidence collapsed passenger traffic dropped 50 
percent in two days bankers tightened the reins on more than 30 
million in credit the stock plummeted 
pba filed for bankruptcy in march 1985 a year later it was 
bought for 30 million by people express itself now defunct 
alfred kahn a cornell university economics professor who headed 
the nowdefunct civil aeronautics board when it deregulated the 
industry in 1978 disagrees that deregulation is to blame for pbas 
collapse 
deregulation gave people an opportunity to make money as some 
of them have he said and gave other people a chance to make 
mistakes

a group wants to start what it believes 
would be the first television station in the country that offers a 
full slate of programming aimed at a jewish audience 
bridgeways communications of westport said its programming would 
be cultural rather than religious 
it will not be the jewish version of the 700 club said 
michael vlock bridgeways president 
the stations target audience would be the 3 million jews living 
in northern new jersey metropolitan new york and connecticut 
the station is intended to be both a resource and a 
celebration of the contributions the jewish community has made to 
society vlock said 
while the programs would be designed to appeal to jews we 
want to be attractive to a broader audience as well vlock said 
the station plans to offer programming in areas such as the 
arts education travel politics science history business and 
current events vlock said 
bridgeways now operates wbcttv channel 43 a home shopping 
channel which he said was started to preserve the companys fcc 
license before becoming a station offering jewish programming 
investors have already raised and spent 3 million to finance 
construction of the stations transmitter and antenna located in 
seymour an additional 500000 was just raised to finance 
development of the new format 
vlock placed the total costs of establishing the station at 
about 10 million 
if bridgeways is to be successful in its endeavor industry 
experts say it will have to persuade cable companies in the region 
to carry the station and convince advertisers that jews will watch 
its programs 
vlock and his mother laurel vlock chairwoman of bridgeways 
are confident that cable networks will make room for channel 43 
people are very concerned about their roots its a trend in 
america in all ethnicities today laurel vlock said 
said michael vlock we offer a large focused loyal and 
welleducated audience what more does an advertiser want

when he was a teenager singing in front of an audience didnt 
bother him but that was all he could do on stage

1986 but says he had another bout of nervousness recently when he 
performed in london before rock star mick jagger and his girlfriend 
jerry hall 
you know in his case hes going to hear every little mistake 
but the show went great and he and jerry came backstage 
afterwards said travis 29 
to start with he was a little standoffish i guess youd say 
he didnt really know what to say or didnt want to say anything 
but once we started talking he was very friendly

barefoot women among the millions 
of homeless in flooded bangladesh clambered from boats monday onto 
the only strip of this village still above water and surrounded 
army officers who doled out food 
they pushed each other in the light rain to get at the giant 
cooking pots they stuffed fistfuls of cooked rice and lentils into 
their own pots and bowls or into the folds of their mudstained 
saris 
floods have submerged threefourths of the nation and claimed at 
least 406 lives this summer according to official figures daily 
tallies in dhaka newspapers put the death toll at 1015 
more than 92000 people are known to suffer from diarrhea and 
5715 more from dysentery the health ministry said 
taslimur rahman joint secretary of the ministry told reporters 
in the capital of dhaka that people get the diseases by drinking 
impure water often the very flood water that maroons them 
officials say water purification tablets are being distributed 
but residents of bailtali a village of 2000 people 55 miles 
southwest of dhaka said they had not seen any 
the water that is available to drink is the flood water we 
have no option but to drink it injul haq majumder a 37yearold 
teacher told reporters who arrived by helicopter 
he translated his reply from english to bengali for villagers 
who crowded around a dozen men nodded vigorously in agreement 
only two short strips of road totaling about 500 yards 
remained above water in bailtali 
one was covered with makeshift shelters of bamboo poles and palm 
thatch and the other was bare as two air force helicopters 
descended through the rain except for the food kettles 
round holes were punched into the mud along the road and bamboo 
poles lay nearby an army officer who would not give his name 
said temporary shelters were dismantled so the helicopters could 
land 
more than 100 small fishing boats carrying two to 10 people 
each bobbed beside the road in flood waters that had engulfed 
power lines and left only the tips of poles and a few loops of wire 
visible 
people throughout bangladesh are huddled on tiny outcroppings of 
muddy earth like those at bailtali 
the largest bit of land seen during a helicopter tour monday 
that covered onetenth of the country was about the size of a 
football field 
almost all the districts are like this dont think this is 
the worst information minister mahbubur rahman told a dozen 
foreign journalists who accompanied him on the flight 
rahman said 50 of the countrys 64 districts and 25 million of 
its 110 million people have been directly affected by floods 
that began in june with the annual monsoon then eased but 
worsened again last week 
by his definition directly affected included anyone who had 
lost relatives a home or business crops or other property 
it is a calamity he said its like a war situation and 
then you have to reconstruct the country 
rahman said it was too early to put a cost on the damage and 
reconstruction but called the loss colossal homes 
agriculture communications bridges culverts educational 
institutions all damaged or washed away 
he and the pilots said the helicopter tour covered 4000 to 
5000 square miles northwest west and southwest of dhaka the 
choppers sometimes flew only 200 to 400 feet above the water 
about 45 miles west of dhaka at the confluence of the jamuna and 
ganges mighty rivers even in nonflooding months muddy brown 
water stretched for up to 25 miles interrupted only by protruding 
treetops 
entire villages had vanished in some towns people had pitched 
tents on the roofs of buildings tall enough to reach above water 
level and taken their goats and chickens to safety with them 
floods are an annual monsoon event in bangladesh a disaster 
that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops but rahman and 
other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory 
last years floods killed about 300 people rahman said but 
dhaka newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1500 
because the floods come regularly people seek higher ground or 
take to boats as soon as the water starts rising thus averting 
greater loss of life the government says most who drown are small 
children and elderly people 
bangladesh whose per capita annual income of 150 is one of 
the worlds poorest nations rivers run through it like veins 
making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour 
south into the bay of bengal 
there shouldnt even be a country here there shouldnt be any 
people here a western relief worker said asked whether canals 
and dams would help he shook his head in despair and replied 
theres too much water

vlok places suttner under nighttime house arrest and bars him from 
any educational facility effectively preventing him from returning

a former official of gte corp has accused the 
telecommunications giant of bribery currency smuggling and 
exchanging money on black markets in central america according to 
court documents 
a lawsuit filed by paul dimatteo former gte general manager for 
central america also claims his supervisors forced him to engage 
in illegal financial practices designed to drain capital from 
nicaragua honduras el salvador and guatemala 
he alleges he was fired unfairly by general telephone amp 
electronics based in stamford conn when he refused 
the lawsuit is set for trial sept 13 before us district judge 
earl gilliam who last month denied gte attorneys request that the 
case be dismissed 
gte officials have declined to discuss the matter but issued a 
brief statement denying dimatteos allegations 
according to the statement the 10year gte veteran was fired 
for failing to perform satisfactorily as a general manager he 
was never encouraged to engage in illegal activities during his 
threeyear term as general manager of the companys electric 
products subsidiaries in central america it said 
mr dimatteos suit is totally without merit and were 
confident that gte will be completely exonerated in this matter 
the statement said 
dimatteo 57 who now owns a small manufacturing business in 
northern san diego county denied he was fired for poor 
performance neither he nor his lawyers would discuss the case 
further 
in court documents his lawyers have indicated that they intend 
to bring up during the trial similar allegations made against gte 
in the past 
according to the documents odalier villalobos costa ricas 
vice minister and later minister of the economy from 1983 through 
1986 was involved in the bribery scheme 
gte through the consulting firm consultoria e inversiones 
ltda paid villalobos the equivalent of 400 to 500 a month 
beginning in 1983 so he would prevent a competitor from selling 
products in costa rica dimatteo said in a deposition 
villalobos suggested the payments and they were approved by 
frederick howard dimatteos superior in danvers mass 
headquarters of gtes precision materials and sylvania lighting 
groups the lawsuit said 
howard who eventually fired dimatteo did not return a 
telephone call to his office in williamsport pa where he is now 
vice president and general manager of gtes electrical components 
and materials division 
villalobos could not be reached in costa rica for comment 
dimatteo claims his only interference with the payments was to 
set the monthly limit and to insist the consulting company find a 
way to make the payments appear legal in the companys books 
he says he objected however when the company sought to 
exchange in us dollars instead of local currencies and encouraged 
illegal methods if legal ones were unavailable 
to obtain this objective dimatteo says his superiors turned to 
the black market smuggling and other illegal methods according to 
a disposition 
an audit of gte by arthur andersen amp co accounting firm in 1983 
noted that the company had exchanged in the currency black market 
in nicaragua and warned the company against continuing the 
practice according to court documents 
in 1977 the securities and exchange commission charged that gte 
paid as much as 14 million in bribes and kickbacks in 28 
countries including iran the philippines and the united states 
gte neither admitted nor denied the allegations but consented 
to a permanent injunction agreeing to refrain from any future 
violations

labor secretary ann mclaughlin said monday the 
big increase in the minimum wage sought by democrats could cost 
jobs and fuel inflation 
mclaughlin interviewed on nbctvs today show defended 
republican support for a subminimum training wage for 
teenagers 
the minimum wage increase across the board as its being 
discussed by the democrats in congress is really a job loser and 
potentially inflationary said mclaughlin 
but in detroit democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
told a labor day rally were going to raise that minimum wage 
and make sure the people of this country have a decent income 
the minimum wage has been set at 335 an hour since 1981 
democrats are pushing bills in congress that would raise it to 
455 by 1991 in the senate version or 505 by 1992 in the house 
version 
vice president george bush is generally opposed to raising the 
335anhour minimum wage his running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana has led the opposition in the senate to a democratic bill 
that would raise the minimum and peg it to inflation 
but quayle said last week that he now favors a gradual increase 
in the minimum wage to 4 an hour coupled with a training wage 
mclaughlin said she was on the same wavelength as quayle 
were sort of talking the same thing there is an interest in 
increasing the minimum wage but theres a greater interest in 
having some kind of a training wage she said 
merely increasing the minimum wage does not address young 
workers need for better education and training she said 
i think the idea of some kind of a training wage that might 
allow us to get particularly our young people into a job learn 
about coming to work coming back the next day and learning a 
little bit about what it takes to hold a job might be helpful 
she said 
she questioned the logic of an acrosstheboard increase when 
there are some places right now that some are suffering from job 
shortages and you cant get a job for 7 or 8 an hour and there 
are other place in our country youd love to have a job at 335

more than three years after twa 
flight 847 was hijacked to beirut two of the us passengers who 
were held hostage aboard the plane will tell a german court about 
their terrifying ordeal 
their testimony will be given at the trial of mohammed ali 
hamadi who is accused of air piracy and murder 
the trial resumes tuesday after a fourweek recess 
thirtynine us passengers were held captive for 17 days and a 
us navy diver was killed during the hijacking 
some passengers were beaten and many said they were tormented 
with death threats after the athens to rome flight was commandeered 
on june 14 1985 
hamadi who already admitted in court that he was one of the 
four men who took part in the hijacking is expected to testify 
tuesday before the judges hear from the two us citizens whose 
names have been withheld 
the masscirculation bild newspaper said monday the us 
government was flying the two us witnesses to frankfurt aboard 
military aircraft for security reasons 
thats why from tomorrow on security level no 1 will be in 
force at the rheinmain air base the newspaper said the us 
government is having the witnesses brought to the hamadi trial with 
military aircraft 
asked about the bild report base spokesman lt william 
dillingham told the associated press i have not heard anything 
security level no 1 is the highest possible at a us military 
base 
the pilot of flight 847 john testrake already has told the ap 
from his home in missouri that he probably will sleep at the 
rheinmain base just outside frankfurt when he comes to germany 
later this month to testify 
they will first testify about the identification of the 
suspect court spokesman falk thomas said of the two american 
witnesses and theyll also testify about the horrible 
experiences during the hijacking 
the hijackers beat 23yearold robert stethem a us navy 
diver before he was fatally shot and his body was thrown onto the 
runway at beirut airport 
west german officials arrested hamadi on jan 13 1987 at 
frankfurt airport when customs inspectors found explosives in his 
luggage 
his trial began july 5 in a specially built courtroom inside 
frankfurts preungesheim prison 
he has testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force the 
release of lebenase shiite moslems imprisoned in israel shortly 
after the ordeal was over israel released about 700 shiites 
in a surprise move aug 9 hamadi admitted he had taken part in 
the twa hijacking but denied killing stethem 
under west german law the frankfurt court can convict hamadi of 
murder even if he did not pull the trigger hamadi who west german 
officials say is 24 years old faces a maximum sentence of life in 
prison 
us officials also have indicted hamadi on air piracy and 
murder charges but west germany has refused an extradition request 
from washington 
in april a duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers 
abbas hamadi to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two german 
businessmen in beirut in an unsuccesful bid to force west germany 
to free mohammed from prison 
the other three men involved in the twa hijacking remain at 
large

the gun doesnt shoot any type of projectile and must be touched 
to a surface to send a charge sergek said 
the weapon was tucked in a pouch hanging from the mans belt 
when a secret service agent spotted it said police sgt nate 
caplan 
theyre considered nonlethal but if you had a 75year old 
person with a heart condition it might be different said caplan 
the man whose name was not immediately released was being 
questioned by the secret service sergek said the man was by 
himself and was not anywhere within arms reach of the vice 
president 
there are indications he has carried the item for 
selfprotection and merely had it with him when he went to the 
rally he said 
it may merely have been a situation of very poor judgment 
there doesnt appear to be any connection between the item and the 
visit

a titan 2 rocket that 
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into 
space monday carrying a secret air force payload believed to be 
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on soviet ships 
the launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles 
had been used as a space booster and apparently was the second 
time us spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a 
week 
it was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as 
expected said air force capt norma payne 
but the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two 
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended 
polar orbit circling the earth from north to south poles 
the rocket almost certainly carried a foursatellite addition to 
the navys white cloud navy ocean surveillance system an 
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies soviet 
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions space 
policy analyst john pike said before the launch 
the navy really likes them said pike of the 
washingtonbased federation of american scientists they are very 
important for being able to keep track of the soviet fleet 
pike said a white cloud launch consists of one mother 
satellite and three subsatellites and that when orbit is 
reached the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so 
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in 
polar orbit 
the 375 million titan 2 roared off space launch complex 4 west 
and into fogshrouded skies at 225 am pdt ms payne said at 
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
the force of the blastoff rattled windows in the nearby town of 
lompoc where police said they received a halfdozen calls from 
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch 
the liquidfueled twostage rocket is 103 feet high and capable 
of lifting 4200 pounds into a 100nauticalmile circular orbit 
starting in the 1960s titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in 
arkansas kansas and arizona where they served as intercontinental 
ballistic missiles each carrying a ninemegaton hydrogen warhead 
but the missiles were removed from service because the 
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had 
a tendency to blow up pike said 
the air force then ordered 13 titan 2s reconditioned as space 
boosters under a 5289 million contract with martin marietta corp 
air force officials have said more are likely to be refurbished 
because recycling the old icbms is cheaper than building new 
rockets 
last friday a satellite said to be designed for intercepting 
soviet communications was launched by a 65 million titan 34d 
rocket from cape canaveral fla but a source close to the project 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the spacecraft failed to 
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22300 miles high when the 
upper stage of the rocket failed to reignite he said there was 
little hope of salvaging that mission 
despite that failure air force secretary edward c pete 
aldridge issued a prepared statement after mondays launch 
declaring this is the year of space launch recovery 
todays successful titan 2 launch is the first of three new 
boosters the air force will launch in the coming year aldridge 
said the titan 2 titan 4 and the delta 2 will ensure this 
nations access to space for many years to come 
the launch had been expected a week earlier but apparently was 
delayed by a fuel leak that the air force said spurred evacuation 
of the launch pad aug 28 no one was hurt in that incident 
officials said 
pike said the only other payload the titan 2 might boost into 
orbit from vandenberg was a defense meteorological support program 
satellite but he called that unlikely 
a titan 2 exploded in its arkansas silo on sept 19 1980 
killing one crewman injuring 21 others blasting a 250footwide 
crater and lofting the ninemegaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet 
from the silo fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo 
evacuations also plagued titan 2 icbms which since have been 
replaced by minuteman midgetman and mx missiles 
pike said air force officials have testified before congress 
that the first 13 reconditioned titan 2s would be used for one 
launch of a landsat earthobserving science satellite six launches 
of dmsp weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a 
classified program 
four or five sets of white clouds about 16 to 20 satellites 
already are in orbit with the new set likely meant to replace 
aging white clouds launched in the early 1980s he said 
pike compared white clouds to soviet rorsats or radar ocean 
reconaissance satellites which monitor us ship movements

american negotiators on monday broke off 
talks with greek officials about a new agreement on us military 
bases after greece announced it will close the us air force 
installation at athens airport 
a us embassy spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the talks were temporarily suspended so the negotiating 
team headed by ambassador alan flanagan can return to washington 
for guidance 
the spokeswoman said the greek side for the first time stated 
their call for the closure of hellenikon base was nonnegotiable 
neither she nor sotiris kostopoulos the greek government 
spokesman could say when the talks held at the foreign ministry 
would resume 
the suspension came at the beginning of a ninth round of 
negotiations for a new greekamerican defense accord to replace a 
1983 agreement that expires in december the talks began in 
november 1987 
hellenikon which is next to athens international airport is 
one of four american bases that have operated in greece since the 
1950s it provides support for us air force and navy planes 
monitoring soviet naval operations in the mediterranean and for the 
three other us bases the greek government has not indicated that 
it intends to close any of the other bases 
about 1400 american servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 
greeks work at the base located 10 miles from the city center 
about 3500 us military personnel are stationed at the four 
us bases two near athens and two on the island of crete 
as a form of rent for the bases greece currently receives 340 
million a year in us credits to purchase military equipment 
the socialist government of premier andreas papandreou was 
elected in 1981 on a platform that called for closing all the 
american bases and pulling greece out of nato two years later he 
signed a new bases pact saying the closures were postponed for its 
fiveyear duration 
the premier now says greece is willing to sign another bases 
agreement but that it must first be approved in a referendum 
papandreou also insists that the united states help solve 
greekturkish disputes over military control of the aegean sea and 
the divided island of cyprus in return for a new agreement 
 
under the terms of the 1983 pact greece issued a formal 
shutdown notice for the bases in july although it is not expected 
to be carried out 
last month the government said it was planning to shut down 
hellenikon 
but mondays announcement at the talks was the first official 
notification to the us government

a nuclear power plant caught fire in lithuania on 
monday but automatic safety systems extinguished the flames before 
radiation could be released the official tass news agency reported 
tass said no one was injured by the blaze which began at 1250 
am in a control cable of the second reactor of the ignalina power 
plant in lithuania a soviet republic on the baltic sea 
the chief dispatcher of the soviet atomic power ministry erik 
pozdyshev told tass the reactors safety systems automatically 
kicked in and that the fire had already been put out by the time 
firefighters arrived 
he said no radiation escaped the plant and there were no 
injuries among the public or plant employees the reactor one of 
two at the plant was shut down after the accident tass said 
the news agencys prompt reporting of the fire reflected the new 
official policy under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive 
for more openness especially about important events such as 
accidents 
considering the heightened public interest in nuclear reactor 
operations which is quite understandable after the chernobyl 
accident we decided to inform the public about what has happened 
at the ignalina station at once pozdyshev said 
the soviet union waited days before informing the world of the 
april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant 
the first report on the accident came from swedish officials 
after high levels of radiation were discovered in sweden 
the worlds worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people and 
sent out a cloud of radiation that stretched worldwide it led to a 
major reevaluation of the safety of nuclear power in the soviet 
union and in many other countries 
the government newspaper izvestia reported on thursday that 
lithuanias cabinet had ordered construction stopped on a third 
reactor at ignalina 
the newspaper said numerous safety violations were committed 
during construction of the plants first reactor and were repeated 
on the third unit 
tass said a commission has been formed to investigate todays 
accident

president reagan is planning dual 
fall campaigns an overt political one on behalf of george bush and 
the other an effort to wring a wish list of items from an 
electionminded congress 
im sure the presidents philosophy right now is very much 
so little time and so much to do said kenneth duberstein 
reagans chief of staff 
but reagans mix of lambasting democrats on the political stump 
and then seeking cooperation from them on capitol hill is not one 
that necessarily has produced legislative successes in the past 
some items however hold more promise than others in the 
relatively brief time before congress adjourns to start campaigning 
in october 
if lame duck means hes in his last year in office then hes 
a lame duck but if it means he cant get anything done it doesnt 
fit contended white house spokesman b jay cooper in santa 
barbara with the reagan entourage 
cooper said that among other things reagan intends to push for 
senate passage of the uscanadian free trade agreement and 
designation of a cabinetlevel department of veterans affairs 
with some fanfare the president also will sign the new housing 
bill seen as an electionyear boost for both parties 
the president also will look for the nearcertain approval of 
his two cabinet nominees nicholas brady as treasury secretary and 
lauro cavazos to head the department of education 
included on the more contentious side of the ledger are the 
renewal of aid to the nicaraguan contras welfare reform and 
passage of the remaining 11 appropriations bills 
when he signed an appropriation bill in midaugust reagan told 
capitol hill not to repeat its past habit of sending him a single 
megabill that wraps up the various appropriations bills in a 
single bill that spends 600 billion of the taxpayers money 
and in his radio address on saturday reagan gave notice hell 
veto any welfare legislation congress sends him if it does not 
contain a work requirement 
the best way to learn to work is to work the president said 
in his labor day weekend radio address 
on his way back from a vacation at his ranch in california 
reagan planned two stops tuesday the dedication of the gray 
communications center at nebraskas hastings college and an address 
to the american legion in louisville ky 
the hastings stop is viewed as a favor to a longtime 
acquaintance washington public relations executive bob gray who 
is a native of the small midwestern town and worked as the director 
of communications for reagans 1980 election victory 
reagan also is scheduled to appear briefly at a fundraiser for 
sen david karnes rneb the appointed senator in a tight race 
against the popular former nebraska governor bob kerrey 
in louisville reagan is expected to extol his administrations 
record on defense and foreign policy and repeat his hardlyveiled 
message that the vice president will continue along the path he 
started if elected 
duberstein interviewed sunday on cbstvs face the nation 
said it is a priority of the president to make sure that george 
bush is elected 
i think the president can be a help to the vice president by 
reminding the american people how far things have come how many 
changes have been made and why it is important to continue on that 
path duberstein said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater has told reporters 
reagan is expected to travel twice a week on bushs behalf 
visiting between eight to 15 cities in the next two months 
the main thing will be to draw the distinction between 
liberals and conservatives democrats and republicans fitzwater 
said of reagans political agenda 
hell talk about peace through strength why a strong military 
forced the soviets to the bargaining table and resulted in arms 
control agreements of unprecedented proportions and contrast that 
with the democratic oppositions military stance of reduction in 
strength pulling troops out of various places around the world 
these will be his themes and we thing theyll play in all 
parts of the country fitzwater predicted 
the president has no foreign trips planned but is likely to go 
to the united nations for the opening of the fall general assembly 
session

students threatened on monday to launch 
further strikes and mass protests unless an interim government is 
formed to supervise multiparty elections that would end 26 years of 
oneparty rule 
in another development at least 20 people were killed in a 
rangoon suburb in a clash between neighborhood security patrols and 
thieves 
the students action supervision committee told reporters the 
government must meet their demands by 8 pm wednesday or protests 
will follow thursday 
opponents of the burma socialist program party have rejected 
president maung maungs proposed nationwide referendum on the 
future of his party 
for the past weeks the government has been crippled by strikes 
and daily demonstrations and a western diplomat estimated that 40 
town administrations were taken over by protesters neighborhood 
committees formed largely of students and buddhist monks have 
patrolled many areas of the country against the spreading 
lawlessness and violence 
on sunday residents of the rangoon suburb of south okkalapa 
said a bloody clash occurred after thieves captured 15 members of a 
neighborhood committee who rushed to a government biscuit factory 
to stop looting 
on monday a mob burst into the factory where they found eight 
members of the committee dead including two monks the mob then 
killed 12 thieves captured 10 and set fire to nearby houses 
belonging to people suspected of involvement in the looting the 
residents said the thieves reportedly included people recently 
released from jail 
more than 10000 prisoners have been released or escaped from 
burma jails over the past two weeks in what some diplomats 
speculate was a calculated move by the government to create chaos 
to justify a military crackdown 
the all burma students union on monday released what it said was 
a secret aug 22 directive from the head of government military 
intelligence 
under prevailing conditions in the country intelligence units 
and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and 
confusion among the public the directive said it bore a 
signature and official stamp but its authenticity could not be 
verified 
a japanese burma scholar minoru kiryu said on monday the 
situation in the country was chaotic and it was uncertain if 
maung maungs government would survive until the party meeting 
also monday more than 50000 people held a solemn ceremony on a 
lake in suburban rangoon for student protesters said to have been 
killed assaulted and drowned there by police during march 17 
antigovernment demonstrations 
wreaths were placed on a flowerdecked raft which drifted away 
as many students wept and prayed aloud 
the government said at least 43 people died in the march riots 
but western diplomats said at least 100 people were killed 
demonstrations flared in june and again after ruler ne win 
resigned july 23 after 26 years in power the party chose 
hardliner sein lwin to succeed him 
government radio said 112 people died in rangoon in rioting 
against sein lwin who resigned after only 17 days in power 
diplomats believe many more people were killed 
maung maung took power aug 19 as the first civilian leader in 
26 years

solidarity activists said on monday that 
more strikes will occur in poland if negotiations with the 
government on workers grievances do not achieve a positive result 
at a news conference for western correspondents at the apartment 
of senior solidarity adviser jacek kuron representatives of miners 
and steel workers on strike last week said that they were pinning 
their hopes on winning legalization of the banned solidarity union 
on the upcoming talks 
it is certain more strikes will occur if the talks fail 
said kuron 
workers problems will not be settled without solidarity 
said jan litynski a solidarity activist from warsaw who was with 
striking miners in recent weeks in jastrzebie 
kuron said there has been no word yet from the authorities about 
when the talks would be convened and exactly who would participate 
he said solidarity was prepared to propose its delegation to the 
talks but gave no details there were indications that the talks 
first proposed by interior minister czeslaw kiszczak might not take 
place until next week 
there is no rush really preparation is a must journalist 
tadeusz mazowiecki an adviser to solidarity leader lech walesa 
said in a telephone interview over the weekend 
litynski said the workers who went on strike between aug 16 and 
saturday were fighting for an independent trade union and were not 
interested in transforming solidarity into a political club as has 
been mentioned by some commentators in the official media 
polands worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law 
crackdown on solidarity ended saturday when remaining strikers 
left an occupied mine in jastrzebie in southern poland and the port 
and main bus depot in the baltic port city of szczecin 
walesa had pressed the strikers to quickly settle local 
grievances and end the strikes so talks about the future of 
solidarity could begin within the framework of the round table 
talks offered by kiszczak 
meanwhile solidarity spokesman wojciech mazierski said 200 
transit workers demanding higher pay went on strike monday in the 
small city of zdunska wola in central poland 120 miles southwest 
of warsaw

shipping companies the coast guard and the 
army corps of engineers are joining in an unprecedented effort to 
ensure that the droughtcaused bottlenecks that idled mississippi 
river traffic this summer wont recur a shipping industry 
executive says 
the three groups are forming a task force and establishing a 
clearinghouse at cincinnait to share information about the 
mississippi and ohio rivers according to jeffrey smith vice 
president of a shipping industry group called american waterway 
operators 
the drought smith said has cost the industry an estimated 200 
million about 20 percent of its annual operating revenue 
however the worst of the 1988 drought may be past for those who 
work on or live along the river some officials believe 
an underwater dike built by the corps for example has stopped 
saltwater from creeping up the mississippi and fouling the water 
supply for new orleans however the corps has had to supply by 
barge some downriver communities with millions of gallons of fresh 
water 
at new orleans the river is running at a rate of about 130000 
cubic feet per second about 55 percent of normal for this time of 
year in early july however it was closer to 114000 
were still way below average said roger steakely a corps 
spokesman in vicksburg miss but were not nearly as bad as we 
were 
gulf of mexico waters have pushed their way up the 
droughtreduced river turning the muddy brown water a beautiful 
bluegreen and threatening the water supply for new orleans which 
is about 100 miles from the mouth of the mississippi 
because the salty water is heavier than the fresh mississippi 
water the corps decided to impede the flow by building a dirt dam 
15 to 25 feet high across the river bottom 
the 790000 structure about 30 miles south of new orleans 
succeeded in heading off the salty flow it was too late however 
for some small communities in plaquemines parish where the corps 
continues to deliver bargeloads of water from farther upriver 
by the middle of last week the corps had barged 52 million 
gallons for those communities according to bruce sossaman a 
spokesman for the new orleans office of the corps 
the increased flow on the mississippi also means a reduction in 
the number of bottlenecks that idled traffic upriver in june last 
week the coast guard relaxed restrictions on towboat loads that 
had been imposed earlier this summer because of low water levels on 
the lower mississippi 
the task of the clearinghouse on river conditions is to ensure 
that everyone on the river is informed of current developments 
smith said 
its a matter of the industry and the coast guard and the 
corps working smarter said smith they took all the 
communications that were disparate and decentralized and 
centralized them out of one office on the ohio river 
as for how long the drought will affect the rivers the experts 
arent sure 
based on what the weather service has said theres virtually 
no way were going to get back to normal weve been hearing 
were in for drought conditions on the river through the remainder 
of the summer said sossaman 
the amount of rain needed to bring the river back up to its 
average flow rate may not come around until next spring steakely 
said and thats all right with him 
a sudden heavy flow of water down the mississippi would dump 
more sand and sediment down river and could cause as many problems 
with navigation as it would solve steakely said 
slow steady improvement is better he said we really arent 
hoping for a dramatic change quickly

twisted sister and motley crue may not 
know it but their music is keeping ducks and geese alive in 
western montana 
the migrating waterfowl hate the heavymetal rock music by the 
groups so much that they avoid a pond contaminated by cyanide where 
the music is kept playing on loudspeakers 24 hours a day 
the contaminated pond is at the golden sunlight mine near 
whitehall where cyanide is used to leach gold from ore the 
cyanide flows into a 250acre settling pond where it is poisonous 
to waterfowl 
don jenkins the mines administrative superintendent read how 
rock music was used to scare starlings from a new york airport he 
decided to try twisted sister motley crue scorpions and others 
he also uses propanepowered cannons that fire every couple of 
minutes and security guards who occasionally fire shotgun blasts 
or flare guns colored helium balloons bob up and down 
but says jenkins the rock music is still the best ploy weve

crystalstudded rock wall and turret rising from a ravine the 
front entrance is sheltered by skewed columns of stacked stone 
cubes 
its architecture for children without being ridiculous 
sargent said we used details in an informal way so children 
could look at it and actually learn something about architecture 
passersby are startled but children are delighted 
theres a whimsical quality about the new structures that at 
first rocks the adult back a little bit but the children see 
it as they might imagine a castle would be like filled with 
all kinds of strange windows and beautifully colored objects 
said chuck johnston headmaster at trinity throughout the project

gulf region after at least one arab government raised lastminute 
objections us military sources said the vessel was to have 
ended its patrol duties with the us joint task force middle east 
on sunday and was earlier reported to actually have left 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the change 
of orders for the vincennes was based on diplomatic rather than 
military considerations and came from a much higher level 
than the navy in the gulf he said a previously announced pentagon 
decision not to replace the cruiser still stood 
in riyadh saudi arabia the foreign ministers of the arab gulf 
states urged the five permanent members of the un security 
council to help push along the peace talks between iraq and iran

fabricated allegations reported by the associated press on the use 
of chemical weapons in north iraq 
it quoted a commentator not identified as saying these 
figures are only present in the figments of imagination of those 
who wove them and declared 
all that happened in the north of iraq was that a group of 
traitors of irans agents collapsed and those of them who fled 
abroad could not find but lies to cover up their defeat 
the agency said president saddam husseins government was 
preparing to sue newspapers involved in publishing false reports 
on alleged use of chemical weapons in the north of iraq 
iran said monday that 5000 iraqi kurds fleeing chemical attacks 
had arrived on its territory

united nations human rights groups and the media for not speaking 
out 
an estimated 70000 to 90000 iraq kurds fled to turkey in the 
past week but turkish officials said monday the influx had stopped 
because iraqi soldiers had blocked mountain passes leading to the

the soviet military chief of staff said monday the 
united states has begun an arms race at sea that increases the risk 
of war and refuses to negotiate a reduction in naval forces 
us naval forces are a key instrument of pressure helping to 
conduct the us positions of strength policy marshal sergei 
f akhromeyev wrote in a lengthy article in the communist party 
daily pravda 
the article which included soviet statistics comparing the 
superpower naval forces appeared at a time when western observers 
say they have detected a scaling back of soviet navy activities 
akhromeyev who toured us naval facilities during a visit to 
the united states this summer accused the united states and some 
of its nato allies of starting an arms race at sea 
they have enormous power he wrote the us navy 
comprises 15 attack aircraft carriers of which five are 
nuclearpowered 
the main thrust of akhromeyevs article was that us naval 
forces are designed for offensive strikes while soviet warships are 
intended to defend their countrys coastline and cannot be 
considered a military threat 
as examples of the us navys ability to deal powerful 
offensive blows akhromeyev cited us actions against libya 
lebanon and grenada 
in the persian gulf area the united states and its allies 
have amassed an armada of over 60 combatant ships of which over 
half are american the soviet chief of staff wrote 
this dangerous demonstration of naval might is explained 
ostensibly by the eagerness to ensure the freedom of shipping in 
the persian gulf the true objective is to shore up the presence of 
the us naval fleet on a permanent basis there 
he accused the united states of opposing negotiations on 
reduction of naval forces or any agreement curbing their activity 
akhromeyev said sovietled warsaw pact countries do everything 
depending on them to turn the world ocean from a zone of war danger 
into a zone of peace and cooperation we call upon the united 
states and its nato allies to support us in this undertaking

utility crews worked monday to complete repairs 
to the last of six electricity cables damaged in a fire that 
blacked out 50 blocks of downtown seattle for nearly four days 
workers had restored power by sunday evening to the entire area 
with the exception of one building a parking garage with some 
office space near the underground vault where the fire began 
in addition said seattle city light spokesman scott forslund 
electricity had not been turned back on in a few buildings whose 
owners werent available or chose to wait forslund said 
the sixth and final 13000volt cable gives the system redundant 
capacity in case of extraheavy demand or the need to turn off 
power in one of the other cables to make repairs said scott 
forslund seattle city light spokesman 
about half the affected customers had begun getting power when 
the switch was thrown on four feeder cables saturday evening and 
other customers were hooked up overnight before the fifth cable was 
repaired sunday evening 
as power was restored fire crews roamed the area to ensure that 
no fires broke out in equipment on which power switches were on 
when the outage began 
city light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power 
or repair damage city light spokesman hugh mcintosh said 
the cause of the fire that sparked seattles biggestever power 
outage wednesday remained unknown but officials said an aluminum 
directcurrent supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus 
lines was a key factor in the blackouts severity 
city light assistant superintendent jerry garman said monday 
that the fire undoubtedly started in lowvoltage city light 
cables which run from transformers to feed individual buildings 
as the system heated power to the highvoltage feeder cables 
should have been cut by current limiters but the metro transit 
cable melted and molten aluminum cut the highvoltage cables 
before power could be cut to all but two of them 
once the dc metro cable started to go it took what would 
have been a minor inconvenience and turned it into a major event 
garman said 
its like we had eight or nine welding torches going at the 
same time 
what caused the lowvoltage cables to catch fire in the first 
place wont be known until data is analyzed garman said adding he 
could not predict how long that would take 
in the meantime city light crews will check other locations 
with similar dual arrangements of city light and metro cables to 
try to head off other problems garman said 
im sure were going to be looking at ways of protecting us 
from them and them from us he said 
some customers in the blackedout area already have filed 
monetary claims against the city claiming losses as the result of 
the failure forslund said 
during the height of the blackout city officials estimated that 
90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area which 
included an estimated 130 restaurants 55 shops in the popular pike 
place market the bon marche department store the 875room westin 
hotel and uncounted other hotels grocery stores and taverns

focus on the withdrawal of cuban troops from marxistruled angola 
angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi said saturday that cuba has 
increased its troop strength in angola from 50000 military 
personnel to 60000 
angola cuba and whitedominated south africa signed a 
ceasefire pact on aug 8 that links withdrawal of south african 
and cuban troops from angola and independence for southwest 
africa also called namibia 
south africa said on aug 30 that it had withdrawn the last of 
its forces from angola leaving rebels of the national union for 
the total independence of angola unita to fight alone against the 
cubans and government troops 
unita was not included in the peace talks and savimbi has said 
his guerrillas will continue to fight for a powersharing coalition 
with the marxists 
angola won independence from portugal in 1975 and unita lost a 
civil war to the soviet and cubanbacked popular movement for the 
liberation of angola unita then began a guerrilla campaign and 
cuba sent troops to help the government 
namibia lying between south africa and angola has been 
administered by south africa since world war i under a mandate by 
the defunct league of nations 
south africa has rejected demands by the united nations that 
namibia be given its independence a major south african condition 
has been withdrawal of cuban forces from angola 
south africa has said it will withdraw from namibia by nov 1 
and allow elections by next june if the cubans leave angola 
unita said in a statement distributed in lisbon portugal that 
the rebels had rejected us efforts to persuade them to accept a 
period of three years for the removal of the cuban troops 
it said the us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs chester crocker tried to persuade the rebels at a meeting 
aug 27 at an undisclosed location in africa to accept a phased 
cuban pullout over a threeyear period 
savimbi said saturday at the rebels headquarters at jamba in 
southern angola that he supported us efforts to resolve the 
13yearold conflict but complained that crocker was giving all 
the cards to the angolan government 
the cubans do not want to leave angola and crocker knows 
that said savimbi we will continue to fight until the country 
is truly free 
there are now 60000 cubans in angola and they are prepared to 
launch attacks within days the cubans didnt comer here to wave 
goodbye it is an initiative for an offensive 
in angola deputy foreign minister venancio de moura said angola 
would make concessions at the brazzaville talks to facilitate the 
negotiations but it would not jeopardize its sovereignty and 
independence he did not elaborate on possible concessions 
according to the report by the angolan news agency angop that was 
monitored in lisbon 
it said he appealed to unita to listen to the voice of 
reason and accept the government proposal that the guerrillas lay 
down their weapons and be integrated into society without 
recrimination

authorities on monday arrested two 
lieutenant colonels and 14 other soldiers and civilians in raids on 
a group that took bribes to help israelis avoid military service 
israel radio reported 
an army statement said authorities began an investigation after 
receiving a tip that young people were avoiding activeduty and 
reserve service in exchange for gratuities and monetary gifts 
such an investigation is rare in israel which has a tradition 
of a citizen army all israeli jews are required to serve in 
the military men for three years and women for two and men 
remain in the reserves until age 57 
the army statement gave no indication of how widespread the 
scheme was but israel television quoted military sources as saying 
it may have helped as many as several hundred israelis avoid 
regular and reserve military service 
israel television called the scandal unprecedented and said more 
arrests were expected 
the radio report said among the eight soldiers arrested were a 
woman and two lieutenant colonels and all were connected to the 
recruiting office it did not identify them 
the radio and television accounts said the civilians included 
several doctors and that large sums of money were involved but 
did not elaborate 
brig gen emil elimelech head of military police told israel 
television the scheme involved false medical documents and 
tampering with computers entering and removing data 
disclosure of the draftdodging came during the palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip which israel occupied 
after the 1967 middle east war 
palestinians have been battling iraeli rule in the territories 
since dec 8 the government has responded by sending thousands of 
troops into the areas and at least 258 palestinians and four 
israelis have been killed in the uprising 
refusal to serve in the israeli military is rare but some 
soldiers have rejected particular postings at least 37 soldiers 
are in jail for refusing to serve in the occupied territories 
according to yesh gvul an organization of conscientious objectors 
elimelech said it was absolutely impossible to link the 
draftdodging scheme to the uprising 
israel radio said the the suspects are to appear for arraignment 
tuesday before a civil judge in petah tikva east of tel aviv

the chief designer of a soviet cargo plane said 
monday that engine flooding caused the aborted takeoff of the huge 
aircraft at the farnborough air show europes leading aviation 
event 
konstantine lechakov told a news conference at the soviet 
embassy a new engine for the antonov 124 the worlds heaviest 
plane would be sent from the soviet union but was delayed awaiting 
overflight permission from west germany 
the blueandwhite aircraft remained grounded at farnborough 35 
miles southwest of london its takeoff was aborted sunday the 
opening day of the show 
it was supposed to give display flights daily during the 
weeklong show at which the soviets also are showing their most 
advanced fighters two mig29s 
at the embassy news conference members of the soviet delegation 
praised the migs and were complimentary about rival western combat 
aircraft on display but dodged questions about soviet production 
figures and sales targets 
the delegation includes aviation officials aircraft designers 
and a test pilot 
there was an engine surge the reason for this engine surge 
was the air bleed system lechakov said through an embassy 
interpreter aides who were questioned later said that meant engine 
flooding or excessive fuel 
a tongue of flames 20 feet long shot from one jet engine as the 
aircraft moved down the runway and the pilot shut down the three 
other engines of the 400ton plane

killed and more than 300 injured when three italian stunt flying 
aircraft collided and one crashed into the crowd 
viktor a maksimovsky deputy aviation minister was asked why 
moscow had decided to show the mig29 in the west and he said it 
was evidence of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or more openness 
the participation of the soviet union this year at farnborough 
is proof of it he declared 
test pilot valery menitsky who flew a mig29 in precision 
manuevers sunday praised the western fighters on display 
including the american f18 and f16 and the mirage 2000 from 
france 
but to be perfectly frank i like our plane much better he

the widow and brother of palau president lazarus 
e salii handled a revolver within minutes after salii was found 
shot to death and before the weapon was turned over to national 
police a government spokesman said 
the 357caliber magnum revolver from which one shot had been 
fired was given to police at a hospital by saliis brother carlos 
said spokesman bonifacio basilius 
there was hysteria and panic basilius said they were in 
shock they were not involved in the shooting 
the 51yearold president was the second elected palau chief 
executive to die by violent means in three years 
salii was elected in august 1985 to succeed haruo i remeliik 
who was assassinated two months earlier three palau men convicted 
at trial in connection with remeliiks death later were acquitted 
the palau government has yet to make public results of an 
autopsy performed on salii 55 hours after his aug 20 death at his 
home in koror the western pacific island chains capital 
palau is a 400milelong archipelago about 600 miles east of the 
philippines and 4500 miles southwest of hawaii its nearly 15000 
residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands in a un trusteeship 
administered by the united states 
salii was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free 
association that would terminate the trusteeship and make palau 
selfgoverning 
the us government is awaiting results of an fbi ballistics 
test on the revolver and the spent cartridge basilius said in a 
telephone interview 
the tests at the fbi laboratory in washington might show if 
saliis fingerprints were on the weapon basilius said 
we want to know for sure we want to eliminate any doubt as to 
whether there were any other persons fingerprints on the gun he 
said we want to be absolutely certain that the bullet came from 
that gun 
meanwhile the associated press obtained a copy of an aug 24 
letter from a highranking traditional chief ibedul yutaka m 
gibbons in which he addresses the question of whether salii killed 
himself 
in the letter to interior secretary donald p hodel whose 
agency is responsible for palauan affairs gibbons wrote that new 
president thomas remengesau told him the night of saliis death 
that it was a suicide gibbons said remengesau told him salii 
himself did it at his house 
gibbons said since the forensic evidence was not finalized by 
then it seems inconceivable that he remengesau would then voice 
such an irresponsible conclusion 
gibbons asked hodel for an investigation into the deaths of 
salii and remeliik 
remengesau was sworn in as president to fill out saliis 
remaining term which ends this year he was elected vice president 
at the special election in which salii was elected president 
remengesau also was minister of justice under the two slain 
presidents 
remengesau is expected to seek the presidency in palaus nov 2 
general election

ptl founder jim bakker made an 11thhour 
plea to supporters monday for help in raising a 3 million down 
payment in his bid to return to the ministry he left amid a 
sexandmoney scandal 
im not going to leave any stone unturned bakker said in a 
telephone interview with the associated press im not going to 
stumble now 
bakker said friends and acquaintances have so far contributed 
close to 2 million in cash and letters of credit toward the 3 
million he needs by tuesday 
he said a group of people is working on raising the remaining 1 
million in thousanddollar pledges and he has set up a trust 
account at a hendersonville nc bank to accept donations those 
donations would be used only if he and his wife tammy faye 
succeed in purchasing the ministry he said 
bakker said he has raised the money and pledges by wordofmouth 
we are sort of running our own labor day telethon without a 
television station he said 
ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton asked for the money 
as a sign of bakkers ability to follow through on the 165 million 
offer hes made for the heritage usa christian theme park a

bakker attorney jim toms said bakker expects to have the whole 
3 million by tuesday but he said he plans to ask benton to accept 
1 million in cash and a 500000 letter of credit so that the 
remaining funds could be used to pay immediate operating expenses 
bakker said a midwest bank has agreed to handle the funds from 
unidentified greek investors he says are backing his offer to buy 
ptl he also said he has several other banks are willing to aid his 
bid but he would not identify the banks 
were almost there bakker said

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen blasted republicans george bush and dan quayle monday 
as an uncaring duo willing to maintain a legacy of poverty for many 
americans 
in the america of george bush and dan quayle the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer bentsen told a fiercely 
democratic labor day rally at a rodeo arena in this east texas oil 
city 
and the vast majority of our people work harder and longer 
just to stay even they need two incomes just to keep from slipping 
back the senator argued 
bentsen began his fall campaign in his native texas saying he 
wanted to be more aggressive he hopes to help the democratic 
ticket bring home the lone star states 29 electoral votes now 
within the reach of either party 
a poll published monday in the dallas morning news showed the 
republican ticket leading 47 percent to 44 percent within a 3 
percentage point margin of error 
bentsen told reporters traveling with him that he expected to 
take texas and win the national election but he acknowledged that 
the democrats were revising their tactics i think youll see a 
more aggressive campaign he said 
you cant keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw such 
as bushs claim that dukakis was unpatriotic because he vetoed a 
bill mandating the recitation of the pledge of allegiance in the 
public schools of massachusetts he said on that issue bentsen 
added republicans would suffer a voter backlash 
the texas senator returning to the trail after a brief vacation 
in wyoming said he had spoken by telephone with john sasso the 
dukakis campaigns new vice chairman who was returning a year after 
resigning for what some considered an unfair attack on sen joseph 
biden ddel a dukakis rival at the time 
bentsen began his labor day at a small business center in waco 
a central texas area struggling economically he met with local 
people trying to launch new businesses and afterward told about 
250 supporters that bush who also claims texas as his home had 
done little for the state 
theyve sort of turned their backs on us this administration 
has bentsen said standing in shirtsleeves outside the former 
high school building 
the republicans have an oil man whos running for president 
he said but frankly i cant remember anything hes done for 
the energy industry in the past eight years 
at the beaumont rally attended by some 2000 people bentsen 
said that quayle was on the wrong side of every energy issue 
important to texas and still george bush chose him as his 
running mate 
bentsen said that quayle exemplified the republican attitude 
with his record opposing health care for pregnant women 
immunizations for children and the bill requiring 60 days advance 
notice for workers facing plant layoffs 
when it comes to basic issues important to working men and 
women the republicans say no he said 
bentsen said the republicans were trying to make ideology and 
patriotism the issues of the campaign but selling dukakis to 
texans he said the real issues were jobs and opportunity 
the republicans like to wrap themselves in the flag and 
demagogue on phony issues said bentsen standing before a huge 
american flag flanked by the texas flags 
the republicans like to talk about left and right but this 
election is not about moving left or right he said it is 
about standing still with george bush or moving forward with mike 
dukakis 
bentsen ridiculed bushs statement that the republicans would 
create 30 million new jobs noting there are only about 6 million 
people officially categorized as unemployed 
i understand george bush is out at disneyland today i think 
hes out there talking to his economist bentsen said 
texas state sen carl parker who hosted the beaumont rally 
said he understood bushs plan the republicans he said want 
people to have such sorry jobs were going to have to work two 
of em 
from beaumont bentsen traveled to st louis where he 
introduced dukakis at a labor day picnic 
bentsens twoday trip was to continue the jobcreation theme on 
tuesday with visits to a training center in lawrenceville ga 
outside of atlanta and a trip to virginia polytechnic institute in 
blacksburg va before returning to washington for the night

israel on monday accused mohammed jamal a top 
moslem religious leader of urging worshipers to attack jews at an 
archaeological site in jerusalem 
there were these other developments 
the supreme court ruled that israel can continue blocking 
international telephone lines to the occupied territories 
journalists at stateowned israel radio announced they would 
refuse assignments in the occupied west bank and gaza strip after 
management rejected a request for reinforced cars and extra pay to 
work there since the start of the uprising last dec 8 by 
palestinians in the occupied lands cars carrying press signs 
frequently have been stoned the attacks followed rumors that 
israels shin bet security agents used press credentials as a cover 
the army issued orders prohibiting troops from firing tear gas 
into enclosed spaces the new policy resulted from a report last 
may by five israeli physicians who determined that using tear gas 
in enclosed spaces was dangerous to human life 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group has 
said at least seven palestinians have perished because of the 
improper use of tear gas the united nations puts the number of 
deaths caused by tear gas at 13 since the uprising began 
at least 258 palestinians and four israelis have been killed in 
clashes and attacks since dec 8 
israeli troops closed down the west banks largest palestinian 
institution the 1000member a najah university friendship 
institute in nablus for allegedly conducting illegal high school 
classes 
saed kenaan the head of the institute said obviously the 
army wants our people to remain uneducated what we were doing is 
not a crime we were teaching our children instead of leaving them 
to the streets 
the army has closed elementary junior high and high schools in 
the west bank and gaza strip contending they are used to provoke 
antiisraeli protests 
israel radio said security forces arrested four palestinians 
from the west bank including two journalists it identified the 
journalists as hassan el khatib who worked for al fajr and salah 
zouheikeh of al shaab al fajr and al shaab are propalestine 
liberation organization newspapers published in arab east jerusalem 
police accused mohammed jamal deputy head of jerusalems 
supreme moslem council with broadcasting a call to worshipers to 
fight jews working on an archaeological dig near two of the citys 
mosques police spokesman rafi levy said he said police plan to 
indict jamal on a charge of inciting violence 
jamal would be the highestranking moslem official to be tried 
by israel since it captured arab east jerusalem in the 1967 middle 
east war 
what i did is not incitement it is the right of moslems to 
come to their holy place and defend it said jamal in an 
interview they crucified jesus now they want to do the same to 
me 
on july 3 riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at 
hundreds of stonethrowing palestinians enraged by the dig near 
temple mount which houses two of islams holiest shrines the al 
aqsa and dome of the rock mosques 
through loudspeakers at the site moslem officials including 
jamal urged palestinians praying at the site to defend the 
shrines saying israel planned to dig a tunnel to the temple 
israeli officials denied they were doing that and said the 
purpose of the dig was to open an underground staircase along the 
western wall which is judaisms holiest site and borders the 
temple mount 
israeli officials acknowledged they did not coordinate the dig 
with the supreme moslem council and excavations were suspended 
temporarily 
the supreme court rejected an appeal by the west bank human 
rights group law in the service of man that israel restore 
international telephone and telex lines to the israelioccupied 
lands the lines were cut march 18 
the army argued at the time that the step was necessary because 
the uprising was being directed and financed from abroad 
the human rights group argued that the order violated freedom of 
speech and constituted collective punishment 
this is another form of harassment of palestinians said 
marty rosenbluth a member of law in the service of man the west 
bank affiliate of the genevabased international commission of 
jurists

factory management

harshest criticism to date of albanian nationalists living in 
the southern serbian province of kosovo the official news agency 
tanjug reported 
the texile workers most of them women were from the sloga mill 
in zrenjanin 40 miles north of belgrade which was shut down by a 
strike last wednesday after assembling outside parliament they 
were directed to the nearby trade union building where they met 
with social affairs minister janko obocki 
we are not asking for color tv sets all we want is bread 
for our children worker snezana tosko said according to a 
tanjug report 
strikers demanded a doubling of monthly pay which now averages 
72 and replacement of the plant management 
obocki promised the government would find a way to curb 
inflation now running at an annual rate of 190 percent and 
increase real earnings tanjug said 
teacher strikes prevented the new school year from beginning in 
many parts of the country newspapers reported monday 
nearly 14000 elementary school students in mostar central 
yugoslavia returned home after finding classrooms locked because 
of a walkout by 500 teachers demanding significant improvements 
of their monthly wages the daily vecernje novosti said 
other teachers strikes were reported at doboj 125 miles west 
of belgrade tanjug said and in the northern port of rijeka and 
several other croatian towns 
about 850 strikes have taken place in yugoslavia over the past

more soldiers be sent to restive kosovo where 90 percent of the 
people are ethnic albanians to counter what he called terror 
unprecedented in postwar yugoslavia

in four serbian towns protesting alleged intimidation by ethnic 
albanians

sen dan quayle in an unabashedly patriotic 
kickoff to the fall campaign stood monday at the statue of liberty 
and declared that he and george bush proudly and unapologetically 
embrace the values embodied in the pledge of allegiance 
to us they are not hokey or cornball or passe said the 
republican vice presidential nominee who attacked democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis for vetoing a bill to penalize 
massachusetts teachers who refuse to lead students in the pledge 
the speech at the base of the statue was disrupted briefly by a 
small band of demonstrators who held signs reading where was 
george and chanted 40000 dead from aids where was dan 
the republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the 
campaign quayle said the center of our debate is not the 
question of anyones patriotism or love of country but he said 
the people of america want to know the kind of values that 
underscore our beliefs and george bush and i proudly and 
unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the pledge of 
allegiance 
in vetoing the pledge bill in 1977 dukakis cited an advisory 
opinion by massachusetts highest court that it was 
unconstitutional as well as a 1943 supreme court decision that 
students could not be forced to recite the pledge and salute the 
flag 
but quayle said that dukakis hides behind an advisory judicial 
opinion which has no force of law 
the mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance is the same mindset that could well 
sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of 
the values and standards upon which we must rely and which have 
been central throughout our history quayle said 
about 30 protesters from the aids coalition to unleash power 
actup a gay rights group tried to drown out quayles speech 
they were immediately surrounded by hundreds of bushquayle 
supporters who began a counterchant we want quayle 
the group said it was protesting quayles vote last year against 
a 30 million appropriation for federal funding of azt an 
experimental drug used in treating victims of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome quayles aides said later that he had voted to 
kill an amendment to the 1987 supplemental appropriations bill to 
provide azt free to aids patients but they said he did so on 
procedural grounds because he did not think such an amendment 
belonged on an appropriations measure 
they said that quayle had voted this year for an appropriations 
measure that provides 12 billion for aids research treatment 
prevention and education and had an exemplary voting record on 
aids 
as the demonstrators were hustled away quayle told the cheering 
audience i believe in freedom of speech they have a right to 
freedom of speech but so do i 
the indiana senator chose liberty island where the statue 
stands in new york harbor for his labor day kickoff to the fall 
campaign 
he also toured neighboring ellis island where millions of 
immigrants entered the country and which is now undergoing 
restoration quayle his wife marilyn and three children posed for 
photographs with a group of people dressed in costumes of their 
native countries and then rode by boat to liberty island 
it was in the nearby liberty state park in new jersey that 
candidate ronald reagan kicked off his fall campaign for the 
presidency on labor day 1980 
dukakis circled liberty island saturday and paid a nostalgic 
visit to ellis island with his 85yearold mother euterpe who 
passed through its processing center 75 years ago as a child 
emigrating from greece 
quayle arrived in detroit too late to participate in a polish 
american day parade in the enclave of hamtramck but he addressed 
those who had gathered for the parade telling them that we will 
never give up until theres freedom again in poland 
quayle who wore a button with the name of the polish labor 
union solidarity got only a tepid reception from the group many 
of whom booed the candidate and heckled him as he spoke 
the secret service said that shortly before quayles arrival a 
man was arrested near the parade reviewing stand when he was seen 
carrying what appeared to be a bomb containing sticks of dynamite 
the device turned out to be a fake 
the 38yearold hamtramck man was arrested on charges of 
interfering with a secret service agent and was held at the 
services office said jim huse special agent in charge of the 
secret service field office in detroit

archbishop desmond tutu 
criticized police monday for suggesting that a bomb blast at the 
headquarters of several antiapartheid groups was caused by 
explosives stored in the building 
police officials made the suggestion last week following the 
aug 31 explosion that wrecked khotso house a sixstory office 
building in johannesburg used by the south african council of 
churches and several human rights groups 
police said investigators had been unable to get through the 
rubble to the section of an underground garage where the bomb was 
believed to have been placed 
but they suggested explosives were being stored in the building 
for use elsewhere building occupants said they believe the bombers 
were rightwing extremists or even security force members 
the police have implied that those who work in khotso house 
are perpetrators of violence said tutu leader of the anglican 
church in southern africa 
it is an absolutely disgraceful suggestion to make and it is 
made worse by the fact the police have made it without a tittle of 
evidence and before doing any proper investigation tutu said in 
a statement 
we are still waiting to hear the governments clear 
condemnation of the bombing 
he said the bombing should be viewed in the context of a claim 
by military commanders last week that the army was beyond the 
jurisdiction of the courts because south africa was in a state of 
war 
on sunday tutu deliberately defied a government ban on calls 
for voting boycotts urging blacks and whites to stay away from the 
polls in next months nationwide municipal elections 
stateofemergency regulations provide for a jail sentence of up 
to 10 years for promoting election boycotts 
a law and order ministry spokesman brig leon mellet said the 
text of tutus speech would be studied he declined to comment on 
possible action against the black archbishop who won the nobel 
peace prize in 1984 
whites blacks asians and people of mixedrace will hold 
separate elections oct 26 to choose local officials 
many antiapartheid activists oppose black participation in any 
local or regional elections as long as blacks are excluded from 
national elections 
under apartheid the black majority has no vote in national 
affairs although the 26 million blacks make up about 75 percent of 
south africas population 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

longtime watchers of the miss america 
pageant may notice a few changes during saturdays contest 
including swimsuit strolls and an improved final crowning 
moment 
bill caligari the production manager for the miss america 
pageant has been testing new ideas in local contests in the past 
year 
other changes will be a deeper set on the stage and a yshaped 
runway that will give us more flexibility in production 
numbers caligari said during a rehearsal break last week 
but a more daring innovation is in the swimsuit competition he 
said 
instead of standing in front of the judges and ankling up 
as we called it were going to have the girls do a walking turn 
and not stop at all caligari said were deemphasizing that 
inspection image that it had for so long 
the changes in this years pageant scheduled to be televised 
nationally by nbc came largely from brainstorming sessions 
held in the past year after the appointment of the pageants new 
executive director leonard horn 
caligari recalled that horn almost immediately came in and 
listed all the things he didnt like about the pageant production 
in years past 
its exciting theres a lot of change caligari said 
were going back to the days when the top contestants were asked 
questions on stage and these wont be airhead questions 
horn said the questions will be intelligent questions were 
not going to be testing them on current events but they wont be 
silly questions either 
the final moments of the competition will also be different than 
in recent years caligari said traditionally the fourth third 
second and first runnersup were announced and then the new miss 
america was announced from the remaining six contestants 
this year the fourth third and second runnersup will be 
announced and then to heighten the drama the remaining six 
contestants will be narrowed down to two the first runnerup will 
then be announced leaving the new miss america caligari said 
the interplay between the two young ladies promises to be 
good he said weve tested this in some of the states and its 
worked well 
the pageant production will also have one fewer songanddance 
number caligari said 
the show is supposed to focus on 51 young talented ladies so 
were including them in all the production numbers he said 
the time saved from dropping that number will allow the producer 
to include brief video spots of the top 10 finalists interviews 
before the judges caligari said 
i got the idea to include parts of the contestants interviews 
from the winter olympics when we saw some backstage interviews 
before the athlete went out on the ice or snow he said 
the miss america moments that used to come before each 
commercial break which simply told viewers what part of the 
contest was next will be replaced with short spots on what former 
state winners are now doing caligari said 
some of those women include a town mayor an assistant district 
attorney a broadway understudy and an aeronautical engineer he 
said

in jinotega province that borders honduras the nicaraguan rebels 
clandestine radio liberation said monday 
a defense ministry source contacted by the associated press said 
he had no information about any such mobilization 
radio liberation in a broadcast monitored here said a 
strong and suspicious mobilization of sandinista army troops to 
the interior of that province jinotega in northern nicaragua was 
denounced by campesino families 
the sandinistas are sending more patrols to those places 
taking advantage of the fact that the rebels forces have retreated 
to the border zones with honduras it said 
it is estimated that some 9000 rebel fighters have returned to 
base camps on the honduran side of the border and about 2000 are 
still operating in nicaragua 
the rebels known as contras began returning to their camps in 
honduras in april after nicaraguas sandinista government and 
contra leaders agreed to a temporary ceasefire and negotiations 
for a permanent truce the peace talks broke down in june 
in honduras the contras are given ussupplied food and 
nonlethal assistance 
defense minister humberto ortega said last week contras who had 
left nicaragua were concentrated near the border 
he said sandinista army units are maintaining a normal 
defense along the frontier and claimed they were constantly 
harassed by contras and honduran troops seeking to provoke a border 
conflict 
sandinista forces have frequently made sweeps through jinotega 
to dislodge contras and drive them out of the province

most of the 22 investigators seeking the 
cause of the delta air lines crash that killed 13 people last week 
returned to washington but several stayed behind to retrieve more 
pieces of wreckage 
some of the investigators hoped to question the planes captain 
but kathy matney parkland hospital vice president said on monday 
capt larry davis was to undergo surgery this week and an interview 
was not scheduled 
the national transportation safety board team members hope that 
davis can answer lingering questions about flight 1141 which 
crashed and burned within seconds of takeoff wednesday at 
dallasfort worth international airport 
ninetyfive people aboard the plane bound for salt lake city 
survived inlcuding the three members of the cockpit crew 
at the airport huge mechanical jaws chewed through the left 
wing of the boeing 727 jet and a bulldozer hauled it away 
right now its wreckage work preparatory to the ntsbs 
releasing it to delta said joe dealey spokesman for the airport 
ntsb spokesman mike benson said he was unsure when the fuselage 
would be removed and where it would go but said it would be 
inspected to determine the condition of the passenger seats and the 
extent of fire damage they suffered 
although most of the 22 federal investigators returned to 
washington over the labor day weekend several remained in texas 
a good number are there that are just finishing up in terms of 
collecting typing up their notes said benson this is a 
difficult accident 
benson said the same group of investigators who spoke with the 
crews first officer and an injured flight attendant would question 
davis however they may have to return to texas to speak with the 
captain 
investigators have evidence indicating that the wing flaps were 
completely or almost completely retracted but they were told by 
flight engineer stephen judd that the wing flaps were extended in 
the proper position for takeoff 
during a briefing sunday ntsb member lee dickinson said more 
evidence had been collected on the position of the wing flaps we 
have further verification that the flaps were retracted he said 
pilots said if the wing flaps were retracted that could be a 
sign the crew was trying to fly the plane on one engine 
dickinson refused to speculate on reports that two engines 
failed 
a recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine 
failure 
the planes cockpit remained at the site monday sealed in a 
plastic blue tarpaulin adjacent to a row of seats pulled from the 
plane the cockpit was to be hauled to delta headquarters in 
atlanta but officials decided to leave it at the airport benson 
said 
we found a hangar we will put it in benson said well be 
able to do the work there on site and wont have to go through 
shipping and those problems

republican george bush compared michael dukakis 
with liberal antiwar activist jane fonda on monday and attacked 
his democratic rivals views on defense the economy taxes crime 
and the death penalty 
plunging into the final nine weeks of the neckandneck race for 
president bush turned up the rhetorical heat on dukakis 
how gloomy he is about the economy bush said 
the vice president said that dukakis views on defense were 
the standard litany of the liberal left and his attitude about 
new weapons was governed by blind negative ideology 
i wouldnt be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise is 
something you find in jane fondas workout book bush said ms 
fonda an actress now best known for producing exercise books and 
videotapes infuriated many people during the vietnam war by 
traveling to hanoi and posing with north vietnamese military 
personnel to dramatize her opposition to us policy in southeast 
asia 
highlighting bushs prodefense stance two aircraft carriers 
rested at anchor across the harbor as the vice president spoke to a 
sundrenched labor day audience of several hundred people outside a 
wholesale fish company 
bill lacy the head of bushs campaign in california said the 
vice president was trailing dukakis in the state by three to seven 
points 
bushs appearance was marred by several dozen noisy protesters 
carrying dukakisbentsen signs and chanting where was george 
and bush and noriega employees of the fish company held up 
cardboard boxes to block the demonstrators from cameramen until 
bush campaign aides ordered the shields taken down 
meanwhile the secret service and police said that a man with a 
stun gun hanging from his belt was taken into custody 
right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vice 
president said steve sergek the special agent in charge of the 
san diego field office of the us secret service 
the person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice 
president or anyone else there sergek said 
bush began the day by touring the chesapeake fish co a family 
owned wholesale fish processing concern whose booming sales are 
attributed in part to heavy demand from sushi restaurants in the 
area 
later he traveled to anaheim calif and gave a disneyland 
sendoff to us olympic athletes headed for the summer games in 
seoul south korea 
youre representing a country that is wide open and free as a 
breeze where the millionaire has no more vote than the pauper and 
where even school children know the words i know my rights 
bush said surrounded by the athletes and disney characters 
the vice president rounded out the day by attending a holiday 
picnic with los angeles policemen i mean to win this election 
he declared 
cheered by the lawmen and their families bush called for 
tougher sentences for criminals including the death penalty for 
people convicted of killing police officers 
i will appoint to the federal bench judges who have a little 
more concern about the victims of crime and a little less concern 
about the criminals bush said 
bush told the san diego audience this campaign is about many 
things but if i had to set some priorities id say it is 
foremost about jobs and peace its about protecting the gains that 
weve made in jobs and peace and its about how to make new 
breakthroughs in both areas 
he credited the reaganbush administration with creating 17 
million new jobs since the end of the 198182 recession and scorned 
dukakis for the massachusetts governors criticism of the economy 
all my opponent can do is try to tell the american people how 
bad everything is bush said 
on the subject of crime bush said dukakis would turn the clock 
back to the fuzzy old days of liberal thinking when the 
perpetrators of crime rather than its victims were viewed with 
more compassion 
to the people of california let me put it this way if you 
loved rose bird youll love my opponent they oppose the death 
penalty no matter how brutal the crime thats been committed 
bush was referring to the state supreme court chief justice who 
was voted off the bench by californias voters in a campaign that 
highlighted ms birds liberal views on criminal matters 
bush also lambasted the prison furlough program in massachusetts 
and said that no more furloughs for people who rape pillage and 
plunder in the united states 
on defense matters bush criticized dukakis for opposing the mx 
and midgetman missiles the strategic defense intiaitive and two 
new aircraft carriers 
weve got to look at every new idea and every defense system 
from the point of view of will it work does it make sense and do 
we need it to make our country safer 
if the answers are yes then at least it warrants our most 
serious attention and then sorting out our financial priorities 
bush said we cant just dismiss every new idea with a breezy 
we already have enough weapons 
on pocketbook issues he said that his primary goal will be to 
provide a job to all americans bush pledged anew to resist any 
move in congress to increase federal spending and government 
regulation of business 
and when they say ill raise taxes i will say no and theyll 
push and ill say no again and theyll push again and finally 
ill say read my lips no new taxes 
why do you think they call it taxachusetts bush said 
referring to state tax increases in massachusetts under dukakis 
underscoring the importance of california in the white house 
sweepstakes and its cache of 47 electoral college votes the 
biggest prize in the country bush said its going to be a 
long tough fight and added california here i come

took food and other supplies to thousands of people stranded in 
southern mexico by floods that killed at least 28 people 
at least 16 of the dead and the largest group of homeless 
25000 were in northern veracruz state which took the brunt of 
hurricane debby on friday said maj javier lopez medel assistant 
state public security director 
the hurricane dissipated after coming ashore from the caribbean 
but rain continued monday in much of the region and in mexico city 
flood waters were reported subsiding in some areas but 
officials said they feared rain in the mountains would make the 
waters rise again 
mud and rock loosened by more than a week of rain slid onto 
roads blocking or slowing traffic on several major highways 
most of the casualties and displaced people lived between tuxpan 
and poza rica 150 miles northeast of mexico city and just inland

the mud he said a number of houses built on the banks of gullies 
that cut through the city of 300000 people were washed away but 
he did not have a specific number 
relief teams were using boats to deliver supplies to towns that 
could not be reached by road he added

kristy dumped rain last week but never went ashore the national 
weather service said 
the resort of ixtapazihuatenejo was isolated for a third day 
stranding hundreds of tourists crews drained water from runways 
but bad weather prevented flights said francisco javier rangel a 
guerrero state government spokesman 
highways up the coast to lazaro cardenas south to acapulco and 
inland to mexico city were damaged or blocked by mudslides he said 
he estimated 3000 to 4000 people had been evacuated from their 
homes in the state and said some communities are isolated 
without telephones or road access mainly because of the rain the 
army is giving assistance everywhere brigades from the state 
government have been checking communities since saturday night but

more than onequarter of britains postal workers 
walked off their jobs monday as a nationwide mail strike spread and 
prevented the delivery of 65 million foreign and domestic letters 
and parcels 
three postal workers were arrested in liverpool one of 40 
cities where sorting offices were paralyzed by the strikes by 
48000 workers said the national post office royal mail 
royal mail which handles 51 million items of mail daily said 
the three were charged with disorderly behavior after bottles were 
thrown from a picket line at arriving temporary workers 
it was the first instance of violence in six days of strikes 
that began wednesday with a 24hour strike to protest regional pay 
differences 
the oneday strike officially ended but the issue of temporary 
workers hired to clear backlogs has continued to keep workers away 
from their jobs 
on monday london birmingham manchester liverpool edinburgh 
and glasgow were among cities where mail could not be collected 
posted sorted or delivered due to walkouts by 48000 of 140000 
sorting and collecting workers 
stamps could be purchased because 40000 administration and 
counter workers have not gone on strike 
international mail was completely suspended until further 
notice after walkouts at sorting offices for foreign mail in 
london and other cities said post office spokeswoman sally 
williams 
ms williams said although workers at londons heathrow airport 
office had gone back to work other offices were not in operation 
bill cockburn managing director of royal mail defended the 
hiring of 3500 temporary workers saying the number hired exceeded 
by only 500 the number used at other peak times such as christmas 
but alan tuffin general secretary of the union of 
communications workers said the dispute could escalate further 
and the whole system could be stopped by midweek 
ms williams said exploratory talks between the union and 
management were scheduled for monday night to see whether there 
is a basis for further negotiations union leaders met in 
england scotland and wales earlier monday to decide their course 
of action union officials said 
the strike wednesday centered on union objections to the post 
office offering weekly bonuses of 75 pounds to 20 pounds 1252 
to 3340 to recruit workers in london and southeast england 
the union said it would not tolerate regional pay differences 
and any bonuses should be paid nationally 
in another british labor dispute the trades union congress 
voted overwhelmingly monday to expel the electricians union its 
first ouster of an affiliate in 15 years 
delegates of the electricians 336000member union showed their 
disdain by walking out minutes before the vote the vote by a show 
of hands came on the opening day of the trades unions weeklong 
annual conference in bournemouth england 
the electronic telecommunication and plumbing union was ousted 
for signing two singleunion nostrike pacts with management in 
violation of trades union policy under such agreements a plants 
work force is represented by a single union and disputes are 
settled by arbitration 
the trades union policy is that such contracts weaken union 
bargaining power and lead to competition among unions for 
representation in a shrinking job market

seven months of talks between 
the social democratic and labor party of moderate roman catholics 
and sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed ira have 
broken down both parties said monday 
the closeddoor talks on the future of northern ireland 
foundered largely as a result of sinn feins refusal to renounce 
violence by the mainly catholic irish republican army the social 
democratic and labor party sdlp said 
sdlp leader john hume and sinn fein president gerry adams had 
carried out the negotiations 
the ira has stepped up attacks on british security forces it 
has killed 27 military men this year in attacks in northern 
ireland mainland britain and continental europe while 11 ira 
guerrillas have been killed by british soldiers 
the ira outlawed on both sides of the irish border wants to 
unite northern ireland a british province where protestants 
outnmuber catholics 32 with the predominantly catholic republic 
of ireland under socialist rule the sdlp also wants to unite 
northern ireland with the republic but by peaceful means 
both sides said disagreement also arose over two other issues 
one was the sdlps contention that the provinces protestant 
majority should have the veto power over northern irelands future 
the other was sdlp insistence that since the angloirish agreement 
was signed in november 1985 britains role in the province has 
been a neutral one 
sinn fein said in a statement that maintaining that britain is 
now a neutral party to the conflict ignores all the historical 
evidence of british domination in ireland and is wholly 
contradicted by the events of the past 20 years 
sinn fein said it was dismayed to find the sdlp accepted 
existence of a protestant veto over the future of the province 
under the angloirish agreement between london and dublin the 
irish republic was given a formal consultative role in running the 
province 
in exchange ireland accepted longterm british rule in northern 
ireland by acknowledging no change can be made in its status until 
a majority of people there agree britain pledged to withdraw from 
northern ireland once a majority of people there indicate they want 
it to do so 
an sdlp statement said violence or what sinn fein called 
armed struggle is wrong and has no contribution to make to a 
resolution of the conflict in ireland even in the iras terms 
justification no longer exists for the use of such methods there 
are no obstacles on the road to achieving their political 
objectives which justify the use of armed force 
the sdlp said it and sinn fein agreed the irish people as a 
whole have the right to national selfdetermination 
but it said the violence is directly responsible for more 
fatalities in the roman catholic community in the past 10 years 
than either the security forces or the protestant extremists 
it also bears much responsibility for the massive unemployment and 
deprivation in the catholic community 
the sinn fein statement said the question on which both parties 
agreed was how do we end the british presence in a manner which 
leaves behind a stable and peaceful ireland 
prime minister charles haugheys government in dublin said in a 
statement it shared humes disappointment that the sdlps effort to 
extend the political peace process had not succeeded there was no 
immediate reaction from the british government

terminals in several us cities monday claiming buses are 
inaccessible to disabled riders and several landed in jail when

organizer said the protests occurred in a dozen cities 
joe carley a demonstrator at the dallas terminal said society 
has spent thousands of dollars keeping us alive and they say we 
have spent this money to keep you alive were not going to spend 
any money to see that you can live and accessibility is living 
protesters want greyhound to install lifts on buses to make them 
more accessible to the handicapped 
were asking them to sign an agreement that any new bus built 
will be accessible said the rev wade blank an adapt spokesman 
in denver 
greyhound officials met with leaders of the denverbased adapt 
in august 
we went through all of this in denver gravley said we 
thought we responded in a forthright way to issues they raised we 
are disappointed obviously that the demonstrations continued 
in denver 10 people including eight in wheelchairs were cited 
for disturbing the peace the protest shifted to the denver city 
jail after police officers booked the two ablebodied people but 
released those in wheelchairs said blank 
two hours later they too were released and a police officer at 
the scene told the protesters they had been booked due to a 
misunderstanding

use toward designing an exprimental bus that would be accessible to 
the disabled he said the company has proposed enlisiting the help 
of an advisory group that would include adapt members the texas 
commission for the handicapped and a retired peoples group 
greyhound operates helping hands a program that provides a free 
ticket for disabled people who are unable to travel by themselves 
but to avoid fraudulent use of the program the bus carrier 
requires users to provide proof of their disability gravley said 
this handicapped organization feels thats demeaning and they 
ought to be the judge of whether they travel alone gravley said 
adapt also objects to greyhounds requirements that 
nonmotorized wheelchairs be stored in baggage compartments and 
batteryoperated wheelchairs be kept off buses greyhound cites 
concerns about battery acid leaking

resolution dealing with international problems 
the draft sharply criticizes israel and south africa echoing 
previous sentiments of the movement 
a copy of the draft notes that since the nonaligned summit 
conference last year the situation in the middle east has

the israeli occupation forces against the civilian population in 
the occupied territories 
the draft salutes the heroic uprising of the palestinian

the arab uprising in the occupied lands that began dec 8 is 
tangible evidence of their determination to have a state of their 
own

deterioration of the situation in south africa and repeats 
previous demands for sanctions against the south african 
government which is controlled by the countrys white minority

caused a mysterious outbreak that sent 119 young navy recruits to 
the hospital over the weekend with breathing problems vomiting and 
other symptoms 
only one of the recruits remained in a hospital after two were 
released monday the enlisted men from the naval training center 
were taken to 10 hospitals in more than 50 ambulances saturday and 
all but three were released by sunday night 
two more men were released monday in good condition from sharp 
cabrillo hospital said nursing supervisor nadine kalmonson a 
third recruit who was diagnosed with pneumonia was still being held 
at the balboa hospital said navy spokesman lt ken luchka 
it could have been that one or two people had a viral 
infection and got sick which caused a mass hysteria to the 
others luchka said 
a hysterical reaction was very possible like in second grade 
when someone vomits and the whole class starts vomiting luchka

local residential telephone rates across 
america are due to go up twice in the coming months but state 
utility consumer advocates are trying to head off the increases 
before they can take effect 
the consumer advocates want the federal communications 
commission to cancel increases scheduled for december and next 
april in the line charge added to residential phone bills 
their call is being heard by some members of congress and the 
state utility commissioners who at the very least want the fcc to 
take a second vote on the added charges before they take effect 
the increases 60 cents per month on dec 1 and 30 cents on 
april 1 1989 were approved as part of a threestep boost in the 
monthly line charge that began with a 60cent increase july 1 
1987 the monthly charge is already 260 
the fcc approved the increases in april 1987 as a way to further 
reduce longdistance rates and encourage large business users to 
stay on the public phone network rather than building their own 
networks 
but the national association of state utility consumer advocates 
is asking the fcc to cancel the future increases amounting to 
about 1 billion a year saying they are unnecessary 
unsupported and unwarranted 
the association said three telecommunications analysts 
commissioned by the group to study a june report compiled by the 
fcc on the effects of the subscriber line charge concluded that the 
threat of large users bypassing the local phone network has not 
materialized increasing the charge by 90 cents will have no effect 
on the bypass that is already occurring they said 
weve really attacked the very basis for the subscriber line 
charge said ron binz colorado consumer counsel 
the line charge helps pay the cost of the wire that connects a 
customers telephone with a phone companys central office part of 
the cost of that line also is subsidized with longdistance rates 
so raising the proportion paid by subscribers reduces longdistance 
rates longdistance rates have dropped more than 30 percent since 
the charge was imposed in 1985 
raising the line charge also reduces local connection fees paid 
by large business users some businesses find it economical to 
build their own telecommunications networks and bypass the public 
phone network 
the fcc continues to support the subscriber line charge and the 
underlying policy of shifting the costs of the local phone network 
to subscribers said fcc spokesman john kamp 
the policy has worked very well bypass has not grown and 
it has caused rates overall to come down considerably and we have 
not seen evidence to cause us to change course he said 
the agency however will look very carefully at the 
consumer advocates requests to cancel the scheduled increases he 
said 
but the consumer advocates group has already taken its case to 
congress where it is talking to democratic members of the 
communications committees most of whom opposed the original 
imposition of the line charge at 1 in june 1985 and the later 
increases 
the issue has caught congress eye said gerard salemme an 
aide to rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications subcommittee particularly because of concerns 
about an fcc proposal to give atampt and the local bell phone 
companies more financial flexibility by capping rates but lifting 
the lid on profits 
salemme said that if price caps were adopted regulators would 
have little or no assurance that the linecharge increases were 
being passed along in the form of reduced longdistance rates 
the national association of regulatory utility commissioners is 
urging congress to pressure the fcc into taking a second vote on 
the further increases after reviewing the effects of the current 
charges 
there is still a lot of healthy skepticism among state 
regulatory commissioners about the need for further increases in 
the line charge said sharon nelson chairwoman of the 
associations communications committee and head of the washington 
state utilities commission 
theyve been very dubious about this from the very 
beginning she said

high poverty rates for young families are 
getting americas youth off to the worst possible start warns 
the head of a group promoting the interests of children 
our children and our young families are this nations growing 
edge we neglect them at our peril said marian wright edelman 
president of the childrens defense fund 
the comments came with the release of a study commissioned by 
the group which found that the economic growth of the last few 
years hasnt benefited young american families 
americas young families are afflicted by an economic 
depression in the middle of our societys more general 
prosperity edelman said in a statement 
in terms of constant dollars the income of families with 
children headed by an adult under age 30 fell by about onefourth 
between 1973 and 1986 the fund reported 
as a result the poverty rate for such families nearly doubled 
from 12 percent in 1973 to 22 percent in 1986 the fund said 
census bureau figures for 1987 were released last week and 
while not identical to the childrens fund figures tend to support 
the groups assertions 
the census bureau found that the 1987 poverty rate for children 
aged 18 and under was 20 percent up from 142 percent in 1973 
younger families tended to have higher poverty rates than older 
ones the census figures showed 
poverty rates for children whether black white or hispanic 
rose between 1973 and 1987 the figures showed and were higher 
than for other families or individuals 
these are the children on whom we must rely to be the workers 
leaders parents taxpayers soldiers and hope of the 21st 
century edelman said we are getting them off to the worst 
possible start 
in the short term the childrens defense fund called for a 
higher minimum wage and passage of the act for better child care 
legislation pending in congress to improve services for working 
parents 
longterm recommendations included extending medicaid coverage 
to pregnant women and children in families with less than twice the 
poverty income expanded tax credits for lowincome families 
expanded head start programs setting up community learning centers 
for children and a series of educational and homebuyer assistance 
programs 
the fund describes itself as a nonprofit group working to draw 
attention to the needs of children particularly the poor 
minorities and handicapped

opec secretarygeneral subroto has made 
little headway in his efforts to persuade iraq to accept an oil 
production quota and iran to allow its persian gulf foe one equal 
to its own the middle east economic survey reported monday 
but subroto was quoted by a united arab emirates newspaper 
monday as rejecting speculation that he had failed to convince the 
two countries to curb their output amid overproduction by some 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the alittihad daily quoted subroto now in qatar for talks on 
curbing overproduction as saying after visiting tehran and 
baghdad last week that he now fully knows what the two countries 
want 
both countries economically drained by their 8yearold war 
are now giving top priority to postwar reconstruction funded by 
their oil revenues 
this means that the two countries are keen to have a strong 
and cohesive opec and get a good price for their oil subroto was 
quoted as saying 
the middle east economic survey published in nicosia said that 
subrotos mission to tehran and baghdad was no doubt useful in 
terms of getting acquainted with the positions and preoccupations 
of the parties 
but the weekly said subrotos talks did not appear to have 
yielded any concrete results in settling the iraniraq quota 
problem 
iraq has refused to accept an opec quota of 15 million barrels 
a day and is demanding parity with iran which has a quota of 2369 
million barrels a day opecs 11 other members agree that iraq 
should have parity 
although neither side has publicly announced the outcome of 
subrotos talks tehran radio stressed shortly before subroto 
arrived in the iranian capital that iran would never agree to allow 
iraq an equal quota 
the allocation of an equal quota for iran and iraq is entirely 
unprincipled quota parity with iran is in fact a kind of 
increase in the iraqi quota the radio commentary noted 
the middle east economic survey a respected oil industry 
newsletter said the key questions in the thorny quota problem were 
whether or not the iranians are prepared to accept the principle of 
quota parity with iraq and whether iraq itself is willing to 
accept such a quota and the production discipline it entails 
the weekly added neither side it appears was in any mood to 
answer such awkward questions or even to discuss them in anything 
but very general terms 
it said that the iranians seemed concerned to steer clear of 
the parity dilemma altogether in their talks with subroto 
indonesias former energy minister 
instead they concentrated on the broad spectrum of problems 
facing opec at present particularly overproduction by certain 
member countries and irans pressing requirements for 
reconstruction in the postwar era it said 
the newsletter also said the iraqis stressed their 
reconstruction needs and made it plain to subroto that in their 
view the question of iraqs quota is only one of a wide spectrum of 
important issues facing opec 
the newsletter noted it would seem that despite 
subrotos brave endeavors opec still has a long hard road to 
travel as regards the iraqi quota impasse and all its other chronic 
disciplinary ailments 
iraqs current production is estimated at 28 million barrels a 
day meaning that even if iran agreed to quota parity baghdads 
output would be reduced at a time when it wants to boost production 
the other major quota violator is the united arab emirates it 
has said it wants to produce around 15 million barrels a day more 
than onethird above its 948000barrel quota 
the newsletter reported that uae ouput soared from 145 
million barrels a day in july to 17 million barrels a day last 
month and is programmed to increase still further to 195 million 
barrels a day for september 
that will heighten pressure on opec to solve the overproduction 
problem which has helped weaken oil prices from opecs benchmark 
or 18 a barrel to around 14 or 15 
the weekly reported last week that overall opec production was 
estimated at 20 million barrels a day more than 35 million 
barrels over the cartels quota ceiling 
alittihad quoted subroto as saying that if peace talks between 
iran and iraq slowed down confidence in the possibility of 
attaining peace will lead to a letdown on the market and 
consequently prices will slip

it was a cold november day in 1966 
when attorney and expectantfather patrick kennedy looked out a 
downtown hospital window toward the vacant grounds of his alma 
mater st marys university school of law 
the international exposition hemisfair was two years away and 
kennedy knew the city needed hotel rooms in the tourist area so as 
his daughter was being delivered kennedy devised a plan to turn 
the colonial spanishstyle campus into a luxury hotel with a view 
of the popular river walk 
kennedys gamble in what became la mansion del rio paid off 
tourists crowded into the hotel when it opened in april 1968 and 
have been coming ever since 
today kennedy is fighting for survival and claiming that one of 
his lenders metropolitan life insurance co backed him into a 
financial corner to steal his hotels for its own hotel management 
subsidiary 
its a lawsuit the hotel industry is watching carefully 
kennedys attorneys say his 7 billion lawsuit against 
metropolitan could be a test case because it charges that a lender 
in calculated moves conspired to become a direct competitor with 
its borrower 
my biggest problem with this case is trying to understand why 
a company with over 100 billion worth of assets and 100 years of 
reputable business dealings would stoop to this practice and that 
is the reason i am willing to go through with this lawsuit 
kennedy said recently 
metropolitan officials deny any wrongdoing and say the case is a 
simple contractual agreement that kennedy broke by not paying his 
bills on time 
i think you are seeing an absolute desperation move said 
metropolitans san antonio attorney seagal v wheatley what you 
have is a straightforward loan met breached no agreement with mr 
kennedy 
wheatley said kennedy is using the lawsuit to avoid a threatened 
bankruptcy 
kennedys lawsuit charges metropolitan with fraud duress 
interference deceptive trade practices breach of confidential 
relationships unfair dealing and conspiracy in what he claims was 
a concerted nationwide effort by metropolitan and its phoenixbased 
subsidiary doubletree hotels inc to take over regional 
profitable hotels at a fraction of their worth 
the fight is scheduled for another round in court on sept 12 
but metropolitan already claims partial victory from state district 
judge peter michael currys summary judgment in august that 
metropolitan and doubletree did not conspire to take over la 
mansion 
but kennedys attorneys are pressing ahead claiming that 
metropolitan wants to postpone a jury trial until 1989 to drain 
kennedys resources 
if we can get to a jury and show a jury how metropolitan was 
telling doubletree that they would be taking over la mansion 
hotels even before pat had any problems and then put the 
incredible squeeze on pat i think a jury is going to be 
offended said kennedys attorney larry macon 
kennedy was 36 when he transformed the old campus into a luxury 
hotel 
success fueled expansion desires and kennedy approached 
metropolitan in july 1978 the 300room la mansion del norte 
opened in san antonio with an 81 million loan from the insurer 
in 1981 metropolitan refinanced kennedys mortgage to expand 
the chain again increasing his loan to 1125 million 
in 1982 kennedy in partnership with an investment group 
started construction of la mansionaustin financed by metropolitan 
servicing agent american general insurance co the 300room austin 
hotel opened in april 1984 
the three hotels macon claims are worth about 80 million 
kennedy alleges that between 1981 and 1984 metropolitan began 
thinking of taking over la mansion after the insurance giant 
acquired 20 percent of doubletree hotels 
with the texas economy on a slide in the mid1980s kennedys 
hotels suffered like others during that time kennedy alleges 
metropolitan told doubletree his hotels were in trouble and could 
become targets for doubletree takeovers 
in july 1986 doubletree hotels president jim schmidt contacted 
him about a franchising plan but kennedy declined the offer he 
said 
that fall kennedy decided to restructure his management company 
and began talking to his lenders he claims he could not reach a 
satisfactory arrangement with metropolitan 
we reduced his monthly payments by 50 percent and he claims 
that we dealt very hard with him said wheatley 
the attorney said kennedys 1986 restructuring earned him more 
than 1 million at a time kennedy claimed he couldnt make payments 
for his north property 
kennedy talked with other lenders and agreed to give up 
ownership but retain management control of la mansion del rio and 
la mansionaustin 
in the summer of 1987 unable to find an investor in the hotel 
kennedy received an extension on his loan payment from 
metropolitan but by that december arnholt declared the loan in 
default and threatened foreclosure on la mansion del norte 
the same month american general life insurance posted la 
mansionaustin for foreclosure and fired kennedys management 
company this january doubletree began to manage the austin hotel 
after wheatley claimed it exhausted its search for a management 
company 
in february metropolitan planned to foreclose on la mansion del 
norte and doubletree employees prepared to move in but kennedy 
filed suit obtained a temporary restraining order and kept 
metropolitan from taking over 
now metropolitan claims that kennedy is on a free ride not 
having paid a dime for the hotels debt service since 1986 while 
continuing to draw fees for managing the hotel 
attorneys for both sides said theyre not sure what will happen 
on sept 12

incidents of criminal wrongdoing the harvard business school is 
requiring its 800 incoming students this fall to think about those 
and other ethical questions 
scholars said the threeweek minicourse at the 80yearold 
graduate school is part of a nationwide trend to devote more 
resources to teaching and research on moral reasoning and ethical 
values in corporate america 
its become sufficiently clear that the business leader of the 
future is going to have to be conversant and thoughtful about 
ethics said kenneth e goodpaster a philosopher who came to the 
harvard business school in 1980 to help develop an ethics 
curriculum 
one goal of the harvard course is to make future business 
leaders consider the impact of their decisions it joins philosophy 
with case study to stimulate dialogue on questions that defy easy 
answers 
the harvard course will tackle such topics as corporate 
responsibility in a plant relocation limits of economic reasoning 
in environmental waste issues conflicting cultural values in 
international business and organizational pressures against 
honesty and integrity 
what courses at harvard and other universities dont do is 
prescribe a set of morals you cant teach ethics scholars said 
graduate students bring with them values developed over a lifetime 
were not trying to make bad people all of a sudden turn into 
saints said joanne ciulla a philosopher who teaches ethics at 
the university of pennsylvanias wharton school its not coming 
up with the right answer its going through the process and 
understanding what are the issues and what are the values what do 
we have to think about here 
business ethics isnt a new field in 1915 harvard offered a 
class on social factors in business enterprise after the 1929 
stock market crash harvard hired a philosopher to teach ethics as 
society reacted to the depression by attacking greed in business 
wharton which has three ethics specialists this year for the 
first time is requiring students to attend two ethics sessions 
during orientation international business students take a class on 
crosscultural ethics while the graduate and undergraduate 
divisions have offered a business ethics course since 1975 
columbia universitys business school has required a course on 
social responsibility since the the mid1960s the university of 
virginia has had an applied ethics center for about 20 years and 
requires firstyear students to take a class similar to harvards 
while stanford offers an ethics elective 
with an increasing number of cases like the ivan boesky insider 
trading and the wedtech defense scandals those schools are 
intensifying research in ethics and harvard is hosting a 
conference on the subject in december still only about 10 percent 
of business students nationwide are required to study ethics 
harvard last year received a reported 20 million pledge from 
former securities and exchange commission chairman john shad to 
study ethics part of a universitywide program to boost research 
in the field in the professional schools 
scholars said the study of business over the last 30 years has 
become more scientific numberscrunching and bottomline analysis 
at the expense of ethics corporate purpose and corporate 
responsibility 
i dont have difficulty putting forth certain values where at 
least alarms ought to go off said thomas r piper harvards 
senior associate dean for education programs but i also think 
the emphasis should be on the awareness of the breadth of impact 
starting in the late 1950s and 60s business schools emphasized 
that the goal of a company should be maximizing the individual 
stockholders wealth now researchers talk about the impact of 
business decisions on all stakeholders workers communities 
customers future generations 
wherever you draw the line on insider trading meeting someone 
in an alley with 400000 in a suitcase is not a hard issue said 
r edward freeman director of the university of virginias olsson 
center of applied ethics 
the more important stuff is how do you put ethics in the 
center of business decisionmaking every day he said we try 
to make students understand that in every decision they make 
theyre making a moral choice

share prices closed higher monday helped by 
lingering bullish sentiment from us employment figures released 
last friday 
price markups by market participants extended a rally begun 
friday on the back of the unemployment data which showed the us 
economy did not expand in august quite as fast as had been expected 
the data allayed concerns that us interest rates still might 
have to rise further to douse an overheating economy 
analysts said shares were also moving better because for the 
time being fears of rising uk interest rates have been pushed 
into the background however market watchers were quick to point 
out that participation remained painfully low monday 
at the end of trading the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index was up 176 points or 100 percent at 17645 the 
index opened 102 points higher and bounced as much as 204 points 
higher by midmorning to its best level of the day 
meanwhile the narrower financial times 30share index was up 
146 points at 14205 volume was extremely light with a scant 
2848 million shares changing hands compared with the 4438 
million shares friday of mondays total 1922 million shares had 
been traded by midday 
market activity was light in response to a lack of leadership 
from wall street which was closed monday for the labor day holiday 
however several analysts stressed the markets firm undertone 
after fridays healthy us employment figures for august and a 
52point bounce upwards on the dow jones industrial average 
the us labor department reported friday that the us august 
unemployment rate rose to 56 percent and nonfarm payroll jobs 
created totaled 219000 the revised july unemployment rate 
remained unchanged at 54 percent but the nonfarm payroll gain was 
revised downward to 200000 jobs from 283000 jobs 
market expectations had been for a 54percent unemployment rate 
and nonfarm payrolls at 224000

international monetary fund opened talks monday with government 
officials on argentinas request for a standby loan of about 12 
billion 
desmond lachman was scheduled to meet with treasury and central 
bank officials to discuss among other topics argentinas balance 
of payments and the antiinflation plan implemented by president

the world bank for two loans totaling 750 million to reform its 
banking system and reorient its trade policy including the lifting 
of restrictions on imports

he expected an agreement would be concluded by weeks end however 
no official statement was issued before the world banks vice 
president for latin america shamid husain returned to washington 
lachman is scheduled to be in argentina for about a week 
since alfonsin took office in december 1983 government policy 
has been to finance half the interest payments with argentine funds 
and half with borrowed funds 
the countrys inflation in july exceeded 25 percent projections 
are that inflation will be at least that high for august though

an engineering firm that acted as a 
consultant to the washington public supply system on abortive plans 
to build two nuclear power plants has settled with bondholders for 
20 million officials said monday 
the settlement between rw beck and associates of seattle 
wash and bondholders was announced in a statement released by 
courtappointed settlement master junius hoffman 
it came two days before the scheduled start of a massive 
securities fraud case against wppss in federal court here 
the agreement is subject to approval by us district court 
judge william browning who will preside over the case in which 21 
public utilities two engineering firms and a financial adviser 
remain as defendants 
more than 24000 bondholders and chemical bank of new york the 
trustee for bondholders allege that the supply system fraudulently 
sold 225 billion in bonds to build the plants 
the project was abandoned in 1982 and the supply system declared 
default in 1983 after the washington supreme court ruled the public 
utilities involved in the project had no authorization to sign 
agreements with wppss 
mondays announcement brought the total settlements so far to 
351 million agreement has been reached on an additional 96 
million in claims against insurance companies although the 
bondholders must pursue lawsuits to obtain any of that money 
last wednesday the supply system itself settled with the 
bondholders for an estimated 3 billion the cost of the bonds plus 
interest 
bondholders were expected to see little of that settlement 
money however because the supply system has few assets to use to 
pay back the bonds

five years and more than 150 million in legal 
fees later a giant fraud case stemming from the biggest default in 
the history of the municipal bond market is headed for trial 
wednesday in tucson ariz 
the litigation in federal court is a consolidation of dozens of 
lawsuits filed by bondholders after the washington public power 
supply systems 1983 default on 225 billion in bonds sold to 
finance construction of two nuclear power plants 
though it has remained obscure the socalled whoops case 
has won notoriety in legal and financial circles for its size and 
complexity 
consider 
since about 1980 market defaults have totaled about 57 
billion forty percent of that is wppss said c richard 
lehmann of miami lakes fla treasurer of the national wppss 45 
bondholders committee 
dozens of attorneys from some 70 law firms with rates as high 
as 400 an hour have been involved in pretrial work still to be 
added to the legal tab are trial costs and the fees of many 
attorneys who have worked for five years on contingency 
a computerized dataretrieval system for the plaintiffs side 
alone has cost more than 35 million and it holds 14 million 
documents and hundreds of statements by witnesses the defense is 
keeping its system secret 
more than 24000 claims have been filed by an estimated 42000 
bondholders 
defendants from wall street bond underwriting firms to 88 
public utilities to law firms and economic advisers originally 
numbered more than 100 some including bond underwriters have 
settled outside court for 331 million so far wppss itself was let 
out of the suit last week in a surprise move leaving 21 utilities 
and engineering and financial adviser firms as defendants 
the trial itself could last up to two years 
the wppss case is unique said new york university professor 
robert lamb who has written a book on the supply systems woes 
there is nothing like it not only in the dollar amount but 
in the complexity of the involvements of different layers of 
government and governmental authority the complexity of the number 
of litigants claimants and participants 
all the major brokerage firms were involved the bond rating 
agencies were involved bond counsel were involved and different 
engineering firms accounting firms as well as all layers of 
government he said 
those complexities aside however and the case comes down to 
who will pick up the tab for the wppss default and the ensuing 
legal battle bondholders alleging fraud who are stuck with nearly 
worthless bonds or electric utility customers in washington who 
will have to pay higher rates if a decision goes against them 
the public is suing the public matt dillon commissioner of 
snohomish county public utility district a defendant said in 
describing the large groups of potential losers 
despite the risk of losing with the potential of a 
multibilliondollar judgment settlement efforts have fallen short 
as trial looms the 351 million in settlements so far include 92 
million from bond underwriters and most of the rest from insurance 
wppss itself was a relatively minor defendant in the recovery 
because others named in the action have more resources to tap 
wppss as part of its settlement agreed not to contest the future 
payment of money to reimburse claimants 
left among defendants are only 20 washington utilities an 
oregon utility two engineering firms and a financial advisory 
firm but those 21 utilities held about a twothirds interest in 
the abandoned plants 
while settlement was encouraged by us district judge william 
browning efforts to reach a global settlement involving all 
parties fell short last may when defendants declined to counter a 
plaintiff offer of something in excess of 1 billion 
without such a settlement the case could last for years said 
bob ratcliffe of portland ore who retired a year ago as deputy 
administrator of the federal bonneville power administration 
its a loselose proposition every day that litigation goes 
on he said if the litigation runs its course it wont be 
resolved until well into the next century 
for the northwest he said the fighting will continue to have 
economic costs and take a toll in illwill and lack of cooperation 
by various energy and governmental entities 
for the bondholders i dont think any of those living today 
will see any money maybe their heirs will ratcliffe said 
and for attorneys i wish i was still practicing law since 
this is such a marvelous opportunity ratcliffe a lawyer said 
sardonically 
to bondholders the case is one of giant fraud and conspiracy 
coupled with a shameless lack of integrity among defendants 
including the northwest as a region they say utilities knowingly 
entered into faulty agreements with the supply system to build the 
two plants wppss nos 4 and 5 
the washington supreme court ruled in june 1983 that washington 
utilities among the 88 participants contracting to build the plants 
lacked authority to sign the pacts and did not have to pay 
chemical bank of new york trustee for bondholders accelerated 
debt payment that august precipitating the default on the debt 
ratepayer representatives say misguided leadership in the 1970s 
faulty projections for energy needs poor planning and reliance on 
experts who were simply wrong were among factors that led the 
region astray 
utility commissioners wrongly believed the plants would be 
needed to prevent power brownouts and the public would accept big 
rate hikes said jim lazar of olympia a utility consultant 
they are not on trial for being stupid he said they are 
on trial for fraud and that is different 
others said the mishap at the three mile island nuclear plant in 
pennsylvania and a worldwide economic downturn were both critical 
though ratepayers have so far escaped paying for wppss nos 4 
and 5 electric rates have increased fivefold in the northwest to 
pay for three other wppss nuclear plants the rates are assessed 
through bonneville a federal power marketing agency which in 
effect guaranteed payments for the three plants that bpa 
paymentguarantee was not forthcoming for the terminated plants 
trial was moved to tucson on a motion that a jury of northwest 
residents might be reluctant to return a decision that could raise 
their electricity rates

marks 
the market tried again to push the dollar below 185 marks 
in the morning but it showed good resistance said a dealer in 
frankfurt west germany

in the united states 
it would have been difficult to sell the dollar at 185 
marks in todays restricted trading environment one dealer 
said

dollar plunge begun friday on news that the us unemployment rate 
had risen to 56 percent from 54 percent in july

gold prices swung in a narrow range in quiet trading adding to

a south carolina newsprint manufacturer 
is planning a joint venture with a canadian company to build and 
manage a 350 million newsprint plant in northeast venezuela 
officials say 
bowater inc whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in 
greenville is working on an agreement with abitibiprice corp of 
toronto that should be completed this month 
bowater and abitibiprice each will control 2425 percent of the 
plant and the venezuelan government will control the rest said 
bowater spokesman arthur king 
this is a project that the venezuelan government has been 
looking at for years king said by making newsprint there 
they can take the wood and power that they have in profusion and 
are currently not using and turn it into another export product 
something besides oil which they need desperately for foreign 
exchange in venezuela 
the new plant will be in ciudad guyana on the orinoco river in 
northeast venezuela which is surrounded by acres of caribbean 
pine and close to guri dam one of the worlds largest generators 
of hydroelectric power 
plaza said after the onemachine mill begins operating sometime 
in 1992 it will produce about 200000 tons of newsprint per year 
and employ about 350 people 
all but about 40000 tons of the newsprint will be exported to 
customers worldwide plaza said and though bowaters share will be 
nominal it is expected to significantly boost the companys 
exports which have fallen off in recent years 
they used to be a fairly goodsized exporter but more 
recently theyve downsized their export exposure said mark 
diverio a pulp and paper analyst who follows bowater for shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
the biggest reason for the drop in exports was the 1984 sale of 
bowater newfoundland ltd a wholly owned plant in canada that 
produced much of the companys newsprint for export diverio said

venezuela faced with falling oil 
export revenue announced monday one of its banks will open an 
office in the goldmining region of the country to buy gold 
directly from miners 
finalven plans to open an office in guayana some 400 miles 
southeast of caracas the official news agency venpress announced 
the new office would buy gold directly from miners at world 
market rates said finalven president arturo sosa a former 
treasury minister 
currently venezuela is pushing to expand its gold production in 
the wake of falling oil export revenue 
venezuela is supposed to produce 20 thousand pounds of gold this 
year up from 11 thousand in 1987 according to official estimates 
experts estimate that much of the mined gold is smuggled out of 
the country in search of better rates until recently there was no 
centralized system of aquiring the precious metal from the miners 
who work independently in the primitive region near the brazilian 
border 
the venezuelan central bank opened an office earlier this year 
that also purchases gold directly from the miners

the 37nation international cocoa organization 
monday began discussing differences over the support price for 
cocoa on the first day of crucial talks on the bodys future 
delegates said 
the logical consequence of nonagreement will be to consider 
implementing plans to start winding down the icco said west german 
chief delegate peter baron 
these plans officially unveiled monday call for halting on 
oct 1 the current levy on internationally traded cocoa the 
iccos main source of finance as well as for the selling off of 
the iccos stockpiles to meet running costs during the coming year 
delegates said ending the levy would acknowledge that the icco 
had no further role to play in supporting prices 
already the body lacks enough money to implement a possible new 
stockpiling scheme because some producers are behind in payments to 
the icco delegates said the icco is owed a total of 70 million 
they said 
prices on world markets last week reached their lowest levels in 
seven years reflecting a current world cocoa glut and an absence 
of icco support operations since february when intervention buying 
was indefinitely suspended 
the proposed new stockpiling scheme under which producers would 
receive icco financing to hold back up to 120000 metric tons of 
cocoa from the market has been blocked by lack of funds and the 
dispute between producers and consumers over the support price for 
cocoa 
consumers say under the provisions of the price pact 
administered by the icco a cut in the price was automatically 
triggered in march but this interpretation is rejected by the 
producers 
a special panel set up to resolve the dispute reported to the 
icco today that it was split 3 to 2 on the issue 
its independent belgian chairman jean parotte backed the view 
of the panels two consumer members while two producer 
representatives backed their sides view delegates said 
it is now up to the full icco to decide the matter and delegates 
said the continued polarization of views made a solution appear 
very difficult to attain 
baron said even if agreement were possible consumers would then 
press for a further cut in the support price to reflect recent 
developments on the market 
even then the new stockpiling scheme could not operate without 
payment of producer debts to the icco consumer delegates said 
the withholding scheme is linked to the arrears said baron

if you dont know what couch potato fat 
city and junk bond mean you can now look them up in the 
first new college edition of websters new world dictionary of the 
american language in 18 years 
websters new world dictionary is one of the nations 
bestselling reference books and the dictionary of choice of many 
of the nations largest newsgathering organizations 
the third college edition goes on sale tuesday at 1795 for 
hard cover 
it is an absolutely excellent dictionary said ken kister of 
tampa fla a librarian and the author of dictionary buying guide 
among all the good desk dictionaries it is probably the best in 
the coverage of americanisms that is words that originated in 
this country 
the dictionary defines a couch potato as a chronic television 
viewer fat city is a place or condition of prosperity 
comfort success etc and a junk bond is a highyield 
speculative bond often issued to finance the takeover of a 
corporation 
those are some of the new terms among 11000 american words and 
phrases and more than 170000 entries in the dictionary 
websters new world dictionaries which has 16 employees in 
cleveland is owned by simon amp schuster inc of new york 
editor in chief victoria neufeldt who joined the company 4 
years ago said planning for the third college edition began in the 
mid 70s and the staff began producing it in 1979 
the companys two fulltime and one parttime readers 
continuously read books newspapers magazines and signs in search 
of new words or new ways of using words 
references to new words are clipped and placed on index cards 
with enough of the surrounding text for editors to be able to 
determine how the words were used editors refer to the cards when 
trying to decide whether a term is common enough to be included in 
the dictionary words that are no longer used are deleted 
theres so little you can really delete ms neufeldt said 
there is just so much burgeoning of the vocabulary and you have 
to keep some of the old words because they are in books that 
remain popular she said 
ms neufeldt said the second college edition was updated every 
two years but some changes couldnt be made because it would have 
involved altering too many pages 
she said for example the third edition uses the word 
muslim instead of moslem to describe a follower of islam 
that change couldnt be made in the second edition updates because 
references to moslem throughout the dictionary would have had 
to be altered she said 
the third edition is the first produced by the company using a 
computer database ms neufeldt said 
kister said websters new world is one of two companies in the 
united states that can trace its heritage to noah webster who 
wrote dictionaries around the year 1800 the other is merriam 
websters of springfield mass which published the latest edition 
of its collegiate dictionary in 1983 
although sales figures are not available kister said merriam 
websters collegiate dictionary is the nations best selling 
dictionary as many as 12 million dictionaries are sold each year 
in the united states and merriam and new world both have sold 
millions of copies 
new world is used by the new york times the washington post and 
the associated press 
other popular dictionaries in the united states are random house 
and american heritage
