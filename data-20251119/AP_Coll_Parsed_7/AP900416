residents voted monday to keep gallups 
feisty mayor who once threatened to erect billboards proclaiming 
his city the nations drunkendriving capital in office for the 
remaining 11 months of his term 
the vote to recall mayor ed munoz was 1995 to 2135 opponents 
needed 2246 ballots to oust the 62yearold democrat 
this tells me that the people of gallup want me to continue to 
address the citys alcohol problem said the longtime mayor of 
this city on the edge of a huge indian reservation 
the 50 percent voter turnout was about 15 percent higher than 
expected said city clerk rosalena chavez gallup has 7218 
registered voters 
munoz said he was not upset that 1995 voters wanted him out of 
office 
it tells me that people associated with the liquor industry 
carry a lot of clout and that other people want to continue to live 
in denial he said people that have drinking problems want to 
continue drinking and continue to live in denial 
munoz contends the liquor industry was behind the effort to 
drive him from office because of his campaigns against alcohol 
problems in gallup 
recall organizer linda tiley said she hoped the vote sends a 
message to munoz i hope he sees by the number of votes against 
him that there are a lot of people who disagree with his views 
ms tiley said 
i dont feel that the recall was a total failure just because 
we didnt win she said maybe now people will start to pay 
more attention to city government 
recall organizers had said they were fed up with munoz 
confrontational style and accused him of using his position to 
help friends they noted that he has three times offered to step 
outside to settle differences during city council meetings 
if i had been charged with malfeasance or something like that 
then i wouldnt feel good munoz said earlier but i feel good 
about this 
ms tiley said the mayors proposal in february for billboards 
depicting a car on a road paved with skulls was just the last straw 
the billboards 20 miles west of gallup on the arizona state 
line would have told visitors that lifelong new mexico residents 
have an 86 percent chance of being involved in an alcoholrelated 
traffic accident 
the rest of the country now thinks this is nothing but a town 
of drunks said ms tiley a skincare consultant and parttime 
waitress and bartender 
munoz retracted the billboard proposal saying it was intended 
to get the attention of state legislators after they failed to act 
on liquorlaw reforms the mayor supported he has proposed closing 
all driveup liquor windows and halting sales before 11 am and 
persuaded voters to impose a liquor tax to pay for alcohol 
treatment 
munoz was mayor from 1958 through 1969 and is in the middle of 
his second consecutive twoyear term 
he is challenging state rep dominic ferrari in the june 
democratic primary election and has said he wont seek another 
term as mayor no matter what happened monday 
ms tiley rejected the mayors accusation that the recall was 
backed by the liquor industry she said the campaign organized 
with the help of a mail carrier and three of her coworkers at the 
powder puff beauty salon hasnt taken any money from 
alcoholrelated businesses 
alcohol has nothing to do with it at all ms tiley said 
its his tactics we dont like the way he runs things 
examples she said included munoz interceding on behalf on an 
acquaintance in a zoning matter and three times offering to step 
outside a council meeting to settle a dispute 
the mayor doesnt deny challenging people to fights 
when they make personal slanders against me ill threaten 
them he said 
of allegations he helped his friends munoz said im 
responsive to people in the community as a mayor should be when 
someone needs help i try to help them 
ms tiley contends that gallups liquor problems are no worse 
than any other citys but says munoz by drawing attention to 
drinking has hurt tourism 
gallup population 24600 is on the edge of the west 
virginiasize navajo reservation which sprawls across three states 
and is home to 165000 people alcohol is banned on the 
reservation so navajos who wish to drink legally must go to nearby 
cities like gallup 
the national institute on alcoholism and alcohol abuse found in 
a onetime study that the gallup areas rate of alcoholrelated 
deaths per 100000 people was nearly six times the us average 
from 1975 to 1979 in 1987 the national safety council reported 
that new mexico was the nations per capita leader in traffic 
deaths and that year mckinley county which includes gallup was 
worst among new mexico counties for severe alcoholrelated crashes 
in 1988 city police threw 26222 people in drunk tanks to 
sober up many of them multiple offenders

the sponsor of the sat is asking a federal court 
to exempt the test from a state law requiring disclosure of 
questions and answers 
the college board said monday that the exemption if granted 
would allow it to administer the scholastic aptitude test more 
often in new york state by holding down the cost of complying with 
the decadeold truthintesting law 
the law requires testmakers to make public test questions 
answers and related research reports such disclosures enable 
students to check their answers or challenge questions they believe 
are flawed or biased 
new york and california are the only two states with 
truthintesting laws but since new yorks law was passed test 
makers have voluntarily extended its provisions to testtakers in 
all 50 states 
the boards request for an injunction was filed monday in 
syracuse joining with the board was the educational testing 
service of princeton nj which administers the scholastic 
aptitude test and numerous other standardized tests 
if the injunction is granted disclosures of test questions and 
answers will no longer be mandatory but board spokesman fred 
moreno said the testmaker would continue to voluntarily disclose 
tests administered on the four existing new york test dates 
the board would then add two new opportunities in december and 
january each year for new yorkers to take the sat there would also 
be additional dates for new yorkers to take the graduate record 
examination and the test of english as a foreign language but 
tests taken on new dates would not be disclosed afterwards 
in effect the college board said that would mean new yorkers 
would have the same number of opportunities to take the tests as 
students in most other states 
the board reduced the number of test dates in new york shortly 
after truthintesting was enacted claiming that it had to do so 
in order to keep the cost of the exam down 
blair horner a spokesman for the new york public interest 
research group which successfully lobbied for truthintesting 
said the college boardets suit reveals their true character to 
gouge students in order to maximize their profits 
but test publishers insisted they were not trying to subvert 
truthintesting 
we do not want to turn the clock back on test disclosure 
said greg anrig president of ets in a telephone interview he 
added that he had gone on record on numerous occasions in support 
of truthintesting 
consumer advocate ralph nader called the lawsuit a big 
mistake this lawsuit will make the standardized testing industry 
fraud a nationally visible issue for public discussion 
cinthia schuman executive director of fairtest a cambridge 
mass group critical of standardized tests called the action by 
the college board and ets hypocrisy 
why should your right to disclosure of a test depend on the 
date that you take it she said 
the sat is taken by about 16 million collegebound high school 
students each year and approximately 200000 new york students 
the way was paved for mondays action when a federal court in 
january ruled that disclosure provisions of new yorks 
truthintesting law conflicted with federal copyright law that 
case involved the mcat a medical school entrance exam

his boyhood friends in indonesia were 
street peddlers and his grandmother still lives in a mudwalled 
house in kenya but barack obama is another world away presiding 
over the harvard law review as the first black president in the 
prestigious journals 103year history 
the charismatic 28yearold ensconced in the halls where 
tradition reigns is taking aim at another custom obamas sights 
are set on the south side of chicago not on a us supreme court 
clerkship or a fasttrack career with a cushy firm 
im not interested in the suburbs the suburbs bore me and 
im not interested in isolating myself obama said in a recent 
interview i feel good when im engaged in what i think are the 
core issues of the society and those core issues to me are whats 
happening to poor folks in this society 
his passion is rooted in his background he was born in hawaii 
his father an oxford and harvardeducated economist from the 
african nation of kenya his mother a white anthropologist from 
kansas obama moved to southeast asia at age 2 when his parents 
divorced and his mother married an indonesian 
until the fifth grade obama attended indonesian schools where 
most of his friends were the sons of servants street peddlers and 
farmers 
concern for obamas education led his mother to return him to 
hawaii where he attended public schools through high school in 
1983 he graduated from columbia university with a degree in 
political science 
at a recent meeting in a harvard cafeteria his affinity with 
the underdog was readily apparent 
i lived in a country where i saw extreme poverty at a very 
early age obama said parts of my family in kenya remain very 
poor my grandmother still lives in a mudwalled house with no 
running water or electricity 
thats who i am thats where i come from not always 
literally but at least emotionally 
obama entered harvard law school in 1988 and through a 
combination of grades and a writing competition was elected to 
head the law review this february he succeeded peter yu a 
firstgeneration chineseamerican 
obama cautions against reading too much into his election 
its crucial that people dont see my election as somehow a 
symbol of progress in the broader sense that we dont sort of 
point to a barack obama any more than you point to a bill cosby or 
a michael jordan and say well things are hunky dory obama 
said 
theres certainly racism here there are certain burdens that 
are placed more emotionally at this point than concretely obama 
said 
professors may treat black students differently sometimes by 
being sort of more dismissive sometimes by being more sort of 
careful because they think you know they think that somehow we 
cant cope in the classroom he said 
obama sees the inner cities as the front lines of racism 
its critical at this stage for people who want to see genuine 
change to focus locally and it is crucial that we figure out how 
to rebuild the core of leadership and institutions in these 
communities he said 
for five years before law school obama took on that task in 
chicago 
as the director of a program that tried to bring south side 
churches unions and block associations together on projects obama 
was not trying to solve local problems he said instead he sought 
to construct something more lasting a forum for the community to 
speak with one voice 
im interested in organizations not movements because 
movements dissipate and organizations dont obama said 
america suffered when the movements of the 1960s dissipated 
obama said those movements succeeded in raising doubts about 
harmful traditions of sexism and racism but failed to offer a 
viable alternative 
hopefully more and more people will begin to feel their story 
is somehow part of this larger story of how were going to reshape 
america in a way that is less meanspirited and more generous 
obama said 
i mean i really hope to be part of a transformation of this 
country and the future of black people and of america generally 
it depends on how good i do my job he said

the amorous escapades of a 10000pound 
asian elephant named indy have captured the attention of the zoo 
world 
the 18yearold pachyderm has impregnated two females at the 
burnet park zoo babe is expected to deliver her baby around the 
last week of april and romani is due in july 1991 
thats earthshaking news for the continents zoos where just 
62 calves have ever been born in captivity its also a sign of 
promise for the 35000 to 45000 asian elephants that remain in the 
wild as an endangered species 
north american zoos are getting serious about reproducing 
elephants the two pregnancies at syracuse is evidence we are 
making progress said tom foose conservation director for the 
american association of zoological parks and aquariums 
to highlight the importance of the twin pregnancies 
jacksonville zoological park director dale tuttle said there are 
only six other zoos with pregnant asian elephants an elephants 
pregnancy lasts 22 months 
only 14 of the aazpas approximately 150member zoos have the 
facilities to breed asian elephants said tuttle coordinator of 
the aazpas species survival plan for asian elephants 
there are only 11 proven male breeders in captivity and just 
12 females that have reproduced said foose whats going on in 
syracuse is very impressive and very significant 
the survival of the species is dependent in part upon the 
establishment and maintenance of viable breeding of captive 
populations in north america and thats where we come in said 
burnet park zoo director dave raboy 
like the decision to have a child starting an elephant family 
is not a commitment entered into lightly 
the zoo decided in 1979 that it wanted to breed elephants said 
curator don moore it began by transforming the 350squarefoot 
indoor pen that housed its one elephant siri into a spacious 
3200squarefoot indooroutdoor living area with a breeding barn 
romani was purchased in 1984 from a circus which bought her 
from an elephant orphanage in sri lanka indy also an excircus 
performer from thailand and babe a onetime gift to the us 
ambassador to pakistan came to burnet park in june 1985 
with dual pregnancies and a virile male to make it worthwhile 
burnet park this year is spending 500000 to thrust itself fully 
into elephant breeding the money will be used to further enlarge 
and modify the zoos elephant habitat 
a single elephant can cost more than 50000 and a suitable 
habitat hundreds of thousands more 
theres no secret said roger henneous the senior elephant 
keeper at the washington park zoo in portland ore the nations 
premier asian elephant breeder in order to have babies you have 
to accommodate adult males youre talking a tremendous financial 
physical commitment to accommodate a mature male most places cant 
or wont its that simple 
washington park zoo which has had 24 births in the past 28 
years has accommodations for three males among its 12animal herd 
chuck doyle the senior elephant handler at burnet park says 
there are other important factors in elephant breeding one of 
which is luck 
copulation is a learned behavior among elephants a female has 
to see another couple mating otherwise she wont allow the male to 
breed her said doyle who broke some ribs in attempts to get 
babe matched up with a mate for three years we watched indy 
push the females around without success finally he pushed babe 
the right way romani needed less time because she witnessed indy 
and babe 
babes calf which will likely weigh about 200 pounds will be 
the first one born at burnet park so its understandable the zoo 
like a firsttime parent has been excited about the pregnancy 
i feel like i felt having our first child said moore 
its also a first for babe who at 36 may be the oldest 
firsttime asian elephant mother in captivity trainers worry she 
may not know what to do when she delivers 
babe has gained more than 1150 pounds since she became pregnant 
in june 1988 she tipped 7450 when she was weighed by state police 
on a truck scale jan 24 
shes a very very nervous animal and shes not real thrilled 
about people doyle said at one point although he said she has 
become more sociable during her pregnancy 
romani and siri who has resisted indys advances will be 
allowed to watch the birth zoo officials said

france has had 11 citizens held hostage in the 
middle east and it has managed to free them all 
commentators are asking whether it is a gallic flair for 
diplomacy or cynical deals with terrorists and their sponsors that 
account for frances success 
is there as one commentator here asked a special french method 
that can maneuver around the obstacle that others run into 
france makes an important distinction said bassma 
kodmonidarwish an expert on frenchmiddle east relations it 
doesnt bargain with terrorist groups it negotiates with states 
each time hostages come home top government officials find 
themselves denying that france panders to terrorists 
and its true it cannot be criticized on that count said 
ms darwish who works for the french institute for international 
relations but it is also a hypocritical nation 
france came under fire from many prominent western newspapers 
for lauding col moammar gadhafi of libya for his role in securing 
the release tuesday of frenchwoman jacqueline valente her belgian 
companion and their child 
the three were held for more than two years by the 
libyancontrolled fatahrevolutionary council headed by terrorist 
abu nidal 
detractors draw little distinction between abu nidals group and 
gadhafi 
france did 
foreign minister roland dumas who praised gadhafis noble and 
humanitarian gesture in seeking the trios freedom and promised 
improved relations said france did not talk with the abductors 
he denied that france traded three jetfighters returned to 
libya several weeks ago for the hostages 
france negotiated the freedom of 10 of its 11 hostages in 
198688 when conservative premier jacques chirac was in power 
eighteen hostages of other nationalities remain in captivity in 
lebanon including eight americans the longestheld is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the us government has publicly refused to negotiate for the 
release of its hostages but three americans were freed in 198586 
while us arms were secretly delivered to iran which backs groups 
holding hostages in lebanon reports of the deliveries led to the 
disclosure that some of profits were funneled to the contra rebels 
fighting the leftist sandinistas in nicaragua 
french thankyous that followed the release of its hostages were 
never so effusive as those proffered to gadhafi but france has 
also made concessions to iran for earlier releases 
all but one item on irans shopping list was met by the french 
who expelled top iranian dissident massoud rajavi normalized 
relations with iran and repaid part of a billion dollar debt dating 
to the days of the shah 
the only outstanding demand is freeing anis naccache serving a 
life sentence in france for the attempted 1980 assassination of the 
exiled former iranian premier shahpour bakhtiar 
gadhafi called for freedom for middle eastern political 
prisoners in europe and it remains to be seen whether naccache 
will go free 
the true french art is hypocrisy columnist richard cohen 
wrote this week in the washington post the french prattle on 
like a womanizer saying whatever seems effective at the moment at 
this particular moment gadhafi seems in line for the legion of 
honor he freed three hostages 
hypocrisy was a word often used abroad each time france obtained 
the release of hostages but the french view themselves differently 
there is here a certain resigned tolerance for halftruths or 
halflies for reasons of state perhaps more so than elsewhere 
the leftist daily liberation said in an editorial 
la raison detat is a famous phrase in france used by 
governments as an excuse to remain silent 
the 1985 sinking of the greenpeace flagship the rainbow 
warrior in new zealand in which one person was killed proved one 
of frances biggest debacles in decades 
international pressure eventually overcame reasons of state 
and the truth came out but polls at the time revealed a public far 
more outraged by the bungling of french spies than by their 
murderous task 
france has shown concerned nations it was prepared to negotiate 
to release hostages said ms darwish but she added that each time 
french hostages have been freed the political context was favorable 
public pressure was a determining factor in freeing french 
hostages held by iranianbacked groups ms darwish said 
the last three hostages held by iranianbacked groups were 
released may 4 1988 days before the presidential election the 
gambit did not work for chirac who lost to the incumbent francois 
mitterrand 
chiracs government denied charges it made payments or promised 
to free naccache as iran claimed the current socialist government 
says it can find no written record of any deals 
in the latest release of hostages the return of the three 
mirages held in france under an embargo was but a signal for change 
in frenchlibyan relations she said a more moderate stance by 
gadhafi over the past six months including his willingness to 
renew ties with egypt ripened the political climate 
it is that evolution which is more important than the 
hostages she said its not just a deal libya has evolved 
we did not exchange three hostages for three mirages but for 
two epithets said one french official referring to the words 
noble and humanitarian used to describe gadhafi 
in any event it had to be done said a foreign ministry 
spokesman it is the custom

after 15 years of fratricidal carnage 
living in beirut has been reduced to survival real life as other 
people know it is on hold 
peace has become more important than life electricity more 
important than the future and butane gas more important than 
completing the school year says talal salman owner of the 
leftist daily assafir 
the lebanese whose disparate factions are sponsored by such as 
iran israel libya syria and iraq appear to have an insatiable 
appetite for killing each other 
no one knows for sure how many people have been killed or maimed 
since the sectarian civil war began on april 13 1975 
estimates of the number killed range up to 150000 doctors at 
the american university hospital say a total of 200000 killed or 
wounded probably is close 
in the latest warwithinawar christians are fighting 
christians 
rebel gen michel aouns soldiers and samir geageas militiamen 
are battling for control of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
north and east of beirut where twothirds of the 15 million 
lebanese christians live 
even the remarkable resilience of the lebanese has been tested 
to its limits by the long war factional feuding two israeli 
invasions and countless air strikes 
for most of the last year beirut has had little or no water and 
electricity civilian life has been conducted largely underground 
in basements and subterranean parking lots used as shelters from 
artillery fire 
what future is there any more asked antoine mousa a 
christian civilian one works only to make enough money to cover 
the expenses of repairing damage 
fadi koukou who at 14 is one year younger than the war has had 
only three months of schooling since march 1989 most of his time 
has been spent in shelters 
i dont think ill be able to concentrate on my studies if 
classes resume he said i havent held a book for a long long 
time 
koukou who lives in the devastated ashrafiyeh district of 
christian east beirut said he envied youngsters in europe and the 
united states because at least they dont have to spend hours 
filling canisters with water and lug them up five flights of stairs 
because the elevators out 
flashes remain of prewar lebanon when beirut bustled with 
vitality and a phoenician gaudiness that made it the last of the 
great levantine cities the playground of the middle east 
lady cochrane who was yvonne sursock when she married an irish 
baronet still holds elegant dinner parties in her colonnaded home 
in east beirut as she did when she was the queen of beirut society 
before the war 
it is her way of showing contempt for the danger and insanity 
around her 
even so lady cochrane whose greek orthodox family has produced 
generations of lebanese notables has stored her art works for 
safekeeping 
a briton invited for dinner a few weeks ago while an artillery 
duel raged said she sat at the head of the table as family 
retainers brought in the family plate she brushed aside all talk 
of alarm or conflict she had house guests and they were going 
to have an enjoyable visit 
regular water and power supplies to beirut were cut off when the 
dbaye pumping station and the zouk generating station both in the 
christian enclave north the city were hit in the early days of war 
between aoun and geagea 
even if the fighting stopped today it would take at least a 
month to make enough repairs to the power plants to supply the city 
with three hours of electricity a day a municipal official said 
the syrians who have 40000 soldiers in lebanon provide 80 
tank trucks to carry water from the south 
the bloodletting between aoun and geagea is seen by many as the 
ultimate madness in a country thought to have seen it all 
nearly 900 people have been killed and 2500 wounded since jan 
30 most of them civilians 
brother is pitted against brother sometimes aouns soldiers 
refuse to fire at other christians or on streets where relatives 
live 
a christian security source said an aoun artillery battery was 
ordered to fire 60 howitzer shells around geageas headquarters 
near beirut harbor 
they did as they were ordered but they defused nearly all the 
shells before they fired them he said 
only eight exploded most of the rest landed in the sea they 
simply found it unbearable to fire on fellow christians 
a christian woman expressed the civilian viewpoint 
weve taken everything theyve thrown at us for the last 15 
years but we never thought wed have christian fighting christian 
like this its insane were killing ourselves it has to stop 
but it never does

the euphoria surrounding vaclav 
havels fairytale journey from prison to the presidency is gone 
and czechoslovaks are back in the real world arguing about the 
economy politics and the countrys name 
in january and february intellectuals still exulted over the 
end of censorship 
the playwright president in prague castle and his entourage of 
former dissidents and underground artists introduced a new morality 
to politics at home and abroad they were praised from washington 
to moscow 
then domestic worries began to take over 
czechs and slovaks whose winter revolution was so smooth split 
on the question of whether socialist should be removed from 
their republics formal name the matter still is not resolved 
government economists facing a deadline in late april for an 
agreement on drastic reforms fell out over how quickly to adopt a 
free market 
political rivals of the movements that led the revolution began 
campaigning for the june 8 elections the first free vote in four 
decades 
havel recovering from a hernia operation acknowledged in a 
national radio address april 1 that the time of elation and 
happiness stemming from the fact that everyone can say what they 
want has come to an end 
the time has come when we will really have to do something 
with the freedom he declared 
transition from communism to democracy in czechoslovakia and 
elsewhere in eastern europe as been sudden and makeshift marked by 
ethnic problems sharp decreases in worker output and a political 
shift to the right 
czechoslovakia is better off than most 
disputes between czechs and slovaks have not become violent as 
ethnic strife has in romania 
the economy while lagging behind countries czechoslovakia 
outstripped 50 years ago is not burdened by heavy debt but 
hundreds of potential western investors flocking to prague still 
await laws liberalizing capital movement 
unlike hungary czechoslovakia has not even begun establishing 
such fundamental elements of capitalism as new banks and a stock 
market 
a senior economist with close ties to the government said reform 
is hindered by a split between finance minister vaclav klaus who 
wants to go allout for capitalism and others including havel 
who fear the social consequences 
havels civic forum and its slovak partner public against 
violence lead opinion polls for the elections with about 20 
percent the communists who still claim 1 million party members in 
a nation of 155 million are second at about 11 percent 
conservative christian democrats won free elections in east 
germany and hungary however and a similar coalition in 
czechoslovakia can count on strong support in heavily roman 
catholic slovakia the visit of pope john paul ii on april 2122 
also could provide a boost 
the strong communist showing has shaken civic forum into a 
vigorous campaign against the communist partys right to keep 
buildings and other assets seized during 41 years in power 
tens of thousands of people massed in wenceslas square this 
week for the first time since december to support civic forum 
demands that the party return the property 
otherwise the ability to draw a crowd seems to be gone only 28 
people showed up when mayor jaroslav koran of prague appointed by 
havel called for volunteers to clean up the city april 7 
most czechoslovaks still are affected by old habits 
in the past the communists threatened those who did not take 
part in their parades and other rituals with loss of jobs or other 
misfortunes four decades of that created a lack of civic awareness 
yet to be overcome 
old habits also remain with former dissidents 
kveta dienstbier whose husband jiri now is foreign minister 
was alarmed one february night by two mysterious men outside their 
home 
dienstbier arrived driving his official mercedes the two men 
got out of their car scarred by years of surveillance and sudden 
arrest mrs dienstbier screamed to her husband 
the men were ministry drivers waiting to collect the mercedes

the physical wounds left by hurricane 
hugo are slowly healing but domestic strife and other signs of 
stress are on the rise among south carolina survivors of the killer 
storm 
counselors and psychologists say some of the deepest emotional 
wounds are only now emerging and may plague survivors for years in 
areas of the state hardest hit by the sept 21 hurricane 
hugo claimed 29 lives and caused 59 billion damage in south 
carolina police court and mental health officials also found a 
toll on the psyche 
during the first three months of 1990 70 rapes were reported 
in the charleston area an increase of 112 percent from a year ago 
the number of domestic abuse and divorce cases filed in 
charleston county is up 17 percent so far this year an unusually 
large increase court officials say 
an estimated 20000 south carolinians suffering posttraumatic 
stress syndrome are expected to develop longterm psychological 
problems mental health officials say 
the number of people seeking help at the charleston office of 
the state department of alcohol and drug abuse was up 25 percent in 
march compared with a year earlier 
studies show young children from the sea islands and mount 
pleasant which bore the brunt of the storms 135 mph winds and 
15foot tidal surge suffered a variety of emotional symptoms 
ranging from flashbacks to fear of storms 
officials note that not all of those statistical increases are a 
direct result of the storm but they say hugos emotional effects 
are real and probably will grow worse in coming months as the start 
of another hurricane season on june 1 approaches 
well see a continuing rise in the need for counseling said 
dr sydney jordan an associate professor of psychology at the 
medical university of south carolina he said posttraumatic stress 
usually takes about six months to set in 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that if 
everybody in the family is under stress it takes a lot less of a 
stimulus to set people off said dean kilpatrick director of the 
universitys crime victims research and treatment center 
theres nothing about hugo that made people feel kinder or 
gentler toward their fellow man or spouse 
the state mental health departments hugo outreach team 
operated with a 15 million federal grant and 50 counselors 
counseled 2300 people in the first three months of the year 
officials suspect thousands more need help and dont know it 
support groups have found that many people dont recognize the 
link between their problems and the storm said cathy joyner of the 
hugo outreach team 
they dont connect that theyre unable to relate to their 
spouse or that their children are incorrigible to the fact they 
have had a significant life change she said 
the increase in reported rapes is probably associated with storm 
stress said jane wiggins of a victim support group called people 
against rape 
anytime you have such a disruption of normal life the loss 
of a home loss of material goods loss of jobs and the influx of 
people it creates stress on the community and those prone to 
violence are more easily triggered she said 
divorce attorneys in charleston are busy these days 
people are certainly calling more attorney sandra jones 
said she said she has had to book appointments two or three weeks 
in advance something that was not necessary before the storm 
id venture to say it is people who were feeling some sort of 
emotional problem in their marriage already she said they 
were already on a thin line and just cant cope with the additional 
frustration and pressure

the next time new york is looking for a new 
nickname or something catchy to put on its license plates how 
about this tops in wollastonite 
thats right folks the empire state which likes to think 
itself unique in many ways is the wollastonite capital of the 
united states if not the world in fact new york was the only 
state that mined the stuff last year and the reason we know this 
is the us bureau of mines says so in its annual state minerals 
summaries 1990 
now maybe youre wondering what the heck wollastonite is the 
bureau of mines report doesnt say so lets try websters 
dictionary 
ah yes wollastonite a white monoclinic mineral casio3 a 
native calcium silicate it was named for william h wollaston 
an english physicist 
the bureau of mines report does offer tantalizing tidbits about 
new yorks wollastonite industry 
in late 1988 it tells us nyco a division of processed 
minerals inc announced that they made a significant discovery of 
wollastonite at oak hill a few miles from nycos existing mine at 
lewis drilling at the site which was initiated in 1986 indicated 
that the new deposit would double the companys current reserves 
the federal report continues albeit ungrammatically during 
the year nyco also introduced wollastokups a chemically modified 
for use in wollastonite product engineering thermoplastics for 
fascia and body panels 
fascia body panels wollastokups 
now wait a minute 
a fascia plural fasciae according to the dictionary is a 
flat strip or an instrument panel or dashboard and anyone 
who has ever had a car accident knows what body panels are so we 
may be getting warm 
todd hutchins a machine operator at nycos lewis mine in the 
adirondacks confirmed that the company sells wollastonite to car 
manufacturers in addition to being used in dashboards and body 
panels wollastonite reinforces car bumpers and is a component of 
brake discs and pads he said asked for a definition of 
wollastokups hutchins said its the same stuff but its 
chemically treated to make it stronger 
while hutchins knew he was working at the only wollastonite mine 
in the united states he was modest 
were something he laughed were bigtime in a town of 
about 2000 
wollastonite has been found in california norway romania 
mexico and hungary but its only mined in new yorks essex 
county according to the encyclopedia americana 
wollastonite is also used as a paint filler and in ceramic 
products such as electrical insulators tiles and porcelain the 
encyclopedia says 
the minerals namesake william hyde wollaston was quite a guy 
born in 1766 in east dereham norfolk england he earned a medical 
degree from cambridge university according to the encyclopedia 
entry written by l pearce williams a history professor from 
cornell university 
although possessed of the attributes of an excellent doctor 
intelligence extraordinarily keen senses and superb manipulative 
ability he was unhappy as a practicing physician and in 1800 
turned to chemistry and physics williams says 
between 1803 and 1805 wollaston focused on procuring platinum 
soft enough to be shaped his efforts were successful and his 
fortune assured williams writes from 1802 until his death a 
whole host of discoveries flowed from his laboratory 
for example williams tells us wollaston discovered two new 
metals palladium in 1803 and rhodium in 1804 but williams does 
not say wollaston discovered wollastonite nor does he tell us who 
decided to name the stuff after him 
the mystery continues

rebellious inmates at strangeways 
prison started a serious fire early monday the 16th day of their 
revolt after accusing authorities of beating prisoners who had 
surrendered 
prison officers entered the prison and had extinguished the 
blaze an hour after it was set a spokesman for the home office 
the department in charge of prisons there was no indication that 
any of the estimated dozen prisoners still on the loose had been 
injured 
there was a danger to life both to the prison officers who 
went in to fight the fire and to the inmates on the roof said 
the spokesman the fire started around 220 am when heavy smoke 
was seen billowing from the building 
the prisoners said sunday they would carry on their siege 
another week alleging that fellow rebels who had surrendered got 
broken arms and legs 
they communicated their plans on a large board to friends 
relatives and sightseers in the streets below in chalk was 
written we was coming down today but because some of the boys 
departing last week got broken arms and legs we are staying one 
more week 
in response prison spokesman ian lockwood told a news 
conference outside the prison 
we categorically deny that there has been any action against 
prisoners who have come down we cant speculate where they have 
heard these reports 
we want to emphasize that with all prisoners coming down there 
is a standard routine prisoners coming down are observed by 
independent witnesses the prisoners are then fed and 
showered 
lockwood governor of haverigg prison in northwest england 
pressed into service at strangeways said negotiations that ended 
sunday morning had not resumed 
the past 48 hours inside the prison have passed quietly with 
only sporadic activity by prisoners and no direct confrontation 
he said 
hundreds of prisoners rioted on april 1 in the overcrowded 
prison which was heavily damaged when inmates set fires and hurled 
roof tiles at guards and firefighters 
most surrendered in the first few days on friday officials 
said two more prisoners had surrendered leaving fewer than 13 
inside the prison 
government officials said strangeways disturbance sparked unrest 
at eight other prisons in england and wales april 8 ranging from a 
sitin at leeds jail to rioting at dartmoor prison

mounted on a wall in george hommells 
tackle shop in this sportfishing haven is a plastic replica of a 
13pound bonefish president bush caught a week before his 
inauguration in 1989 
its the kind of monster some anglers wait a lifetime to catch 
but the selfproclaimed environment president threw the fish back 
after measuring it 
that fish is swimming around yet probably 13 pounds by 
now said hommell who is taking bush to his best bonefish haunts 
on saturday and sunday 
hommell who has worked the sand flats and coral reefs around 
the florida keys for 45 of his 65 years pointed with pride last 
week to the sparkling bluegreen water under backlash the 17foot 
bonefishing boat he uses on fishing trips with the president 
everything he wants to do is conservationminded the first 
time i fished with him he looked down at the water nice and clear 
and said we have to make sure the next generations are able to 
enjoy this hommell said 
hommell said bush has become an expert at catching the muscular 
silvery fish during five outings with him since treasury secretary 
nicholas brady a fellow angler introduced them in 1980 
a former navy gunner hommell came to florida after world war ii 
and got hooked on the keys where more than 400 species of fish 
meant steady business for good fishing guides 
he ran charters until he could open his own shop world wide 
sportsman in 1968 
golfer jack nicklaus is one old customer and baseball legend 
ted williams hauled in a few prizes on hommells boat but his 
tackle business has expanded and now bush is the only angler he 
finds time to guide 
bush is a darn good fisherman said hommell hell listen 
to you hes very attentive and hes patient you might go 
three four hours without seeing a bonefish and hes got the 
patience for that 
bush talking to reporters the day after he caught the 
13pounder said of the bonefish these are pound for pound id 
say as fighting a fish as there is in the world it really is 
amazing what they do 
then you take them in weigh them and hold them in the water 
and stroke them so that they can escape without some shark getting 
them it really is very wonderful he said 
other resorts claim to have good bonefishing but only in the 
keys do bonefish grow over 10 pounds according to sportfishing 
magazine at that size only the most skillful anglers can haul in 
the fish known as the ghost of the flats 
youve got to fish them like youre hunting deer theyre very 
spooky hommell said 
bush has ordered his small army of secret service agents and 
other federal officials to keep their boats and helicopters at a 
distance and other trappings of power are left at the dock 
hommell said 
hes just a regular fisherman and he acts that way he said 
hommell said he hasnt told bush how he feels about allowing oil 
drilling off southern florida a move locals say could destroy the 
fragile keys environment and shatter the states tourismbased 
economy 
bush has promised that drilling wont be allowed in highly 
sensitive areas but he has stopped short of calling for the ban 
floridas entire congressional delegation wants 
hes basically down here to fish and i dont ask him about it 
because i realize he only has a few days each year to do it 
hommell said 
i try to make sure we talk fishing and look at the clean 
surroundings and hell realize how important it is that it stays 
that way

the president is a little like the shopper who 
consistently underestimates his shopping list and has to go to the 
automatic teller machine to replenish his wallet 
in the waning months of each fiscal year he always finds 
himself short of cash and has to ask congress for more unexpected 
expenses have arisen or things cost more than anticipated 
but unlike the teller machine congress has a mind of its own 
you can have the money lawmakers tell the president but only 
if youll also take all this extra cash and use it for a list of 
projects we would like 
the scenario has been much the same since the birth of the 
republic the first supplemental appropriations bill as the money 
measures are called was proposed in 1790 deficit pressures have 
led to an actual decline in their use in recent years 
this year president bush asked congress for a relatively modest 
870 million 500 million to support panamas fledgling new 
democratic government 300 million to do the same for nicaragua 
and 70 million to pay for resettlement of a higherthanplanned 
number of soviet jews emigrating to the united states 
because of budget rules any new spending must be balanced by 
cuts in some other part of the budget so the net package wont add 
to the deficit bush proposed to pay for the new aid by trimming 
the pentagon budget 
but the house wants the pentagon to finance a good deal more 
than bushs package house members added 510 million for food 
stamps 111 million for disaster assistance 390 million for 
veterans assistance 432 million for fire fighting and a list of 
other items pushing the bills total to 24 billion 
the money bill is among the first items facing the senate when 
it returns this week from a twoweek easter recess the senate 
appropriations committee is likely to take up the measure late in 
the week 
when that happens the bill probably will grow some more 
already sen joseph biden ddel has indicated he wants to 
add 125 million in us economic aid to help wean andean farmers 
from producing coca the leaf used in making cocaine others likely 
will seek additional spending on various domestic programs 
its seen as the only train leaving the station said one 
senior senate aide 
that is because of the urgency with which the white house sees 
the funding bill it is a must sign measure because of the aid 
to panama and nicaragua which bush believes is crucial to the 
survival of two nascent western hemisphere democracies 
in panama the administration is anxious to repair the physical 
damage from its invasion last december and the longerterm economic 
damage from us trade sanctions imposed as pressure on former 
dictator manuel noriega 
the situation is even more desperate in nicaragua which voted 
the leftist government of daniel ortega out of office in february 
and replaced him with a coalition led by presidentelect violeta 
chamorro 
shes got the contras the usbacked rebels to dismantle a 
wrecked economy she cant make agricultural plans said a senior 
administration official chamorro is to be sworn in april 25 
even before she raises her hand to take the oath of office 
shes got more problems than the average president accumulates in a 
year the official said 
nicaraguan inauguration day just nine days from now has become 
the administrations new target date for winning approval of the 
aid package bushs earlier goal april 5 slipped by without 
congressional action 
there is little controversy over the items bush requested the 
house trimmed his 500 million for panama to 420 million devoting 
the rest of the money to other foreign aid causes but gave him the 
full amounts for nicaragua and the refugees 
but the bill may be further delayed by unrelated disputes 
its mustpass nature makes the measure the ideal target for 
those with sharp policy disputes with the white house such as a 
band of congressional liberals who want bush to take a tougher line 
toward the government of el salvador and its alleged tolerance of 
human rights abuses 
nobody ever said shopping on capitol hill was easy

the prime minister resigned monday and 
king birendra dissolved the national assembly he had dominated 
satisfying the two major conditions prodemocracy protesters had 
set for joining an interim government 
the announcement broadcast by state radio ended a week of 
political deadlock in which the two parties leading the campaign 
for democracy refused to join an interim government unless the 
rashtriya panchayat or national assembly was dissolved and their 
own nominee named prime minister 
in view of the events that have taken place in certain parts 
of the country the peoples aspirations and the ideals of 
democracy we have been making political changes birendra said 
there should be a congenial atmosphere where every citizen can 
enjoy democracy and nobody should be be forced to do anything which 
can run counter to the expression of freedom 
the proclamation was the second major victory for prodemocracy 
forces on april 8 birendra caved in to their demand to lift a 
29yearold ban on political parties he also freed several hundred 
political prisoners and permitted several previously banned 
newspapers to reopen 
the prime minister who resigned lokendra bahadur chand had 
been named to the post on april 6 in one of the kings last moves 
to try to contain the prodemocracy movement 
on that day police unleashed the bloodiest crackdown in nepals 
modern history witnesses said as many as 200 protesters were 
killed though the government put the death toll at 10 
birendras proclamation followed the collapse earlier monday of 
marathon negotiations between chand and leaders of the 
prodemocracy movement from which hundreds of protesters refused 
to let the politicians leave 
after learning of the breakdown demonstrators destroyed a 
mercedes benz belonging to the prime minister as well as the car of 
foreign minister pashupaiti rana 
by then a crowd of about 15000 had dwindled to a few hundred 
angry students who refused to let negotiators leave police were 
deployed on three sides of the governmentrun royal nepal academy 
of arts and literature site of the talks but officers said they 
were under strict orders not to use force 
government officials and opposition leaders said they would 
sleep in the academy where the talks began sunday 
the king had invited the leaders of the prodemocracy movement 
the previously outlawed nepali congress party and the united left 
front to join an interim government until the next general 
elections 
but they refused saying they wanted their own nominee as prime 
minister and the national assembly dissolved immediately 
frustrated protesters burst through the gates of the academy 
three times during the sundays talks and demanded that the 
government give in to the opposition demands demonstrators also 
stoned and slightly damaged chands car as he attempted at one 
point to leave the building chand scurried back to the meeting 
minutes later they also forced opposition leader yog prasad 
upadhyaya back to the talks 
demonstrators chanted slogans including hang chand and 
chand resign now clapped and danced on car rooftops during the 
12hour meeting at least two people were slightly injured during 
fighting between members of opposition factions police said 
also sunday hundreds of christians held an easter march 
chanting we want religious freedom as they tested the promises 
of new democracy in this himalayan nation the march was the first 
in recent memory in the worlds only hindu kingdom which bans 
christian missionary work 
on kings way the broad street leading to the tall walls 
surrounding king birendras palace 300 nepalese christians marched 
shouting we want religious freedom 
nepalese law bans hindus from converting to christianity anyone 
convicted of proselytizing is subject to prison terms ranging up to 
six years 
the authorities did not interfere in the christian procession 
although king birendras government has described itself as a 
democracy the nepalese constitution gave the monarch supreme 
executive judicial and legislative powers 
ninety percent of nepals 17 million people are hindus while 5 
percent are moslems and 3 percent are buddhists nepalese 
christians estimate their number at 25000

few developments would make american rice 
farmers happier than to see japan open its door to imports 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter predicts it will happen this 
year 
for decades the united states has been badgering japan to open 
its import door to more agricultural products there has been 
significant success with beef citrus and some other products 
but rice no way 
rice has almost mystical status as a food staple in japan and 
government policies for many years were aimed at guaranteeing 
selfsufficiency regardless of high subsidy costs and rising 
surpluses 
now japan is one of the most important trading nations engaged 
in the uruguay round of negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the goal is to liberalize global trade by the 
time the talks are scheduled to conclude at the end of this year 
yeutter who is optimistic about a favorable conclusion to the 
gatt talks speaks with more certainty about japan opening its rice 
door 
i believe that the japanese market for rice will be opened up 
prior to the end of the uruguay round and should be open 
yeutter said 
allowing rice imports not only would be good for the japanese 
consumers but will help those countries that want to sell rice to 
japan he said and tokyo cannot stand up for world trade 
liberalization without looking at its own policies 
or putting it in a more specific way he said japan 
simply cannot continue to exclude imports of rice from its own 
marketplace while it insists in the uruguay round that other 
nations liberalize trade in their industrial products and in 
services such as the financial marketplace 
yeutters comments were made last week in a televised satellite 
interview with european reporters part of the us information 
agencys worldnet operation 
if japan wishes to continue expanding its own exports it must 
open itself to others he said 
and my judgment is that the political leadership in japan will 
come to that same conclusion between now and december and 
therefore japan will open its rice market yeutter said 
there will be a great debate of course as to how far it will 
open he added no one is suggesting that japan must open its 
rice market totally thats unrealistic 
meanwhile these are uncertain times for us rice producers 
its not just the political maneuvering over the 1990 farm bill 
world supplies and prices are huge factors in the us market 
rice is an important crop in half a dozen states with arkansas 
the biggest producer followed by california louisiana texas 
mississippi and missouri 
globally most rice is consumed in the countries that produce 
it total output in calendar 1990 is projected by usda at 5036 
million metric tons one ton is equal to about 22 hundredweight 
the hundredweight or 100 pounds is the standard us measure 
of the world total output china is expected to account for 179 
million tons of rice and india 105 million tons neither is a 
major exporter in 1990 
but thailand which is forecast to produce 21 million tons of 
rice this year will be the worlds largest exporter at 47 million 
tons 
japans 1990 rice crop is forecast at 129 million tons exports 
are zero along with imports 
the united states which may produce around 7 million tons of 
rice this year according to usda projections is expected to 
export about 26 million tons second only to thailand 
according to the departments foreign agricultural service 
china and indonesia imported some rice in calendar 1989 but have 
dropped out of the market this year now the agency reported the 
major rice exporters are having to scramble harder in 1990 
meanwhile in another report analysts said us rice stockpiles 
could drop to 19 million hundredweight less than 1 million tons 
by aug 1 the beginning of the 199090 rice marketing year 
that would be down from 267 million hundredweight last aug 1 
and 314 million on aug 1 1988 it also would be the lowest us 
rice stockpile at the beginning of a marketing year since 1981 
market prices paid to farmers have improved because of the 
tighter supply and are currently expected to average 725 to 775 
per hundredweight over the 198990 marketing year up from 683 in 
198889

patients suffering from kidney disease so 
mild they dont know they have it run a serious risk of kidney 
failure from the widely used pain reliever ibuprofen a study warns 
ibuprofen is sold over the counter under such brand names as 
advil medipren motrin and nuprin 
the threeyear study appearing in sundays edition of the 
annals of internal medicine was accompanied by an editorial that 
proposed the food and drug administration strengthen warning labels 
to urge consumers with any serious condition to consult their 
doctors before using the drug 
ibuprofen approved for sale in nonprescription form since 
1985 accounts for about 20 percent of the nations 25 billion 
annual overthecounter sales of pain relievers 
the study examined the shortterm effects of ibuprofen on 12 
women with mild kidney disease who also had arthritis and high 
blood pressure two illnesses that often prompt the use of 
ibuprofen 
researchers at johns hopkins university in baltimore led by dr 
andrew whelton gave participants 800 milligrams of ibuprofen three 
times a day the equivalent of 12 ibuprofen tablets for up to 11 
days 
the maximum recommended nonprescription dose is 1200 
milligrams a day 
after eight days three women developed kidney failure which 
reversed when ibuprofen was discontinued the three were then given 
400 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day the maximum 
recommended dose two of the three again developed kidney failure 
but recovered when ibuprofen was stopped 
the remaining nine women who received ibuprofen for 11 days 
showed changes in kidney function but did not develop kidney 
failure 
ibuprofen relieves pain by interfering with the bodys 
production of prostaglandin a substance involved in inflammation 
but at the same time the drug constricts blood flow 
normally the change poses little risk if used for a short 
period but for those whose blood flow to the kidneys is already 
reduced by kidney heart or liver damage the flu or aging 
ibuprofen could trigger acute kidney failure the study says 
overthecounter use of ibuprofen was of special concern 
because without careful monitoring people may not know their 
kidneys are failing the researchers said 
patients with previously undiagnosed mild renal impairment may 
consume therapeutic doses of ibuprofen without supervision and 
could suffer severe kidney damage they wrote 
the editorials authors pharmacologist michael murray of purdue 
university and dr d craig brater of indiana university said the 
studys results do not warrant the removal of ibuprofen from drug 
store shelves 
instead they agreed with the national kidney foundation that 
warnings for the drug should be more explicit current labeling on 
ibuprofen products warn only those people who are allergic to 
aspirin not to take the medication 
fda spokeswoman eva kemper said an agency advisory panel met in 
february to consider ibuprofen warnings but had not yet made any 
recommendations 
brater and murray urged that further studies be conducted to 
determine the risk to the general population of developing kidney 
damage from ibuprofen

president bush will ask a 17nation conference 
this week to examine the economic impact of global warming but the 
administration plans to argue its too early to propose specific 
measures to deal with the problem officials say 
the white houses cautious approach in developing responses to 
global warming is expected to unleash renewed criticism from some 
european countries that the united states is failing to provide 
leadership in dealing with the socalled greenhouse effect 
the bush administration has maintained that while there is 
widespread agreement that manmade pollutants are causing the earth 
to become warmer there remain too many unanswered questions to 
warrant pollution controls that could have widespread economic 
implications 
the president is hosting a white house conference on the 
greenhouse effect on tuesday just days before next sundays earth 
day observance during his 1988 campaign bush said such a 
conference was a top priority and would be held in his first year 
as president 
senior advisers on economics science and the environment from 
17 nations plan to attend making it the first gathering on the 
subject with government officials representing such a broad 
spectrum of interest 
senior bush advisers said they hoped the conference would for 
the first time give equal weight to economic as well as 
environmental issues related to global warming 
we hope it will raise the level of debate on the science 
and economics of global change said michael boskin chairman of 
the presidents council of economic advisers who will be one of 
the three conference cochairmen 
administration officials cautioned in briefings with reporters 
that the gathering is not intended to produce any blueprint for 
dealing with global warming instead the officials said the 
administration will emphasize the need for further scientific 
studies and incorporating the economic issues involved 
last week the presidents chief science adviser allen bromley 
criticized those who advocate slamdunk solutions to global 
warming he said too many scientific and economic uncertainties 
remain to map out specific measures 
we cannot sail blindly into the future he declared bromley 
will serve as a conferencecochairman along with boskin and michael 
deland chairman of the presidents council on environmental 
quality 
but even before many conference delegates arrived officials 
from several european countries complained about the bush 
administrations emphasis on further research and its refusal to 
discuss specific action plans to deal with the greenhouse issue 
some delegates will advocate more than just research said 
an official from one european country asking that he not be 
identified further we want to stress that research should not be 
a substitute for action 
some of the europeans plan to push the americans pretty 
hard said another european also speaking anonymously 
a number of european countries including the netherlands and 
west germany have called for the industrial nations to commit 
themselves to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions by the 
year 2000 
carbon dioxide primarily from the burning of fossil fuels 
accounts for more than half the greenhouse pollutants such 
curbs would require significant increases in energy efficiency or 
cuts in energy use 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
said sunday the president is committed to an international treaty 
on global warming but he too cautioned that more scientific 
evidence is needed 
we have to be cautious careful and take out something of an 
insurance policy he said on abcs this week with david 
brinkley 
while most scientists agree that manmade pollutants are 
enveloping the earth and causing it to warm they are unsure about 
the eventual severity of the warming 
some computer models have suggested a 4degree to 9degree 
fahrenheit increase in global temperatures but some scientists 
said those projections are uncertain and may not adequately take 
into account the effects of clouds or other factors that might have 
a counteracting effect 
what we do not know is the timing the magnitude or the rate 
of the temperature increase said bromley

it is not as if byron r whites resume needs 
enhancement but for two decades the capital citys rumor mill has 
had him leaving the supreme court for some new challenge 
will he run for president or vice president has he been asked 
to become fbi director will he become commissioner of major league 
baseball or the national football league 
white has denied or ignored each of those rumors and has 
remained an independently minded intellectual force on the court 
marking his 28th anniversary as a justice today white 72 is 
considered an influential consistent member of the courts 
conservative majority 
he has more seniority than anyone except justice william j 
brennan 83 who joined the court in 1956 
one rumor persists seemingly finding its way into print every 
year or so that he is about to retire 
after such a report was published in 1988 white dispatched 
court spokeswoman toni house to tell reporters he has not told 
friends any such thing he is not considering retirement 
white who refused to be interviewed for this article continues 
to scoff at any suggestion his retirement is imminent 
his resume by any standard is impressive athletic and 
academic star in the tiny town of wellington colo university of 
colorado valedictorian class of 38 bestknown college football 
player of his time and star in basketball and baseball as well 
member of professional footballs hall of fame rhodes scholar 
decorated war veteran highhonors graduate of yale law school law 
clerk to chief justice fred vinson attorney general robert f 
kennedys chief aide appointed to the supreme court by president 
john f kennedy at age 44 
it is an allamerican story 
in a breezy dispatch written just months after white joined the 
court in 1962 an associated press reporter predicted he is 
going to be no flaming liberal no social reformer type nor a 
rightwinger 
at the same time life magazine said although he has had no 
experience on the judicial bench white is a man of depth and 
intensity with a capacity for dispassionate analysis 
some liberal critics say white indeed has become a 
rightwinger after spending most of his tenure at the courts 
center 
his voting record manifests a judicial philosophy that is 
very close to ronald reagans ideal washington lawyer nathan 
lewin has said 
white would let states outlaw most abortions opposes broad use 
of affirmative action to remedy past bias in employment and favors 
greater governmental accommodation of religion in ways some 
consider violations of churchstate separation 
in cases pitting societal protection against individual rights 
white generally votes on the law and order side 
he wrote for the court when in 1987 it ruled that the privacy 
rights of homosexuals do not protect them from state laws making 
sodomy a crime 
im not a fan of his said stephen barnett a law professor 
at the university of californiaberkeley he has had no coherent 
judicial philosophy and little distinction of any kind his service 
on the court is distinguished only by its length 
barnett called whites opinion in the homosexual privacy case 
a low point in its sneering tone and lack of reasoning 
but harvard law professor lance liebman a former white clerk 
says that throughout his career the justice has tried to decide 
most cases narrowly and without sweeping statements 
he thus plays the role of the careful lawyer applying his 
powerful intelligence to the case before him in the context of the 
precedents as he finds them liebman said 
whites written opinions most often employing unadorned prose 
rather than rhetorical flashes reflect his personality friends 
say that in his personal life white exposes no more of his 
thoughts and feelings than necessary 
he can be gruff and impatient as lawyers who appear before the 
court have learned to their discomfort 
bad lawyering is almost as sure to make white grimace as being 
reminded of the football nickname he has grown to hate 
whizzer 
despite starring as the national football leagues best running 
back for three years after signing in 1938 for a recordhigh 
15800 annual salary white says the sport was merely a means to 
an end to earn the money needed for law school 
nevertheless he played with a tenacity later displayed in his 
legal career 
that guy was tougher than hell if we needed a yard or two we 
didnt call on our fullback we called on him former detroit 
lions teammate howard weiss once told the washington post i 
should know i was the fullback he was a tough monkey

hundreds of police some in riot gear took to 
the streets of chinas capital to prevent unrest on the anniversary 
of the start of last springs prodemocracy movement 
they succeeded a lone protester was arrested sunday other 
expressions of dissent were discouraged by the heavy police 
presence 
a year ago sunday former communist party chief hu yaobang died 
hu was ousted from power in 1987 for failing to stop student 
demonstrations and students mourning his death used the occassion 
to criticize the leadership and push for democratic reform and an 
end to official corruption 
for seven weeks beijing streets were filled with crowds of up 
to 1 million people demanding the resignation of unpopular leaders 
and more say in how they live their lives 
it all ended when troops invaded the city on june 34 killing 
hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators with automatic weapons fire 
and driving students from tiananmen square the countrys symbolic 
seat of power 
this spring beijing is a different city students say protests 
are unlikely because of heavy police surveillance and the certainty 
that anyone who tries to organize a demonstration will be arrested 
in addition thousands of people who took part in last years 
demonstrations are thought to still be in jail without charges and 
some protest leaders have fled the country 
in anticipation of sundays anniversary police set up 
checkpoints at several intersections near the university area in 
northwestern beijing and officers carrying rifles with bayonets 
drawn patrolled the square 
the square was open to the public sunday unlike on april 1 and 
5 when police sealed it to block feared protests overseas 
dissidents had urged people to silently stroll through the square 
on those days in honor of those killed last june 
sundays only incident occurred when a man in his 30s began to 
pin on his sleeve white paper flowers a traditional sign of 
mourning streamers from the flowers read to mourn hu yaobang 
and heroes who die for democracy and liberty 
police quickly arrested the man who told onlookers he was a 
scientist from the southern province of guizhou and had come to 
beijing to mourn our great general secretary hu 
he carried suitcases and said he had come to beijing with 
everything he owned in anticipation of being arrested 
about 20 police stood guard around a monument to revolutionary 
heroes in the middle of the square throughout the day forbidding 
entry 
the monument usually open was covered with wreaths last year 
brought by students and others to mourn hu it was also the 
headquarters for student leaders during their occupation of the 
100acre square last may and june 
buses and vans loaded with police were parked around the 
monument and dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police patrolled 
the square 
as usual almost all the people on the square were from outside 
beijing workers in blue mao jackets and rubbersoled slippers 
sunburned farmers in illfitting suits and honeymooners posing for 
pictures 
students and young workers have been warned by authorities to 
stay away from tiananmen this spring and told they face expulsion 
or banishment to a countryside job if they are involved in protests 
hundreds of riot police some with shields and hard helmets 
were stationed along main streets of the capital on sunday 
ostensibly to control crowds for a marathon race through the city 
surprisingly security was only marginally increased at the 
university campuses in northwestern beijing that were hotbeds of 
dissent last spring 
at beijing normal university crowds gathered around recently 
posted notices announcing the expulsions of movement leaders wuer 
kaixi and chai ling both of whom escaped to the west 
students appeared more concerned with making the most of 
sundays sunshine and warm temperatures reading outdoors or 
playing basketball than with attempting to mark the anniversary 
the communist partys official peoples daily did not mention 
the anniversary in its sunday edition there have been no reported 
official events to commemorate the death of hu

saturday at baltimores pimlico racetrack from a pool that had been 
steadily growing for 23 days the other winners were not identified 
beyer gambled 4578 after determining that at least half the 
horses in the field were so totally devoid of talent that they 
couldnt possibly finish in the money and then plotting out 
possible strategies for the remaining contenders he said in his 
column sunday 
the ten winners had to pick the correct order of finish for 
first second and third in both the third and fifth races 
i never even had to root beyer wrote my horses 
controlled the race from start to finish 
the state record for doubletriple payoffs is 314366 which 
went to a syndicate of local professionals in february 1987 
i have spent many many years and a ridiculous amount of 
effort trying to win a sixdigit payoff at a racetrack and i had 
finally done it beyer said in his column

retired judge arlin adams a longtime 
stalwart of the federal bench is taking on what may be his 
toughest case the hud scandal 
his staff isnt complete and remains in temporary offices but 
adams said it has been making progress anyway in its investigation 
of alleged fraud by top officials in the us department of housing 
and urban development 
adams who travels back and forth to washington as needed said 
his staff has received fbi files and other documents and met with 
two congressional committees 
he expects to have his staff completed by this week and 
interviews in the investigation should start almost any day he 
said thursday 
adams 68 spent 18 years on the bench of the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals in philadelphia he retired and went back to his 
old law firm three years ago he also is finishing two books due 
out this year on religion and law 
never quite out of the legal limelight adams last month was 
named independent counsel to investigate allegations that former 
housing secretary samuel pierce jr and other hud officials 
conspired to defraud a government program by steering rent 
subsidies to politically connected developers 
there has been testimony before congressional committees that 
hundreds of millions of dollars were improperly handled possibly 
stolen 
the softspoken adams has a reputation for being sensitive but 
firm with those who stand before him 
if the evidence is there for him to seek indictments adams 
said he will hire other lawyers to do the courtroom work his 
expertise at the trial level is in civil work mainly in antitrust 
securities and mergers 
yet he said his most interesting case was a murder early in his 
career he was appointed to defend a man charged with killing a 
policeman he won reversal of the conviction when he was able to 
prove his client hadnt fired the bullet 
as a judge adams heard the appeal of two soviet spies convicted 
of obtaining secrets of the strategic air command adams said he 
persuaded his colleagues on the court that the president as head 
of foreign affairs did not need court authorization to order the 
wiretaps used to convict the spies 
the interesting windup of the case is that the russians 
demanded the united states return the two spies in exchange for 
gary powers who was shot down by the russians during the 
eisenhower administration in the u2 incident i think that was a 
good result adams said 
adams a lifelong republican staunchly believes all lawyers 
should be involved in public service even when it costs them 
money 
if the lawyers wont do it who will he said 
for reasons i dont quite understand lawyers today are not 
taking on as much public work as they did 10 or 20 years ago like 
so much in society the legal profession has gotten very 
materialistic but i am hopeful that is going to change 
his first taste of politics came in 1949 when the head of his 
law firm william schnader was chairman of a commission writing a 
new charter for the city of philadelphia and got adams involved 
then adams worked in several campaigns of rep hugh scott who 
later became a us senator and minority leader when another 
congressman william scranton ran for governor adams became a key 
supporter 
when he won he urged me to become a member of his cabinet and 
first i said no i couldnt afford it but when he asked me to 
be secretary of public welfare mr schnader and i decided that was 
a request i couldnt turn down because that was public service 
adams said 
later scranton and scott unsuccessfully urged adams to run for 
governor 
in 1968 adams became one of the key people in richard nixons 
successful presidential bid that led to his appeals court 
appointment 
adams said high points in his career came when nixon and 
president ford considered him for the us supreme court 
i dont think i was entitled to it adams said there were 
many other lawyers and judges more qualified i thought and just 
being considered was honor enough 
president jimmy carter while i was a judge offered me a very 
high government position which i cannot discuss because i declined 
to accept it adams added i thought that was a very satisfying 
thing because he did that strictly on my record i did not know 
jimmy carter

the government will sponsor a threeyear 29 
million research project aimed at reducing or preventing the 
elderly from becoming physically frail two federal agencies say 
the national institute on aging and the national center for 
nursing research said sites in eight states will be used for the 
ficsit project which stands for frailty and injuries 
cooperative studies of intervention techniques 
more than 1500 volunteers are expected to participate the 
program will feature exercise ranging from the oriental practice 
of tai chi to aerobic dance education to make older people aware 
of accident risks and rehabilitation to improve physical 
conditioning 
millions of older people lack strength mobility balance and 
endurance and are therefore susceptible to serious falls nursing 
home admissions and a loss of independence according to the nia 
the new trials highlight the fact that frailty and injuries 
are not the inevitable outcome of aging said nia director dr t 
franklin williams instead they are problems for which we have 
now found some very viable solutions 
more than 32 percent of people over age 75 cannot climb stairs 
40 percent are unable to walk two blocks 7 percent cannot walk 
across a small room and 22 percent cannot lift 10 pounds the nia 
said fortytwo percent of nursing home residents cannot get out of 
a chair without help

a hopedfor trade agreement between the united 
states and moscow could be derailed if soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev carries out his threatened economic blockade against 
lithuania warn senate leaders in both parties 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan said sunday that retaliation by moscow to 
lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence would jeopardize a 
trade agreement president bush and gorbachev hoped to sign at a 
summit in june 
the bush administration was taking what secretary of state james 
a baker iii called a wait and see attitude as the 
kremlinimposed deadline for lithuania to rescind its declaration 
of independence passed sunday night 
mitchell who on saturday condemned gorbachevs ultimatum as 
precisely the wrong approach said sunday he was waiting for 
bush to do the same but in an interview on cbstvs face the 
nation mitchell also supported the administrations reluctance 
to issue specific counter threats 
we ought not to be announcing in advance what were going to 
do when we dont know for sure that they are going to do he said 
however mitchell said a wide range of possible reactions 
could include canceling the summit slowing down the trade 
negotiations and in between those a whole lot of things that 
can be done 
dole interviewed on nbcs meet the press from jerusalem 
questioned the wisdom of canceling the summit if the soviets carry 
out their threat to cut off supplies to lithuania 
any us retaliation dole said should be limited to measures 
that are more to moscows benefit than to the united states

expensive and take longer than repairing the 17mile road damaged 
in the oct 17 earthquake 
hundreds of merchants in chinatown were to close their doors 
today and head for an afternoon meeting of the board of 
supervisors which has the mayors proposal on its agenda 
agnos argues the elevated freeway is ugly blocks a panoramic 
view of san francisco bay and is too expensive to repair although 
state transportation department estimates put the cost of reopening 
the road at 32 million 
agnos wants to spend 120 million to replace it acknowledging 
that the project could take five or six years the transportation 
department said repairs could be completed by oct 1 if the work 
started in june 
rose pak of the chinese chamber of commerce and others said time 
is critical for chinatown merchants who have been doing without 
their key link to tourists who usually keep their shops and 
restaurants bustling 
she called todays shutdown a very basic grassroots humble 
gesture it follows the submission of 10000 signatures in favor 
of repairing the freeway 
its a political statement that were not a silent minority 
pak said 
the freeway has long been controversial in 1986 voters 
rejected a proposal to spend 10 million to tear it down many 
groups opposed it even before it opened in 1959 saying it would 
sacrifice city streets and alter the character of neighborhoods 
supervisor tom hsieh was outraged by the mayors proposal which 
he said was explained to the board of supervisors in a twopage 
statement that lacked details about where the 120 million would 
come from and what chinatown is supposed to do while the expressway 
is built 
some leaders have no idea of the hardship and the trauma 
people in that community are facing hsieh said they lost not 
just business they lost employment 
last week a san francisco chamber of commerce business panel 
voted in favor of rebuilding the road 
although business leaders vow that agnos position will hurt him 
politically the mayor contends that the longterm interests of the 
city must come first 
nobody wants to sacrifice shortterm discomfort for longterm 
progress but thats what a great city has to do or it will become 
stagnant he said

up to 19000 gallons of fuel are 
believed to have leaked near yellowstone national park from a 
fallout shelter built by a religious group girding for nuclear 
armageddon 
workers on sunday began pumping out 540000 gallons of gasoline 
and diesel from the underground tanks while furious local 
residents said their fears of an environmental disaster were borne 
out by the leaks 
id say were mad as hell said richard parks who owns an 
outdoor equipment shop in nearby gardiner i hope they can get 
the fuel out of there i hope to god people have got the sense 
not to let them put it back in 
the 35 tanks with a capacity of 634500 gallons were installed 
last winter in the church universal and triumphants underground 
complex the shelters are on a ranch purchased in 1981 from 
publisher malcolm forbes to prepare for a nuclear catastrophe 
church officials reported last week that one tank containing 
diesel fuel had leaked 4000 gallons into the ground two others 
were reported leaking over the weekend 
steve pilcher chief of montanas water quality bureau said 
15000 gallons were unaccounted for sunday and most likely were in 
the soil near the complex 
the tanks and the 750person shelter complex are five miles 
north of yellowstone national park and within several hundred yards 
of mol heron creek a cutthroat trout spawning stream that runs 
into the yellowstone river 
small amounts of fuel had reached the creek but no major damage 
had occurred officials said pilcher said less than 1000 gallons 
of spilled fuel had been recovered but trenches were dug to 
capture most of the fuel before it reached the creek 
its not a oneday quickfix cleanup theyre looking at 
a longterm recovery and cleanup effort theres still a big threat 
there pilcher said by saturday night church officials had 
decided all 35 tanks must be pumped out excavated and inspected 
said murray steinman a sect spokesman 
after the second and third leaks we said thats it were 
going to get all this out of here steinman said the cleanup is 
under the direction of envirocon a missoulabased engineering firm 
retained by the church 
steinman said tanker trucks hauled out 110000 gallons of 
gasoline on sunday and crews will work all week to remove the 
remaining fuel 
the leaks occurred within weeks after state officials reopened 
their environmental review of church developments near corwin 
springs they said the church concealed construction of the complex 
during the original review completed a year ago 
the local population of church members mushroomed this year 
after spiritual leader elizabeth clare prophet who claims she 
receives and passes on to church members messages from a group of 
souls known as the ascended masters warned that march and april 
are dangerous times 
she told members to come to montana for a prayer vigil and to 
prepare for a possible nuclear war or accident 
local officials estimate 2000 to 3000 church members live in 
the scenic mountain valley where the church owns about 30000 
acres and has sponsored housing developments the church said 
nobody is living in the fallout shelters 
steinman said the tanks might have been defective but pilcher 
said the tanks might have ruptured because they were installed in 
frozen soil that shifted when it began to thaw

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange tumbled in 
thin trading monday while the dollar ended higher against the 
japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average the markets main barometer fell 
75074 points or 257 percent to 2846318 a thin 230 million 
issues changed hands on the exchanges first section which 
includes the countrys largest and most profitable firms 
the dollar closed at 15942 yen up one yen from its close 
friday at 15842 the currency moved in a narrow range between 
15900 yen and 15945 yen after opening at 15915 yen 
in the bond market the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
government bond was quoted at 8579 points at 300 pm down from 
its close friday at 8590 the bond yield rose to 7405 percent 
from 7380 percent 
kazuhiro nomura an analyst for new japan securities co said 
arbitrage selling of spot issues accounted for the deep losses in 
the nikkei index which were further exaggerated by the unusually 
light trading 
in arbitrage trading dealers exchange spot issues for stock 
futures or vice versa in an attempt to profit from the difference 
in prices between the two markets 
japanese market participants have frequently pointed to the 
recent introduction of arbitrage techniques as a reason for the 
continuing instability of the tokyo market 
nomura said market dealers were largely waiting on the sidelines 
ahead of an announcement wednesday by the us commerce department 
of the countrys trade figures for february they were also waiting 
to see the bank of japans moves to regulate the countrys money 
supply and the trend in exchange rates 
on the currency market dealers also pointed to the us trade 
figure announcement and speculation about future bank of japan 
policy regarding interest rates as affecting the yendollar rate 
norio takeda a dealer with the bank of tokyo said the dollars 
early strength was attributable to the view that the upcoming us 
monthly trade imbalance will show an improvement 
a dealer with fuji bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
added the dollar was also propped up by a large demand for the 
currency by banks on occasion of the first day of the monthly 
reserveaccounting period monday 
early in the reserve period banks try to obtain a lot of cash 
to fufill their reserve requirements the surge in demand often 
kicks up demand for the dollar as well as various short term 
interest rates

following are excerpts from the vatican 
translation of pope john paul iis easter sunday message which was 
delivered in italian 
 
i have overcome the world jn 1633 
the stone before the tomb at the foot of golgotha rolled away 
the tomb itself empty he is not here he has risen he is not 
here mk 166 
go tell his disciples and peter mk 167 
simon peter and john discover in the tomb everything just as 
the women had said they do not find him were they perhaps 
already then capable of recalling those words i have overcome the 
world in the world you have tribulation but be of good cheer i 
have overcome the world jn 1633 yes those last days had been 
a time of terrible tribulation they had been dismayed by the 
arrest in gethsemane by the condemnation to the cross by the 
death on calvary they had experienced a terrible tribulation 
before the empty tomb did they wonder has he conquered the world 
 
this world in which man lives where man has dominion this 
world in the end seems to overcome man it overcomes him through 
death but christ who has conquered death has overcome the 
world by his own death he has put to death that death whose 
beginning was sin mans sin and the sin of the world 
the world as the original lie was whispered became in mans 
heart gods foe the world which should have opened mans heart to 
god began instead to drive god out of the human heart and even 
though the tempter has repeated from the beginning you will be 
like god cf gen 35 this world is never able to offer man in 
the end anything more anything other than death 
in the world you have tribulation but be of good cheer that 
world which is the theatre of mans historycarries the marks of 
his energies his tragedies and his triumphs gaudium et spes 2 
the worldthe scene of mans many tribulations has fallen into 
the bondage of sin ibid and so often calls this very bondage its 
freedom the world called into existence out of love and kept in 
existence by its creator by christ on the cross freed by the 
power of his death and revealed anew through his resurrection as 
the divine cosmos cf ibid 
man of our time man living immersed in the world thinking that 
you have mastered it whereas you may well be its victim christ 
frees you from every form of bondage to set you upon the way to 
victory over self to love that is constructive and aims for the 
good a love that is demanding that makes you build up and not 
destroy your tomorrow your family your environment and all of 
society 
man of our time only the risen christ can fully satisfy your 
irrepressible yearning for freedom after the horrors of two world 
wars and all the wars which in these last fifty years often in the 
name of godless ideologies have reaped a harvest of victims and 
sown hatred in so many nations after the years of dictatorships 
which have deprived men and women of their basic freedoms the true 
dimensions of the spirit have been discovered anew those 
dimensions which the church has always promoted by revealing in 
christ mans true stature 
today as well the reawakening of many democracies is leading to 
dialogue and trust between peoples and the world is coming to 
understand once again that man cannot live without god without the 
truth that in him makes him free cf jn 832 
man of our time christ sets you free from selfishness to call 
you to a spirit of sharing and to a ready and joyful commitment to 
others i have been in africa in the sahel and i have seen the 
sand burying villages drying up wells burning the eyes turning 
children into skeletons paralyzing the strength of the young as 
it brings desperation starvation sickness and death death from 
hunger and thirst man of today wealthy nations of the 
civilisation of opulence do not be indifferent to this great 
tragedy be ever more urgently resolved to help those peoples who 
struggle each day for survival let yourselves be convinced that 
there can be no freedom where misery continues to exist 
let human and christian solidarity be the challenge that 
provokes your conscience to make that sand slowly give way to the 
advancement of human dignity an abundance of bread and the return 
of laughter employment hope and progress yet i thank god that i 
have also seen volunteers individuals associations and 
institutions priests religious laity of various professions 
committing themselves and making sacrifices for the good of their 
brothers and sisters who are most lonely and most sorely tried i 
thank them in the name of the crucified and risen lord 
man of our time christ frees you because he loves you because 
he has given himself for you cf gal 220 because he has won 
victory for you and for all people

prices on the tokyo stock exchange dropped sharply 
in thin trading today as the dollar surged against the japanese 
yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average the tokyo exchanges main 
index fell 75074 points or 257 percent to 2846318 only 230 
million shares changed hands on the exchanges first section down 
from 320 million shares on friday 
masahiro umemori an analyst for nomura securities said a 
sprinkling of sell orders during the day over thin trading forced 
down the nikkei index 
he said many participants stayed on the sidelines awaiting the 
release of us economic indicators including the consumer price 
index due out on tuesday and february trade statistics on wednesday 
as a result he said no one wants to do any buying 
traders said the weakening yen also discouraged market 
participants 
dealers and news reports earlier in the day said the nikkeis 
fall was related to arbitrage selling of spot issues but umemori 
said arbitrage had only a slight impact on the market 
in arbitrage trading which has been frequently blamed for 
recent drops in the tokyo stock exchange traders attempt to profit 
from price differences between the spot and futures markets 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 15942 yen up 100 
yen from fridays close of 15842 yen the us currency stayed in 
a narrow range between 15900 yen and 15945 yen after opening at 
15915 yen 
an analyst with new japan securities speaking on condition of 
anonymity said many currency traders also were awaiting us trade 
statistics 
there is particularly strong sentiment on the market that the 
trade results will be good so dealers are trying to attain long 
or strong positions in the dollar the dealer added 
a trade report saying the united states had further decreased 
its trade deficit is likely to strengthen the dollar on currency 
markets 
in the bond market benchmark no 119 10year government bonds 
closed at 8574 points down from 8590 at fridays close their 
yield rose to 7415 percent from 7380 percent

a man who flew into a rage at a surgeon after 
learning his father had died on the operating table returned with a 
gun and opened fire in an emergency room killing two people and 
wounding two police and witnesses say 
bradford warren powers jr 46 was being held today for 
investigation of murder and attempted murder in the rampage 
saturday at mission bay memorial hospital 
he surrendered to police shortly after the shooting spree in 
which a nurse and a medical trainee were killed and a doctor and a 
patients father were wounded 
the elder powers had suffered an abdominal aneurysm and required 
emergency surgery but his son had told doctors not to operate 
saying the 75yearold wouldnt survive the surgery because of his 
age and condition said dr harry henderson hospital chief of 
staffelect 
but henderson said the man would have died without the 
operation he said the surgery was successful but the elder powers 
who suffered from heart and lung ailments died on the operating 
table of cardiac arrest 
people who were in the emergency room when powers was told by a 
surgeon that his father had died said the son became enraged 
the surgeon came out to talk to him and he got irate he was 
stomping around said pj ginsburg who was being treated for 
burns he started to yell what the hells wrong with you why 
didnt you treat him the first time 
the elder powers had been taken to the emergency room the night 
before for an unrelated ailment and released henderson said

gunman was aiming at him 
he didnt look like a crazy man said mowrer who was 
wounded when he tried to run

avoid him i guess i thought i was giving him a smaller target i 
didnt even know i was shot i fell to the ground

police said the fifth slaying in five weeks of a 
cabbie in the bronx is not the work of a serial killer suspected in 
three of the shootings but that did little to calm drivers fears 
i want to stop driving this month said aleou gueyes a 
driver for four years who manages uptown car service in the bronx 
i can drive a truck 
the latest victim rafael montes de oca 38 was found slain 
saturday night the fifth time since march 7 that a cab driver had 
been fatally shot in the head at close range in the bronx all five 
had been robbed of cash 
police have said one man using a 22caliber handgun was 
responsible for the first three shootings that person phoned three 
bronx car services and requested cabs then shot and robbed the 
drivers 
in the fourth shooting last tuesday a driver who picked up a 
fare on the street was shot and died the next day witnesses saw 
two teenagers flee that car police said that case was unrelated 
to the first three 
police also said the killing of montes de orca appeared 
unrelated to the first three 
there are certain consistencies in the other cases which are 
not present in this one said lt james malvey precinct 
commander we became convinced there is no connection 
mayor david dinkins offered a 10000 reward on thursday for 
information leading to the killers 
the guardian angels announced that a member of the group would 
begin riding with drivers for two car services on their overnight 
runs sunday night 
we look upon these car services as the lifeline in these 
communities said lisa sliwa a leader of the crimefighting 
group known for its red berets without them theres no way for 
people like nurses who work late to get around 
cabbies said they are being choosier about their passengers and 
companies are having trouble keeping drivers as they quit or refuse 
to work nights 
ten to 15 percent of seaman car services 350 drivers no longer 
work late hours said luz rivera a dispatcher at the company where 
the latest victim worked 
gueyes said he sizes up his fares and refuses to take more than 
one person for fear of being outnumbered sometimes when i see 
the people if they dont look right i keep on going he said 
i try not to think about it but its always on your mind 
said miguel reyes of amigo car service a cab driver for 11 years 
on saturday a customer who gave his name as george called 
seaman car services and asked for car 215 montes de ocas car 
rivera said i told rafael and he said tell him ill be there 
in 10 minutes 
more than an hour later a caller reported the driver appeared 
either unconscious or dead seaman president rafael peralta said 
montes de oca had a pregnant wife and four children police said

nasa says it has completed the 
trickiest part of preparations for the second attempt to launch 
space shuttle discovery with the hubble space telescope 
the space agency on saturday removed a faulty auxiliary power 
unit that forced a scrub of discoverys launch last tuesday a new 
unit was installed sunday the first time the procedure has been 
performed at the launch pad 
also on saturday discoverys payload bay doors were opened and 
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries were removed for recharging 
at a laboratory the 130hour recharging began around noon sunday 
nasa took the batteries to the lab because they can be recharged 
at a cooler temperature there than at the launch pad and thus 
retain more power 
nasa spokesman george diller said the weekend operations were 
the trickiest part of preparation for the second launch attempt 
discovery is scheduled to lift off with the 15 billion 
telescope the space agencys most expensive payload on april 25 
right now everything seems to be in the bag for a week from 
wednesday diller said 
the shuttles three auxiliary power units which weigh 88 pounds 
each pressurize the hydraulic system used for braking and 
steering all power units must be operating properly for a safe 
launch 
once in orbit the telescope will enable astronomers to study 
stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling 
toward earth for 14 billion years

in her native country greta garbo was 
remembered with pride today as an actress whose charisma made her 
the worlds best known swedish emigrant 
i do not know what it was that made everybody turn around and 
keep looking at her when we entered a restaurant garbos 
longtime friend mimi pollack said on swedish national radio 
ms pollack and garbo were fellow students at stockholms royal 
theater school in the early 1920s ms pollack said they had not 
been in touch since garbo fell ill this winter 
swedish film professor leif furhammar said he remembered her as 
a someone who walks down the stairs in such a way that you cannot 
take your eyes off her 
torsten jungstedt a swedish film critic told the swedish 
national news agency tt that garbos face was perfect for film 
it was a close shot face with an enormous amount of life in it 
photographers said it had a light of its own he said 
garbo died sunday in a new york hospital she was 84 
she grew up in soder a workers district in southern stockholm 
director mauritz stiller discovered her at the royal theater 
school stiller and pollack persuaded her to change her name from 
greta gustafsson to greta garbo 
garbo was the first of several swedes who made international

defense secretary dick cheney brushed aside 
soviet complaints that a new bush administration strategic arms 
proposal focuses exclusively on landbased missiles a newspaper 
reported today 
in an interview cheney rebuffed a soviet suggestion that the 
administrations proposal be expanded to constrain seabased 
missiles the new york times reported in todays editions 
looking forward to new arms reductions that would follow a 
treaty to be signed later this year the bush administration has 
proposed a ban on all landbased missiles that carry multiple 
warheads 
the united states has the advantage in sea and bomberbased 
nuclear weapons while the soviet union has more landbased 
missiles 
some senate democrats have argued that the united states should 
tell the soviets it will consider cutting submarine and 
bomberbased weapons after a strategic treaty is completed this 
year 
cheney suggested the soviets despite their complaints might 
agree to the proposal without any guarantees on seabased missiles 
or bomber weapons the newspaper said 
many officials in the bush administration argue there is no need 
to restrict sea or airbased multiple warheads because of their 
comparative invulnerability to preemptive attack multiple 
warheads also are known as mirvs for multiple independently 
targetable reentry vehicles 
the argument for demirving is that landbased missiles make 
attractive targets with mirvs deployed at sea that piece of the 
argument goes away the newspaper quoted cheney as saying in the 
interview conducted last week

the saudi oil minister today 
announced new efforts to bring back into line opec partners 
violating the cartels oil production quotas and driving down 
prices an official report said 
it was the first official saudi reaction to last weeks wild 
swings in oil prices as a result of overproduction by some opec 
members 
the current situation not only harms all producers but 
weakens the chances of the anticipated improvement in oil prices 
during the second half of the current year oil minister hisham 
nazer was quoted as saying today by the saudi press agency 
the official agency said nazer will meet kuwaits oil minister 
sheik ali khalifa alsabah and his united arab emirates 
counterpart mana saeed otaiba in the red sea port city of jiddah 
on tuesday 
he said consultations with other opec states were aimed at 
restoring their production to the allocated ceiling the agency 
reported the kingdom hopes that these contacts will achieve 
their aim of restoring stability to the market 
the uae and kuwait which along with saudi arabia are members 
of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries are 
considered the two main violators of production quotas fixed by the 
cartel saudi arabia is the cartels leading producer 
in november opec set an overall production ceiling of 22 
million barrels a day for the first half of this year but opec 
countries produced about 24 million barrels a day last month the 
nicosiabased middle east economic survey has reported 
that was the highest monthly output since 1981 the respected 
oil industry newsletter said 
the uae has rejected its quota of 11 million barrels a day 
and has been producing double that kuwait has been overshooting 
its quota of 15 million barrels a day by about 300000 barrels 
their overproduction has been a major factor in flooding the oil 
market and thus forcing prices down for the first time in a year 
opecs benchmark price is 18 a barrel based on a basket of 
seven opec crudes 
during the winter prices shot up as high as 22 a barrel at 
times however in the recent slide the widelytraded north sea 
brent oil to which many opec crudes are linked fell below 15 a 
barrel

protesters attacked a secret police office in 
armenias capital with stones and torches over the weekend and one 
demonstrator was killed the official news agency reported 
in the incident a crowd of people broke off from an 
environmental rally in yerevan on saturday night and headed for the 
kgb office in the southern republic tass reported sunday 
tass said the crowd apparently was angered by the arrest of four 
armenians on charges of stealing weapons from a military unit 
the attack lasted about two hours but the crowd was unable to 
get inside the building and eventually dispersed tass said adding 
that kgb officials inside did not open fire 
one person was killed when a homemade grenade he was carrying 
exploded tass said 
one resident said tanks and armored personnel carriers later 
were deployed on the outskirts of yerevan but not inside the city 
eduard shakhnazaryan of the armenian news agency armenpress said 
in a telephone interview today that authorities had every right 
to sanction opening fire and the attackers could have been shot 
like sitting ducks from the rooftop of kgb headquarters but no 
such measure was resorted to 
he said residents believe the attack was provoked by forces 
interested in creating chaos in the city with longreaching 
consequences but he did not elaborate 
shakhnazaryan said none of the attackers was arrested 
alexander arzumanyan a spokesman for the armenian national 
movement said his group believed the attackers were actually 
plainclothes kgb agents circulating at the environmental rally to 
instigate the crowd of hot heads 
the rally began as a protest of the narit chemical complex 
where an explosion occurred earlier in the day and spewed noxious 
fumes into the air arzumanyan said 
vladimir a kryuchkov national head of the kgb on sunday 
called the attack an onslaught by bandits in a message to the 
agencys armenian branch he praised the men inside the building 
for their restraint 
however the postfactum news agency quoting a leader of the 
armenian national movement reported that movement members had 
rushed to the scene and persuaded the protesters to leave 
since armenias strained relations with neighboring azerbaijan 
worsened this winter and armed ethnic clashes grew common 
militants have staged dozens of raids on armenias arms depots to 
obtain weapons to battle azerbaijanis 
attacks against kgb government and party buildings have 
generally increased around the southern soviet union in the past 
year some are aimed at taking arms from police and kgb stocks and 
others have been intended to force political change

nigger creek and dead negro draw 
should be wiped off the texas map says an naacp official working 
to replace those and other racially offensive place names with 
expressions of black pride 
gary bledsoe naacp austin chapter president said he resolved 
to eliminate slurs from the map during an outing two years ago 
when he ran across nigger creek and niggerhead hill within 
an hours drive of the capitol 
i couldnt believe what i saw and how totally offensive that 
was he said recently 
many texas locations were tagged with such names because blacks 
lived there at some point bledsoe is looking to rename 33 places 
there are six negro creeks in texas a negro crossing 
near san angelo and negros liberty settlement negro bend 
and negro gully all in liberty county east of houston 
negro was substituted for nigger in a comprehensive 1962 
name switch by the board of geographic names in reston va the 
board is responsible for deciding which names are used on all maps 
produced in the united states 
but bledsoe said old maps still are in use and official name 
changes dont always alter what places are called 
its horrible the psychological damage that is done by naming 
something like that bledsoe said and these were official 
actions 
he consulted the librarian of the george washington carver 
branch of the austin public library and proposed new names for the 
33 sites identified in a computer search 
some of the suggested names include ebony and freedom 
others honor individuals john jefferson a blackseminole indian 
scout with the us cavalry pianistcomposer scott joplin ada 
smith an austin historian who died recently and milton holland 
the first black texan to win the medal of honor 
bledsoe said he has the support of other texas chapters of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
the travis county commissioners court has worked for months to 
change nigger creek and niggerhead hill to warbler 
creek and warbler hill the proposed names are awaiting a nod 
from the board of geographic names which relies on community 
approval in deciding such requests 
mike igau a white man who owns the two sites said he would 
like to see an end to the names that came with the ranch his family 
bought in 1910 
frankly we never did like the designation anyway but we 
never had anything to do with the naming of it igau said i 
think we need to rename these landmarks if theyre offensive to any 
group or person 
he said the countys proposed names celebrate the rare 
goldencheeked warbler that lives in the region 
but bledsoe wants names that promote black pride there are so 
few state and national treasures that are named in a way that would 
be suggestive of black accomplishments he said 
the board of geographic names usually approves any name with 
overwhelming community support said ernie berringer chief of 
staff for the domestic names committee 
he said the panel tries to avoid common names those of living 
people and names not somehow related to the area 
only two racially offensive geographic names outside of texas 
have been changed in recent years berringer said 
in yellowstone national park chinaman spring is being 
changed to chinese spring

jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said today he 
fully backs the us senate resolution affirming jerusalem as 
israels capital contradicting remarks attributed to him by 
visiting senate republican leader robert dole 
dole also told a sunday news conference at the end of an 
eightday middle east tour that he would tell the senate he now 
opposes the nonbinding resolution which he originally supported 
when it was approved march 22 
i conclude the resolution was illtimed dole said he 
said it was distracting attention in the arab world from the peace 
process 
dole said sunday that kollek agreed the timing was bad and that 
it served no useful purpose 
but kollek said today that the resolution had come up during 
talks with dole in the context of an earlier congressional 
resolution recommending that the us embassy be moved to jerusalem 
despite the earlier resolution the united states like most 
other western nations still maintains its embassy in tel aviv 
kollek said he told dole my concern was that the present 
resolution would not be acted upon by the administration 
he added but this in no way detracts from the importance 
which i attach to this decision of the majority of the senate 
rescinding the resolution now would only encourage arab extremism 
and harm the peace process 
the senate resolution said jerusalem is and should remain the 
capital of the state of israel 
it was enacted shortly after president bush said he objected to 
settling soviet immigrant jews in arab east jerusalem which was 
annexed by israel after it was captured from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
the united states has repeatedly said that the status of 
jerusalem should be negotiated with palestinians who have demanded 
that it be the capital of their wouldbe independent state 
dole also told reporters sunday that the united states has to 
take care of its own homeless before granting israels request for 
loan guarantees to house soviet jewish immigrants 
charity starts at home and that means america the kansas 
republican told the news conference we are going to give 400 
million to israel for housing guarantees when we have 3 million 
homeless in america and no program for them 
others in the senate delegation were james mcclure ridaho 
alan simpson rwyo frank murkowski ralaska and howard 
metzenbaum dohio the group visited egypt syria jordan iraq 
and israel before leaving for washington on sunday

lithuanias leadership today discussed what to do 
about a kremlin threat to cut off crucial supplies to the baltic 
republic for ignoring a deadline to repeal laws that break with 
moscow 
as the 48hour deadline set by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev expired sunday night the republics deputy prime 
minister romualdas ozolas went on lithuanian television to urge 
its 38 million people to brace for a hectic week 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene and members of the cabinet and parliamentary 
leadership discussed a plan of economic measures in the face of 
an embargo by the kremlin vilnius radio said 
such an embargo would include cutting off the supply of oil and 
natural gas that the republic buys only from moscow at subsidized 
prices 
the capital of vilnius was quiet today as the predominantly 
roman catholic republic celebrated the final day of a threeday 
easter weekend most factories and businesses were closed 
according to a worker in the information office of the supreme 
council lithuanias parliament 
the full parliament is to meet tuesday 
ozolas also said that lithuania and estonia planned to exchange 
ambassadors today according to aidas palubinskas of the lithuanian 
parliaments information office 
landsbergis repeatedly has said lithuania would not abandon its 
drive to restore the independence lost when with fellow baltic 
states latvia and estonia it was forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 
gorbachev demanded friday that lithuanias leaders rescind 
anticonstitutional actions promoting independence or face an 
economic embargo that includes canceling conscription into the 
soviet army and seizing communist party property 
the soviet president threatened to cut off products the soviet 
union sells abroad for hard currency if the republics leaders 
failed to act by sunday he did not specify the materials but they 
include oil and gas 
there was no immediate word from the kremlin today on the 
threatened embargo 
in washington on sunday senate leaders of both parties warned 
gorbachev that carrying out his threat could hurt efforts to 
improve trade relations between the united states and moscow 
lithuania declared its independence from the soviet union on 
march 11 and has been locked in tense confrontation with the 
kremlin which has alternated between making threats and 
conciliatory statements 
soviet troops have occupied some buildings in the capital of 
vilnius and conscripts who deserted the red army have been seized 
and beaten gorbachev also demanded that lithuanians turn in their 
firearms and the soviet military asserted itself by sending 
armored personnel carriers through vilnius 
palubinskas said lithuanias factories would be able to function 
for only about two weeks if moscow imposed an embargo 
he said ozolas advised his compatriots to rest up because 
this week doesnt promise to be any less hectic but by next 
weekend well be happy by what weve accomplished 
the spokesman said the lithuanians consider gorbachev to have 
softened his stance appearing to back away from an earlier demand 
that lithuania rescind its declaration of independence 
earlier in the day the leader of lithuanias roman catholics 
told worshipers in vilnius to keep a cool head but stand tough 
a resident said 
speaking at an easter mass with landsbergis sitting in the front 
pew cardinal vincentas skadkevicius urged the population of the 
baltic republic to stay calm said eduard potashinskas of 
lithuanian tv 
in washington senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and minority leader bob dole rkan said retaliation by moscow 
against lithuania would jeopardize a trade agreement president bush 
and gorbachev hoped to sign at a summit in june 
lithuanian officials have acknowledged that an embargo of 
materials such as oil and gas could cause mass layoffs in the 
republic of 38 million people but said they hoped sympathetic 
soviet republics would not cut off crucial supplies 
lines at gas stations in vilnius were a little longer than usual 
on sunday as people reacted to the threat palubinskas said 
besides oil and gas the baltic republic also depends on the 
soviet union for metal machinery chemicals cotton and 
automobiles 
at least four other soviet republics are now controlled by 
progressives who have indicated support for lithuanias bid for 
independence and some lithuanians said they were hoping for holes 
in gorbachevs embargo 
we dont think individual republics will go along with this 
especially republics like azerbaijan and georgia which want 
independence said palubinskas 
prunskiene said the republic had stepped up efforts to establish 
economic ties with the west and was negotiating with west germany 
and switzerland to print lithuanian money in case of an embargo 
the official soviet news agency tass reported saturday 
latvia and estonia are also pressing for independence though 
more cautiously than lithuania on friday they signed an economic 
cooperation agreement with lithuania that promises mutual aid in 
emergencies 
palubinskas voiced confidence that the kremlin would not be able 
to starve lithuania into submission because the republic produces 
more meat and milk than it consumes

in 1988 he won passage of a law that pays 20000 to each 
surviving japaneseamerican interned during the war matsunaga had 
to overcome opposition from some veterans and from those who 
objected to the cost of the bill 
during debate the senator was forced to halt his comments in 
midsentence while telling of an elderly internee killed by a guard 
as he went to pick up a softball 
i myself become overly emotional when i think about it even to 
this day he said after regaining his composure

he also served on the labor and human resources and veterans 
affairs committees 
matsunaga lobbied for 22 years before persuading congress in

so attentive to visiting constituents almost daily matsunaga

room

voters were asked to recall mayor ed munoz 
today for waging a campaign against alcohol abuse that his chief 
critic says has the rest of the country convinced gallup is 
nothing but a town of drunks 
munoz 62 earlier this year threatened to put up billboards 
warning motorists at the arizona line that they were entering the 
nations drunken driving capital the billboard had a car traveling 
on a road paved with skulls 
the rest of the country now thinks this is nothing but a town 
of drunks said linda tilley leader of the recall effort and a 
parttime waitress and bartender at several nightspots 
we have a skid row just like every other city but our problem 
isnt any worse 
munoz who was mayor from 1958 through 1969 and is in the middle 
of his second consecutive twoyear term blamed the recall effort

the supreme court today left intact a ban on 
school dances in a missouri town inhabited largely by christian 
fundamentalists 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the ban 
imposed by public school officials is religiously motivated and 
therefore violates the constitutionally required separation of 
church and state 
the longtime nodance rule in rural purdy mo was upheld by a 
threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals last 
september 
in november the full appeals court voted 54 not to review the 
panels decision but dissenting judges called the ban religious 
tyranny that violates the rights of students wishing to hold 
schoolsponsored dances 
officials are not sure when the ban on school dances was 
adopted but fundamentalist ministers in the town long have 
preached against social dancing calling it satanic and 
sinful 
when the ban was challenged in 1986 ministers from five 
fundamentalist churches led the opposition to its repeal 
more than 250 people attended a school board meeting in march 
1986 and most stood in unison to signify their opposition to 
relaxing the rule 
parents and students who want to change the rule sued and a 
federal judge declared the regulation unconstitutional but the 
ruling was overturned by the threejudge 8th circuit court panel 
the panel in an opinion written by judge george g fagg said 
any arguably religious effect of the rule is indirect remote and 
incidental 
it added the mere fact a governmental body takes action that 
coincides with the principles or desires of a particular religious 
group does not transform the action into an impermissible 
establishment of religion 
the ruling was criticized sharply by four 8th circuit judges who 
later tried unsuccessfully to overturn the panels decision 
judge john r gibson writing for the four said the school 
board was motivated by religious purposes this is a case about 
religious tyranny 
he said in the overall scheme of things a dance at purdy 
high school with an enrollment of 519 may not be of 
earthshattering signficance yet our constitution protects all 
citizens from religious oppression by a majority 
gibson also said the threejudge panel missed the point in 
describing dancing as a secular nonreligious activity the true 
issue in the case is whether the nodance rule has a secular 
purpose he said 
another dissenter chief judge donald r lay said the panel 
ruling could be a devious springboard for further destruction of 
the wall separating church and state 
the missouri school boards association and the missouri 
association of school administrators urged the justices to leave 
the ban intact 
the groups said local school boards should be allowed to 
regulate the extracurricular use of facilities that is neutral 
toward religion and which is consistent with the shared values of 
the communities 
the case is clayton vs place 891348

the supreme court today refused to make new 
york compensate the former owners of a buffalo nursing home forced 
by the state to remain open even though it was losing money 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the states 
ordering the homes owners to keep it open when they wanted to shut 
it down did not amount to a taking of private property 
the constitution allows government through eminent domain to 
take private property for public use but requires that just 
compensation be paid 
at issue in the buffalo case was whether a temporary taking 
occurred when abbott manor nursing homes owners were forced by 
state officials to absorb about 30000 in monthly operating losses 
for three years 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
last june 8 that no taking occurred 
the june ruling overturned lower court decisions that there had 
been a taking and that the state owed abbott manors owners 
542000 
before his death in early 1976 bernard p birnbaum owned and 
operated abbott manor which had some 80 residents at the time of 
his death the home was losing between 20000 and 30000 each 
month 
as coexecutor of his brothers estate saul birnbaum notified 
state officials about bernards death 
the state position was that the home could not be closed because 
no alternate facilities were available 
after failed negotiations with state officials the estate 
announced that all abbott manor residents would be removed by sept 
7 1976 
state officials however obtained a court order blocking the 
homes closing and the removal of its residents two of the homes 
employees were appointed as receivers in charge of operations but 
the birnbaum estate was forced to pay all costs 
the receivership was not ended until sept 14 1979 after all 
abbott manor residents had been placed in other facilities 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the birnbaum family 
argued that requiring a private business to remain in operation 
and to bear substantial operating losses without providing just 
compensation is precisely the kind of harm the constitution 
prohibits

the supreme court today blocked temporarily 
the sales of five hare krishna temples to satisfy a 5 million 
judgment against the religious sect 
the justices granting an emergency request by the krishnas 
ordered the sales postponed until they consider a formal appeal in 
the case 
the krishnas had filed the request with justice sandra day 
oconnor saying emergency help was needed to save their 
religion from destruction 
oconnor referred the request to the full court 
the international society of krishna consciousness and two 
krishna officials were sued successfully by a mother and daughter 
marcia and robin george of cypress calif 
their lawsuit alleged that robin had been brainwashed by the 
krishnas when she was 14 and that krishna leaders conspired to keep 
her away from her parents 
a california jury in 1983 awarded the georges 325 million in 
damages against the krishnas but the award was reduced on appeal 
to 29 million 
with interest the judgment today is estimated to be in excess 
of 5 million 
a state judge last month ordered that five krishna temples 
already placed under court supervision including the religions 
headquarters in los angeles be sold and the proceeds be paid to 
the georges 
four california courts including the state supreme court 
refused to block that order 
the state supreme court refused last novebmer to review the 
award and the krishnas filed an appeal with the nations highest 
court feb 28 
the sales presumably would be unnecessary if the judgment is 
paid before they occur 
lawyers for the georges urging the justices to reject the 
emergency request said no immediate court action is required 
because it will be almost months before the sale of any assets 
can occur 
they added there is no reliable evidence in the record to 
support the krishnas allegation concerning the financial 
hardships which will befall them if the stay is not granted 
miss george and a friend 16yearold caron dempsey visited a 
hare krishna temple in laguna beach calif for the first time in 
1974 at miss dempseys suggestion 
miss dempsey later decided to join the religious sect and 
persuaded miss george to attend meetings at the temple 
by the fall of 1974 miss george was wearing a sari while 
attending school and chanting and praying at a hindustyle altar in 
her bedroom 
according to court documents a krishna official told miss 
george to leave her home and live at a temple she did spending 
time at hare krishna temples in laguna beach san diego new 
orleans and ottawa canada 
the georges lawsuit alleged that krishna officials conspired to 
keep miss george from her parents who learned of her whereabouts 
in late 1975 only after miss dempsey left the religion and told 
them 
in the stillpending appeal filed with the justices in february 
lawyers for the krishnas said the award won by the georges amounts 
to religious bigotry 
for the first time in this country since the antimormon 
frenzy of the 19th century an entire religion stands subject to 
destruction and the confiscation of its property at the hands of 
the state the appeal says 
it adds the proceeding below turned into a trial of what the 
georges counsel called the pernicious evil of the krishna 
consciousness religion and the jury awarded damages 
calculated to bring the religion in this country to an end 
the case is international society for krishna consciousness vs 
robin and marcia george a682

two men convicted of a famous london jewel 
robbery who want to be moved from a british prison to one in this 
country lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that spared the 
us attorney general from adopting rules that could have led to 
the prison transfers 
jerome scalise and arthur rachel are us citizens convicted in 
the 36 million holdup of a london jewelry store in 1980 their 
haul included the famous marlborough diamond 
authorities said the jewels have not been recovered 
scalise and rachel began serving 15year prison terms aug 6 
1984 they are eligible for release in july 1993 
the united states and great britain ratified a treaty in 1985 
that permits prisoners in each nation to be transferred to their 
homeland 
scalise and rachel sued in federal court in the united states 
seeking to compel former attorney general edwin meese iii to 
transfer them home and to adopt guidelines governing prisoner 
transfers between great britain and the united states 
meese and his successor attorney general dick thornburgh 
refused to adopt such rules or grant the wish of the two men to 
return home 
a federal judge ordered the adoption of the guidelines but that 
ruling was overturned last december by the 7th us circuit court 
of appeals 
the appeals court acknowledged that the treaty is intended to 
help rehabilitate prisoners by letting them return to their 
homeland and be closer to family and friends but it ruled that 
such decisions should be left to the attorney general without 
judicial secondguessing

the supreme court today refused to order the 
government to reveal the names and addresses of retired or disabled 
federal workers 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by an 
organization seeking to use the information to recruit new members 
in its campaign for increased benefits for retirees 
the national association of retired federal employees used to 
have an agreement with the federal office of personnel management 
that helped the associations drive for new members 
the agency from 1979 to 1981 permitted the association to send 
information packets to newly retired federal workers through an 
independent mailing service the association was not given the 
names or addresses until recipients of the packets expressed an 
interest in joining 
after the office of personnel management ended the arrangement 
the association sought to obtain the names and addresses under the 
freedom of information act 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the association but the us 
circuit court of appeals here overturned that ruling last july 
the appeals court said revealing the names and addresses of 
retired and disabled workers would violate their privacy 
the appeals court said that if the association is allowed to 
have the names there would be no basis under the freedom of 
information act to withhold the names from others who seek them 
any business or fundraising organization for which such 
individuals might be an attractive market could get from the 
government at nominal cost a list of prime sales prospects to 
solicit the appeals court said business people will not 
overlook an opportunity to get cheaply from the government what 
otherwise comes dearly 
by contrast the appeals court said the retirees association 
failed to show there is a public interest in revealing the names 
and addresses even a modest privacy interest outweighs nothing 
every time the appeals court said 
the association said the appeals court misinterpreted the 
freedom of information act a 1966 law aimed at curtailing 
government secrecy the association said congress intended that 
such lists be provided unless release would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of privacy 
justice department lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
associations appeal 
the case is national association of retired federal employees 
vs newman 891098

greta garbo the huskyvoiced swedishborn 
screen legend who turned her back on hollywood in 1941 to live 
according to her bestremembered line i vant to be alone is 
dead at 84 
the reclusive garbo died sunday said andrew banoff spokesman 
for new york hospital at her familys request banoff gave no 
other information except that donations should be made to a kidney 
treatment center at the hospital 
ben buttenweiser who lived in an apartment below garbos said 
the actress had undergone dialysis treatment 
with her sculpted beauty garbo first gained attention in silent 
films when talkies came along hollywood worried that her accent 
and throaty voice would end her career but they only enhanced her 
appeal and she became an international sensation with such films 
as anna christie mata hari grand hotel and queen 
christina 
she reigned in hollywood in the 30s public response to her 
face and her lithe figure in silky halter gowns was so frenzied 
that the phenomenon had a name garbomania some critics 
considered her the finest screen actress of all time 
but garbo disliked the attention and quit at age 36 her 24 
films keeping her name alive for generations 
while camille and ninotchka became film festival 
standards the woman known worldwide simply as garbo remained 
practically shuttered in her manhattan apartment where she moved 
after becoming a us citizen in 1951 or in various retreats in 
france and switzerland 
when she traveled she slipped in and out of airports in dark 
glasses and a slouch hat garbo watchers would wait hours 
outside her apartment hoping to catch a glimpse of her 
photographers who stalked her occasionally stole a quick shot of 
the face 
in grand hotel one of her lines was i vant to be 
alone legend has it she used it on reporters who dogged her but 
she denied it telling a friend she actually had said i want to 
be let alone 
nominated four times for an academy award she didnt win until 
1955 when the academy gave her a special oscar for a series of 
luminous and unforgettable performances garbo did not appear to 
collect it 
as an actress and as a person she had this very special thing 
about her that i think sort of set her apart actor jimmy stewart 
said it was a combination of the way she looked her voice and 
the beautiful way she moved 
she was always a living unreachable myth the founder of a 
religious order called cinema italian director federico fellini 
said 
she gave cinema the sacredness of mass he told the italian 
news agency ansa 
she never married but rumors of her love affairs with rich and 
famous men were abundant over the years she was linked with actor 
john gilbert maestro leopold stokowski and russianborn 
entrepreneur george schlee 
in comments published in life magazine in 1989 garbo described 
herself as a sour little creature 
i dont want any kind of attention from anybody except that i 
know that someone likes me and thats nice otherwise its 
sickening she said 
in the rare interviews she gave she said you cheapen 
yourself in telling others your private joys and sorrows she 
said she preferred to let her work speak for itself 
neighbor buttenweiser who said he knew garbo for 35 years said 
he sometimes discussed world developments with her but that she 
would not talk about her film career 
carl peterson a doorman in her building said he last saw her 
last week she had gray hair and was very thin she looked very 
pathetic he said 
born greta lovisa gustafsson in stockholm garbo was the 
daughter of an uneducated laborer who was often ill or unemployed 
after her father died when she was 14 she left school and earned 
25 a month as a department store clerk 
while clerking she was chosen to appear in a filmed hat 
advertisement the 17yearold was stagestruck and enrolled in 
stockholms royal dramatic theater academy she won several small 
parts the first in a 1923 comedy peter the tramp 
her big break came when mauritz stiller then swedens leading 
director made her his protege changed her name to garbo and cast 
her as the star of his 1924 movie the saga of gosta berling 
at first sight of garbo on film stiller said her face you 
only get a face like that in front of a camera once in a century 
stillers film caught the attention of hollywood tycoon louis b 
mayer who offered the director a contract at mgm stiller agreed 
on condition garbo be signed too 
for her first talking picture the studio cast her in anna 
christie which called for an accent publicity slogans 
proclaimed garbo talks 
later the comedy ninotchka prompted marquees across america 
to blaze garbo laughs but her next attempt at a humorous role 
in twofaced woman flopped and garbo announced her retirement 
film buffs can recite her first lines on camera gimme a 
viskey ginger ale on the side and dont be stingy baby 
a millionaire through wise investing garbo who reportedly was 
earning 250000 to 300000 a picture by the 1930s had no need 
to work again and never did 
a health buff she was rarely ill 
the hospital spokesman said he didnt know who the family

president corazon aquino confirmed 
today that british troops are training filipino security forces 
after renegade officers promised to attack what they called british 
mercenaries in the army 
last week the young officers union a shadowy group believed 
linked to decembers failed coup claimed british mercenaries were 
training philippine forces in a clear violation of philippine 
sovereignty 
asked about the claim mrs aquino said there were no 
mercenaries training her forces 
however there is a team of british military engaged in 
training the psg presidential security group on military 
activities and this was done at the request of the philippine 
government she added 
the british embassy was closed today for the easter holidays 
the presidential security force guards mrs aquino and foreign 
dignitaries 
the union warning was the first directed against the british 
since the dec 19 failed coup in which 113 people were killed and 
more than 600 wounded 
rebel soldiers have frequently warned the united states to avoid 
meddling in philippine affairs after us jets flew air cover 
for government forces during the coup attempt 
the failed coup was the sixth and bloodiest bid so far to oust 
mrs aquino 
a fugitive exarmy officer suspected of playing a leading role 
in decembers coup attempt said in an interview that mutineers gone 
into hiding will not surrender until this government shapes up 
former lt col gregorio honasan did not specify what changes he 
wanted but criticized alleged corruption and incompetence 
it the december coup attempt may have failed tactically or 
it may have been a setback tactically but you have to agree that 
just like august in 1987 it has really jolted this administration 
into for once setting directions honasan said 
thats all we ask honasan added and then we can probably 
surrender and then you can save on the 5 million on my head 
honasan said in an interview for the us cable news network 
portions of the interview were carried today by the manila times 
newspaper and a private television station channel 7 
he was referring to the 5 million peso 227000 reward offered 
by the government for information leading to his arrest 
honasan initially supported mrs aquino when she came to power 
during the 1986 people power revolution 
mrs aquino dismissed honasans statement saying he was merely 
repeating criticism of her government that he has made since 
breaking away 
in another development the military announced today that 18 
more communist rebels were killed in an air assault on 300 new 
peoples army guerrillas who surrounded a 100man army patrol 
friday on the central island of negros 
the latest casualties bring to 81 the number of rebels killed 
since the military launched an offensive on march 29 the 21st 
anniversary of the founding of the new peoples army said brig 
gen raymundo jarque the negros military commander 
no casualties on the government side were reported 
the new peoples army the military wing of the outlawed 
communist party has been waging an insurgency to establish a 
marxist state in the philippines

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether workers may sue in state courts when they allege their 
employers fired them to avoid paying pension benefits 
with millions of dollars at stake the court said it will use a 
texas case to decide whether such state lawsuits are precluded by a 
federal law protecting pension benefits 
the court is expected to rule sometime in 1991 
the justices agreed to hear an appeal by ingersollrand co 
which was sued by fired sales representative perry mcclendon 
mcclendon was transferred by the company from san antonio to 
dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market there for the companys 
construction equipment he was fired on nov 19 1982 four months 
before his 10th anniversary with the firm 
a worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his 
pension vested meaning the employer must contribute to the 
employees retirement benefits 
mcclendon sued in state court in texas accusing ingersollrand 
of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits the company said it 
dismissed him to reduce its workforce and save money 
the federal employee retirement income security act of 1974 
erisa protects workers pension rights 
but mcclendon did not sue in texas courts for lost pension 
benefits in fact shortly after he sued the company agreed to 
vest his pension 
mcclendon sought a potentially bigmoney judgment for lost 
future wages mental anguish and punitive damages 
the texas supreme court last october overruled lower state 
courts and revived the lawsuit ordering a trial 
many states accept the principle that an employers ability to 
fire a worker at will is limited by public policy the state court 
said for example the state court said workers may claim they 
were fired illegally because of sex race or age discrimination or 
for exercising their collective bargaining rights 
we hold that public policy favors the protection of integrity 
in pension plans and requires in this case an exception to the 
employmentatwill doctrine the state court said 
mcclendon is entitled to damages if he can prove he was fired 
because ingersollrand wanted to avoid paying pension benefits the 
state court said 
the us chamber of commerce and other business groups urged the 
us supreme court to overrule the texas court and hold that the 
federal pension law preempts such lawsuits 
the chamber of commerce said lawsuits by fired workers against 
their former companies already have mushroomed 
the organization cited one study showing the national average 
for damage awards based on wrongful firing rose from 227280 in 
1986 to 311332 in 1987 
allowing fired employees to sue over the pension issue will 
prompt thousands of additional suits that could be devastating to 
american business the chamber of commerce said 
it noted that the aging of the socalled babyboom generation 
already poses a threat to the financial stability of pension plans 
if the texas court ruling is upheld the chamber of commerce 
said at the same time that pension plans are being put to their 
most stringent financial tests thousands of employees who are 
about to vest in their pension rights will be able to bring 
lawsuits for wrongful discharge seeking extensive compensatory 
and punitive damages 
the case is ingersollrand vs mcclendon 891298

king birendra today bowed to a 
groundswell for further democratic reform and asked a veteran 
opposition leader to be prime minister of an interim government 
the opposition party announced 
earlier today birendra announced the resignation of prime 
minister lokendra bahadur chand and the dissolution of the 
partyless legislature 
the developments ended a week of political deadlock that ensued 
after the king yielded on april 8 to demands that a 29yearold ban 
on political parties be banned that move came two days after a 
bloody clash between troops and prodemocracy demonstrators that 
left as many as 200 people dead 
krishna prasad bhattarai the prime ministerdesignate and 
acting president of the longbanned nepali congress party said he 
will present a cabinet on tuesday 
bhattarai also said king birendra indicated during a meeting 
today with opposition leaders that he will look favorably upon the 
idea of becoming a constitutional monarch foresaking the 
nearabsolute power he has wielded for his 18 years on the throne 
there was no immediate comment from the palace 
bhattarai told reporters he was surprised by the offer to become 
prime minister 
its a very very challenging task for which i was not at all 
mentally prepared he said i do not know to what extent i 
shall be able to do something for all those who have given their 
lives for the cause of democracy 
an earlier statement issued by the nepali congress said king 
birendra first offered the prime ministers job to ganesh man 
singh supreme leader of the party singh 75 declined citing 
poor health 
singh said general elections for a new rashtriya panchayat or 
national assembly would be conducted before april 1991 the 
balloting would be the first multiparty election in the himalayan 
kingdom in three decades 
bhattarai said his government will include members of the united 
left front a coalition of communist groups that had joined the 
nepali congress in the people power movement 
also today a youth gang set fire to a movie theater ticket 
office and stoned another empty cinema prompting the capitals 
four other theaters to close riot police were deployed but no one 
was reported injured 
it was not immediately clear why the gang targeted the movie 
theaters located 500 yards from the royal palace 
witnesses said the attackers were members of mandale a 
secretive group that had supported the royal family before 
switching allegiance to national assembly members who were upset at 
losing their jobs 
in a royal proclamation on government radio today king birendra 
announced chands resignation and the dissolution of the rashtriya 
panchayat or national assembly conceding the two major 
preconditions of prodemocracy leaders for joining an interim 
government 
in view of the events that have taken place in certain parts 
of the country the peoples aspirations and the ideals of 
democracy we have been making political changes birendra said 
chand had been named prime minister april 6 replacing a 
hardliner in one of the kings last moves to try to contain the 
growing prodemocracy movement but demonstrators were not 
satisfied 
a few hours later police unleashed the bloodiest crackdown in 
nepals modern history witnesses said as many as 200 protesters 
were killed as thousands marched on the palace the government put 
the death toll at 10 
this is progress in the right direction yog prasad 
upadhyaya secretarygeneral of the nepali congress said of 
birendras announcement which came eight hours after talks between 
chand and leaders of the 7weekold prodemocracy movement broke 
down 
the collapse spurred a violent protest by hundreds of 
demonstrators who had gathered outside the academy where the talks 
were held cars belonging to chand and foreign minister pashupathi 
rana were destroyed and demonstrators initially refused to allow 
the politicians to leave 
three times during sundays talks protesters had burst through 
the gates of the academy demanding the government give in to the 
opposition 
birendras father king mahendra banned political parties in 
1961 after two years of westernstyle party government headed by 
the nepali congress mahendra dismissed the government accusing it 
of corruption and inept administration 
since then the king has shared power with a largely 
rubberstamp national assembly the monarch nominated onefifth of 
the assemblys 140 members and according to poitical observers 
approved the nominations of the others standing for election 
observers say the current campaign is succeeding because of a 
growing belief among the countrys 17 million people that genuine 
democracy may help nepal to counter widespread poverty 
the picturesque kingdom is one of the poorest countries in the 
world and has a per capita yearly income of 150 only 25 percent 
of the population can read and write and 11 percent of all babies 
die before the age of one year

members of the national commission on aids 
got a firsthand look at the problems of rural aids patients today 
as they visited patients and health care workers in southern 
georgia 
theyre trying to learn whatever problems they aids 
sufferers face getting treatment in rural areas said commission 
spokesman thomas brant who was traveling with the 11 members 
making the trip 
aids victims in many rural areas have to travel long distances 
for medical care and are often treated as outcasts by those who 
think of the disease as a big city problem health officials and 
activists say 
the panel planned to attend briefings and meet with aids 
patients doctors and health officials in waycross albany and 
macon 
in the country aids still is sometimes a dirty word said dr 
ted holloway director of a 16county health district in 
southeastern georgia 
theres a big stigma about being gay or being a drug user 
or being hiv positive he said 
weve had people lose their jobs and get kicked out of their 
apartments theres a lot of selfblame people become totally 
dependent on their families living in fear about how people will 
react to their disease 
holloway said some patients are afraid to tell the truth to 
their insurance companies and instead try to pay for expensive 
tests and drugs out of their own pockets 
a spokesman for rainbow partners a yearold support group in 
waycross said rural residents tend to think of aids as a big city 
problem 
they see it on tv and say we dont have that here they 
have the attitude its just a bunch of homosexuals and drug 
addicts said the spokesman who identified himself only as 
charles once they meet someone who had aids it becomes 
personalized and changes their attitudes 
of the 3488 aids cases reported in georgia since january 1987 
the eightcounty atlanta area had 2549 holloways district was 
second with 237 cases his district about the size of the state of 
massachusetts has a population of 275000 and includes the city of 
savannah 
we dont have large gay communities like the big cities 
holloway said its been hard to mobilize community activities 
because we dont have that leadership from the gay community 
people are just beginning to realize the problems we face 
health officials are concerned that a syphilis epidemic in 
georgia foretells a surge in aids cases in years to come the 
epidemic is believed to be linked to the practice of trading sex 
for crack in southeastern georgia syphilis cases jumped from 48 
in 1984 to 500 last year 
weve talked to hivpositive crack addicts who are having sex 
with 30 or 40 people a month holloway said theres just got 
to be transmission occurring 
holloway said rural areas need money for aids and drug treatment 
programs and for drugs such as azt that can prolong the life of 
people infected with the hiv or aids virus 
dr paul white district health director in southwestern 
georgia which has had 97 reported aids cases in three years said 
poor people from albany have to make a 350mile round trip to the 
aids clinic at atlantas grady hospital once a month for treatment 
and a supply of drugs 
the aids commission made up of scientific and legal experts 
was created by congress in 1988 to coordinate the federal attack on 
aids

defendant keith mondello organized the white 
gang that surrounded and killed a black teenager last summer a 
prosecutor said today at the opening of the trial of two men 
charged in that attack 
the death of yusuf hawkins raised racial tensions in a city that 
was then in the middle of a mayoral campaign 
the evidence in this case is going to show you that an unarmed 
16yearold boy who went with three friends to look at a used car 
was surrounded and killed by a gang organized by this defendant 
assistant district attorney james kohler told the jury 
the case against codefendant joseph fama 19 allegedly the 
triggerman in the murder of 16yearold hawkins was scheduled to 
start later in the day in the same courtroom but lawyers said fama 
was sick with the flu and the opening of that case was in doubt 
fama 19 and mondello 20 are the first of eight white men 
from the largely italian bensonhurst section of brooklyn to go on 
trial in the fatal shooting aug 23 of hawkins 
two juries sitting sidebyside were chosen for their 
simultaneous trials to speed justice 
a mob of 30 or more men who attacked hawkins after he ventured 
into bensonhurst with three friends to check out a used car for 
sale 
the judge state supreme court justice thaddeus e owens 
ordered two juries to hear evidence in the same courtroom rather 
than hold separate trials for fama and mondello to save time 
many in the bensonhurst mob which prosecutors recently revealed 
included a black man were armed with baseball bats the group had 
gathered in a schoolyard to protect their turf from outsiders 
fama and mondello are charged with murder riot assault 
menacing and other crimes they could get 25 years to life in 
prison on the murder charge

escaped from a privately run prison across from the police station 
after one of them pulled a gun on a guard authorities said 
five federal agencies plus mexican texas and local officials 
were searching today for the men who escaped sunday evening they 
include mario alberto salinas trevino who federal authorities 
allege masterminded one of the largest drugsmuggling and 
moneylaundering rings between texas and mexico 
police said the three men may be heading to mexico and are 
considered armed and dangerous at its closest point the border is 
about 100 miles away 
salinas 37 was among 25 people arrested in march 1989 in a 
drug operation dubbed operation jet set 
us marshal bill jonas said 10 million was seized from salinas 
then and hes suspected of having up to 10 million in drug money 
stashed in a hideaway either in texas or mexico 
prosecutors charge that between 1983 and 1989 a drug ring 
salinas helped run was responsible for transporting more than 
46000 pounds of marijuana and 1900 pounds of cocaine the ring 
allegedly distributed the drugs throughout texas pennsylvania 
california illinois florida and massachusetts 
the ring also is accused of laundering of more than 76 
million using financial institutions in san antonio and roma 
texas and san ysidro calif to launder narcotics profits 
jonas identified the other inmates as charlie edward compton 
58 and juan chapa garza 44 compton was awaiting trial on federal 
charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute chapa 
was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute 
the charges were not related to the jet set probe 
compton and salinas are us citizens jonas said he wasnt 
sure about chapas nationality 
the three were cellmates at the central texas parole violators 
facility a minimum to mediumsecurity prison in the old bexar

overpowered another guard on the ground floor before seizing the 
security control panels and opening a door jonas said they fled 
on foot 
according to police reports san antonio police werent notified

escaped 
but wackenhut spokesman pat cannan said police were notified 15 
to 20 minutes after the jail break by the guard on the ground 
floor who was tied up outside 
it took him about 15 to 20 minutes to get unloose and he ran 
straight across the street to the police department cannan said 
that was the proper thing to do 
jonas said he had no indication that wackenhut had delayed the 
reporting unneccessarily 
wackenhut officials speculate the pistol was smuggled into the 
prison during easter day visiting hours cannan said he spoke in a 
telephone interview from coral gables jonas said the gun was 
believed to be a 25caliber

rebel inmates started a fire at 
strangeways prison early today and three more prisoners 
surrendered suffering from suspected food poisoning prison 
governor brendon ofriel said 
the last seven prisoners still holding out may have eaten food 
gone bad in the 16day siege or even rat poison scattered in the 
aging building ofriel said 
one inmate became so sick overnight with suspected food 
poisoning that other inmates asked prison staff to take him to 
hospital and two others surrendered saying they felt unwell 
ofriel said 
it is possible these three prisoners are suffering from some 
form of very serious food poisoning maybe salmonella he told 
reporters 
for some time we have been concerned about the state of their 
food supplies and we have become increasingly worried that they may 
have been eating contaminated food or water ofriel told 
reporters 
prison officers went into the prison about 220 am when heavy 
smoke was seen billowing from the building but the fire was 
considered doused at 315 according to a home office spokesman 
there was a danger to life both to the prison officers who 
went in to fight the fire and to the inmates said the spokesman 
who spoke anonymously in line with british custom there was no 
word of any casualties he said 
ofriel appealed to the last seven rebels to surrender urging 
them not to let the siege end in some sort of tragedy resulting 
from food poisoning or other illness 
the inmates stockpiled large amounts of food before more than 
1500 inmates at the 900capacity prison rioted on april 1 
however they have no refrigeration in the wing they are occupying 
on sunday the rebels displayed a large sign saying we was 
coming down today but because some of the boys departing last week 
got broken arms and legs we are staying one more week 
authorities categorically denied violence had been used against 
surrendering inmates 
one prisoner accused of sexually assaulting three children died 
from injuries in the rioting and a prison guard died of a heart 
attack several inmates who surrendered earlier claimed they had 
seen dead bodies inside but others insisted there had been no 
deaths 
most prisoners gave themselves up soon after the riot sparked by 
overcrowding in the victorianera facility

the supreme court today left intact a 931000 
libel award won by a former cia deputy director who resigned amid 
allegations of improper business dealings 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by two brothers 
successfully sued by former central intelligence agency official 
max hugel 
hugel sued thomas and samuel mcnell over a july 14 1981 
article published in the washington post under the headline cia 
spymaster accused of improper stock practices 
the mcnells were stockbrokers in the mid1970s when they had 
business dealings with hugel that turned sour 
tom mcnell provided the newspaper with tape recordings of 
telephone conversations with hugel intended to support allegations 
that hugel engaged in illegal securities transactions 
hugel resigned as deputy director of administration at the cia 
after the article appeared 
he sued the mcnells for libel in federal court in new hampshire 
hugels home state hugel did not sue the newspaper 
the mcnells who are from maine dropped out of sight and did 
not emerge until 1987 when they were arrested on federal charges 
of fraud and shipping stolen goods across state lines they pleaded 
guilty and were sentenced to prison 
samuel mcnell has been freed from prison and is living in 
portland ore his brother remains in prison in california 
while the mcnells were in hiding a federal judge in 1984 ruled 
they had defaulted in the libel suit hugel was awarded a default 
judgment of 931000 
the mcnells said they were treated unfairly in the case saying 
they were unaware of the lawsuit until they emerged from hiding 
and thus were denied a chance to show in court that the suedover 
article was true 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld the award last 
year ruling that the trial judge had the authority to grant the 
default judgment 
the mcnells knew that release of the allegedly false 
information would have a devastating impact on hugel and it can be 
fairly inferred that they intended the brunt of the injury to be 
felt in new hampshire where hugel had an established reputation as 
a businessman and public servant the appeals court said 
even if the mcnells defense to the libel claim had merit that 
does not justiify overturning a judgment based on their failure to 
appear in court to defend themselves the appeals court said 
the case is mcnell vs hugel 891270

we would never accept a 48th ranking in sports read one 
protest sign referring to what the teachers say is oklahomas 
ranking among the states in teacher pay the minimum beginning 
salary for a teacher with a bachelors degree is 15060 
ms jewell the crowd around the capitol at more than 10000 and 
said more teachers were expected to arrive in buses later in the 
day other estimates ranged from 5000 to 15000 
the oeas delegate assembly is scheduled to meet friday to 
discuss the teacher walkout 
at that point well decide whats next said karla feeley 
oea spokeswoman of course if the problem is solved before 
friday thatll be another matter but at this point were 
committed for one week 
the teachers are incensed by a state senate vote that killed an 
emergency clause to the school reform and tax bill 
the measure has been the work of an eightmonth special session 
gov henry bellmon called last august to come up with ways to 
improve oklahoma schools 
the emergency clause would have made the measure effective 
immediately 
after the senate voted wednesday to drop the emergency clause 
legislative leaders got the senate to send the bill back to 
committee to keep it from going to bellmon without the emergency 
clause 
the bill would have made number of changes including proposals 
to set greater equity in the way state funds are allocated salary 
increases for teachers a school consolidation plan and a program 
to close schools that dont meet accreditation requirements 
it would have provided an additional 212 million for schools 
that could be used for teacher salaries and other items it also 
proposed 1500 increases in minimum teachers salaries for each of 
the next four years 
much of the opposition stemmed from the supporting tax plan 
which called for a halfcent increase in the states 4cent sales 
tax and increases in corporate and personal income tax 
the oea does not believe the walkout is illegal ms feeley said 
bellmon asked the states attorney general robert henry on 
friday to take all action necessary to prevent illegal disruption 
of the education of oklahoma schoolchildren 
henrys office was researching what steps to take assistant 
attorney general ned bastow jr said last week that a 1981 statute 
makes strikes against a local school board illegal but its not 
clear if the prohibition applies to statewide strikes

supporters of exiled king michael on 
monday yelled back at what they claimed was a governmentsponsored 
rally against the monarchs planned visit to his native land 
several hundred promonarchy demonstrators shouted communists 
go to church and long live the king as they tried to 
prevent an antiking rally in front of government headquarters 
there was some pushing and kicking between the rival groups but 
eventually they dispersed quietly and there were no arrests 
later about 300 supporters of the monarch signed a petition 
they planned to send to the supreme court asking for a visa for 
king michael 
the government in withdrawing the visa has violated the 
helsinki accords on human rights said noni andronescu a 
supporter of king michael 
the 68yearold former monarch was forced to abdicate by a 
sovietinstalled government on dec 30 1947 and now lives in 
switzerland he planned to visit his homeland for 10 days on a 
private trip 
the bucharest government last week revoked micheals visa 
forcing him to cancel what would have been his first romanian visit 
in more than 42 years 
his supporters claim that those opposed to the kings visit are 
former communists backed by the national salvation front 
government the main contender in may 20 elections 
we dont want a king shouted a woman who was among 
approximately 100 people marching down the citys boulevards toward 
the government building to show approval for the visa revocation 
communists in disguise go home or to church its a holiday 
today scores of the exiled monarchs supporters shouted back 
monday is celebrated as the second day of easter in most of europe 
the demonstrators shouted antigovernment slogans and demanded 
that former communists be barred from senior administrative jobs 
for the next 12 years 
police initially stopped the antiking rally from taking place 
later they allowed about 500 demonstrators to enter victory square 
after they displayed a letter stating they had the mayors approval 
to assemble there 
the antiking march had been previously announced on television 
but the other rally was spontaneous said victor alexa one of the 
participants 
those opposed to the monarch accused king michael of not doing 
enough for the nation while it was ruled by communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
there has been no official explanation for the withdrawal of 
michaels visa but some romanians believe interim president ion 
iliescu and premier petre roman both former communists were 
concerned their opponents would earn political mileage from the 
trip 
michael said after ceausecus overthrow in december that he was 
prepared to return to romania as head of a constitutional monarchy 
but indicated that this would have to be subject to a referendum

its director pleaded innocent today to misdemeanor charges alleging 
that photographs in an exhibit of the late robert mapplethorpe are 
obscene 
attorney h louis sirkin entered the plea in hamilton county 
municipal court on behalf of the center and director dennis barrie 
the courts assignment commissioner referred the case for trial 
to municipal judge david albanese and scheduled a pretrial hearing 
april 30 when a trial date may be set the date must be set within 
90 days 
a hamilton county grand jury indicted the gallery and barrie on 
april 7 five of the 175 photos in the exhibit show homosexual acts 
and two show children revealing their genitals 
lawyers filed the pleas about two hours before a scheduled 
arraignment before municipal judge dennis helmick in the hamilton 
county justice center said martin pinales an attorney in the firm 
handling the case 
the exhibit has been drawing large crowds more than 23000 
during its first week and is scheduled to continue through may 26 
before moving on to boston 
hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney handed over prosecution to 
the city of cincinnati last week saying ohio law prohibits him 
from prosecuting misdemeanors 
some city officials accused ney of getting rid of a case too hot 
to handle and too flimsy to prosecute 
we cant dictate to the city solicitor whether or not to 
proceed with the case but we can certainly make our views known 
said councilman peter strauss i personally think they are going 
to have a hard time making a case that the show in its entirety 
lacks artistic value 
fiftynine percent of those who responded to a poll conducted 
for the cincinnati post said they believe the photographs should be 
displayed

the supreme court on monday agreed to consider 
shielding businesses from some bigmoney lawsuits by fired workers 
the justices said they will use a texas case to decide whether 
workers may sue in state courts when they allege their employers 
fired them to avoid paying pension benefits 
business leaders saying millions of dollars are at stake want 
the high court to rule that such state lawsuits are precluded by a 
federal law protecting pension benefits 
the federal law is aimed at assuring workers will get their 
retirement pay state lawsuits potentially are far more lucrative 
because workers can win punitive damages that greatly exceed lost 
pay 
the justices are expected to rule sometime in 1991 
in other action the court 
left intact a ban on dances at public schools in purdy mo 
where most residents are fundamentalists and some believe social 
dancing is satanic 
let stand a 310000 award against los angeles county stemming 
from a county jail inmates 1984 suicide 
left intact a 931000 libel award won by former cia deputy 
director max hugel who resigned in 1981 amid allegations of 
improper business dealings 
refused to make new york compensate the former owners of a 
buffalo nursing home forced by the state to remain open even though 
it was losing money 
in the pensions case the court agreed to hear an appeal by 
ingersollrand co seeking to kill a suit by a fired worker 
the us chamber of commerce and other business groups support 
the appeal they contend the federal employee retirement income 
security act of 1974 erisa has exclusive power to protect pension 
rights and preempts state lawsuits 
the chamber of commerce said lawsuits by fired workers against 
their former companies already have mushroomed the organization 
cited one study showing the national average for damage awards 
based on wrongful firing rose from 227280 in 1986 to 311332 in 
1987 
allowing fired employees to sue over the pension issue will 
prompt thousands of additional suits at a time when many pension 
plans are being burdened by the aging of the socalled babyboom 
generation the chamber of commerce said 
ingersollrand was sued by perry mcclendon who was transferred 
by the company from san antonio to dallas in 1979 to develop a 
sales market there for the companys construction equipment he was 
fired on nov 19 1982 four months before his 10th anniversary 
with the firm 
a worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his 
pension vested meaning the employer must contribute to the 
employees retirement benefits 
mcclendon sued in state court in texas accusing ingersollrand 
of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits the company said it 
dismissed him to reduce its workforce and save money 
mcclendon did not sue in texas courts for lost pension benefits 
in fact shortly after he sued the company agreed to vest his 
pension 
instead mcclendon sought a potentially bigmoney judgment for 
lost future wages mental anguish and punitive damages 
the texas supreme court last october overruled lower state 
courts and revived the lawsuit ordering a trial 
the state court said an employers ability to fire a worker at 
will is limited by public policy for example the state court 
said workers have grounds to sue when they claim they were fired 
because of sex race or age discrimination or for exercising 
collective bargaining rights 
we hold that public policy favors the protection of integrity 
in pension plans and requires in this case an exception to the 
employmentatwill doctrine the state court said 
mcclendon is entitled to damages if he can prove he was fired 
because ingersollrand wanted to avoid paying pension benefits the 
state court said

for two years neighbors in a treelined 
section of this new york city suburb saw what they thought was a 
typical family living in a nice house 
police say the family may have been part of a front for a drug 
factory that polluted the septic system and well of two homes with 
chemicals that may have been used to process cocaine 
they mowed the lawn did the gardening said lt thomas 
johnston commander of the westchester police narcotics unit 
what they did was ruin the neighborhood 
the family paid the rent and all other bills by cash and used 
fake names 
neighbors spotted at least two children but nobody is sure how 
many there were the children were not sent to schools and the 
family was seen only on weekends 
during the week a light was on and no one suspected anything 
they blended in and no one was any wiser said johnston 
no one ever saw deliveries being made said johnston but the 
chemicals probably were brought in in small quantities 
one day last summer they vanished from this westchester county 
town about 30 miles north of manhattan leaving the toxic mess that 
authorities say may cost 100000 to clean up 
when the owners returned last autumn from a twoyear stay in 
japan they found hazardous chemicals in the well and septic tank 
tetrachloroethene acetone toluene and dichloroethene which comes 
from tetrachloroethene 
the chemicals are used for processing cocaine but have 
industrial uses such as for dry cleaning but police say they are 
leaning toward the drug processing theory 
rocco a mastronardi jr assistant county public health 
engineer said his department was checking wells in the area 
where homes range from 300000 to 400000 
samples from the well and septic system taken in march contained 
4000 parts per billion of the tetrachloroethene and 14000 per 
billion of dichloroethene officials said quantities above 5 parts 
per billion are considered hazardous with longterm exposure 
owner max marx and one neighbor have been filtering their well 
water for drinking 
the pollution has seeped to the leaching field and affected 
surface water leading to wampus pond a county recreation area but 
mastronardi said none has been found in the pond itself 
the state says marx is responsible for the clean up 
marx who is trying to get state or federal superfund money to 
help pay said the people who rented his house were very nice 
he said they replaced carpeting rerouted electricity and 
repainted to cover their tracks 
marx who declined to say what he does for a living called the 
evidence of a drug factory circumstantial 
no one has been arrested 
we got started six months in the hole said johnston 
every name they used was fictitious 
drug factories or stash houses for money are not uncommon in the 
metropolitan area suburbs and more people are starting to pay 
attention to suspicious activities by their neighbors said mary 
cooper a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration 
weve seen everything from apartments to farmhouses used 
she said

three sick prisoners surrendered 
monday on the 16th day of a siege at strangeways prison and one of 
the rebels was described as very ill with what was believed to 
be food poisoning 
the prison head brendon ofriel speculated the men were eating 
contaminated food or water in the victorian jail where there have 
been no fresh supplies since a riot april 1 
ofriel appealed for the remaining seven rebels to give 
themselves up 
two of the prisoners who surrendered carried a third inmate on a 
stretcher he was rushed to hospital 
one boy is i am afraid very ill said mary stewart vice 
chairman of the prisons board of visitors he was semiconscious 
when they brought him down he had been hemorrhaging from the 
mouth 
mrs stewart a magistrate and former nurse who has been at the 
prison most of the time since the riot began said all three 
inmates showed the same symptoms 
it is possible these three prisoners are suffering from some 
form of very serious food poisoning maybe salmonella ofriel 
said 
my appeal to the remaining seven is if any of you are feeling 
ill i strongly advise you to come down and let us get you to 
hospital i do not want this to end in some sort of tragedy 
resulting from food poisoning or other illness 
more than 1500 prisoners rioted at the overcrowded prison april 
1 and caused severe damage to the buildings most surrendered in 
the first days but some remained on the loose the number of 
holdouts dwindled day by day to the seven holding out sunday 
the prisoners stockpiled large amounts of food before the riot 
but there was no refrigeration in the wing they were occupying 
the meat they have been eating is now so rotten they cannot 
eat it mrs stewart said adding food cans have been left open 
for 16 days it is very doubtful from where they are getting 
water from 
ofriel said another possibility with an old prison like 
strangeways is that there are areas of the prison where we have 
been trying to prevent a spread of rats and they may have eaten rat 
poison 
earlier monday the rebel inmates started a serious fire but 
there was no indication any of the prisoners were injured 
the prisoners said sunday they would carry on their siege 
another week alleging that fellow rebels who had surrendered got 
broken arms and legs authorities denied the accusation

the bush administration and the national 
wildlife federation clashed before the supreme court monday over 
what it takes to prove an individual has been harmed by opening 
federal lands to commercial development 
the justice department asked the high court to reverse a june 
ruling from the us appeals court for the district of columbia 
the ruling gives environmentalists potentially sweeping power to 
prevent the restricted public lands from being opened to mining and 
mineral exploration 
the appellate ruling said the federation may sue the interior 
department over the governments plans to change the status of 180 
million acres of public land in the west and alaska 
the appellate came after the federation presented affidavits 
from members who said they use some of the land for recreation 
peggy k peterson said the bureau of land managements decision 
to allow mining in the vicinity of south passgreen mountain 
wyo has adversely affected her recreational use and aesthetic 
enjoyment of the federal lands 
in particular the south passgreen mountain area of wyoming 
has been opened up to the staking of mining claims and oil and gas 
leasing an action which threatens aesthetic beauty and wildlife 
habitat potential of these lands she said in an affidavit 
federation spokesman david alberswerth said monday that a high 
court decision against the environmentalists would prevent them 
from challenging reclassification of land initiated by the reagan 
administration in 1985 following a policy instituted by 
theninterior secretary james g watt in 1981 
it will severely constrain the opportunity for environmental 
groups such as ours to take the government to court alberswerth 
said 
the federation said the reagan administration violated the 
federal law by opening the land to development without following 
procedures in the 1976 federal land policy and management act such 
as conducting environmental impact statements 
the issue before the supreme court is whether peterson and the 
federations 45 million members have standing in the case or the 
right to sue based on damage to their recreational use and 
aesthetic enjoyment of the lands 
john g roberts jr of the justice department told the justices 
that peterson and others have been too vague in explaining the harm 
and the specific area where the harm has occurred 
he said they should be required to show damages on specific 
tracts of land where commercial development has been approved

delegates from 17 nations gathered for a white 
house conference on global warming amid criticism monday from some 
participants and environmentalists that the bush administration 
isnt dealing with the problem 
senior administration officials said the united states will call 
for increased international research on both the science of global 
warming and the economic implications of the greenhouse effect 
when the twoday conference begins tuesday 
but as delegates arrived environmentalists chastised president 
bush for not calling for specific actions to ease the global 
warming problem including commitments to make specific reductions 
in greenhouse pollutants 
the sierra club which announced a tv advertising campaign to 
highlight concerns about global warming called the white house 
conference an attempt by the administration to shift the focus of 
the issue away from the need for pollution controls to a debate 
over economic considerations 
its really a smoke screen for the administrations inaction 
on global warming said daniel becker of the sierra club we 
know enough now to begin acting on to curb global warming today 
some conference participants also expressed concern about the 
heavy us focus on more research 
in spite of remaining uncertainties on some aspects of the 
issue an effective response policy must be established now 
without any further delay said a statement issued on behalf of 
the 12 nations attending from the european community 
laurnes jan brinkhorst directorgeneral for the environment of 
the european communitys council of ministers and padraig flynn 
environmental minister of ireland said there was an urgent need 
for an effective response policy while additional research is 
under way 
senior administration officials have reiterated in recent days 
that bush will offer no new policy proposals to curb the manmade 
pollution that scientists agree is causing the earth to warm 
bush in remarks that will open the conference was expected 
instead to focus on the need for additional research to resolve 
both scientific uncertainties about global warming and establish 
clearer estimates on economic costs 
the conference which is being held just days before sundays 
celebration of earth day fulfills a campaign promise bush made to 
hold an international conference on global warming early in his 
presidency 
representatives to the meeting are senior cabinetlevel advisers 
on economics science and the environment from 17 nations 
including the european community japan and brazil 
bush advisers said they hoped the conference would for the 
first time give equal weight to economic and environmental issues 
related to global warming and ensure the economics will be 
injected into all future international forums on the subject 
we hope it will raise the level of debate on the science 
and economics of global change said michael boskin chairman of 
the presidents council of economic advisers and one of the 
conference cochairmen 
a number of european countries including the netherlands and 
west germany have advocated that industrial nations commit to a 
stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 through a variety 
of programs reducing energy needs 
carbon dioxide which is produced in the burning of fossil 
fuels is responsible for about half the greenhouse pollutants 
environmentalists have argued that a wide range of actions could 
be taken to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse pollutants by 
requiring the manufacture of more fuelefficient cars and promoting 
energy savings in other ways in homes and businesses 
the sierra club which has more than 500000 members will take 
that message to the public with a series of public service ads 
featuring actors such as william shatner john ritter and jane 
alexander 
the bush administration has maintained that while there is 
widespread agreement that manmade pollutants are causing the earth 
to warm its not clear how severe the problem will be to warrant 
pollution controls that could have widespread economic impact 
the presidents chief science adviser allen bromley last week 
criticized those who advocate slamdunk solutions to global 
warming 
we cannot sail blindly into the future said bromley 
another conference cochairman 
some computer models have suggested that manmade pollutants will 
cause a 4degree to 9degree fahrenheit increase in global 
temperatures in 60 years as the increasing pollution traps heat 
close to the earth 
however some scientists said those projections are uncertain 
and may not adequately take into account clouds or other factors 
that might have a counteracting effect

the agriculture department said monday it has 
given the goahead for an auburn university scientist to conduct 
field tests of cabbage and broccoli that have been genetically 
engineered to glow 
officials said a permit has been issued to joseph shaw an 
assistant professor of botany and microbiology to begin the tests 
this month in macon county ala 
shaw transferred a set of genes having a code for 
bioluminescence from a marine organism into bacteria that causes 
black rot a major disease of plants in the cabbage and broccoli 
family 
after infecting plants with the luminescent black rot bacteria 
the diseased plant parts will glow allowing scientists to trace 
the progress of the disease through the plant 
one of the benefits of the process will be the observation of 
the diseases progress without destroying the plants shaw said in 
a report released here 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service which issued the permit said a 
review showed the proposed field tests will pose no agricultural 
or human hazard 
in nature the microorganism vibrio fischeri enjoys a 
symbiotic relationship with fish for which it produces light 
the agency said scientists suspect the fish use the glowing 
microorganisms to communicate with each other

dog may be mans best friend but sometimes 
dogs choose other creatures dear or deer as the case may be 
richard faulkners yellow labrador jake has taken up with a 
chummy young buck that showed up in faulkners wooded back yard a 
couple of weeks ago looking hungry and lost 
jake a frisky 3yearold made the deer feel at home sharing 
his water bucket and trying to entice the woodland animal into 
games 
jake must think the deer is a dog and the deer must think jake 
is a deer said faulkner 
the dog tosses a bone into the air hoping the deer will get the 
idea and play along the deer watches closely but doesnt get it 
or just doesnt like that particular game 
he does occasionally hunker down on the ground nosetonose with 
jake faulkner said and when frightened the deer huddles near 
jakes backyard dog house for protection 
i cant understand it and ive thought about it quite a bit 
too said faulkner 59 who retired friday from his job as a 
night watchman at a quarry 
i think both of them are lonely 
the deer follows faulkner to his garden and lets him get within 
5 feet 
i think theres a bond between people and animals he said 
faulkner refuses to make a pet of the animal saying he fears 
that the deer could hurt children in his neighborhood he tried 
scaring the buck off recently but it returned

king birendra on monday asked the 
oncebanned nepali congress party to form an interim government to 
rule until the first free elections in nearly three decades are 
held 
a leader of the party ganesh man singh met with birendra and 
said the king indicated he would give up his wide powers singh 
said after the meeting that parliamentary elections would be held 
within a year 
birendra approved krishna prasad bhattarai as the new prime 
minister pending the vote singh said bhattarai is acting 
president of the nepali congress party 
the events capped a day of political victories for the nepali 
congress party and its ally the sevenparty united left front 
they led nationwide prodemocracy demonstrations that began in 
february 
the palace press secretary was not available for comment 
earlier monday birendra dissolved the nonpartisan national 
assembly and announced the resignation of the 10dayold government 
of prime minister lokendra bahadur chand clearing the way for the 
new interim government 
the concessions followed the kings decision april 8 to lift the 
29yearold ban on political parties in an effort to appease the 
prodemocracy movement which included violent clashes between 
protesters and police 
bhattarai 65 told reporters he will present the names of the 
members of his government to the king tuesday 
a nepali congress statement said birendra first asked singh to 
head the government but the 75yearold leader refused citing ill 
health 
singh then suggested bhattarai as the new government leader and 
the united left front agreed the statement said 
his majesty accepted the suggestion and asked mr singh to 
convey his pleasure to mr bhattarai on his nomination said the 
statement 
it added mr singh repeatedly emphasised the great benefits 
the country shall derive if his majesty very gracefully accepted 
the role of a constitutional monarch of a parliamentary democracy 
singh later said birendra expressed his inclination toward 
changing the country to a constitutional monarchy he did not say 
in explicit terms but favored the idea singh said 
under the present system all executive legislative and judicial 
powers are in the kings hands 
birendra invited singh to the palace after talks between chand 
and opposition groups on forming an interim government broke down 
sunday 
the nepali congress and the united left front who launched 
their movement feb 18 demanded multiparty elections an interim 
government headed by an opposition leader the dissolution of the 
national assembly and a new constitution 
bhattarai said a commission would draft a new constitution 
he added i hope in course of our work with the king there 
will be no use for his special powers those powers will remain 
in force until a new consitution is framed 
he said it was unlikely members of the former national assembly 
would participate in the new government 
bhattarai called his new job a very very challenging task for 
which i was not at all mentally prepared still i am glad that my 
friends and comrades have reposed so much confidence in me for 
which i am thankful to them all 
i still do not know to what extent i shall be able to do 
something for all those who have given their lives for the cause of 
democracy he said 
bhattarai was the speaker of the nepalese parliament during the 
nations only previous experience with westernstyle democracy from 
195960 
birendras father king mahendra dissolved the government led 
by the nepali congress in december 1960 accusing it of corruption 
and incompetence political parties were banned shortly afterward 
thousands of demonstrators stoned chands car sunday afternoon 
and wrecked it during the night outside the royal nepal academy of 
arts and literature 
bhattarai said the new governments first priorities would be 
improving the economy and relations with india 
landlocked mountainous nepal is one of the worlds poorest 
countries 
bhattarai also said his government planned to compensate the 
families of those killed by security forces during the sevenweek 
democracy campaign and reorganize the police force to limit its 
powers 
in a radio broadcast announcing the dissolution of the national 
assembly birendra said in view of the events that have taken 
place in certain parts of the country the peoples aspirations and 
the ideals of democracy we have been making political changes 
there should be a congenial atmosphere where every citizen can 
enjoy democracy and nobody should be forced to do anything which 
can run counter to the expression of freedom

vehicles and killed 43 government troops in the raid two of four 
helicopters taking part in the fighting were destroyed by rebel

department analysts forecast us milk production this year may 
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last years 1443 billion pounds 
the high milk prices of late 1989 and early 1990 have provided

the estimated size of a fuel leak 
near yellowstone national park reached 31000 gallons monday and 
the state considered legal action against the sect that owns the 
leaking tanks 
workers continued to pump out 35 tanks with a capacity of 
634500 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline that were buried during 
the winter by the church universal and triumphant as part of a 
750person fallout shelter complex 
the sect buried the fuel for use after an unspecified global 
catastrophe it believes may occur this spring 
the complex is five miles north of yellowstone national park and 
within several hundred yards of mol heron creek an important 
cutthroat trout spawning stream that runs into the yellowstone 
river 
the estimated size of the spill was increased from 19000 to 
31000 gallons as a result of more accurate measurements but 
officials hadnt ruled out the possibility that more fuel was 
leaking said steve pilcher chief of the state water quality 
bureau 
small amounts of fuel that reached the creek sunday were gone 
monday and no major damage had occurred officials said us fish 
and wildlife service officials took water samples downstream from 
the spill for tests 
the sect owns about 30000 acres in southern montanas park 
county it has sponsored several housing developments in the rural 
remote area and urged its members to build fallout shelters in 
anticipation of a nuclear war or nuclear accident 
but the church says its concern over nuclear holocaust took 
second place to pollution when it discovered last week that three 
tanks were leaking 
this is our home the last thing we want is to have to deal 
with an environmental problem said church spokesman murray 
steinman church spiritual leader elizabeth clare prophet has 
said protecting our ecosystem is more important the our bomb 
shelters 
state health officials met in helena to decide whether to seek a 
court order to make sure the church carries out its plans to dig up 
the 35 tanks and inspect them for leaks pilcher said 
the state may seek an injunction either to guarantee the tanks 
are emptied tested and removed or to halt construction at the 
site he said 
state officials also were attempting to determine if the spill 
violated the states water quality and underground storage tank 
laws pilcher said 
we dont have any idea where that 31000 gallons of fuel is 
pilcher said if we did wed know how dangerous our enemy is 
it could show up anywhere theyre going to have to begin 
digging and follow the contaminated soil until they find it and 
either recover it or get rid of it 
pilcher said the tanks may have ruptured because they were 
installed in frozen soil that shifted when it began to thaw 
by being installed during the winter the tanks are exempt from 
new underground tank regulations that took effect april 1 
church officials decided over the weekend to pump out the tanks 
after the second and third leaks we said thats it were 
going to get all this out of here steinman said 
he said tanker trucks hauled out 110000 gallons of gasoline 
sunday leaving 430000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel to be 
moved 
state officials earlier this year reopened an environmental 
review of church developments near corwin springs saying the 
church concealed construction of the shelter complex during the 
original review completed in march 1989

the bush administration suggested monday that 
delaying action on its central american aid package beyond 
nicaraguas april 25 inauguration would be an affront to incoming 
president violeta chamorro 
i have pledged to mrs chamorro that the united states 
government would respond in nicaraguas hour of need said 
president bush renewing criticism of congressional inaction on his 
800 million aid request for nicaragua and panama 
im disappointed that congress failed to take the final steps 
to make the funds available before the easter recess he told a 
conference at the white house on latinamerican affairs 
at the same time a senior administration said it would be a 
very unfortunate message for the congress to send to mrs chamorro 
not to have this on the presidents desk by her inauguration 
time is wasting to cut this package and reduce it supposedly 
to help some other part of the world would be a historic mistake 
said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity at a 
briefing on tuesdays visit of honduras president rafael l 
callejas 
the package bogged down in congress calls for 500 million for 
panama and 300 million for nicaragua 
however the house increased the package to 24 billion adding 
money for us projects including food stamps disaster relief 
fighting forest fires and veterans programs 
the senate has yet to act on the legislation congress returns 
from its recess later this week and the senate is expected to 
quickly take up the central american aid package 
many members have called for expanding the package to include 
more aid for emerging eastern european democracies 
the administration last week said it would shift some 36 
million in already appropriated funds as a stopgap measure to help 
a joint united nationsorganization of americans states team begin 
the process of demobilizing contra rebels many of the rebels are 
in camps in honduras 
but the senior administration official said there are some 
45000 family members of the resistance who will remain in honduras 
as refugees they want to go home 
bushs 300 million request for nicaragua includes 47 million 
for refugees and resistanze members and families 
if that money is not available the ability of the central 
americans and mrs chamorro to help this process move along is 
going to be crippled it would burden honduras with a burden it 
should not have at this time theyve been very patient for many 
years the official said 
bush told his audience that mrs chamorros inauguration will 
close a painful chapter in nicarguas history and begin a new 
story a new life in democracy 
i believe the united states of america has a great deal at 
stake in the success of violeta chamorro but more so in democracy 
itself in nicaragua bush said

bush administration is examining ideas for 
broad changes in the banking system but is months away from 
deciding on specific proposals officials said monday 
the treasury department has expanded an ongoing study of federal 
deposit insurance to include a look at restructuring the regulatory 
bureaucracy and at mixing commercial banking with the insurance and 
securities industries officials said 
savings and loan legislation enacted last august requires 
treasury to complete the deposit insurance study by february it is 
focused on ways to limit taxpayers liability for the insurance and 
on removing incentives from the system that encourage unwarranted 
risktaking by insured institutions 
administration officials also have long discussed modernizing 
the financial system by relaxing the restrictions that have 
separated commercial banking from the securities business since 
enactment of the 1933 glasssteagall act 
the effort which is being combined with the deposit insurance 
study has been intensified by the prospect of increased 
competition from foreign institutions after the economic 
unification of europe in 1992 
the administration also is reviewing a recent congressional 
report that predicted the savings and loan bailout will fall short 
requiring billions of dollars more from taxpayers 
the treasury department is broadening the study to 
consider other problems in the financial industry the savings and 
loan situation certainly demands attention white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said monday i think its fair to say that 
treasury is looking at the broad regulatory aspects of banking 
officials denied however that the administration was settling 
on a number of controversial proposals reported in mondays 
editions of the washington post among them were 
cutting the 100000peraccount deposit insurance in half and 
limiting depositors to one insured account 
merging the banking and sampl industries and eliminating the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
combining the insurance funds for banks and thrift 
institutions thereby forcing banks to help pay for the sampl bailout 
we dont have any conclusions at the moment the study is 
certainly a long way from being completed fitzwater said 
treasury spokeswoman desiree tuckersorini said the deposit 
insurance review is in its early stages and the administration has 
no preconceived ideas about how the system should be changed 
she said the administration last year rejected merging the bank 
and sampl insurance funds and we have no proposal to do that now 
at this time we dont see any reason to abolish the thrift 
office she added 
but she also said that the department hasnt rejected any ideas 
either only that the administration believes this year is too soon 
after passage of the sampl law to act on major banking legislation 
for next year who knows at this point its way too early to 
determine she said 
deputy treasury secretary john e robson in a private speech 
earlier this month to the independent bankers association of 
america revealed that the department had widened the scope of its 
approach 
the treasury study is not going to focus on deposit insurance 
in a vacuum robson said we are taking a comprehensive 
approach including consideration of the financial activities 
in which institutions engage and the regulatory structure 
lobbing groups objected strongly to some of the ideas floated in 
the posts story 
floating a proposal to cut back existing levels of deposit 
insurance is unfortunate said kenneth guenther executive vice 
president of the independent bankers association of america it 
further weakens confidence in the financial industry and if 
implemented would further weaken the thrift industry and 
consequently increase the cost of the sampl bailout 
robert dugger chief economist of the american bankers 
association said merging the bank and sampl insurance funds would 
raise public concerns about bank safety 
its a formula for financial disaster he said you 
cant burden the bank insurance fund with the thrift crisis its 
not designed for that and would collapse under the weight

the government on monday banned eight 
militant moslem organizations in kashmir and closed two local 
newspapers in its latest effort to contain unrest in the disputed 
territory 
the press trust of india news agency said one of the 
organizations outlawed was the jammukashmir liberation front 
which is leading the bloody independence campaign in the northern 
area bordering pakistan 
the two newspapers closed are in srinagar kashmirs main city 
and the center of the separatist campaign 
a government statement said the urdu language newspapers aftab 
and alsafa had published materials to incite the public 
earlier monday witnesses accused indian soldiers of brutalizing 
suspected militants during housetohouse searches at least 33 
people were arrested the searches came on the 10th day of a 
24hour curfew that has restricted civilians to their homes 
in one district troops were seen forcing a group of men to 
perform squats a kneebend exercise with heavy stones on their 
backs 
none of them are militants said one witness but this 
will make them militants we thought the indian army was 
disciplined but we were wrong 
he and other witnesses all of whom spoke on condition of 
anonymity said they were too far away to know what provoked the 
action 
the government imposed a roundtheclock curfew april 6 after 
three people were kidnapped by moslem militants whose seek 
secession of the kashmir valley from hindudominated india all 
three hostages were shot to death when the government failed to 
respond to the kidnappers demands of freedom for three jailed 
comrades 
since then residential areas of srinagar at the far northern 
tip of india have been under constant curfew as troops fan out to 
search for suspects 
on monday the government announced a twohour relaxation of 
curfew in the civil lines shopping district witnesses said most 
shops in civil lines did not open because the shop owners live in 
downtown srinagar where curfew was not lifted 
the insurgency in the kashmir valley has claimed at least 270 
lives since the government cracked down on the moslem movement on 
jan 20 most of the victims have died in confrontations between 
security forces and the militants 
the independence movement has also escalated tensions between 
india and pakistan which have fought two wars over the valley 
since both counties gained independence from britain in 1947 
the hindu ruler of the moslemdominated kashmir province opted 
to join india although other moslemmajority provinces went to 
islamic pakistan 
a moslem secession movement has grown in recent years because of 
complaints the region was being ignored by new delhi 
india accuses pakistan of fomenting the insurgency an 
accusation pakistan denies

drug ring and two other inmates who pulled a gun on a guard and 
escaped from a privately operated jail 
the three cellmates at the central texas parole violators 
facility fled late sunday on foot 
one of the three lured a guard to the cell by pretending to be 
sick then pulled a 25caliber handgun said us marshal bill 
jonas the three inmates then locked up two guards in a closet and 
overpowered another before seizing the security control panels and 
opening a door jonas said 
officials of wackenhut corp which operates the supplementary 
jail under contract with bexar county to alleviate jail crowding 
speculate the pistol was smuggled inside during visiting hours 
sunday said pat cannan spokesman for the coral gables fla

police headquarters but cannan would not give details of the 
process 
the escapees were identified as mario alberto salinas trevino

arrested hes also suspected of having up to 10 million in drug 
money stashed in texas or mexico jonas said 
law enforcement authorities suspect salinas would go to mexico 
about 150 miles away 
thats a logical escape route said jonas if thats the 
case i think hes acting illadvisedly i have every reason to 
believe the mexican government will cooperate with us 
salinas allegedly led a drug ring with ramiro mirales felix of 
guadalajara mexico federal prosecutors said when salinas was 
arrested

a juvenile facing a possible death sentence in 
alabama lost his final court battle to avoid extradition monday 
when the supreme court refused to hear his appeal 
the 17yearold boy identified in court proceedings only by the 
initials om is charged with arson and murder in the may 1988 
death of 14monthold tamal jackson who was killed when a firebomb 
exploded inside an apartment at a gadsden ala housing project 
om has been fighting extradition since his arrest by district 
of columbia authorities in december 1988 his battle has attracted 
widespread attention because of its focus on capital punishment for 
juveniles and southern justice for blacks 
james a hedgspeth district attorney for etowah county ala 
said the supreme courts refusal to hear the case removes the last 
legal obstacle to the youths return to alabama to face the 
juvenile petition charging him with arson and murder 
the etowah county district court will determine whether om 
will be certified to stand trial as an adult a move that could 
subject him to the death penalty if convicted 
oms lawyers argued unsuccessfully in washington courts that 
his extradition would violate the district governments ban on 
capital punishment 
they also contended that om who is black could not get a 
fair trial from the predominantly white judicial system in etowah 
county where both his father and another relative died in police 
custody 
two of oms uncles 32yearold yul devoe guice and an 
18yearold identified only by the initials st also were charged 
with arson and murder in the death of the jackson infant 
st was arrested by district of columbia authorities last 
summer and has also been fighting extradition to alabama

president george bush assured singapores 
probable next government chief monday that the united states 
intends to maintain a strong military presence in the western 
pacific said the visitor first deputy prime minister goh chok 
tong 
we support that goh told reporters after a halfhour white 
house meeting with bush secretary of state james a baker iii 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and other us leaders 
dont give up your influence in the area under fiscal 
pressure added goh named by longtime prime minister lee kuan yew 
three years ago as lees eventual successor as head of the 
singapore government and ruling peoples action party 
the united states has invested many years building influence in 
the western pacific and it would be wrong to abandon it just as 
countries in the area such as singapore hong kong taiwan and 
south korea are taking off economically he said 
goh also urged us steadfastness in backing the policy of 
singapore and other members of asean the association of southeast 
asian nations toward seeking a comprehensive solution for 
cambodia devastated by years of civil war 
the question is do we now become suddenly exhausted and hand 
the game to the vietnamesebacked hun seng government or to the 
khmer rouge or do we try to ensure that the noncommunist 
resistance has a chance to win in a fair elections which may be 
held under united nations supervision he said 
us officials have been reported reassessing us cambodian 
policy to break a deadlock among the cambodian factions that 
critics say threatens a return to power of the khmer rouge blamed 
for more than a million cambodian deaths in the 1970s 
singapore has said us forces could use some of its facilities 
if the united states and the philippines fail to agree on future 
terms for american bases in the philippines

friends and relatives of hostage john 
mccarthy sent messages to beirut newspapers and television stations 
asking for his freedom as the british journalist marked his fourth 
year in captivity monday 
there is no word on mccarthys welfare and no group has claimed 
responsibility for his kidnapping 
we think constantly of the long years you have spent in beirut 
and hope that 1990 will see you safely back home mccarthys 
father patrick wrote in a message 
mccarthys girlfriend jill morrell wrote no one has 
forgotten you for a second i long to know how you are and what you 
are thinking but the longer this goes on the more determined i am 
to see you back home hang on and do not lose hope 
several newspapers radio and television stations in beirut are 
planning to broadcast or print the messages that friends and 
relatives hope mccarthy will be permitted to hear or read 
mccarthy 33 was kidnapped april 17 1986 while driving to 
beirut airport to catch a flight to london he was working for the 
londonbased worldwide television news 
in london a noon church service and a silent vigil outside the 
iranian embassy were planned to mark his abduction 
despite repeated appeals from his family published in beirut 
newspapers little is known about mccarthys kidnappers 
mccarthys mother sheila died of cancer at age 66 on july 9 
1989 a month before her death she appealed to her sons abductors 
to let her see him before she passed away she received no response 
and it is unclear if mccarthy is aware of his mothers death 
appeals from the british government the international 
federation of journalists and the united nations education 
scientific and cultural organization unesco have also failed to 
draw any response from the kidnappers 
sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin spiritual head of lebanons 
shiite moslem community said recently that all western hostages 
kidnapped in beirut were alive and well he did not expand on the 
statement

18 western hostages in lebanon most have been captives for more 
than three years

middle east correspondent for the associated press he was abducted 
march 16 1985 
the 18 hostages include eight americans four britons two

operating license monday to the comanche peak texas nuclear power 
plant 
the fivemember commission approved the license for the plant 
the second in the state after a lastminute claim from opponents 
that evacuation plans do not account for the areas higher summer 
population 
opponents organized as citizens for fair utility regulation 
complained that tu electric co the plants owner has failed to 
adequately warn residents living near the plant 80 miles southwest 
of dallas about evacuation plans the activists complained 
particularly about the added summer population of children 
attending church camps 
another activist group citizens association for sound energy 
had sought a licensing condition to assure a more disciplined 
accountable approach to resolving operational incidents 
but the nrc staff recommended said such a condition was not 
called for 
utility spokeswoman kathi miller said the company which is 
seeking a 102 percent rate increase in part to recover the costs 
of building the 91 billion plant could reach full power by this 
summer the plant is a decade behind schedule and billions of 
dollars over budget

northern third of the state could begin receiving electricity from 
comanche peak 15 years after construction began in 1975 at glen

the bush administration is allowing south 
african iron and steel into the united states despite a 1986 
economic sanction designed to force an end to apartheid the state 
department said monday 
most of the controversial imports are ferroalloys strategic 
commodities never intended by congress to be banned under the law 
said department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
the administrations definition of steel was upheld in a federal 
court in 1987 and certain prefabricated products that contain steel 
are not included in the definition of steel she said 
this administration will continue to enforce fully all 
provisions of the comprehensive antiapartheid act ms tutwiler 
said this is an old issue that has been thoroughly reviewed by 
the treasury department 
another us official requesting anonymity said some 
prefabricated items such as toasters and some ferroalloys had been 
imported the official said the volume of imports was not readily 
available 
the new york times quoting commerce department officials 
reported saturday that more than 900000 tons of south african iron 
and steel products worth at least 350 million had entered the 
united states despite the sanctions 
nothwithstanding any other provision of law no iron or steel 
produced in south africa may be imported into the united states 
the law says 
the times said treasury department lawyers had defined steel 
to exclude fabricated steel products such as girders beams and 
plates used in the construction of bridges 
however rep john bryant dtexas took issue with the 
interpretation 
there is no excuse for the administration to allow even one 
ounce much less billions of pounds of such products to enter the 
united states bryant told the times 
a treasury department official told the associated press on 
monday that ferroalloys were always outside the scope of the law 
and that the department intended to screen out prefabricated 
products containing steel 
but the official said the appeals court for the court of 
international trade ruled against the department the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said such imports were very 
minor about 1 percent of the volume of ferroalloys 
our enforcement is very strict the official said there 
is no reason for alarm 
the law passed by congress over president reagans veto also 
prohibits new lending and investment bans flights to and from 
south africa and prohibits american imports of south african coal 
textiles uranium farm products and gold coins 
the reagan administration called repeatedly for an end to racial 
segregation in south africa however it opposed sanctions saying 
blacks would suffer if the countrys economy were hurt

the man accused of being the ringleader in a 
racial slaying carried a pistol and bragged that he was going to 
shoot blacks the prosecution said monday at the start of his 
murder trial 
keith mondello was going to murder a black man assistant 
district attorney james kohler said it didnt matter what black 
man yusuf hawkins innocently appeared on the scene and his fate 
was sealed 
mondello boasted that he would blow the heads off the nigger 
bastards the prosecutor said 
a state supreme court jury began hearing the case against 
mondello nearly eight months after 16yearold hawkins and three of 
his pals crossed paths with a mob of batwielding whites in the 
mostly white bensonhurst section of the borough of brooklyn 
prosecutors say mondello charged with two counts of 
seconddegree murder and other crimes did not shoot hawkins but 
created the circumstances that caused his death by assembling the 
white gang 
a second jury in the same courtroom was to hear opening 
statements in the trial of the accused gunman joseph fama 
however those proceedings were postponed until tuesday because 
defense lawyer david depetris had the flu 
mondello and fama both 19 years old and charged with two counts 
of seconddegree murder would face 25 years to life in prison if 
convicted 
kohler charged the slaying was a racial murder motivated by 
mondellos hatred of blacks and hispanics 
to call it anything else but a race riot would demean and 
trivialize the death of yusuf hawkins kohler said 
he added the person who will put many of the pieces to the 
puzzle together is the defendant himself 
in statements mondello made to the police following his arrest 
he admitted assembling the gang admitted having a gun in his car 
and said he was carrying a bat at the time of the attack the 
prosecutor said 
mondellos lawyer stephen murphy disputed prosecutors 
accounts of the killing and asserted his client was being falsely 
accused by gina feliciano a key prosecution witness he described 
as a habitual liar and an unreformed drug addict 
murphy said he would play for the jury a recorded conversation 
between miss feliciano and her sister that makes it real clear 
that the truth has nothing to do with anything 
murphy charges that the girl brought on the entire episode by 
inviting some black and hispanic friends to an aug 23 birthday 
party in the mostly italianamerican neighborhood 
murphy asserted that mondello was horrified by the shooting 
six other young whites also were indicted in the killing and 
will be tried later

military families are used to being 
moved around but the latest marching orders for 1200 families 
arrived in the form of an eviction notice 
in a costcutting move the families of mostly lowpaid military 
recruiters and support staff have been told they must leave their 
cozy armyowned ranch houses near obsolete nike missile bases by 
aug 15 a few have until 1993 to find new homes 
we dont know where were going to go said cynthia aitken 
whose new britain home is in a cluster of 16 army houses that are 
being sold off 
the houses once were occupied by the families of nike 
antiaircraft missile crews who had to live nearby so they could 
rush to their battle stations in the event of war 
the missiles were phased out two decades ago and the housing 
passed on to younger generations of military families many of them 
in the army but with some from the other branches of the armed 
forces 
two years ago congress ordered the army to close or reorganize 
86 installations as part of that order the army must sell 53 
housing complexes near former nike bases 
the housing is concentrated in the northeast with 239 families 
in connecticut 163 in new york 104 in new jersey 124 in 
massachusetts 133 in pennsylvania and 78 families in rhode island 
there also are 12 houses in maryland 94 in st louis 32 in 
virginia 110 in wisconsin 24 in illinois and 60 in washington 
state 
the closings will save the army about 2 million in maintenance 
and utility costs in connecticut massachusetts and rhode island 
this year alone said helen mulligan a spokesman for fort devens 
in ayer mass 
until the closings were announced mrs aitken did not have to 
worry about housing costs because her family was allowed to live 
rentfree her husband bruce a firstclass petty officer and 
13year navy veteran works at the plainville reserve center 
she and others like her are worried about how they will rent or 
buy homes on annual salaries that in some cases can amount to less 
than 15000 when they leave their free armyowned housing the 
families can expect housing allowances in the range of 600 a 
month depending on rank and where they live 
the issue is particularly sensitive for military families in new 
england where housing costs are among the nations highest 
that 600 isnt going to buy anything except in neighborhoods 
dogs shouldnt be forced to live in said patricia berkley one 
of more than 100 military spouses who gathered at the army reserve 
training center in west hartford last month to express their 
frustration to military officials 
how do you expect my husband to be all he can be while hes 
worried about his wife and children getting mugged 
roberto ramos a coast guard officer who lives in middletown 
says the army should have given families who live in the houses the 
first chance to rent or buy them 
a lot of these guys are young with young kids said ramos 
if you put them out in this economy theyre going to be poor 
people 
under the law the army had to offer the housing to other 
service branches and federal agencies first houses the federal 
government doesnt want will be offered to state agencies and any 
remaining will be offered for sale to the public

defense secretary dick cheney in an annual 
report on the defense spending of nato nations and japan faulted 
luxembourg denmark and canada on monday for below par 
contributions to the common defense 
these nations have by and large relatively prosperous 
economies and relatively high standards of living yet devote 
relatively small proportions of their resources to defense said 
the report released at the pentagon 
the performance of this group of nations looks 
substantially below par it said 
however the report noted canada has had a relatively good 
performance in increasing defense spending in recent years 
luxembourg is an important host to allied forces and denmark has a 
better than average showing in other areas such as in its 
active and reserve troop numbers in relation to the nations 
population 
the annual report on allied contributions to the common defense 
is required by congress which has become sensitive in recent years 
to the high defense contributions the united states makes to 
economically robust nations in western europe and the far east 
the report said that with revolutionary changes sweeping eastern 
europe and the soviet union the need for defense arms control 
and burdensharing objectives to remain in harmony is crucial 
within nato a stronger european pillar is evolving 
adjustments in the roles and responsibilities for the common 
defense will contribute to this evolution the report said 
overall the report said the nato nations and japan spent about 
489 billion on defense in 1988 the last year for which common 
figures were available 
the united states accounted for 293 billion or 60 percent of 
that amount the report said 
the other major spenders included france 361 billion 74 
percent west germany 351 billion 72 percent britain 347 
billion 71 percent japan 289 billion 59 percent canada 
10 billion 2 percent italy 204 billion 42 percent and 
others 307 billion 63 percent the report said 
besides assessing the amount spent on defense by each nation 
the report also attempts to look at such things as weaponry and the 
number of each nations active duty and reserve forces in relation 
to its population 
but the report said some things are much harder to measure such 
as the loss of real estate given over in order to allied troops on 
a nations soil 
nations such as japan and west germany are sensitive to such 
matters and the report said the market value of such property in 
west germany alone has been estimated at 24 billion 
the report lauded the socalled burdensharing efforts of 
turkey greece britain and france saying they all allocated 
relatively high proportions of their national income to defense 
turkey and greece nations often at odds with each other have 
made such contributions even though they enjoy a rather low 
economic prosperity the report noted 
the nations that have made mixed efforts included norway 
west germany the netherlands portugal italy belgium and spain 
the report said 
germany norway and the netherlands comprise an upper echelon 
of nations who are making good to excellent force improvement 
efforts and strong contributions in a number of areas but are 
lagging somewhat in the defense spending arena said the report 
portugals relatively modest efforts appear genuinely 
equitable when its poor economic situation is taken into account 
and italy is making major efforts to improve despite a low 
financial contribution the report said 
the report said if japans defense spending were measured only 
against its high standard of living and economic output it would 
also be judged substantially below par but the report noted 
japans contribution of 1 percent of its socalled gross domestic 
output to defense puts it among the top five nations in total 
defense spending 
of greater relevance japan is making rapid progress towards 
the military capability to fulfill its agreedupon mission the 
defense of its territory and its sealanes to a distance of 1000 
miles the report said 
japan and okinawa host nearly 50000 us troops and japan 
contributed nearly 22 billion in support for us forces in 1989 
including 685 million for military construction and 410 million 
in labor cost sharing the report said

chief officer oddvar finstad of the 
scandinavian star conceded at a marine inquiry on monday that he 
and other officers abandoned the blazing ferry while passengers 
awaited rescue 
police in oslo norway estimated 161 people died in the april 7 
fire but said the figure was not final because it was still 
uncertain how many passengers boarded the ferry the danishowned 
vessel was on an overnight run from oslo to frederikshavn denmark 
finstad the thirdincommand said he capt hugo larsen the 
norwegian master of the scandinavian star and other officers left 
the burning vessel in a lifeboat knowing passengers remained on 
the deck 
the fate of the abandoned passengers some of whom were rescued 
later was not discussed as they rowed away in the last usable 
lifeboat finstad said 
i cant see what more i could have done on board after the 
captain left the ship he said 
larsen and other officers returned three hours later to help 
swedish and norwegian firefighters 
larsen testified as the first witness in the inquiry and said he 
abandoned ship while some passengers remained alive on board 
finstads testimony on the sixth day of the inquiry supported 
accounts by rescued passengers that the crew appeared confused and 
illtrained to deal with an emergency 
under questioning finstad acknowledged he knew practically 
nothing about the ships emergency plan or evacuation procedures 
that he was unaware of his assignment in the posted emergency plan 
as head of the ships 14member fire squad and was unable to 
identify the other squad members 
the inquiry established that the required fire and evacuation 
drills were not held 
finstad was asked why safety procedures were not checked before 
the 20yearold ferry was allowed to sail with passengers 
we had been on board such a short time that we hadnt gotten 
around to it he replied 
most of the predominantly portuguese and filipino crew signed on 
the scandinavian star five days before the fire which police 
believe was deliberately set 
the ships safety officer first officer sverre aashildrods 
testified he knew nothing about international safety regulations 
that require fire drills when more than 25 percent of the crew is 
new 
the scandinavian stars alarm systems had not been checked and 
passengers coming on board did not receive the required safety 
cards telling them what to do in an emergency the inquiry was told 
the panel is headed by five judges and includes norwegian and 
danish police three scandinavian maritime authorities and lawyers 
for the shipowner and the insurance companies concerned 
the judge leading the inquiry is frank poulsen president of the 
marine and trade court he said the inquiry came at the request of 
the shipowner vr dano lines 
criminal charges cannot arise from the inquiry but witnesses 
testify under oath and are warned their testimony could be used in 
any subsequent criminal case 
a joint commission of danish norwegian and swedish maritime 
officials is to hold hearings on the case follow the copenhagen 
inquiry

the government said monday it had 
freed nearly 7700 inmates including all political prisoners as a 
goodwill gesture marking the holy month of ramadan 
there is not a single political prisoner in the kingdom 
according to an interior ministry announcement broadcast by 
staterun riyadh radio because king fahd had declared amnesty for 
7681 prisoners 
the gesture was made possible by benefactors who donated about 
87 million to help pay the public and private debts of some 
prisoners the ministry said 
in a report on saudi arabia issued in january the londonbased 
human rights group amnesty international said more than 700 people 
were detained without trial from 1983 to 1989 mainly shiite 
moslems including iranianbacked fundamentalists 
the report said at least 100 people were seized last year and 
named 66 held in three prisons 
saudi arabia denied the report mondays announcement did not 
specifically refer to the shiites 
those still jailed were being held for capital crimes or were 
convicted and awaiting sentencing 
capital crimes under islamic law include murder punishable by 
beheading adultery punishable by stoning and thievery 
punishable by cutting of hands from the wrist in recent years 
beheading was also decreed by moslem theologians for drug smuggling 
the amnesty included saudis and foreigners but no breakdown was 
released it referred to an unspecified number of foreigners 
detained for various misdemeanors financial crimes and public law 
violations it said their embassies were asked to prepare for their 
deportation as is customary 
it is a tradition for rulers in islamic countries to issue 
amnesties during ramadan and other moslem occasions islamic law 
also allows for benefactors sometimes anonymous to settle 
prisoners debts as an act of charity 
neighboring gulf countries have already announced their 
amnesties for ramadan but they have not exceeded 200 prisoners 
the saudi statement did not identify the benefactors in 
neighboring united arab emirates president sheik zayed bin sultan 
al nahyan personally underwrote the debt of the 150 prisoners 
released in the capital abu dhabi

a preacher who says the easter bunny is nothing 
more than a pagan icon served barbecued rabbit to the needy hoping 
to shift the focus to the true meaning of the christian holiday 
just like turkey is served on thanksgiving i would like to 
see rabbit served in homes across america every easter said the 
rev larry rice director of the new life evangelistic center in 
st louis 
rice came up with the idea to attract more attention to the 
original meaning of easter a christian holy day that celebrates 
the resurrection of jesus christ and the promise of everlasting 
life 
the easter bunny is tremendous competition to that message 
rice said monday we like to think of ourselves as a christian 
nation but our focus on a mystical rabbit is really paganistic 
the new life center a privately operated shelter for the poor 
in downtown st louis bought 604 rabbits to serve on easter 
sunday rice said primarily because they were cheaper than beef or 
pork 
people who came to the easter dinners didnt have to eat rabbit 
if they didnt want to rice said 
about 500 people could choose from grilled rabbit sauteed 
rabbit rabbit cacciatore turkey or ham 
the majority of people ate rabbit but thats partly because 
we only cooked 10 turkeys said ruth powell a volunteer at new 
life who planned the dinner i was surprised by the number of 
people that wanted the rabbit 
yvonne dozier seated at dinner with her 8monthold baby 
james didnt have a problem eating rabbit 
its great she said tearing into her dinner there aint 
no such thing as the easter bunny and i aint no kid this is just 
food good food she said 
in kansas city about 200 people were given a piece of chicken 
and a piece of rabbit 
rice said hes received some calls from people who canceled 
their plans to make donations to his shelter one woman called to 
complain about the psychological counseling children were going to 
need because of his idea 
but he said overall response was positive 
im toying with another idea for later this year theres a 
lot of hunting for deer around christmas and we might take 
advantage of that and serve whitetail deer mule deer even 
reindeer rice said

the bush administration said monday it would 
not forbid american companies from offering special purchasing 
incentives to win contracts for military sales aboard though it 
will not encourage thoce incentives either 
a white house statement said that incentives known in military 
circles as offsets have become a common feature in the 
international arms trade an offset is a requirement that the 
selling company buy a certain amount of goods and services in the 
buying country 
the decision whether to engage in offsets and the 
responsibility for negotiating and implementing offset 
arrangements resides with the companies involved the white 
house said in a policy statement issued under president bushs name 
the administration said no agency of the us government will 
encourage offsets or commit us firms to offset deals 
moreover it said that no us government funds will be used to 
finance offsets in security assistance deals except in accordance 
with currently established policies and procedures 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the government 
views offsets for military exports as economically inefficient 
and market distorting 
one case of offsets cited by the pentagon involved the recent 
purchase of 11 airborne radar warning and control planes from 
boeing by britain and france in an 18 billion deal 
the two countries demanded an offset from boeing of 130 percent 
meaning that the manufacturer would have to buy more than 23 
billion in goods and services from britain and france 
such an arrangement puts the us company in the role of a 
middleman for selling the foreign countries goods if they have 
nothing to sell that the us company needs immediately

thousands of teachers went on strike monday 
to show their anger over a failed 230 million education 
improvement package and many picketed at the state capitol 
teachers say their pay ranks 48th in the nation the minimum 
beginning salary for a teacher with a bachelors degree is 15060 
the crowd outside the capitol was estimated at more than 10000 
by nancy jewell vice president of the oklahoma education 
association other estimates ranged up from 5000 
hundreds of teachers clogged legislative halls inside the 
capitol lobbying for additional school funding 
if you can read this thank a teacher if you cant thank a 
legislator read a sign carried by one picket 
schools were closed in more than 145 of the states 606 school 
districts where more than half the education associations members 
are teachers said association president kyle dahlem the 
association represents 80 percent of oklahomas teachers 
the tulsa school district the largest in the state was among 
those closed schools were open in oklahoma city but not in many 
of the capital citys suburbs 
teachers in oklahoma city and some other districts said they 
feared reprisals if they took part in the strike school 
administrators supported the walkout in some areas and opposed it 
in others 
at the capitol the knob to the main door of gov henry 
bellmons office was loosened because so many teachers wanted to 
register their presence said andrew tevington bellmons chief of 
staff 
bellmon asked state attorney general robert henry to go to 
court if necessary to block the walkout henry issued a statement 
late monday saying it did not appear immediate legal action was 
warranted 
henry said state law forbidding strikes against local school 
boards did not appear to apply in the case of a walkout to express 
dissatisfaction with legislative action 
the education association called for a fiveday teacher walkout 
after the oklahoma senate failed last week to pass the school 
reform bill as an emergency measure which would have put it into 
effect immediately 
the measure has been the work of an eightmonth special session 
bellmon called in august to improve oklahoma schools 
the republican governor supported the bill but only one of the 
senates 15 republicans voted for it wednesday along with seven of 
the senates 33 democrats 
after the senate voted wednesday to drop the emergency clause 
legislative leaders got the senate to send the bill back to 
committee to keep it from going to bellmon without the provision 
the bill mandates greater equity in the way state funds are 
allocated salary increases for teachers a school consolidation 
plan and a program to close schools that dont meet accreditation 
requirements 
it calls for an additional 212 million for schools that could 
be used for teacher salaries and other items and proposes 1500 
increases in minimum teachers salaries for each of the next four 
years 
much of the opposition was stirred by the plan for taxes to 
support the reforms including a halfcent increase in the states 
4cent sales tax and increases in corporate and personal income 
taxes 
senate president pro tempore bob cullison said there were 
negotiations over the weekend to revive the school bill which he 
had said last week was apparently dead he said he could not 
comment on whether there had been any progress toward a compromise 
ms dahlem said critics of the walkout should come walk in our 
shoes and then tell me that what we are doing isnt necessary 
that this isnt the last resort on a list of options that have all 
failed over long months of pushing pulling frustration and 
compromise only for education supporters to come up emptyhanded 
the walkout was supported by the national education association 
which has 2 million members nea president keith geiger and other 
officials of the national group issued a statement saying there was 
an educational emergency in oklahoma right now

longterm television viewing is one cause of 
violent or aggressive behavior in children and contributes 
substantially to childhood obesity the american academy of 
pediatrics said monday 
in its first policy statement on children and television since 
1984 the 39000member academy called for more involvement by 
parents and pediatricians in regulating childrens viewing and 
urged that viewing time be cut in half 
by the time a child today reaches age 70 he or she will have 
spent approximately seven years watching television the 
pediatricians said 
for some children the world shown on television becomes the 
real world the statement said 
the academy also recommended 
intensifying efforts to teach parents and pediatricians about 
televisions influence and promoting critical viewing among 
children 
parents limiting childrens viewing to one to two hours daily 
and developing activities such as reading athletics and hobbies 
supporting legislation making broadcast of highquality 
childrens programming a condition of license renewal and mandating 
at least one hour per day of educational childrens programming 
supporting efforts to ban programs that have toys as main 
characters 
portraying sexuality responsibly 
working to eliminate alcohol ads on television and encouraging 
extensive counter advertising 
ac nielsen co data indicate children ages 2 to 5 watch tv 
about 25 hours weekly 6 to 11yearolds more than 22 hours 
weekly and 12to 17yearolds 23 hours per week said the policy 
statement 
were asking that parents cut their kids television viewing 
in half or more said dr victor strasburger of the university of 
new mexico school of medicine he added that the academy did not 
recommend a time limit five years ago 
experts have established a link between heavy television viewing 
and obesity he said the policy statement credits a 1985 study by 
drs wh dietz and sl gortmaker that appeared in the journal 
pediatrics 
dietz a member of the academy committee that prepared the 
policy statement has done followup research strasburger said 
it could be that television watching is such a sedentary 
activity he said in a telephone interview monday it could be 
because the nutritional messages on television are so terrible or 
it could be that kids usually eat while theyre watching 
television it probably is all three 
he said tv still offers a steady diet of violence causing 
some children to believe that if youre the good guy violence 
can be acceptable to solve some problems 
the policy statement also calls for contraceptive advertising 
and for responsible portrayals of sex 
strasburger said no national networks have been brave enough 
or publicspirited enough to advertise contraceptives 
theyre so wrapped up in business decisions they really dont see 
that this is an urgent public health matter not just because of 
aids but also because of teenage pregnancy 
he said soap operas offer the worst examples of sex on 
television and are shown when small children often watch tv 
what tv airs at 10 oclock at night is not what were worried 
about he noted its what they put on at 2 oclock in the 
afternoon 
despite tvs negative aspects he said the academy believes 
its ok to use the television set occasionally as an electronic 
babysitter but parents should videotape programs they approve 
of rather than let the kids play channel roulette 
in calling for an end to programs featuring toys as the main 
characters the academy reasoned that such shows are really 
marketing vehicles 
saturday morning television is still the vast wasteland that 
it was 10 or 15 years ago strasburger said it could be far 
more educational than it is the fact that it hasnt changed is 
really a reflection on the federal communications commission 
william johnson deputy chief of the fccs mass media bureau 
said the problem the agency faces in regulating childrens 
programming borders on censorship 
another issue johnson said is whether the federal government 
should arbitrarily decide between good and bad programming how 
do we define it and how would you enforce that he said in a 
telephone interview from washington 
he said cable tv outlets have provided more opportunities for 
good childrens programming and said there was much less violence 
on childrens programs than before 
spokesmen for abc nbc and cbs could not be reached for comment 
by telephone late monday because they were either gone for the day 
or unavailable

the us supreme court on monday let stand a 
ban on school dances in this bible belt town prompting an opponent 
to lament a victory for liars cheats and hypocrites 
opponents said they now hoped the school board would voluntarily 
lift the rule but officials said they wouldnt discuss the issue 
until may 
the high court without comment rejected arguments that the 
nodance rule was religiously motivated and violated the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state a federal 
appeals court in september upheld the ban 
im disappointed by the ruling but im not surprised said 
attorney william fleischaker who represented 21 purdy high school 
students and their parents who filed a lawsuit in 1986 seeking to 
overturn the ban in this ozarks town 
we knew the odds against us were pretty strong we had hoped 
we could get the ear of someone at the supreme court and get them 
to review the situation obviously that didnt happen he said 
no further legal appeals are planned fleischaker said 
school superintendent sheldon buxton declined to speculate 
whether the school board would again prohibit all schoolsponsored 
dances or modify or abandon the rule 
the board was scheduled to hold its regular meeting monday night 
but didnt plan to discuss the ruling buxton said 
this is not the time or place for the board to gloat said 
board president glenn garrett it is time for the board 
administration faculty students and the purdy citizens to set 
about healing the divisions caused by this litigation 
the student body president and several other students refused to 
comment as they were leaving school monday afternoon 
i think the students are just glad to see it all end said 
becky woods a highschool physical education teacher and purdy 
native there was excitement about the first dance but then the 
whole thing dragged on so long the press got into it and now i 
think students just dont care where they dance at the school or 
elsewhere 
school board member alan keeling praised the ruling saying its 
best for the board to decide whether dances should be held he said 
board members had been confident they would win the case 
buxton said three dances have been held at the school since us 
district judge russell clark in springfield ruled in 1988 that the 
nodance rule was unconstitutional clarks ruling was overturned 
by the appeals court 
he said the dances went smoothly with no problems and no 
complaints from five fundamentalist ministers in the southwestern 
missouri community of 900 who regard dancing as satanic and 
sinful and led support for the ban 
im relieved that this situation has come to a closing 
point buxton said i think the support and interest in the 
school that has been shown from people on both sides will help the 
healing process allow us to get back to business as usual and put 
this issue behind us 
the ban on dancing at the high school which has an enrollment 
of about 230 drew national attention for its similarity to the 
movie footloose the 1984 film centered on a fight in a 
fictional texas small town between young people and city fathers 
who thought dancing sinful and immoral 
joan fox a parent and plaintiff along with her son and husband 
said the supreme courts refusal to hear the case is a real loss 
for students in this community and around the country 
its an extreme victory for liars cheats and hypocrites 
she said i think the judicial system in this country has gone to 
pot 
mrs fox called on the school board to voluntarily abandon the 
100yearold dance ban 
the kids have had several successful wonderful dances and i 
hope the school board realizes that its for the kids benefit to 
have dances on campus she said i hope they dont tell them to 
get lost which is what theyve always said previously 
fleischaker said he hoped school board members would note how 
well the first three dances had gone and permit future dances this 
years juniorsenior prom will be held in the nearby community of 
monett at students request school officials said 
there certainly has been strong and vocal opposition to 
schoolsponsored dancing fleischaker said i would hope the 
opposition has mellowed a bit

nelson mandela stepped triumphantly onto the world 
stage at a concert full of rock stars monday night and urged foes 
of apartheid to wage unrelenting war against the system that jailed 
him for 27 years in south africa 
the 71yearold black nationalist leader standing before a 
sellout crowd of 72000 at wembley stadium beamed with pleasure 
and obvious affection as seven minutes of applause and cheers 
washed over him 
with his wife winnie standing nearby mandela then spoke 
forcefully for a halfhour interrupted about 30 times by applause 
the fatigue that showed in his face earlier vanished as he thanked 
supporters and spoke of the need to carry on the fight 
the address was telecast to millions in 40 countries 
international stars filled the stadium with music and the crowd 
danced sang and chanted mandela is free before the deputy 
president of the african national congress spoke 
it was his largest audience since his release from prison feb 
11 where he was serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government 
the concert sold out in two days among those who paid 33 to 
attend were american politician jesse jackson and neil kinnock 
leader of britains opposition labor party 
top british reggae group aswad kicked off the celebration which 
featured simple minds grammy awardwinner bonnie raitt neil 
young soul ii soul the neville brothers peter gabriel anita 
baker tracy chapman and oscarwinning actor denzel washington who 
played murdered black activist steve biko in the film cry 
freedom 
miriam makeba canceled her scheduled appearance for reasons of 
health 
said mandela we are meeting here to celebrate the victory 
represented by the release of some of us we must however 
remember that only a few have been released 
a greater number remains in prison we should therefore treat 
this day of celebration as one of rededication to the struggle 
for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners 
and against the system which keeps the outstanding sons and 
daughters of our people in jail 
he begged the world not to stop fighting the racial separation 
system in whitedominated south africa that denies the black 
majority the vote 
the apartheid crime against humanity remains in place it 
continues to kill and maim to oppress and exploit its 
bloodstained offspring continue to rain death and destruction on 
the peoples of mozambique and angola every day it produces orphans 
throughout southern africa mandela said 
mandela said sanctions should be maintained and that pretoria 
must not be rewarded for releasing political prisoners or lifting 
the ban on the anc 
his audience filled the playing field and most of the stands a 
huge banner across the stage said the struggle is my life the 
title of a book of mandelas writings and speeches 
mandela wearing a navy blue blazer and a tie striped in the 
black green and gold colors of the anc told reporters before his 
speech twentyseven years ago when i went to jail i had no vote 
i have come out and i still have no vote 
he said concerts such as this one were important for raising 
world awareness 
i think artists can play a very decisive role in the fight for 
human rights artists can reach quarters not nececssarily 
interested in politics through music which interests everybody so 
that the message can go further than we politicians can push it 
mandela told the crowd 
dear friends it will not be long now before we see the end of 
the apartheid system the dreams of millions of people to see our 
country free and at peace will be realized sooner rather than 
later we are determined to ensure that our country is transformed 
from being the skunk of the world into an exemplary oasis of 
unrivaled race relations democracy for all a just peace and 
freedom from poverty and human degradation 
he thanked those around the world who had clamored for his 
release including the thousands who attended a freemandela 
concert at wembley two years ago 
even through the thickness of the prison walls we heard 
your voices demanding our freedom during all the days we spent 
buried in the apartheid dungeons we never lost our confidence in 
the certainty of our release and our victory over the apartheid 
system 
mandela spoke warmly of anc president oliver tambo who is in 
sweden recovering from a stroke tambos wife adelaide sat with 
them in the stadiums executive box 
there is no man in this country or anywhere else in the world 
who could have performed as magnificently in the past 10 years 
mandela said 
as mandela left the stage and tracy chapman started to sing 
talking about a revolution the huge crowd danced in joy 
jesse jackson praised mandela at a news conference saying he 
is in good health his vision is clear his objectives are clear 
and hes gaining world support 
the mandelas arrived about an hour after the concert started 
smiling and waving their fists in the air as the crowd cheered 
they flew to london on sunday to attend and left immediately 
after the concert to fly to addis ababa ethiopia 
concert organizers said part of the proceeds will go to 
charities including oxfam and save the children fund they gave no 
estimate because the sale of television rights was still under way

york suburb for the funeral of phillip pannell 16 and about 200 
more gathered outside to listen to the service over a speaker most 
were black

took turns at the pulpit to call for solidarity in the wake of 
pannells death 
pannell was killed in teaneck last tuesday by an officer 
responding to reports that the youth was brandishing a gun a vigil 
there the following night turned violent with angry black youths 
smashing police car windows and looting stores 
no longer will we put up with public officials putting guns in 
the hands of people untrained to our needs said theo bolden a 
junior at teaneck high school today we say goodbye to phillip 
pannell but with our minds and hearts and souls we must say hello 
to the black community of tomorrow

lending an attentive ear in a critical time of need powell said 
the rev herbert daughtry the pannell familys pastor read the 
names of about 10 blacks killed recently in altercations with 
police in the new york metropolitan area despite the riot in 
teaneck the day after pannells death the black community has been 
complacent in responding to violence from police he said

15yearold irish italian or jewish kid said daughtry i 
submit to you we would not have a few broken windows down in 
teaneck 
pannell was shot by teaneck police officer gary spath who has

an allwhite jury was chosen to hear the murder 
trial of a former houston police officer accused of killing a black 
woman prompting outrage from community activists monitoring the 
trial 
they could have gotten that jury makeup in houston i dont 
even know why they came to dallas to do this said activist ada 
edwards referring to a change of venue 
the killing of ida lee delaney along with another killing of a 
black motorist by a white officer has been the focus of protests 
by blacks and calls for reform of houstons police force 
the former officer alex gonzales 25 is accused of killing 
mrs delaney 50 last fall during an exchange of gunfire following 
a highway chase while he was offduty 
prosecutors say the case has nothing to do with race so the 
racial makeup of the jury isnt important 
the state of texas is very happy with the jury said don 
smyth assistant harris county district attorney we think 
theyll do a fine job as weve been telling eveyrbody else this 
is not a racial case some folks are trying to make it a racial 
case 
its not a surprise said ms edwards one of more than 40 
people who drove from houston to dallas to monitor the trial i 
just hope the process will carry itself out and that those people 
are people who will be willing to hear the entire story 
i feel like this trial this marching none of this should be 
going on said ora shaw a sister of the dead woman who has taken 
part in protests she was murdered for nothing 
the case was moved to dallas because of pretrial publicity in 
houston 
ms edwards said activists were more concerned with the process 
than the outcome of gonzales murder trial but she said he is 
guilty of killing ida delaney now if they want to get technical 
about what level of guilt i cant speak to that 
some of the spectators in the dallas county courtroom were 
ushered out to make space for 60 potential jurors 
mrs delaneys was killed within two weeks of the death of byron 
gillum who was shot eight times after a traffic stop by an officer 
who said he saw gillum reach for a gun the officer hasnt been 
charged a gun was recovered from gillums car 
ms edwards who is cochair of the ida lee delaneybyron gillum 
justice committee said the group and volunteer attorneys would 
watch the trial to make sure the community is aware of what 
happened 
testimony is expected to begin tuesday said don smyth who 
heads the harris county district attorneys offices civil rights 
division and is prosecuting gonzales 
mrs delaney driving to work on a houston freeway apparently 
cut off gonzales and two other offduty officers in an unmarked car 
about 5 am on oct 31 she pulled over after a 12mile chase and 
mrs delaney and gonzales exchanged gunfire 
gonzales attorney mike hinton said mrs delaney fired first 
the offduty officers had been attending a birthday party at a 
nightclub for several hours before the shooting hospital records 
showed gonzales was legally intoxicated when he sought treatment 
for gunshot wounds to the abdomen 
all three officers were fired but only gonzales was indicted on 
a murder charge by a grand jury all are appealing their firings to 
independent arbitrators 
activist groups in dallas and houston planned to monitor the 
proceeding 
eva mcmillan of the dallas antiapartheid coalition said 
dallas juries tend to disregard the people 
i think nothing should be handed down but a guilty verdict 
ms mcmillan said but knowing texas justice especially dallas 
and the type of juries dallas selects juries which will vote in 
favor of the establishment 
one houston activist alkebu motapa said he would fast 
throughout the trial which attorneys say could last two weeks 
throughout the trial ill be in constant prayer and 
meditation for justice motapa said 
ms edwards said activists want houston to establish a civilian 
review board of police 
the committee organized a march that attracted 200 people in 
houston saturday on sunday members planted a black cross near 
where gillum was killed 
earlier this month harris county grand jurors declined to 
indict former officer scott tschirhart 27 in gillums death 
gillum was the third black civilian killed by tschirhart during the 
officers seven years on the houston force

the us supreme court on monday refused 
to hear an appeal from a man condemned to die for killing an 
attorney during a 1985 courthouse shootout 
the justices denied ronnie lee gardners bid for a supreme court 
hearing without comment except for customary dissenting statements 
by justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose 
capital punishment under all circumstances 
gardner 27 was sentenced to die for gunning down michael j 
burdell during a botched escape attempt april 2 1985 at salt lake 
citys metropolitan hall of justice 
police said a girlfriend of gardners slipped him a handgun 
while he was being transported to a hearing on a separate 
seconddegree murder charge stemming from the 1984 slaying of a 
bartender 
though shackled hand and foot gardner turned the weapon on two 
utah state prison guards accompanying him one of the guards shot 
gardner in the shoulder before he fled confronted burdell and shot 
the attorney once in the head gardner also wounded a bailiff 
before surrendering 
in february 1989 the utah supreme court denied gardners appeal 
following a threeyear review 
defense attorneys had argued that gardner should have been 
granted a change of venue due to pretrial publicity his lawyers 
also contended that the state district judge who tried the case 
should have removed himself since he was in the courthouse at the 
time of gardners escape attempt 
gardners attorneys were not immediately available for comment

the manufacturer of the steel tubes suspected to 
be parts of a huge iraqi weapon said monday its contract with iraq 
involved space research corp which designed a satellite launch 
system and was run by slain american ballistics expert gerald bull 
customs seized the eight sections april 12 as they were to be 
shipped to iraq and insist they could be used as part of a large 
gun sheffield forgemasters has insisted they were for use in a 
petrochemical installation and not subject to the licensing 
controls that bar sales of armaments to iraq 
forgemasters lawyer stuart benson said in a statement monday 
all documents i have seen support forgemasters understanding 
that the pipes were for a petrochemical application 
it has always been accepted by forgemasters that space 
research corp had involvement in this contract forgemasters has 
never sought to conceal such involvement 
he said a dr cowley not bull was the space research 
representative in the contract with the iraqi ministry of trade 
space research has its headquarters in brussels 
customs said there was no question the tubes could be used as a 
barrel of a large artillery piece to fire a projectile it holds 
the tubes pending investigation 
benson said it was not for forgemasters to prove or disprove the 
ultimate use and purpose of the tubes 
my only concern is to rebut any suggestion that it has acted 
in any way improperly or unlawfully he said 
bull 62 a canadianborn us citizen was slain in brussels 
march 22 belgian police said he was shot twice in the head with a 
silenced gun and robbery was not the motive because 20000 was 
found in bulls pockets 
bulls company was described as a multinational dealing in space 
and military research and employed in international arms sales 
sheffield forgemasters says it agreed to supply 52 sections of 
the steel tubing and had delivered 44 to the ministry of industry 
and minerals in baghdad it denied the eight tubes seized last week 
could be joined together to form a huge gun to attack iraqs middle 
east enemies or launch satellites 
iraq says the tubes are petrochemical pipes 
on saturday press association the british domestic news 
agency quoted unidentified reliable government sources as 
saying they had correspondence linking british industry with bulls 
firm 
the correspondence refers to orders for the manufacture of 
smoothbore pipes that experts believe match the specification 
detailed in bulls design for a space satellite launch system the 
sources were quoted as saying 
the times of london on friday quoted an unidentified customs 
official as saying the seized materials matched a design by bull 
janes defense weekly has identified bull as a designer of south 
africas g5 155mm howitzer which has been sold to iraq 
on march 28 british customs officers arrested five people at 
heathrow airport and seized 40 usmade components for nuclear 
bomb triggers that were being shipped to iraq one of those

argentinas public works 
minister roberto dromi said monday that about 80000 public 
employees will be retired or laid off by the end of the month as an 
austerity measure 
government workers past retirement age or within two years of 
retirement are affected employees who hold two jobs in the state 
sector must give up one employees who are in position to be 
retired are going to receive their pensions and be retired dromi 
said in an interview broadcast by radio rivadavia 
such action has been rare in argentina since the late president 
juan peron came to power in 1946 peron entrenched himself by 
creating or expanding state companies in part to spur employment 
and improve working conditions peronist provincial governments 
still expand public rolls during bad economic times 
argentina returned to democracy in december 1983 after nearly 
eight years of harsh military rule but the economy has been in 
constant trouble for decades 
dromi said the public sector amounts to about 3 million of the 
12 million total workforce argentinas total population is about 
31 million 
the public administration is absolutely too big alberto 
kohan a key aide to president carlos menem told reporters 
the government announced on march 4 that it was planning job 
cutbacks and tax increases to slash the budget deficit by 2 
billion it put no figure on forced retirements and layoffs until 
dromis comments 
retirement clauses in collective bargaining contracts vary from 
ages 55 to 65 
a recession has idled up to 15 percent of the workforce and 
shrunk wages for many workers to 100 or less a month many rely on 
overtime or a second job to make ends meet 
initial comments from labor leaders were cautious victor de 
gennaro secretarygeneral of the 145000member association of 
state workers said the measure wont serve to lower public 
spending because more employees would be suspended with pay than 
retired 
the retirements wont improve the functioning of the state on 
the contrary capable people will be lost he told the private 
news agency noticias argentinas 
union leaders supported menem a peronist during his election 
campaign last year however many have protested since he took 
office last july that his policies of budget austerity and economic 
reform have hurt union members 
menem drastically increased public service rates freed wages 
and prices opened the oil industry to foreign investment and put 
state companies up for sale in an attempt to reduce the fiscal 
deficit 
the deficit for years covered by the central banks printing 
currency is a prime cause of inflation that soared by 95 percent 
in march and 20266 percent the past 12 months 
the forced retirements are almost certain to provoke a labor 
reaction unions representing oilfield and train workers bank 
clerks and others have staged strikes or job actions this year to 
protest layoffs 
shrinking the public payroll is seen as a major test of whether 
menem is willing to take on organized labor long the backbone of 
the peronist party analysts and critics say such a confrontation 
is essential and unavoidable 
the labor ministry this year has asked labor courts to withdraw 
the legal status of unions that strike for political rather than 
economic reasons 
last week about 70 members of the brotherhood of locomotive 
engineers were fired for participating in a strike the ministry 
ruled illegal

us rep harold ford told a federal court 
monday that he has decided not to call any defense witnesses in his 
trial on charges he took political payoffs from bankers 
were going to send it to the jury and let the jury decide 
ford said as he left the courtroom where he has been on trial since 
feb 12 
the 44yearold memphis democrat is being tried on charges of 
conspiracy bank fraud and mail fraud he is accused of taking 
payoffs from former tennessee bankers jake and brother ch butcher 
jr 
prosecutors surprised defense lawyers and courtroom spectators 
last week by resting their case without calling ch butcher who 
had been expected to be a star witness against ford 
butcher charged with ford in 1987 has pleaded guilty to 
conspiring with him to commit bank and mail fraud 
assistant us attorney dan clancy declined to comment on his 
decision not to summon butcher 
ford is being tried with three former butcher aides accountant 
david crabtree and laywers douglas beaty and karl schledwitz 
the congressmans codefendants also announced they were ready 
to turn the case over the jury following final arguments 
before resting their case defense lawyers asked us district 
judge odell horton for a direct verdict of acquittal saying the 
prosecution had fallen well short of proving its case horton 
denied the motion 
defense and prosecution lawyers are scheduled to discuss 
procedural matters tuesday afternoon with horton final arguments 
are expected to begin wednesday 
government lawyers called 29 witnesses who outlined a 
complicated series of loans to ford from lending institutions once 
run by the butchers 
most of those loans were without collateral or adequate 
financial statements and ford made few if any payments on them 
until the butchers banking empire collapsed in 1983 witnesses 
said 
the butchers set off the largest banking collapse in tennessee 
history and are serving 20year bank fraud sentences in federal 
prison 
government witnesses said fords loans were moved from bank to 
bank apparently to hide them from federal examiners many of the 
loans eventually ended up at ch butchers southern industrial 
banking corp a statechartered finance company 
a federal bank examiner described sibc as a dumping ground 
for bad loans issued by the butchers 
the government says ford got some 1 million in butcher loans 
between 1976 and 1982 but he puts the loan total at 650000 ford 
said the loans have been settled since 1983 
he paid a bankruptcy trustee 25000 in 1983 to settle his 
obligations stemming from a 350000 loan from sibc to a company 
called tennford inc

a woman whose 1988 arrest on charges she 
tried to kill the head of a medical company galvanized the animal 
rights movement pleaded no contest monday in exchange for a reduced 
oneyear prison sentence 
although she strongly contested the case against her fran 
trutt 33 pleaded no contest to attempted murder possession of 
explosives and bomb manufacturing said her attorney john williams 
trutt was arrested in november 1988 after a remotecontrolled 
pipe bomb was found near the parking space of leon hirsch chairman 
of us surgical corp in norwalk 
animalrights activists had criticized us surgical for using 
anesthetized dogs to train physicians how to use surgical staples 
in place of stitches the dogs are then killed 
under the plea bargain reached late monday afternoon trutt will 
serve one year in prison followed by three years of probation as 
part of a 10year suspended sentence 
trutt who lived in new york city when she was arrested has 
been held on 500000 bond at the connecticut correctional center 
in niantic 
in pleading no contest she resisted any suggestion that she was 
guilty instead she accused hirsch of murdering dogs 
i disagree completely with guilt the evidence we needed to 
prove has not come up yet trutt told stamford superior court 
judge joette katz 
as katz reviewed the charges trutt said the one who was 
guilty of that is hirsch 
animalrights activists and trutt claimed she was set up by the 
company to discredit their movement 
us surgical said trutts conviction vindicated the company 
her convictions should send a clear message to animalrights 
activists that they can protest that they can disagree and they 
can picket peacefully but the american system of justice will 
pursue vigorously those who attempt to force their views on others 
through violence said company spokeswoman marianne scipione 
the pleas discredit the entrapment argument ms scipione said 
the plea bargain was similar to one that fell through april 5 
in the earlier agreement trutt would have pleaded no contest to 
at least one of the charges against her in exchange for a oneyear 
sentence and the right to visit her four dogs but when prison 
officials denied trutt the dogvisitation rights she opted for a 
trial williams said 
williams said trutt decided on the plea bargain because the 
prosecution was prepared to introduce tape recordings of her 
discussing details of her sex life and the murder attempt 
the sex tapes i think thats what did it it was just 
disgusting williams said after mondays hearing in state 
superior court in stamford i have been fearing this from the 
first day how long will fran be able to stand up to this 
the tapes were of telephone conversations between trutt and mary 
lou sapone who was hired by us surgical to befriend trutt and 
spy on her williams said 
the case was in the pretrial stage when mondays agreement was 
reached 
trutt could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison on 
the attempted murder charge alone

mario vargas llosa said monday he will 
continue his presidential campaign and participate in an election 
runoff against alberto fujimori a political neophyte now favored 
to win perus presidency 
i will go to the second round fighting for the reforms that 
our country needs the celebrated novelist said in a brief 
statement following a twohour meeting with campaign strategists 
and leaders of his centerright democratic front coalition 
vargas llosa said he had been ready to end his candidacy to save 
peru the turmoil of two more months of election campaigning but was 
persuaded to continue for the good of this andean nation wracked 
by economic problems and a violent guerrilla uprising 
he had been seriously considering dropping out of the runoff 
election after a disappointing showing in the april 8 opening 
round according to key figures in his campaign 
fujimori the descendent of japanese immigrants and a political 
unknown when he started the campaign ran a close second to vargas 
llosa and has emerged as a favorite in the runoff because he is 
expected to pick up the support of voters who favored leftist 
candidates 
vargas llosa said a major factor in his decision was the 
constitutional requirement for a runoff if no candidate receives a 
majority of votes effectively barring by law from withdrawing his 
name from the second round 
that appeared to confirm reports he was participating in the 
runoff expected to be held in late may or early june to fulfill a 
legal requirement and was not enthusiastic about continuing his 
presidential campaign 
key supporters said the novelist had been considering dropping 
out because he was reportedly discouraged by the prospect that he 
would lose the runoff or if he won face the prospect of governing 
the country without control of congress 
vargas llosa author of such celebrated books as the green 
house aunt julia and the scriptwriter and converations in 
the cathedral went into seclusion with his family last wednesday 
to mull over the decision on whether to continue the race 
he said monday night hoped the second round of campaigning would 
produce a clean debate on the best ways to solve perus 
problems 
news commentators and political figures close to the writer had 
said earlier monday they were convinced he would stay in the race 
some of vargas llosas closest supporters have stressed the need 
for a runoff to ensure that perus next president can claim a 
popular mandate to deal with the countrys problems 
due to the growing violence by the shining path guerrillas and 
the countrys severe economic problems peru needs a president 
elected with majority support manuel dornellas editor of the 
expreso newspaper and a close friend of the writer said last week 
the mandate that fujimori would receive after vargas llosas 
resignation could be questioned in the future opening the doors to 
a possible military coup dornellas wrote in a column in his 
paper 
fujimori had been given little chance of making the second round 
a month ago but a late surge propelled him into second place in 
the field of nine candidates 
vargas llosa had hoped for a majority to avoid a second round 
but received only 32 percent of the votes fujimori an 
agricultural engineer and former university rector running as an 
independent received nearly 30 percent 
fujimori is favored in the runoff because vargas llosa is 
unlikely to receive support from the leftofcenter ruling aprista 
party and perus leftist parties 
vargas llosa harshly criticized the leftists policies while 
fujimori conducted a conciliatory campaign 
fujimori avoided specifics in his campaign stressing instead 
general goals like improved health care and revitalized industry 
analysts say fujimori also benefited from voter concerns about 
the harsh economic austerity measures advocated by varsa llosa and 
suspicions about the oldline politicians in the democratic front 
the democratic front also fell far short of gaining a majority 
in the congressional elections 
without support in congress vargas llosa would have great 
problems as president imposing his economic austerity program aimed 
at reviving perus moribund economy

the medellin drug cartel rejects its 
longtime leader pablo escobar because of his indiscriminate 
terrorism according to a statement claiming to be from cartel 
members 
the newspaper el tiempo on monday doubted the the statements 
authenticity it said the format and lettering were different from 
previous documents sent by the traffickers to local media 
defense minister oscar botero said monday he did not know if the 
statement was authentic but that a split in the cartel does exist 
over tactics in a battle against the government 
there are many drug traffickers botero said in a tv 
interview broadcast by the cinevision news program adding that 
some members of the medellin cartel were opposed to terrorist 
violence 
the statement was issued sunday night and declared 
we the extraditables do not agree with the terrorist acts that 
pablo escobar is ordering in an indiscriminate and personal way 
previously we asked pablo escobar to stop detonating bombs and 
executing innocent people because such acts did not help our cause 
from now on we declare ourselves in total disagreement with 
the terrorist acts ordered personally by pablo escobar we reject 
the violent way escobar is forcing us to carry on his personal 
war by kidnapping torturing and threatening our families 
authorities have blamed the medellin cartel for a campaign of 
bombings and other terrorist violence that killed 238 people in the 
last eight months 
the attacks were in retaliation for a government crackdown in 
which 15 drug suspects were extradited and hundreds of traffickers 
properties seized 
last month the cartel ended a unilateral truce declared in 
january it said the renewed violence was in reply to continued 
government pressure on them 
in two weeks terrorists killed 28 police officers in medellin 
on april 5 police defused a 1650pound dynamite truck bomb on a 
main avenue in bogota during morning rush hour authorities say the 
bomb could have killed thousands 
authorities blamed the medellin cartel for all the attacks the 
statement makes it appear that escobar may have acted alone 
police dispatched 300 antiterrorist agents to medellin to 
search for escobar who they say has undergone plastic surgery to 
evade authorities 
police sources say escobars capture dead or alive is imminent 
since he is losing organization support authorities say escobar 
has killed and tortured cartel members suspected of betraying him

despite a merchants strike that shut down 
the citys famed chinatown the board of supervisors voted monday 
to tear down a quakedamaged freeway the merchants consider a vital 
link to their community 
almost 1200 shops restaurants and professional offices all 
but five small businesses signed up to take part in the 
threehour shutdown said protest organizer rose pak of the chinese 
chamber of commerce 
many of the business people attended the meeting at which the 
supervisors considered a proposal by mayor art agnos to consider 
replacing the elevated embarcadero freeway with either a surface or 
underground road 
the board voted 65 to accept agnos proposal the state 
department of transportation previously agreed to abide by the 
supervisors vote on the stateowned freeway 
supervisor angela alioto said the vote means the freeway that 
runs along the waterfront will have to be torn down but pak vowed 
to continue the fight and hold state officials to a plan to repair 
the road 
the strike began at 130 pm and chinatown came to a grinding 
halt most stores closed with shopkeepers taking their goods off 
the sidewalks 
the usual shouldertoshoulder pedestrian traffic in the heart 
of chinatown went away the noise of car horns was replaced by the 
sound of chimes blowing in the breeze 
we just got in to chinatown and already got kicked out of two 
shops said michael kiriazis a businessman from portland ore 
just as the strike began 
hundreds of chinatown business people and residents climbed 
aboard buses that shuttled them to city hall 
it has stood empty since a 71magnitude earthquake shook 
northern california six months ago killing 68 people cracking 
concrete columns supporting the waterfront roadway 
agnos recently proposed tearing down the elevated freeway long 
considered an eyesore as well as an easy entrance for drivers into 
chinatown and the restaurants of north beach and tourist 
attractions at fishermans wharf in its place the mayor suggested 
building an underground road that he believes would be safer from 
earthquakes and more aesthetically pleasing 
but pak and others such as supervisor tom hsieh contend 
repairing the existing freeway would be better because it would get 
business traffic back into the economically depressed chinatown 
area sooner and cheaper 
the agnos plan calls for expenditures of about 120 million 
mostly in federal funds over four years repairing the old 
freeway however would cost the state transportation department 
about 32 million to wrap the structures support columns in 
2inchthick steel jackets making it able to withstanding an 
83magnitude quake under that plan the freeway would reopen by 
october 
time is essential to chinatown merchants while deputy mayor 
james ho estimated business in that area is down by 8 percent pak 
placed the loss closer to 30 percent for touristdependent 
businesses and 20 percent for those relying on local residents 
she said the community is united behind the repair plan 
this is the first time in 205 years the chinese community has 
shut down their businesses to protest pak said 
while chinatown initiated its protest action the san francisco 
chronicle ran a column by 1990 pulitzer prizewinning architecture 
critic allan temko headlined freeway must go for the city to 
thrive 
temko argued for a buried freeway and said san francisco could 
once again be the beau ideal of a civilized american metropolis 
as it was before the freeway transformed one of the loveliest 
waterfronts in the world into one of the most obscene

the killings of five cab drivers in the bronx 
including three who may have been victims of the same robber have 
terrorized hundreds of drivers who are sacrificing profits for 
daytime driving 
at the seaman car service employer of the latest victim black 
flags flew monday from the antennas of cabs and drivers held a 
memorial procession 
at the flash car service co in the bronx only 15 of the 80 
drivers who normally work sunday nights showed up for work said 
dispatcher pablo feliciano 
most of them are switching to the days feliciano said 
theyre really disturbed about whats going on everybodys 
shaken up really badly 
drivers again vented their outrage later monday when 400 to 500 
cabs descended on a section of the bronx and tied up traffic after 
hearing a false report on their radios that another driver had been 
shot said officer fred weiner 
with lights on the cabs parked in the street and blocked 
traffic from 3 pm to 5 pm said weiner a police spokesman 
a canvass of the car service companies did not turn up any 
drivers missing weiner said they caused a major traffic jam 
over there 
the latest killing saturday and another three days earlier were 
dismissed by police as unrelated to the first three but the 
slayings heightened fears in an area where cab drivers havent felt 
safe for decades 
officer james terretta part of a task force of about 30 
officers investigating the slayings said police do not have a 
suspect in any of the killings but are receiving many tips 
mayor david dinkins has offered a 10000 reward for information 
leading to the killer or killers 
the terror spree began march 7 with the death of acton jones 
37 on march 14 43yearold eliot whitaker was killed and on 
april 9 paul burghard 25 was fatally shot 
in each shooting a man phoned a car service requesting a cab 
then killed the drivers with a shot to the head from a 22caliber 
gun and robbed them 
last wednesday dennis forbes 41 the driver of an unlicensed 
cab was shot in the head and killed before he had a chance to use 
a 25caliber pistol police said he kept on the seat next to him 
late saturday rafael montes de oca 38 of the seaman car 
service was shot in the head and killed after he went to pick up a 
regular customer 
the first three are connected and the last two are not said 
officer ralph st just a police spokesman he said investigators 
refused to explain why 
in new york city there are four basic types of taxicabs yellow 
cabs also known as medallion cabs roam the streets of the borough 
of manhattan and airports picking up passengers at random 
car services or socalled livery cars generally operate 
outside manhattan and are dispatched in response to customer calls 
black cars are used almost exclusively by corporate clients who 
arrange their pickups then there are thousands of unlicensed cabs 
which ply the streets 
the number of car services grew in the 1960s and 1970s when 
yellow cab drivers began avoiding the outer boroughs where they 
felt less safe and where there generally was no customer to return 
with to manhattan 
cars are dispatched from 120 bases in the bronx but some 
companies have lost up to 80 percent of their drivers at night 
because of fear caused by the deaths said tony carter a spokesman 
for the taxi and limousine commission which licenses cabs in the 
city 
customers calling cabs in the bronx now wait an hour or more for 
a car that used to be at their doorstep in 10 to 20 minutes he 
said 
last year 32 cab drivers were killed about half of them in the 
bronx said officer kim royster a police spokeswoman citywide 
3032 cabbies were robbed last year 
there are 11787 yellow cabs 35000 livery cabs and up to 
20000 unlicensed cabs in the city 
of the 1989 deaths 28 were livery drivers and four were 
medallion drivers the spokeswoman said

participants in an international media conference 
said april 10 that new communications technology and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms have combined to open up the east 
bloc to the rest of the world 
but at least one western journalist taking part in the 11th 
world media conference expressed concern over the closing of 
lithuania and other restive soviet republics to foreign reporters 
the conference meeting for the first time in moscow held a 
threeday symposium to discuss the impact of political changes in 
the soviet union on international communications 
about 500 delegates from 60 countries including many former 
heads of state attended the meeting of the association which was 
founded by the rev sun myung moon to encourage eastwest 
communications 
allen h neuharth retired chairman of gannett co inc told an 
afternoon panel discussion that advanced satellite communications 
and publishing technology have opened a new window on the world 
he said people around the world were able to watch the events 
unfolding in the soviet union and eastern europe on television and 
read about them almost immediately in newspapers 
andrei grachev deputy director of the communist party central 
committees international affairs department agreed 
the 20th century began as an age of electronics and is ending 
as the age of communications grachev said 
we are living in an age where secrets cannot be kept he 
said citing the example of foreign scientists who detected the 
1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster and satellite intelligence on the 
location of nuclear missile sites 
most panelists agreed that gorbachevs policies of perestroika 
and glasnost helped create the conditions for radical change in the 
east bloc and the speedy reporting of events in east bloc nations 
however jim laurie moscow bureau chief for abc news noted 
that in cases of unrest several republics had been closed to 
foreign reporters recently western journalists were ordered out 
of lithuania after the republic declared its independence 
the absence of foreign journalists could lead to partisan 
manipulation of the media by means of circulating stories that 
could not be independently checked laurie said 
among the delegates attending the conference were arthur a 
hartman former us ambassador to moscow joseph luns former nato 
secretarygeneral raul alfonsin former president of argentina 
alfonso michelsen former president of colombia and jihan sadat 
widow of egyptian president anwar sadat 
representatives from the soviet union included andrei grachev 
deputy director of international affairs vadim zagladin adviser 
to gorbachev economist abel aganbegyan nikolai vorontsov 
chairman of the state committee for protection of the environment 
and ivan ivanov deputy chairman of the international economic 
commission

president bushs distaste for broccoli has 
received nearly six times as much public attention as earth day 
according to a surve of peoples attentiveness to the news 
the times mirror center for the people and the press said april 
11 that its interviewers asked 1212 people age 18 and older what 
vegetable it is that bush recently said he wouldnt eat 
seventysix percent said broccoli the right answer four 
percent named some other vegetable the rest refused to answer or 
said they didnt know 
by contrast 13 percent knew that april 22 is being observed as 
earth day to honor the environment fifteen percent gave a wrong 
answer and 72 percent said they didnt know when asked what was 
special about the date 
the survey also found for the fifth month in a row that 
americans paid more attention to foreign news than domestic news 
the organization listed 18 news stories and asked people which 
was the most important 
forty percent cited an international story with 21 percent 
naming lithuanian independence also mentioned were other political 
developments in the soviet union germany and elsewhere in eastern 
and central europe two percent named the release of black leader 
nelson mandela from a south african prison 
four percent mentioned domestic stories including oil spills 
the ncaa basketball playoffs the death of 87 people in a fire at a 
social club in new york and the attempt in idaho to pass a bill 
that would severely restrict abortions 
ten percent named stories not on the list 43 percent said they 
didnt know and 2 percent refused to answer this adds up to only 
99 percent because the percentages were rounded to the nearest full 
number 
the survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted 
under the direction of princeton survey research associates from 
april 58 with the 1212 respondents interviewed by the gallup 
organization the results are subject to a sampling error of plus 
or minus three percentage points

laws mandating the use of recycled 
newsprint will slow progress toward recycling rather than speed it 
up the president and chief executive of the hearst corp said 
april 11 
frank bennack jr who is chairman of an american newspaper 
publishers association task force on recycling said such laws 
could cause the severe disruption of the newspaper and newsprint 
production industries 
society cannot legislate solutions to what are basically 
economic problems he said only a free market can produce 
solutions to economic problems that are effective and efficient 
bennack received the rochester institute of technologys isaiah 
thomas award for outstanding contributions to the newspaper 
publishing industry 
about 35 percent of all used newsprint is recycled bennack said 
there is obviously much room for improvement in those 
statistics he said and there is agreement that it can and 
will be done 
but bennack said the conversion must be voluntary 
there is a shortage of recycled newsprint because most paper 
mills are not equipped to handle recycling bennack said 
laws mandating recycling such as those in california and 
connecticut could cause imbalances and shortages in other parts of 
the country he said bennack said he also opposes such regulations 
in principle because regulated newsprint is typical of a 
nondemocratic society 
instead bennack said there should be more voluntary agreements 
by publishers to increase their use of recycled newsprint he 
called for efforts by the states to make used newsprint available 
and encourage the construction of recycling plants

attorneys for mcdonalds corp have written 
letters to newspapers advising them not to publish advertisements 
from an anticholesterol crusader who launched a national campaign 
earlier this month 
phil sokolof placed ads in newspapers april 4 asking mcdonalds 
to lower the amount of saturated fat on its menu the ads 
headlined the poisoning of america included a plea to 
mcdonalds to cut the fat in their hamburgers by 10 percent 
mcdonalds attorney joseph califano said april 13 the ad was 
inaccurate and that newspapers did not check the facts 
now they know the facts now they are all on notice to 
publish anything like that ad would be a malicious act said 
califano secretary of the department of health education and 
welfare in the carter administration 
sokolof said mcdonalds was putting up a smokescreen and 
that the ad was a public service 
mcdonalds has chosen to try and intimidate the nations 
leading newspapers said sokolof who blames a bad diet for a 
heart attack he suffered years ago he would not rule out placing 
more ads in the future 
mcdonalds spokesman chuck ebeling said the ad overstated the 
saturated fat content of mcdonalds products including an 
assertion that mcdonalds precooked hamburger meat is 215 percent 
fat 
in reality the fat content before cooking is 17 to 20 percent 
fat and is typically 195 percent fat ebeling said 
an official of a washington dcbased consumer advocacy group 
the center for science in the public interest said either way the 
saturated fat levels in fast food are too high 
to me the important part is that the general thrust of the ad 
was correct said nutrition director bonnie liebman many of 
the foods served at mcdonalds are loaded with saturated fat and 
cholesterol and eating less would reduce heart disease the 
nations largest killer

a newspaper reporter testified april 9 
as a defense witness in the murder trial of a prison inmate who 
claims he was insane when his former wife was beaten to death in 
1989 
marti goodlad heline the courts reporter covering the trial for 
the south bend tribune had been subpoenaed as a prosecution 
witness the prosecution rested its case without calling her 
alan l matheney is charged with murder and burglary in the 
march 4 1989 slaying of lisa marie bianco 
defense attorney scott l king called heline to testify about 
two interviews she conducted with matheney and three stories based 
on the interviews published in march and june 1989 
under kings questioning heline said matheney told her he went 
to ms biancos home to retrieve audio tapes recorded by ms 
bianco he believedt a ring of 
physicians performed unnecessary surgery on elderly patients for 
profit 
in the series reporter ed gonzalez said srivastava lost his 
privileges to practice at santa rosa hospital and the baptist 
memorial hospital system amid claims of unnecessary surgery 
the doctor contended the series ruined his san antonio practice 
his malpractice insurance skyrocketed and he was forced to move to 
midland where he now practices at a loss said his lawyer james 
branton 
kenstv president and general manager michael j conly said the 
station was surprised at the verdict 
at the same time we know media companies frequently lose 
verdicts at the jury level for whatever reasons but then win on 
appeal because the law recognizes the crucial role the media plays 
in educating the public and protecting our democratic 
institutions conly said 
the news series included interviews with family members of some 
of srivastavas patients and documentation of the suspensions 
kenstv stood behind the broadcast as good journalism on a subject 
of great public concern 
the stations attorney mark cannan argued that the medical 
community already knew of srivastavas hospital suspensions and 
therefore the doctors reputation was damaged before the first 
kenstv story aired 
he noted the suspensions also were reported in the san antonio 
expressnews the morning before the first broadcast 
cannan said the series ran over a period of several days and 
srivastava had an open invitation to appear 
the jury found that the reports as a whole were false and ruined 
the doctors reputation the panel also said the television station 
knew the stories were false and acted with reckless disregard for 
the truth

polands lawmakers on april 11 formally 
ended censorship one of the final relics of four decades of 
communist rule 
the decision by a 2660 vote with eight abstentions was 
largely symbolic censorship has been almost nonexistent since the 
solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was 
voted in to power last fall 
solidarity deputy juliusz braun said censorship had actually 
allowed slandering with impunity without permitting a person to 
defend himself 
the censorship law allowed the former communist authorities to 
control all kinds of publications and stage and film performances 
preventing criticism of the political system 
many poles turned to underground printing which flourished 
through the 1980s 
solidarity the east blocs first independent trade union 
fought for elimination of censorship since its foundation in 1980

a judge on april 6 ordered 25 newspapers and 
television stations to give police all film and photographs of a 
march 31 antitax riot in london 
a dozen organizations immediately opposed the order two said 
they were willing to hand over what they published and the 
remaining 11 neither opposed nor consented 
judge neil denison issued the order after a day of legal 
argument ruling the film would help police and that it was in 
the overriding public interest 
however he said in other cases the public interest may be 
better served by allowing the news media to report events freely 
and each case should be decided on its merits 
it is right as has been argued that the court should not 
automatically or routinely grant such orders denison said it 
should not be seen to be rubberstamping such applications 
the news organizations reacted angrily 
if we are seen to be a potential arm of the state journalists 
are going to be targets of the rioters said tvam news director 
jeff berliner 
geoffrey shaw lawyer for the bbc and tvam argued there had 
been 2750 police officers at the poll tax demonstration 
they should not require the media to be their eyes and ears 
if they want film it is reasonable to expect them to take it 
themselves shaw said 
the riot broke out after 40000 had gathered for a peaceful 
demonstration to protest the new poll tax by prime minister 
margaret thatchers government

president bush will ask a 17nation conference 
this week to examine the economic impact of global warming but the 
administration plans to argue its too early to propose specific 
measures to deal with the problem officials say 
the white houses cautious approach in developing responses to 
global warming is expected to unleash renewed criticism from some 
european countries that the united states is failing to provide 
leadership in dealing with the socalled greenhouse effect 
the bush administration has maintained that while there is 
widespread agreement that manmade pollutants are causing the earth 
to become warmer there remain too many unanswered questions to 
warrant pollution controls that could have widespread economic 
implications 
the president is hosting a white house conference on the 
greenhouse effect on tuesday just days before next sundays earth 
day observance during his 1988 campaign bush said such a 
conference was a top priority and would be held in his first year

yellow creek used to run black for 
miles with a stench that made people retch red blisters 
disfigured fish in the stream 
people downstream blamed pollution from a tannery and aged 
sewage treatment plant in this town of 13000 for their neighbors 
cancer deaths as well as their foul well water 
in 1983 the city engineer testified that 25 million gallons of 
raw or partly treated sewage had been dumped into yellow creek that 
year alone 
today yellow creek sparkles as it winds quietly through the 
thickly forested appalachian hills people who live along the creek 
say water quality is probably the best theyve seen in a decade and 
credit the 77 million sewage treatment plant built in 1986 
credit is also due to the yellow creek concerned citizens a 
local environmental group that has labored since 1980 filing 
lawsuits lobbying congress holding candlelight memorials for 
people they believe were fatally sickened by pollution occupying 
city hall to demand that the creek be cleaned 
but the black tide although receded left behind a legacy of 
health questions and lingering legal challenges neighbors suspect 
that years of tannery pollution deposited a layer of toxic sediment 
in the creek bed and theyre worried that a new court agreement 
will loosen pollution regulations 
over the years word of yellow creek and its lessons has 
stretched well beyond this mountainous corner of southeastern 
kentucky the tactics and victories of the yellow creek concerned 
citizens are being studied by environmental groups across america 
and in some cases around the world 
remember this struggle for the small community of yellow 
creek is in no way the only one said mm chiputa of the 
southern african environmental network of zaire we have it you 
have it and they have it 
yellow creek has gained such attention largely because of larry 
wilson the president of the citizens group wilson is 
environmental programs director at the highlander institute in new 
market tenn which holds training sessions for social activists 
who hail from bhopal india to dayhoit ky 
as a polished insider of the national environmental movement 
wilson wields influence that last month drew more than 100 
activists from massachusetts to arkansas to a meeting on the future 
of yellow creek 
john oconnor executive director of the national toxics 
campaign in boston struck a common theme among many of the 
speakers at the march 31 meeting 
we kind of feel if they can get away with poisoning people in 
yellow creek they can get away with poisoning anyone in the united 
states oconnor said 
yet yellow creek is anything but poisonous today according to 
the environmental protection agency 
epa environmental engineer ron barrow said results of a study of 
creek water and surface sediment to be released later this month 
will show significant improvements over a 1982 study of creek 
pollution 
a standard epa test using water fleas showed they not only 
survived but also reproduced in fullstrength effluent from the new 
sewage plant 
and dirk anderson manager of the middlesboro tannery co says 
it has done an excellent job in meeting state and federal 
guidelines and installed the most efficient pretreatment system 
in the tanning industry today 
he says the tannerys waste water is one of the best 
discharges in the united states and asks what is the 
controversy 
to many residents the controversy remains vivid 
an advisory warning residents of bell county since the early 
1980s not to swim in the creek drink its water or eat its fish is 
still in force 
wilson asserts that he feels really comfortable in 
estimating that 100 deaths in the valley from cancer leukemia and 
other illness can be linked to the pollution 
a 1988 study of bell county cancer rates while failing to tie 
the illness to creek pollution did show that residents face an 
increased risk of cancer 
those cancers that have been linked to occupational exposure 
to tannery work tend to be higher in bell county than the 
comparison groups said the report by lorann stallones an 
epidemiologist with the university of kentucky medical center 
and a study done in the early 1980s by vanderbilt universitys 
center for health services indicated that residents who drank well 
water tended to have higher rates of miscarriages kidney and 
digestive ailments 
a 31 million lawsuit filed by residents against the tannery in 
1983 requested longterm health monitoring a proposal supported 
then by a leading state health official 
toxic chemicals often take many years to produce their 
effects and certainly there have been significant exposures in the 
past because of the tannery effluent dr arthur l frank of the 
university of kentucky medical center said in a statement for the 
lawsuit 
no longterm monitoring is underway and the lawsuit is still 
pending in state court 
many of these concerns deal less with the creeks current water 
quality and more with the sediment on its bottom a university of 
louisville chemist probing the creek bed in 1987 found deep 
deposits of chromium a byproduct of tanning in research by the 
national cancer institute chromium is suspected of causing cancer 
in humans 
w hank graddy iii attorney for the citizens group said the 
study indicated chromium was still accumulating even after all 
these years of litigation and trying to require them to adopt 
controls 
barrow the epa engineer and bill phillips an attorney for the 
agency said they were not aware of any complaints about chromium 
deposits until a reporter posed questions about the matter earlier 
this month 
that reaction along with other official stances has made 
yellow creek residents suspicious of government regulators 
especially the epa 
creek residents are worried for example about a new court 
document signed by the city the tannery and the epa that will 
alter the amount of chromium cyanide mercury and bacteria 
allowed in tannery wastewater sent to the sewage plant 
graddy wilson and others contend the agreement will increase 
the permissable amounts and cause yellow creek to be polluted again 
attorneys for the city tannery and epa all say it would tighten 
pollution regulations not make the situation worse 
the agreement amends a 1985 consent decree that settled a 1984 
lawsuit filed by the justice department that suit alleged numerous 
violations of epa regulations because raw sewage was spilling into 
the creek 
the disagreement is so strong because each side is comparing the 
new document to a different prior arrangement the officials assert 
the provisions strengthen the 5yearold consent decree and the 
environmentalists say they are weaker than those in an operative 
pollution permit dating from 1985 
the citizens group also opposes the agreement because it would 
reduce the fines levied against the city and tannery together 
they have been fined at least 162 million for federal pollution 
violations but collections would total only 177400 under the 
pending amendment 
the burden of proof is on the victims here wilson said 
because government agencies and industry already have the money 
and lawyers in place to defend their position 
were overwhelmed he said were fighting life and 
death

after five years of not living up to its name 
the balanced budget act is under attack by some members of the 
congress that passed it but if it is the crutch they call it 
its still the only one around 
so theyll keep limping along with it toward the moving goal 
line of a balanced budget which now is supposed to be reached on 
oct 1 1993 the original deadline was next oct 1 but the 
government wont come close even with the bookkeeping gimmicks 
that keep some spending outside its limits 
deadlines dont count for that much congress is supposed to 
adopt its annual budget resolutions by april 15 each year but that 
schedule is meaningless house and senate committees will get down 
to the business of writing budget blueprints this week 
theyll have to shrink the deficit by about 37 billion or face 
the prospect of another round of automatic spending cuts later this 
year 
thats the way the grammrudman balanced budget act of 1985 
works and a conservative analyst says washington should be 
saluting its success not complaining at its shortcomings 
since it was enacted inflationadjusted federal spending has 
grown by only 14 percent annually a dramatic reversal of the 
runaway federal spending increases of previous periods according 
to daniel j mitchell of the heritage foundation mitchell says 
annual spending increases averaged 36 percent in the 1970s and 4 
percent between 1980 and 1985 
at the same time the federal budget deficit as measured for 
grammrudman purposes has declined from 212 billion in 1985 to an 
estimated 1238 billion this year adjusted for inflation the 
deficit today is less than half the size it was five years ago 
mitchell says calling that grounds for celebration not criticism 
mitchell also defends the system of automatic spending cuts that 
take effect if the projected budget deficit doesnt match 
progressively lower targets that are supposed to lead to balance in 
the 1993 budget 
the deficit ceiling for the next budget year is 64 billion 
dropping to 28 billion in the 1992 budget and to zero in 1993 the 
whole system is built around estimates not actual deficits and 
the estimates always have been exceeded in the end 
nevertheless mitchell argues that the law was a turning point 
in the battle of the budget and says many of its critics dont 
like the system because it works too well for their interests 
many legislators resent having to choose which programs will 
receive scarce funds he says special interest groups are 
having a much harder time getting access to taxpayers wallets 
sen edward m kennedy takes a different route to the same 
conclusion that the grammrudman system is worth keeping the 
massachusetts democrat wants it used in a fashion that would have 
congress devote defense budget savings the peace dividend to 
domestic programs not budget balancing 
we do not have to apply the peace dividend and we should not 
apply it to deficit reduction kennedy says instead we 
should let the grammrudman process run its course through 1993 
exactly what would have occurred without the great unexpected 
peaceful revolution of 1989 
much as congress set up the grammrudman system to control 
deficits it could not or would not deal with vote by vote 
kennedy proposes a national needs trust fund that would put defense 
savings off limits he said that should come to at least 170 
billion over the next five years and probably more kennedy said 
that would guard against interest group bargaining that would 
turn a unique opportunity into a trivial division of spoils 
let us deal with the deficit as president bush intended on the 
day he took office not with a peace dividend he did not expect 
but with a grammrudman process he has repeatedly endorsed 
kennedy said 
his trust fund proposal stands no realistic chance but it does 
fit the trend in congress which is to devise formulas and systems 
to make things happen automatically outside the traditional 
legislative process 
that amounts to an admission that congress cant control itself 
a leading advocate of change in the spending and budget system 
is rep dan rostenkowski of illinois chairman of the house ways 
and means committee who proposed a tough deficit control plan but 
isnt getting far either 
rostenkowski wants to earmark any peace dividend for deficit 
reduction raise taxes cut some politically sensitive spending 
repeal grammrudman and force congress to make hard choices again 
grammrudman is a crutch a collective confession of our 
inability to lead and our unwillingness to face up to our 
responsibilities he said in outlining his plan a month ago we 
didnt have grammrudman for the first 209 years of the republic 
lets repeal it and govern the old fashioned way elected 
officials representative of the people exercising their judgment 
making decisions in the national interest and honestly paying for 
the cost of government that their constituents demand he said 
has it been so long ago that weve forgotten how to do it

if you miss those days cbs and magicianauthor ricky jay offer 
a droll affectionate and engrossing hour thursday night of 
90sstyle vaudeville learned pigs and fireproof women you 
just dont see this stuff on tv nowadays 
the shows title comes from jays book a history of such 
esoteric acts as pigs who could do arithmetic and women who could 
endure steakbroiling temperatures 
the entertainments are interspersed with backstage business 
historic footage and photos illustrating the extent to which 
jugglers magicians and daredevils would go to thrill an audience 
jay opens the show in los angeles warner grand theater with his 
own amazing ability to throw playing cards farther faster and 
harder than anyone in history unfortunately this theater is too 
small he allows 
then he demonstrates why the theater is too small defending 
himself against various fruits up to and including a belligerent 
watermelon for further instruction see his book cards as 
weapons 
that dates back to my childhood in brooklyn when i started 
throwing baseball cards jay said in an interview i discovered 
i could hit things 
the pace is wonderful if shakuntala devi the lady who 
calculates cube roots at a glance doesnt thrill you and frankly 
extracting cube roots does rank right up there with dental work 
theres another act right behind it 
like michael moschen a man who juggles himself who 
delightfully animates a cystal ball 
or meagan riesel a 100pound strongwoman for the 90s who 
shows off her mastery of the odic force a skill that lets her 
resist being lifted or displaced by much stronger heavier people 
jamey turner a virtuoso on glass harp plays beethovens ode 
to joy on 60 waterfilled brandy snifters and quickchange 
artist michael mcgiveney plays all the parts in a scene from the 
stage play oliver twist 
john gaughan the leading designer of magical illusions shows 
off his restoration of an automaton acrobat a fascinating 
mechanical device built by the great magician robert houdin in 1847 
and steve martin the comedian brings in lost footage of 
his vaudevillian grandfather the great flydini one of the 
greatest magicians of all time who produces all manner of innocent 
objects from a startling place 
these are people that i am particularly fascinated by jay 
said this is my world these people are all to some extent my 
friends and some are also my very close friends 
all these delightful acts are interspersed with amusing 
backstage business a woman in bo peep outfit leads an enormous hog 
and a very small bike offstage howd it go jay asks 
not so good says bo looking tired he wouldnt do the 
wheelie

in an economy gone ecological some of the old 
marketing concepts that once could be relied upon to sell products 
have developed a reputation as bad as noxious chemicals 
in the best of the marketing tradition however youll find few 
companies complaining while their tested concepts have been 
degraded they have embraced the new whats new sells and they 
know it 
they accept the idea that they just cant use disposable 
without accepting consequences and that in selling cars and 
gasoline they must steer clear of horsepower claims and talk about 
low mileage and clean burning 
in cereals health is tops and taste is now secondary in a 
cholesterolconscious world the beef industry talks about leanness 
rather than juiciness and fastfood outlets are forced to 
reconsider their recipes 
annual reports of paper companies show clean streams rather than 
logfilled ones and those of heavy manufacturers are more likely 
to show the factorys beautiful front lawn than the parts inventory 
in the rear 
in marketing today you must be against pollution for recycling 
against fat and for lean for peace rather than military might and 
view diets as necessary to good health rather than for making a 
person swimsuit slim 
you can do no wrong if you align your company with peace 
health equal rights sexual equality clean environment 
patriotism education naturalness opportunities for minorities 
community mindedness family life 
while such concerns have forced almost every company in america 
to rethink its values and recast its image the effort has not been 
without benefits like anything else these issues can be used to 
promote goods and services 
in short and in a marketing sense those movements designed to 
improve the quality of life have come of age they are powerful 
enough to sell goods and services 
while the observance of earth day on april 22 is the proximate 
reason for all the attention being given such issues they have 
been developing for a long time simultaneously with a weakening of 
resistance 
twenty years ago for example some of the nations biggest 
paper companies were reluctant to spend the ninefigure sums 
required to clean up their operations which were among the largest 
polluters of waterways 
the council on economic priorities a volunteer group began 
rating them on compliance with environmental standards and 
discovered that paper companies with the best environmental records 
tended to have the highest priceearnings ratios on their stocks 
it helped sell environmental issues 
peace became a practical dollar and sense issue too various 
groups developed mutual funds that included shares of companies 
deemed peaceful that is not connected with military matters in 
any way some did fairly well 
health consciousness was being raised at about the same time 
and when president jimmy carter denounced the threemartini lunch 
as a waste of money it already was on its way out liquor 
consumption statistics document it 
the consumer movement which began even before the 
environmental health and womens movements was then at full 
strength denouncing the very notions that bigger was better that 
glitz was chic that exclusive was better 
all movements develop their radical fringes and tend to be 
scorned at some time by some people but if they have the goods so 
to speak they gain acceptance even if grudgingly 
acceptance is grudging no more for many of the movements that 
began in the 1960s and 1970s theyve come a long way and you know 
it when corporate marketing people use their themes to sell goods 
and services

only in america could an irish bandleader 
in a town of polish immigrants transform that most hokey of ethnic 
music into sounds worthy of carnegie hall 
you see polkas dont come just with kielbasa anymore 
slush down some beer and polish sausage thats all some 
people see when they think of the polka said fred hudy 
president of the international polka association in chicago 
were trying to get rid of that image 
theyre definitely out of the closet now said ian dove 
spokesman for the national academy of recording arts and sciences 
which added a polka category to the grammys five years ago 
the jimmy sturr orchestra is riding the new wave of polka 
popularity winning the grammy four straight years sturr has 
played at new yorks carnegie hall six times the only polka band 
to perform that much at the celebrated concert auditorium 
once relegated to the stomping grounds of local sausage fests or 
to sunday morning radio broadcasts the polka is following latin 
american and cajun into the musical mainstream 
its big business said sturr 42 an irish bandleader who 
lives in the orange county village of florida about 30 miles 
northwest of new york city 
his 10piece orchestra has recorded 76 albums 75 polka and one 
country on his starr records label which he started in 1964 the 
label records other polka country and ethnic groups including 
bobby vinton 
getting its own grammy category has completed the legitimization 
of a musical form once thought squarer than the square dance until 
1985 polka music was lumped into the catchall folk category dove 
said 
it was felt that polka was a form of music unto itself he 
said similarly the grammy trustees created separate categories 
for reggae tropical latin and mexicanamerican music in recent 
years 
sturr started his first band when he was 11 though irish he 
was surrounded by polishamericans who made up fourfifths of his 
hometowns population sturr grew up with the polka and fell in 
love with the music he began recording and touring with his polka 
band in the musical maelstrom of the 1960s when most people viewed 
the polka as a dance confined to the bowling alley crowds of 
milwaukee or buffalo 
its moved out of that ethnic category sturr said now 
everybody enjoys the polka when i was a kid and somebody said 
hey what kind of band do you have id be embarrassed to say im 
in a polka band 
minnesota gov rudy perprich declared 1990 the year of the 
polka thousands attend polka festivals each year in minnesota 
which claims to have the granddaddy of all polka fests in 
gibbon minn 
like cajun and country the shrill brass and reedy woodwinds of 
some polka styles revolve around the accordion which is enjoying 
its own return from corn purgatory 
its a happy music its a snappy music hudy said your 
feet automatically tap 
several rock groups have transformed themselves into new wave 
polka bands turning out what sturr calls punk polka one such 
band rotundi has scored a parody polka hit with polka till you 
puke 
in the united states the polka is most closely associated with 
polishamericans yet the polka invented in 1830 by a peasant 
girl in bohemia now part of czechoslovakia never was popular in 
poland even though it was influenced by polish styles of music and 
dance 
as the polka swept through europe in the 1830s and 40s poland 
was trying to regain its independence from russia other europeans 
considered the polka a twostep with a hop thrown in a dance of 
sympathy for polands oppression but the poles felt the polka 
mocked the way polish women danced said charles keil american 
studies professor at the state university of buffalo 
europeans had a general fascination with poland as a 
struggling country whose borders had been violated thats 
where polka dots came from everybody was naming things after the 
polka said keil whose book polka happiness is being 
published by temple university 
from europe the polka traveled around the world it became 
paraguays national dance while american indians out west adopted 
a form of polka in the 1860s 
those indians think of the polka as their traditional music 
nowadays keil said 
while sturrs polishamerican polkas win grammys 
mexicanamerican bands in southern texas are producing the most 
innovative polka music today keil said 
the mexicanamerican style mixes latin and polka rhythms while 
sturrs eastern polish style relies on woodwinds accordions and a 
frantic beat in the midwest the slower german polka with its 
brassy oompahs is popular while plucky banjos highlight country 
polka styles 
polkas must be written in twofour time two quarter notes per 
measure a tempo which gives the music its dancy beat the songs 
can range from the toofat polka with its whimsical chorus 
i dont want her you can have her shes too fat for me to 
the more sentimental did you ever fall in love polka from one 
of sturrs albums 
songwriter steve lopuch has contributed three songs to sturrs 
records including titles on his 1988 grammy album i remember 
warsaw and this years winner all in my love for you 
lopuchs source material ranges from nursery rhymes in the 
crooked man polka to allamerican denim in the blue jeans 
polka 
when these people came the irish polish lithuanians 
germans italians they didnt have nothing said lopuch a 
retired dairy farmer in the montgomery county town of florida 30 
miles west of albany not to be confused with the village of 
florida where sturr grew up they planned to stay a few years 
make some money and go back but most didnt go back they stayed 
and so did their music 
lopuch has written about a dozen polkas based on nursery rhymes 
which he hopes to have recorded by sturrs orchestra or some other 
polka band 
im hoping grandparents will buy it for their grandchildren so 
they dont listen only to rock lopuch said 
keil has similar hopes that more young people will turn to 
polka local polka fests are dying out because a younger 
generation has not come along and gotten into the dancing of it in 
any big way he said 
he predicts there will be a revival of polka dancing its so 
good its eating drinking dancing partying music because it 
survived so long despite rock n roll despite tv because some 
fanatic people wont give it up its a matter of young people 
getting really bored with postpunk nonsense people will see that 
community dancing is a powerful thing

for novelist marcel proust a madeleine 
triggered a remembrance of things past for chef and artist 
shirley king prousts novel triggered thoughts of things to come 
those things recently came together when king prepared dinner 
from foods in prousts novel and exhibited her photographs of 
prousts france pairing each dish and picture with a quote from 
the author 
and to set the stage for what king called a real proustian 
evening she chose music from the belle epoch rather dreary 
sort of quartet music 
as proust who lived 18711922 wrote lavishly of his memories 
king lavished her attentions on each dish skewering a beef roast 
with carrots that had been cut into flower shapes spinning sugar 
to accompany homemade pistachio and coffee ice creams served of 
course with madeleines or giving a pineapple and truffle salad a 
japanese appearance 
the japanese influence was quite strong in those days not 
that it would have reached out to that country house but anyway 
said king author of the 1979 book dining with marcel 
proust a practical guide to french cuisine of the belle epoch 
charmed by a description of chunks of aspic king served the 
beef cold as the main course for proust the beef was couched 
by the michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly 
like transparent blocks of quartz 
i chose the dishes by the quotes said king the quotes 
are so lovely 
the meal served april 5 to about 60 people was prepared with 
the help of advanced students at the french culinary institute and 
is part of the schools artist and cuisine dinner series it 
was the first at which the artist and chef were the same person 
kings dreamy photographs hung around the institutes dining 
room feature the landscape of the village of illierscombray 
where proust spent childhood vacations also among the 18 pictures 
are shots of the house where he spent holidays 
king also has written saucing the fish and her fish the 
basics is to be published later this year a former restaurant 
chef she teaches cooking in new york 
she became interested in proust after a friend recommended him 
more than 15 years ago it was my habit and still is to read 
all of one author and as she read she noticed the attention he 
paid to food 
his descriptions still turn me on she said in an interview 
before dinner it makes me very interested and passionate about 
food 
with the first few pages of remembrance of things past one 
becomes aware of the brilliantly told minute observations of food 
which proust weaves into his story king writes in the 
introduction to her book very soon meals and culinary happenings 
become an integral part of the book 
using his own past prousts monumental novel tells of innocence 
lost love and friendship sin and despair and the search for 
truth written in seven volumes three of them published 
posthumously the memories of the title are set off by the taste of 
tea and a madeleine a small rich cake baked in a shellshaped mold 
the men at kings dinner were given red carnations stems 
wrapped in silver paper as was done for proust at his dinner at 
mme swanns the same dinner at which he first encountered caviar 
kings first course blinis with caviar was inspired by a 
comment that would gladden the hearts of the sqeamish on the 
other side of my plate was a smaller plate on which was heaped a 
blackish substance which i did not know then to be caviar i was 
ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not 
to let it enter my mouth 
that was followed by skate with black butter the beef the 
salad and dessert 
the salad an unusual combination of endive pineapple and 
truffles was made by prousts mother to impress a visiting 
ambassador but the ambassador after fastening for a moment on 
the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer ate it 
with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat and without 
disclosing to us what he thought of it 
and so we shall not

doreen edwards third rejection letter arrived 
earlier this month 
i was disappointed but not squashed flat she said about the 
return of her third manuscript from mills and boon publisher of 
romantic fiction 
hoping to hone her talent edward recently came down from her 
home in wales husband grudgingly in tow to attend a mills and 
boon writers workshop at the london book fair 
mills and boon britains equivalent of harlequin in the united 
states depends heavily on selfstarters who are willing to slave 
over a typewriter between household chores or holding down a job 
the company receives 5000 unsolicited manuscripts a year and 
editorial director frances whitehead crisscrosses the country to 
dispense encouragement and criticism to her authors 
more than 100 people mostly women recently turned up to hear 
whitehead and one of her bestselling authors sally wentworth 
dispense nuggets of advice 
among the pearls of wisdom for romance writers 
disease isnt taboo but messy disease is 
the best time to submit manuscripts is midjanuary after the 
prechristmas deluge 
the hero should have a ruthless streak women dont fantasize 
about apologizers 
submit more than one title chances are your first choice has 
been used before 
the formula for a mills and boon novel is that the couple 
meets on page one and after 50000 words they have decided to spend 
the rest of their lives together its up to the writer to fill in 
the rest whitehead said 
mills and boon has been publishing romantic fiction since 1908 
when gerald mills and charles boon founded the company last year 
it sold 15 million books in 19 languages 
the japanese are not keen on books set in australia and the 
french dont like books set in france because they dont want 
anyone else writing about them whitehead said 
sally wentworths 43 books including the lord of misrule 
and wish on the moon have sold 15 million copies in 13 years 
but the audience gasped when wentworth confided that her success 
was preceded by 14 rejection letters 
wentworth said she writes 2000 words a day generating about 
four books a year she said she combs the birth columns of the 
conservative press for characters names such as verity charlotte 
and skye 
only a handful of men attended the seminar which isnt 
surprising only two of mills and boons stable of 300 permanent 
authors are male and they write under womens names 
dorothy minton 45 was waiting to hear mills and boons verdict 
on deceptively yours her third offering her first two were 
rejected with words of encouragement she declined to give away too 
much of the plot but said it was racier than the work of that 
other giantess of the genre barbara cartland 
minton took up writing when a medical problem with her shoulders 
forced her to give up her florist job her daughterinlaw fiona 
27 is spending her maternity leave writing the rainy day book 
under the pseudonym jinx moran and is on chapter three 
i want my baby to be late so i can finish it she said 
most of the aspiring writers want to make enough money to quit 
their daytime jobs or pay for an extra vacation or car 
whitehead said authors receive royalties of 4 percent of the 
paperback book profits the average paperback sells for 140 pounds 
230 less than half the price of an ordinary paperback 
among the most successful authors are wentworth charlotte lamb 
and penny jordan 
wentworth makes no claim to literary greatness 
mills and boon books are often looked down on and critics 
have no time for them she told the audience but they are 
extremely popular and the readers know exactly what they are 
getting and they will enjoy it

editors note forty years ago on june 25 communist north 
korea invaded south korea to begin a threeyear war that would cost 
thousands of american lives and billions of dollars in aid and if 
the cold war has ended in eastern europe the two koreas today 
remain armed camps now the united states is cutting back its 
troops and closing three air bases in south korea leaving many 
wondering what effect that will have on the balance of power

once a month the huge sprawling city 
of seoul comes to a standstill as shrieking sirens and loudspeakers 
warn 10 million citizens to seek cover in airraid shelters 
for 20 minutes the frenzied economic and political capital of 
south korea one of the worlds largest cities is hushed the only 
movement along wide boulevards and narrow alleys are green army 
jeeps on surveillance patrols checking to be certain citizens 
complied 
thirty miles north beyond barbed wire and concrete bunkers 
lies the most heavily fortified border in the world and one of the 
last frontiers of the cold war the demilitarized zone separating 
south and north korea 
while eastern europe celebrates the collapse of communism and 
the easing of eastwest tensions the korean peninsula continues an 
arms buildup with virtually no signs of detente between the 
capitalist south and the communist north 
for south korea security and war preparedness are number one 
national priorities and the monthly airraid drills are symbolic of 
the times in both koreas billions of dollars a year are spent on 
armies and weapons 
nothing remotely comparable to events in eastern europe is 
happening in north korea says us ambassador donald p gregg 
if the hallmark of south korea is progress the hallmark of the 
north is stagnation 
despite this grim evaluation the united states primary sponsor 
and chief ally of south korea for four decades is making plans to 
reduce its 43000 forces new economic realities are forcing 
alterations in the two nations relationship 
to most south koreans the special brotherhood with the united 
states has had a single purpose to deter or defeat a new invasion 
from the north many americans see wider economic issues and point 
to a 47 billion trade imbalance and the current deployment of 
troops as altruism their country can illafford 
restructuring of delicate bilateral alliances poses tough 
questions for those trying to protect american interests as well as 
preserve peace and stability can south korea which has cost 
americans dearly in blood and treasure become selfreliant as us 
troops are withdrawn 
for its part south korea faces a critical turning point in its 
defense posture as it enhances its military capabilities and looks 
to develop new and independent thinking for the next century 
among factors influencing the united states and south korea are 
these 
communist north korea has more soldiers more tanks more 
artillery pieces and more planes than the south and many analysts 
say it will hold a military advantage for at least the next five 
years 
north korea is widely believed to be nearing capability to 
develop a nuclear weapons program and it reportedly has agreements 
to sell arms in the middle east 
northeast asia is unique in that it engages the vital interests 
of four of the worlds great powers the united states the soviet 
union japan and china strategically us policy has been that no 
single nation or coalition of nations should control the resources 
and people of the region 
despite all the hostility and suspicion between the two koreas 
and all the energy that has been invested in the construction of 
separate and competitive societies koreans continue to cherish the 
hope however bleak of national unification 
the ideological and civil war that began in 1950 between north 
and south korea lasted 37 months more than 5 million americans 
served in korea with 140000 casualties 
the country was rubble and 2 million south korean soldiers and 
civilians had died by the time the armistice was signed in 1953 
american forces the largest contingent among 16 nations who fought 
on the side of the south were seen as heros 
in the immediate aftermath of the bloody and horrible civil war 
it became a national passion to make certain that americans never 
leave korea again americans became the key deterrent to renewed 
communist aggression 
now radical students yell yankee go home burn effigies of 
uncle sam and stomp american flags painted on roadways at college 
campuses 
the korean war remembered vividly by the 1950s generation is 
only a textbook to todays korean soldier an independent 
consumeroriented conscript who thinks korea is no 1 and is 
generally indifferent toward the united states 
not so long ago korean officers accepted american decisions but 
nowadays military observers say they too are quick to engage in 
confrontation on virtually all matters there has to be a 
negotiated yes or a negotiated no says one american 
for a quick look at korea nothing is quite as sobering as a 
visit to the barren no mans land along the 25mile wide 
demilitarized zone rimmed with barbed wire bunkers and guardposts 
along both sides of the 155milelong border 
on a spring day the undulating hills and valleys of the dmz are 
green with new grass and yellow wildflowers flocks of birds flap 
overhead 
except for the camouflage netting the personnel carriers the 
milelong antitank barriers the soldiers moving in full combat 
gear and the sound of jeeps the dmz could be a rural scene from a 
tourist brochure 
dmz duty is the closest assignment the army has to combat 
soldiers in flak vests and helmets carry loaded automatic weapons 
and focus their sights directly into enemy territory sentries with 
binoculars watch communist guards from behind sandbagged guardposts 
clashes along the border are fewer than they used to be but 
incidents still occur 
in february on the eve of a visit by us secretary of defense 
dick cheney 20 shots from a north korean guardpost hit a south 
korean guardpost there were no injuries the south did not return 
the fire 
in march us and south korean forces unearthed what they said 
was an invasion tunnel dug under the border by north korea this 
was the fourth such tunnel found and the korean defense minister 
said there could be as many as 20 more 
sen tim wirth dcolo who favors cutbacks in the military 
said his first visit to the korean border this winter stunned him 
and made him see the threat of a north korean attack in a new light 
analysts agree such a threat remains serious especially from 
terrorism and subversion and could be increased by political 
unrest on either side south koreans raise the specter of an 
allout invasion

ultimately the question is can south korea can deter communist 
aggression can it become selfreliant 
few military systems have been affected by other powers as 
profoundly as that of south korea the united states helped create 
the countrys armed forces designed its organizational structure 
and selected its first officers 
south korea this spring is embarking on an ambitious military 
improvement program that entails modernizing its forces by 
purchasing new weaponry developing its aerospace program changing 
its defense hierarchy and democratizing its military 
president roh taewoo a former general calls it the 
koreanization of the military and its a major step toward 
creating an armed forces seen as more korean and less american 
the centerpiece of the south korean military is the prestigious 
korean military academy founded in 1946 and consciously modeled on 
the us military academy at west point 
all of south koreas presidents have been kma graduates since 
park chunghee who gained power in a 1961 military coup with some 
of his classmates the 11th class in 1955 produced former president 
chun doohwan and his successor roh 
although civilian control of the military is taught at the 
academy the sense of professional elitism an almost puritanical 
ethical code and a devotion to national service has led in the past 
to a willingness by the military to take over the reins of 
government if a threat to national security was perceived 
the 650000 soldiers sailors airmen and marines in service are 
better fed better trained and better housed than ever before 
military service is compulsory draftees are paid only about 15 a 
month but theres a growing if controversial effort to improve 
their lot 
revisions suggested for a new military code of conduct became 
public recently and included controversial guidelines regarding the 
use of firearms rules for controlling civilians during violent 
protests and new limitations as to when and if a soldier could 
disobey the order to fire 
theres also a suggested ban on political involvement and on 
violence and abuse in the barracks 
the military like korean society is vertical rather than 
horizontal in structure and koreans used to knowing their place 
among associates feel comfortable in the rigid authoritarian chain 
of command 
within the us military theres a willingness to send things 
up the chain says a longtime western observer but in korea 
the hierarchy serves to send things down the chain 
an american meeting a military colleague asks what class he was 
in to determine if they have mutual friends a korean officer asks 
a new acquaintance his class to determine who is superior 
koreans still have a reluctance to pass along bad news fearing 
they will be blamed and punished according to us officers in 
the us army it wouldnt be held against an officer to report the 
enemy advancing on his flank but in the korean army he could be 
reprimanded experts say 
assessing the korean soldier a western military expert says 
for a major war on the ground us troops are the best but if i 
had to defend an obstacle a country and if it required hard 
close fighting with limited objectives id go for the koreans 
if you tell a korean soldier go do it hell go do it no 
matter what the cost no matter if its his life 
in military terms north korea seems to have more of everything 
more soldiers more tanks more planes more submarines and more 
artillery 
the majority of communist troops are deployed offensively near 
the border north korean missiles could reach seoul in two to three 
minutes bombers in eight minutes tanks in two to three hours 
is there any hope of an arms reduction between the koreas 
on april 4 south korea formally agreed to a us plan to cut 
back 7000 of the 43000 american troops by 1993 all 
noncombatants they include 2000 air support personnel assigned 
to three us air bases which cheney announced in january would be 
closed as a costsaving measure 
this was called the first stage of us withdrawal further cuts 
could come in 199495 after a review of the military situation on 
the peninsula thirdstage cuts would come after 1996 
north korea has demanded a withdrawal of all us troops 
seoul and washington are looking for north korea to reciprocate 
with some form of comparable reduction south korean defense 
minister lee sanghoon has said he expects arms control talks in 
the middle 1990s after concluding a nonaggression pact and a peace 
treaty 
washington and moscow are pressuring the koreas to talk 
seriously on ways of building mutual confidence rapidly improving 
trade and diplomatic ties between anticommunist seoul and moscow 
are seen as a moderating influence between the two koreas 
war preparedness is so costly many observers say economics will 
drive the koreas together long before ideology 
since 1950 washington has spent roughly 59 billion dollars in 
korea on war and military aid ranging from loans and weapons 
procurement to the training of korean officers 
in addition to containing communism the alliance between south 
korea and the united states has been a remarkable economic success 
story the united states has helped south korea become the worlds 
10th largest trading nation with 1989 trade volume of 130 billion 
it is the countrys growth that has spurred washington to demand 
that seoul open its markets wider to us products and pay more of 
the costs of keeping us troops 
south korea now absorbs 19 billion in land leases and pays 
about 300 million in direct local costs an average of 50000 per 
american soldier the united states puts in an equal amount plus 
an additional 3 billion to 4 billion for indirect costs such as 
wages which would be incurred regardless of where the troops were 
stationed 
having the american forces in korea has been good business for 
korea 
us forces korea if viewed as a business conglomerate of us 
and korean employees ranks as the fourth largest employer in 
korea exceeded only by the giant companies of hyundai samsung and 
daewoo 
as the efforts continue to reduce tensions and bring the koreas 
closer together american businessmen and diplomats hope the united 
states will be able to develop an economic presence which is 
appropriate to its military and political influence 
us ambassador gregg is optimistic 
we are clearly in a constructive transition moving from our 
role as a military alliance to a new and broader role as an 
economic and political partnership he says we are i hope 
entering a new decade in which the korean question will finally be 
solved

soldiers of the rok army have to be 
hard 
in the army of the republic of korea they run naked before 
breakfast swim icy rivers in the winter take orders without 
question and get mainly veggies to eat 
in the army of south korea they may even be whipped 
us soldiers have seen young korean soldiers with whip lashes 
across their backs 
reformers are demanding the armed forces of south korea 
eradicate vestiges of the old japanese imperialist practice of 
kihap or manhandling which often resulted in fatal injuries 
during disciplinary punishment 
a field commander in south koreas 1st division smiled when 
asked about charges that discipline in the rok army had sometimes 
been fatal 
corporal punishment is almost nonexistent nowadays he 
said we used to batter them 
korean soldiers also are reluctant to pass along bad news 
fearing they will be blamed and punished us officers say 
at the annual ussouth korean joint military maneuvers two 
years ago a korean soldier killed himself after a mock battle 
rather than admit to his superiors he had misplaced his weapon 
training for korean soldiers is like yearround boot camp they 
run for 45 minutes before breakfast every morning most often naked 
and with their superiors running alongside barking orders 
in winter they jump in rivers and lakes with chunks of ice to 
build up stamina 
officers have black belts in martial arts and soldiers are 
expected to become proficient in taekwondo fencing and judo 
food is rice fruit and pickled cabbage called kimchi 
staff sgt kim moonsoo served three years in the korean army 
before he became an american citizen joined the us army and was 
assigned to the 25th infantry division based in hawaii 
training in the us army says kim is a piece of cake 
the us army he says wants you to take responsibility the 
south korean army only wants you to take orders

it was one of the darkest moments in us 
history the last americans were scrambling aboard helicopters to 
flee vietnam defeated by a communist enemy they had fought so 
long ap special correspondent george esper who spent 10 years 
covering the vietnam war was in saigon when south vietnam fell 15 
years ago he was expelled five weeks later by the new regime here 
he recounts those final days in vivid detail 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the colonel had a crazed look in his eyes despair in his voice 
facing a calamity that on this final day would bring to an end a 
century of western influence in vietnam 
a beaten man he stood at a south vietnamese war memorial in lam 
son square in saigon in happier times it was a place where 
revelers had exploded firecrackers in joyous celebrations 
but on this wednesday morning april 30 1975 the colonel and 
thousands like him had been told in a broadcast by the saigon 
government to stack their weapons in surrender to the feared 
communist north vietnamese 
i stood there with him face to face trying to sort out what 
was going on 
the colonel frantically waved his arms 
fini fini he shouted 
his right hand moved to his holstered pistol would he take aim 
at me a symbol of the american allies he might have felt had 
abandoned him and his countrymen in these final days 
the colonel saluted the statue raised the pistol to his head 
and fired he fell dead at my feet 
his war was over 
there was fear panic and humiliation among the south vietnamese 
troops pouring into saigon from their outposts and garrisons to lay 
down their weapons and those trying to flee the country with their 
american allies 
intoxicating panic the commander of saigons defenses 
called it in an interview just before he slipped out of the country 
on an american helicopter 24 hours before the south vietnamese 
government surrendered 
on the day of saigons fall 15 years ago i walked through city 
streets littered with boots and olive green uniforms discarded by 
south vietnamese soldiers who were trapped and faced the wrath of 
the communists they had changed into civilian clothes in efforts 
to hide their military service for fear of reprisals 
the pentagon east the oncebustling us military 
headquarters inside tan son nhut air base lay gutted by grenades 
destroyed by the americans themselves 
an american flag lying in the streets outside the us embassy 
was being trampled on a colleague and i picked it up 
north vietnamese soldiers in loosefitting uniforms and pith 
helmets stood guard at positions once manned by crewcut 
spitandpolish american marines 
i watched soldiers raise the red blue and yellow flag of the 
national liberation front the viet cong over the presidential 
palace 
in the final days scores of vietnamese friends journalism 
colleagues army officers and politicians had lined up outside the 
ap bureau asking me to intercede with the us embassy to get them 
out of the country some followed me around slept outside my 
apartment not letting me out of their sight thinking that if i 
left they somehow would escape with me 
left behind in the hysteria of the disorganized evacuation were 
more than 400 friends and allies of the united states including 
vietnamese embassy employees and their families they had been 
promised safe passage out of the country 
at the ap bureau the incoming teletype from new york 
headquarters clicked off a message from wes gallagher then the 
president and general manager of the ap he advised there might be 
one more helicopter 
any of you want to leave if it works out he asked 
gallagher thanks for your offer i replied we want to 
stay 
only minutes earlier the last american helicopter had left with 
the last of 800 us marine reinforcements who had provided 
security for the evacuation its flight ended the evacuation of 
1000 americans and 6000 vietnamese including many of the top 
military commanders thought to be marked for death because of their 
association with the united states 
a rear guard of 11 us marines scrambled to the sixth floor of 
the embassy then to the rooftop landing pad to await the final 
helicopter a crowd of vietnamese panicked by rumors of a 
communist bloodbath that never materialized followed desperately 
seeking a way out of the country 
the marines tossed tear gas into the stairwells to fend them 
off suddenly off in the sunrise they spotted the ch46 helicopter 
for which they had been anxiously waiting 
the happy marines fired a red smoke grenade to guide it to the 
landing pad north vietnamese forces ringing the city withheld 
their fire fearing retaliation by american bombers flying cover 
for the evacuation the marines jumped aboard and the helicopter 
whirled out of sight over the south china sea to an aircraft 
carrier

they were the last american military men to leave at 757 am 
just like that 30 years of american involvement ended so suddenly 
that even the north vietnamese seemed surprised 
most us military forces had left vietnam two years earlier 
under terms of the paris peace agreement but 50 american military 
attaches and 1200 civilians remained at the defense attaches 
headquarters which had replaced the us military command in the 
pentagon east an additional 150 us marine guards remained at the 
embassy 
the final evacuation was hastened by a heavy artillery attack a 
signal by the north vietnamese that they wanted the americans out 
of the country immediately tuesday april 29 dawned with a 
threehour rain of rockets and artillery shells onto tan son nhut 
air base 
two recently arrived marines charlie mcmahon 21 from woburn 
mass and darwin judge 19 from marshalltown iowa were on their 
watch at the us defense attaches headquarters on the base 
mcmahon had been home on leave less than two weeks earlier ill 
be back he told his father as he left for vietnam 
instead mcmahon and judge were struck down at random by an 
imprecise north vietnamese rocket in the final hours of shooting 
they were the last two americans killed in vietnam 
in another tragic incident a helicopter plunged into the south 
china sea during the evacuation two other marines capt william 
nystul 29 of coronado calif and lt michael shea 25 of el 
paso texas were killed 
during the evacuations helicopters swarmed over saigon landing 
on the rooftop pad at the embassy and at tan son nhut air base 
itself 
hundreds of south vietnamese soldiers converged on the base 
seeking an escape route by air south vietnamese guards angry that 
the americans were pulling out without them fired their rifles 
into the air over buses carrying the evacuees to board the 
helicopters 
we want to go too they shouted 
hundreds of vietnamese tried to push their way through a 
chainlink fence gate in the center of the 14foot high wall 
surrounding the us embassy compound 
vietnamese men and women tried to claw their way over the wall 
in danger of losing control of the situation and of being 
overwhelmed by the crowd frantic battlegarbed marines and 
civilians beat them back with pistol and rifle butts feet and 
fists they pulled westerners who couldnt break through the mob 
over the wall by their collars 
one young woman an amerasian clung to the neck of an american 
photographer 
i will die if i stay she cried out 
mothers held their children above the crowd begging the 
americans inside to take them with them 
take it ive got to fight one marine yelled as he thrust a 
tiny vietnamese boy into the arms of a german clergyman minutes 
later with the 6monthold baby cradled in his arms the clergyman 
was in a helicopter en route to one of the ships in the south china 
sea 
the evacuation ended at 420 am the next morning april 30 
twentyfive minutes later us ambassador graham martin left 
carrying the american flag another group of officers departed less 
than an hour later then the marine rear guard left minutes before 
8 am closing the doors to vietnam 
now all ties were severed and an eerie quiet fell across the 
capital as 3 million saigonese anxiously awaited the triumphant 
march of the north vietnamese and viet cong into the city at noon 
the conquering troops rolled down unity boulevard in tanks and 
trucks to claim the presidential palace the white house of south 
vietnam 
at some point to my surprise two north vietnamese soldiers who 
looked no older than 20 casually strolled into the ap office they 
made no threats or demands to me they seemed like curious country 
boys who were awed by the big city 
we offered them cokes and some stale poundcake the only food 
and drink we had left in the office we took out a map and they 
showed us the invasion routes their forces had taken on their 
advance to saigon 
they talked about their homes in the north and how much they 
missed their families they showed us photos they had carried 
through the jungles and monsoons for months 
for 10 years i had been writing about the north vietnamese 50 
killed 100 killed cold statistics in battlefield reports i had 
seen them in death their bodies stacked across the killing fields 
i had seen them in prisoner of war camps and in delegations that 
came to saigon for peace talks 
now they were standing in front of my eyes i thought to myself 
theyre the same as the south vietnamese they have the same 
feelings the same fears the loneliness for families for nearly 
two decades theyve been killing each other and taking so many 
americans with them 
for them and for me the war was finally over

to the people of plelo us army lt robert 
hamsley is an unsung hero of world war ii now more than 45 years 
after he led an american platoon into the french village and wiped 
out a contingent of heavily armed germans hamsley will be honored 
by the town he saved 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in august 1944 us army lt robert 
hamsley led a fivetank platoon into the french village of plelo 
and wiped out a contingent of heavily armed germans 
two days later german antitank guns knocked out four of the 
five tanks and damaged hamsleys own m4 before he and the three 
crew members recovered they destroyed the attack guns killed and 
routed some 100 germans and rescued the wounded 
the second action earned hamsley the bronze star and a promotion 
to captain the successful attack at plelo went practically 
unnoticed and it was unreported in the official diaries of the 
15th cavalry regiment of gen george pattons third army 
but the people of plelo never forgot 
now 46 years later the mayor and the village council of plelo 
have declared hamsley a hero and the towns liberator they have 
named him an honorary citizen and are recommending that he be 
awarded the french legion of honor 
hamsley now 71 and a winter resident of orlando from his home 
in lawrenceburg tenn is overwhelmed by the attention he and 
several family members will travel to plelo in june for a 
celebration in his honor 
if it werent for the five tanks and 20 men under hamsley many 
of the village residents would have been executed in the town 
square by the germans in addition a small force of french 
resistance fighters called the maquis were in danger of being wiped 
out 
at the moment the american tanks rumbled into town the german 
soldiers had lined up against a high wall an elderly woman her 
daughter and the village priest to be shot as collaborators of the 
maquis according to one published account 
to the germans amazement other residents had stepped up 
alongside the three condemned citizens the enemy occupiers also 
were rounding up still more villagers 
but the germans were routed during intense firefights in the 
village square and at a nearby field where they were garrisoned 
the american tank platoon assisted by the maquisards and some of 
the villagers killed about 50 enemy soldiers and captured 60 
according to the accounts 
hamsley and his tank platoon quickly left plelo met up with 
their main column the next day and were soon engaged in the battle 
near plouigneau which earned him the bronze star 
hamsley says things were moving too fast for a debriefing of his 
platoons activities at plelo by the time a sketchy report was 
made it became a footnote to ensuing battles 
we just did our job we figured it was just another days 
work hamsley says 
he never knew the full significance of the side trip to plelo or 
that his platoons cavalry charge would go down in village history 
until this past year 
amateur french historians and a retired american colonel 
pinpointed hamsley as the man on the spot and researched the 
details of the military encounter they pieced together eyewitness 
accounts and consulted military records and village archives 
the excolonel robert dwan of tucson ariz spends much of his 
time trying to get belated recognition for deserving members of 
the 15th cavalry in which he also served as a platoon leader in 
france 
dwan contacted yvon herve a history buff who lives in brittany 
near plelo and roger gergaud another resident of the area to 
uncover details of the battle 
herve sought out a number of the rural areas older residents 
among them a former mayor of plelo who was a boy of 15 and one of 
those scheduled for execution in the town square at the time of the 
germanamerican battle 
in a 1975 french history entitled the battle of brittany 
author jean joseph barsel writes that the americans saved the 
people of plelo from death and destruction as the germans had put 
everything into place for the total destruction of the village 
jean querrou a member of the french resistance at that time 
told a newspaper recently that we old combatants recall with our 
heart the american officer they had helped to save the 
inhabitants of plelo from a dramatic situation 
plelos current mayor yves le coqu wrote hamsley last august 
informing him of the councils action in naming him an honorary 
citizen of the village in testimony of our gratitude for your 
courageous action of aug 6 1944 which led to the villages 
liberation 
the mayor wrote again in november to thank hamsley for accepting 
their invitation to visit in june he was overjoyed the mayor 
wrote at the idea of finally being able to welcome 46 years 
later the man who was our liberator 
hamsley will fly to paris and then travel to plelo on june 16 
for a celebration in his honor 
most accounts of the battle mention the providential arrival 
of the american soldiers particularly because many of the 
inhabitants had gone to the village church to pray that they be 
spared from the german occupiers 
hamsley agrees with the use of the word providential because 
he and his platoon were reluctant participants in the battle of 
plelo 
it had to be providential that we wound up there when we were 
separated from our main unit for a couple of days without radio 
contact hamsley says our main concern was to get to brest 
not to engage in an outoftheway battle 
the stillslim hamsley who in civilian life became a horse 
auctioneer a law enforcement officer and businessman looks 
forward to seeing plelo again 
i remember it as a pretty town hamsley says i remember 
well the town square or plaza and a park i want to see the high 
wall with its iron grillwork where much of the fighting took 
placeit will be like they say providential

john hatch founder of the nonprofit foundation 
for international community assistance promotes village banking to 
encourage private enterprise in the third world what he foresees 
is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
john hatch says he hit upon his third world 
poverty vaccination while panicstricken on a flight to bolivia 
he had decided he could not comply with requirements of a 
consulting job he had accepted from the agency for international 
development and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable 
substitute 
and on my second double bourbon at 35000 feet up flying over 
the andes i have to say it was like this thought just rolled 
through my body hatch recalls i had my calculator out and i 
was sketching this thing and i was doing numbers and i arrived in 
la paz with a fullblown concept 
what he had stumbled upon was village banking a system of 
investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance 
their private enterprise allowing them to create savings while 
paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans 
the series of loans starting at 50 is renewable over three 
years to a ceiling of 300 allowing recipients to reach a level at 
which they can qualify for commercial credit 
what hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has 
translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 
35000 members portfolios total 16 million with a 96 percent 
repayment rate village banks are operating in mexico haiti 
thailand guatemala honduras costa rica bolivia peru and el 
salvador 
the concept is similar to the one behind the grameen bank of 
bangladesh channeling money to the impoverished principally 
mothers without the demands of commercial banks for collateral so 
they can improve their families lives 
what hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through 
bootstrap economics 
hatch a onetime peace corps volunteer with a doctorate in 
economic development is founder and president of the nonprofit 
foundation for international community assistance which recently 
moved its headquarters from tucson to alexandria va 
he says its impetus was and remains the thousands of children 
worldwide who die daily because of starvation what he calls the 
sacrifice of probably our most precious resource 
hatch focuses on reaching mothers in the belief that 
strengthening them economically lets them care for their children 
better there is almost a 100 percent guarantee that increased 
income for women will go into improvements in their childrens 
welfare hatch says 
we teach severely poor mothers how to create their own 
selfmanaged bank which provides them with selfemployment loans 
provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a 
support group of mothers like themselves so that they are all 
attacking change at the same time 
lawrence yanovitch small enterprise development program 
coordinator for catholic relief services in baltimore md says 
john hatch is close to the voice of the poor though hes come up 
with some sophisticated economic tools hes kept the 
humanitarianism 
catholic relief services entered a fiveyear 1 million joint 
venture a year ago with the us agency for international 
development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in 
thailand 
they targeted microenterprise development through small 
entrepreneurs vendors village market women who in some 
developing countries comprise up to 50 percent of the employment 
capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring 
agency 5000 
beryl rupp a rotary club official in phoenix says the bank 
members buy necessities with their profits or savings a chair to 
sit on pots to cook in blankets better food 
the women when asked speak of the greatest benefit in terms of 
what hatch calls empowerment perceptions 
they say things like now im somebody or my husband 
respects me more 
their vehicle for improvement is the village bank each 
comprised of 30 to 50 women who through loans starting at 50 can 
earn enough to provide savings and create capital hatch says the 
loans give them freedom to start their own investment projects in 
or near home 
the foundation will go into a village with a jointventure 
partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization such as 
rotary clubs or catholic relief services and identify a key woman 
she then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting 
forget the mayor forget the priest forget the chief hatch 
says we want to know who the most powerful woman is in that 
village 
at the meeting the women circle illustrated examples of 
quickturnover work they want the loans to finance it might be 
selling produce groceries baked goods raising chickens sewing 
or craftwork 
each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as 
collateral agreeing to repay onesixteenth of the loan weekly 
plus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent in line with local banks 
in some countries the repayment rate has been 100 percent 
overall the average is 97 percent says hatch 
fifty percent or more are illiterate and i would say 90 
percent of them dont have any idea of what theyre getting into 
when we start out says hatch and yet within 16 weeks theyre 
all experts they just learn as they go 
women who join the bank screen members and elect their leaders 
from firstmeeting attendees 
at the end of the 16th week each members loan balance is zero 
but at the same time each woman has been depositing weekly savings 
of at least 20 percent of the original loan the savings serve as 
incentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each 
time hatch said 
interest in village banking is mounting 
the united nations has provided a 50000 grant to research the 
effects of womens empowerment through village banking on maternal 
and child health practices 
the foundation has major proposals pending with the agency for 
international development the ford foundation citibank and the 
chase manhattan bank among others 
rotary club 100 a phoenix organization and a rotary club of 
mexico city are in a joint venture having funded five village 
banks in guaymas mexico with another four to be launched in the 
slums of mexico city 
hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in 
reducing poverty along the mexican border and in slowing down 
migration to this country 
as for whether such a system could work in the united states 
rotarys rupp says frankly its the only hope we have of 
changing the welfare system 
ultimately the way out of poverty is savings hatch adds 
its got to be built on the back of their own savings

when a sudden blow came up on

for me this is something glorious a whole new life he 
said studying a yellow screen that in dancing graphics showed the

with wine casual dress and lifestyles in an atmosphere of 
ebullient camaraderie 
some of both 
village veterans on their first cruise wondered whether chef de 
village janyck daudet outranked the captain in the reception line 
at the welcoming cocktail party when the ships program decreed 
elegant dress for dinner some put their best foot forward in 
jogging sneakers 
cruise ship veterans spoiled by bigname las vegas acts on 
other ships were only moderately tolerant of the nightly amateur 
musicals staged by the exuberant staff in the superbly equipped 
theater for club med addicts the beachcomber fantasy was blurred 
a bit by using credit cards instead of beads to barter for drinks 
in the five bars 
there was a bridge instructor on duty in the card room but in 
deference to a younger more active cruising clientele there were 
no shuffleboard bingo or steeplechase races

during the winter season the club med sails the caribbean out 
of guadeloupe in the summer it will cruise the mediterranean out 
of ville franche on the french riviera 
designed by architect francois xavier poylo and built in le 
havre france the 100 million ship is owned by three french banks 
and leased to club med and service et transport a shipping firm 
for seven years with an option to buy 
at 617feet it is not the largest ship with sails in history 
the great eastern nearly a century and a half ago was 60 feet 
longer had propellers the size of windmills and stationed a bugler 
at the top of the companionway to summon her 4000 passengers to 
dinner a failure in the passenger trade she found glory as a 
giant sea spider spinning out the atlantic cable 
second mate heidenreich a sailing buff cites the cargo ship 
thomas lawson plying the maine coast at the turn of the century 
she had seven masts each named for a day of the week 
this ships top speed of 14 knots with an assist from her four 
dieselpowered electric turbines is sluggish compared with the 
great clipper ships like cutty sark and flying cloud which fully 
rigged with 28 sails rushed forty niners around the horn to the 
california gold rush at 20 knots 
but her creature comforts are a far cry from what club med 
offered poor french students and vacationing secretaries at its 
first tent village on majorca 40 years ago 
telephones tv hair dryers minibars kingsized beds and 
matisse prints grace the 204 cabins decorated by alberto pinto who 
did the gucci offices in milan and a royal yacht for prince kaled 
of saudi arabia 
there are two dining salons two outdoor pools a casino a 
beauty parlor sauna and a dutyfree boutique 
alas the tradition of a ships library has shrunk to a bookcase 
of paperbacks 
with a draft of only 15 feet this hitech windjammer can visit 
smaller islands and lonelier beaches a boulderstrewn cove called 
the baths on virgin gorda in the british virgin islands was 
scorned as too commercial because its pristine sands were 
interrupted by a beer tent and a stall selling tshirts 
on st thomas the beach was already occupied by a few thousand 
sailors from the us aircraft carrier enterprise enjoying their 
first shore leave in six months 
the exotic combination of a new fivemasted cruise ship anchored 
in the same harbor with a nuclear powered carrier begged the 
question of why this return to sail in the atomic age 
the japanese had experimented with saildriven tankers during a 
world oil crisis in the 70s and now said capt lambert they 
want to buy our software 
when mikhail gorbachev addressed the united nations a year and a 
half ago a soviet trade fair in new york exhibited models of a new 
generation of freighters with auxiliary sails two other 
computerized sailing ships about a third smaller are already in 
the cruise trade and more are on the drawing board 
this is not a romantic gimmick insists lambert under 
sail the ship is quieter more comfortable for passengers she 
rolls less there is no vibration with normal power we use 20 tons 
of marine diesel in 24 hours under full sail with our four 
generators also going we use 7 tons if the wind is from the 
starboard our computer directs the exhaust fumes off to port side 
even when there is very little wind the sails give us an 
extra 2 knots speed and every owner knows the last 2 knots are the 
most expensive 
the great clipper ships required a crew of 130 to wrestle with 
acres of canvas stretching 2990 square yards of dacron this 
latterday descendant needs only 35 officers and seamen not 
counting our most versatile hand the computer adds the captain

the new head of the us border patrol believes 
illegal aliens looking for work should be treated with compassion 
even as they are turned back but when it comes to drug runners and 
other criminals mike williams is in favor of using the military to 
help seal the border some alien advocates disagree 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for almost a quarter century mike 
williams has wrestled with the paradoxes of the nations southwest 
boundary an escape route for the destitute the front line of the 
nations war on drugs yet a doorway for commerce 
williams a border patrol agent who learned spanish from the 
illegal aliens he turned away is the agencys new chief 
williams was appointed in january to oversee the policing of 
some 5960 miles along the us borders with canada and mexico 
its a 263 millionayear operation involving 3800 border patrol 
agents in 22 districts 
williams says a good border patrol boss should know how to 
balance compassion for the illegal aliens looking for work in the 
united states with intolerance for the drug runners auto thieves 
alien smugglers and other sinister characters who defy the law 
i think that we dont need to apologize because we want to 
control our borders williams said in a recent interview as he 
completed his move to washington from el paso 
i think we need to recognize the sensitivity of the reasons 
why people come and we do but i dont think we need to say that 
we should not enforce laws 
williams also makes no apologies for controversial proposals to 
have the military help the border patrol fight illegal drug traffic 
i feel it is morally right to try to prevent this plague 
thats attacking america he says 
williams a native of gainesville fla began his border patrol 
career in 1967 after a fouryear stint with the coast guard at his 
first posting in comstock texas he learned the indian tracking 
techniques the patrol uses to pursue undocumented aliens often he 
would track them up to 70 miles inland though rugged country 
he says conversations with the illegal immigrants he arrested 
taught him spanish and developed his understanding of their 
hardships 
they come here to get jobs to feed their families to 
possibly increase their standard of living he says the worst 
thing that can happen to them is theyll get sent back to mexico 
so theyre going to come here to try to improve their standard of 
living 
williams demanded similar empathy from his officers when he 
headed the el paso border patrol sector says gus de la vina now 
its acting chief 
he taught the difference between dealing with a criminal vs 
dealing with a person that is coming in that is not a criminal but 
is violating an administrative law de la vina says 
jose guadalupe moreno director of the el paso catholic dioceses 
migrant and refugee services says he applauds the appointment of a 
border patrol chief who professes to understand the plight of 
immigrants but hes not sure that a law enforcement officer can be 
compassionate 
their job is to look for individuals who are here without 
documents moreno says no matter how professional they should 
be no matter what the policy it still takes the individual to 
follow through to act in a way that will not step all over 
peoples basic and human rights 
before coming to el paso the 45yearold williams headed the 
patrols office in havre mont and was deputy chief in san diego 
the largest border patrol sector 
williams says he has no hobbies spending most of his free time 
with the patrol when hes not home with his wife pat and their 
three children 
even before leaving el paso he was talking eagerly about the 
fight ahead to get more funding from congress 
its a challenge to me and ive always rode to the sound of 
the guns he said i feel i can make a difference that i can 
help these men and women that are out here on americas front line 
doing their job 
williams has taken on capitol hill before 
in 1986 he criticized congress for its sluggish pace rewriting 
immigration laws we are losing control of the border he said 
then 
the immigration and naturalization service believes the number 
of people crossing us borders illegally grows each year though 
there are no statistics other than the numbers caught 
and that number has dropped by half since the immigration reform 
and control act the law williams pushed for was passed in 1986 
it granted amnesty to about 3 million aliens who had lived in the 
country since 1982 and imposed sanctions on employers of 
undocumented workers 
in 1986 16 million aliens were arrested that fell to 855315 
in 1989 
border patrol officials figure that fewer arrests mean fewer 
people are trying to cross the border 
recently the number of arrests began to rise again patrol 
agents say they believe theyve controlled the exodus of central 
americans over the border but not mexicans 
critics such as brownsville immigration attorney linda yanez say 
thats a sure sign immigration reform is not working 
the purpose of much of the legislation was to curb and control 
immigration and it has not done that ms yanez says it just 
created more laws to punish and they dont work obviously were 
not addressing issues at their core 
the border patrol is moving into yet another arena of 
controversy as it takes on more duties in the war on drugs 
in fiscal 1989 the border patrol made 5441 drug seizures 
valued at 12 billion up from 3257 valued at 700 million the 
year before 
ms yanez says she is most concerned about proposals to use the 
military on the border i dont think it solves any problem and 
sends the wrong message she says 
but williams welcomes the additional manpower 
because of the magnitude of this influx of drugs were 
experiencing we welcome any assistance we can get he says 
they can be our eyes and ears out there when we dont have the 
manpower to be out there

stephanie zimbalist has gone from solving 
mysteries on television to creating one in caroline she plays 
a young woman who was presumed dead for 16 years before turning up 
to claim a family fortune 
caroline the seasons final hall of fame presentation on 
cbs on sunday is in reality a touching family drama masquerading 
as a mystery the story set in the 1950s appears sinister at 
first with caroline suspected of being an impostor out for the 
inheritance it then turns into something quite different 
its about how families work and dont work says zimbalist 
who starred for four seasons in the private eye series remington 
steele 
its a study of how families operate in a group its like a 
little boat if one person is dysfunctional it tips the boat 
you have a father who is a workaholic you have a mother whos 
a control freak you have a young girl whos handicapped you have 
a boy who has the one chance to become normal but hes attached to 
his sister by the hip 
caroline is the therapist the hook of the story is whether 
shes real is she anastasia but she comes in and helps the 
family 
pamela reed also stars as grace the stepmother who sees 
caroline not only as a fortunehunting impostor but as an 
interloper trying to drive a wedge between her and her own 
handicapped daughter 
george grizzard is the father patricia neal is carolines 
former school mistress and dorothy mcguire is the grandmother who 
leaves the money to caroline 
shawn phelan plays as the young son and jenny jacobs the 1982 
cerebral palsy poster child is heidi 
joseph sargent directed the production from a screenplay by 
michael de guzman based on the novel fathers arcane daughter 
by e l konigsburg 
at the heart of the drama is the conflict between caroline and 
the mother over special schooling for heidi caroline sees her as a 
bright child who is only mildly dysfunctional while the mother 
treats her as totally helpless and incapable of learning 
caroline says heidi is who she is zimbalist says you 
cant keep hiding her you face it you erase it you move on 
joe sargent directed a lot of scenes with the children 
watching from behind doors thats because the children were not 
allowed into the life of the family its so expressive of how life 
was in the 1950s 
zimbalist says her greatest pleasure in doing caroline was 
working with pamela reed who is currently starring in nbcs 
grand 
when you work with pamela her burner is always on high she 
says 
given her druthers stephanie zimbalist would rather be on stage 
in front of an audience than in front of a camera she has spent 
much of her time in the theater since the end of remington 
steele 
zimbalist grew up in a show business family her father efrem 
zimbalist jr is an actor who starred in 77 sunset strip and 
the fbi her grandfather was concert violinist efrem 
zimbalist and her grandmother was opera singer alma gluck 
even as a teenager she preferred the stage but opted for 
television when she was unable to find work one of the first 
things she did was a comedy pilot with her father 
one of her earliest roles and one she still regards as one of 
her best was as elly zahm in the massive miniseries centennial 
in 197879 author james michener liked her portrayal of the 
illfated pioneer woman so much that he wrote her a letter 
she also won the heart of james stewart when they worked 
together in the magic of lassie one of her few theatrical 
films he said she was his favorite young actress 
shes currently costarring in the baby dance a twoact 
play at the pasadena playhouse that she helped develop 
the play is about a yuppie couple from california who are 
adopting a baby from a backwoods family in louisiana 
musicals are the thing i love to do most zimbalist says 
theres hardly a musical that i dont know all the songs its 
why i became an actress 
after the end of remington steele she toured for six months 
with tommy tune in my one and only

black rain paramount home video vhsbeta rated r 
 
take one maverick cop a young vicious japanese gangster 
motorcycles two gritty cities and more blood and gore than most 
people would rather see add more than a few cliches stir fry for 
two hours and five minutes and you get black rain 
red rain would have been more like it this crime thriller 
directed by ridley scott of aliens and blade runner fame 
features a murder by stabbing another by throatcutting a 
shooting death at least one machine gunning and the slashing of 
the hero and thats just in the first halfhour were also 
treated to a graphic beheading a finger amputation and gunfire 
aplenty 
michael douglas plays nick conklin a new york detective whose 
hobbies include daredevil motorcycling and raising obnoxiousness to 
an art form hes also suspected of stealing money from drug 
dealers but his brash manner makes him just a little likable 
sometimes 
nick collars a gangster sato yusako matsuba after sato rubs 
out two rival japanese mobsters in a new york bar remember that 
first halfhour nick takes sato back to japan but the killer 
escapes after the plane touches down 
and the hunt is on 
the plot has so many twists and turns youre dizzy by the end 
and there are other things that make little sense for instance 
most of the time the japanese speak japanese without dubbing or 
subtitles but towards the end they get subtitles the japanese 
actors do speak english at some points but in some cases its 
still impossible to understand what theyre saying 
the maverick cop has become a cliche but douglas takes it to 
extremes hes so mouthy and rude youre surprised his japanese 
counterparts dont put him on the first 747 back to new york with 
the luggage 
there are some other formula characters to help him theres 
likable charlie good cop to nicks bad cop played well by andy 
garcia anyone whos been to the movies knows what happens to the 
likable character it does then theres kate capshaw who plays a 
toughcookie hostess at an osaka bar shes a walking scorecard on 
japanese gang warfare who fills nick in despite the danger to 
herself but its never made clear exactly how she knows all this 
stuff or why shes helping nick 
matsuba does a chilling job of playing sato and ken takukara is 
also good as nicks japanese partner in crimebusting masahiro the 
osaka street scenes are interesting and ridley scotts dark flashy 
sets are up to his usually high standards but this formula film is 
way too violent and muddled 
black rain isnt a tasty sukiyaki its mulligan stew

pianist marcus roberts is traveling the jazz 
road laid down by the masters toward his own individuality 
i figure if youre going to learn how to play piano why 
wouldnt you listen to the music of thelonious monk or listen to 
duke ellington he says 
im interested in following a road that has been forged and 
set by the great masters of the art form that will lead me to the 
natural power of identity that i possess 
it is my feeling that if you have a concept of the tradition 
from which you come that can only strengthen your personal 
statement it is not going to limit your creativity to have studied 
30 great duke ellington compositions 
roberts who is blind has been receiving increasing attention 
and praise as pianist in trumpeter wynton marsalis group for the 
last five years he now has his second album on novus records 
deep in the shed referring to a place for intense practice and 
jazz experimentation it presents six tunes he composed and 
arranged each a different exploration of the blues 
i believe very strongly in playing blues any of the truly 
great jazz musicians play blues some nights duke ellington would 
play nine or 10 
the truth is spoken here roberts first album also on 
novus an rca records label had performances by drummer elvin 
jones and tenor saxophonist charlie rouse rouse played with 
monk elvin jones played with the great john coltrane i always 
had a great love for coltranes music it was an honor for me to be 
in the studio with him 
this record uses some of marsalis musicians and some unknowns 
who played dates with roberts last summer 
there are a lot of brilliant young musicians who deserve an 
opportunity to play whatever i can do to perpetuate that im 
going to do roberts said marsalis group is touring now 
roberts will start touring as a leader in may but he isnt really 
looking forward to doing that full time i like nothing better 
than to walk on wynton marsalis bandstand every night each day i 
have more love for him and his music its hard to picture myself 
not playing with him even though i know eventually that will 
probably happen 
he didnt always dream about leading his own combo roberts 
says first and foremost i just wanted to be part of a group of 
musicians that were all very serious and dedicated and who could 
all play 
i realized to get to a certain level of artistry it is 
necessary that you if possible try to establish your own vision 
and direction i guess over the years ive started to think more of 
having my own music and musicians 
the first time it came up was years ago wynton brought it up 
i hadnt been in his band very long he said whenever its time 
for you to go and do what you have to do know that ill 
understand i didnt know what he was talking about 
roberts is 26 nine years ago jazz pianist marian mcpartland 
was the first established performer to take an interest in him she 
was a judge in the first music competition he entered which he 
won i was in high school she gave me a lot of real good advice 
early on she represents what jazz music is all about she goes all 
over the place and does what she can to encourage young musicians 
to come out and play i have a great love for her 
he has been a guest on her piano jazz radio program 
she told me do as many records as you can document your 
music because thats the only way people ever remember who you are 
whatever you have to do no matter what the money is if you have 
music ready to be recorded get it recorded thats definitely 
some of the best advice ive ever been given by anybody said 
roberts who plans his third record as a solo piano of tunes by 
jelly roll morton ellington and monk 
when he cuts his own records robert said you have to 
determine everything concept music musicians the puzzle has to 
be in my mind and how the pieces should all fit together when i do 
records with wynton he is such an organized person all ive got 
to do is come in and play the piano 
marsalis first heard roberts in 1982 in chicago where he played 
as a student winner at a jazz educators convention he only heard 
me three more times before i joined his band he said 
we would stay in touch over the telephone wed talk he was 
never that impressed with my playing i was very very surprised 
when he asked me to join his band i always hoped it would happen 
there was not a band in the world i would have preferred to play 
with 
wyntons true greatness was not developed in the 80s in the 
90s people will really see the level of genius wynton has

the composers who wrote the 
grammywinning song wind beneath my wings are aiming their 
ambition at another challenge an academy award 
the touching tune about worshiping loved ones was voted song of 
the year in february earning a grammy award for cowriters larry 
henley and jeff silbar the song also was chosen record of the 
year earning another grammy for bette midler 
the song performed by midler in the movie beaches was not 
eligible for an academy award because it was not written for a 
motion picture 
i watched the academy awards and thought boy id like to 
have one of those henley said in an interview you get this 
award syndrome its so much fun to go up on that stage and get an 
award 
im hopeully going to get more songs in movies my next goal 
is to win the academy award 
henley lives in nashville silbar who lives in studio city 
calif is directing his songwriting toward an oscar as well 
im trying since the grammy award to write with the best 
writers i can and write for special projects he said by 
telephone 
henley and silbar wrote wind beneath my wings in 1981 on 
nashvilles music row henley put the finishing touches on the 
lyrics the next day as he sat alone on a yacht in the gulf of 
mexico off corpus christi texas 
an estimated 200 singers have recorded the song with midlers 
version hitting no 1 on the pop music charts last summer 
the wellcrafted tune in dramatic and sweeping fashion is 
about one person telling another person that he or she is his or 
her hero the person being addressed is saluted for strength and 
willingness to let others reap the glory of life i can fly 
higher than an eagle because you are the wind beneath my wings 
warner chappell which published the song says it has become 
the most performed piece of music at weddings it also is played 
often at funerals 
it gets people coming and going henley said 
silbar refers to it as the ultimate thank you song 
people have been looking for the words to say this and the 
song just kind of crystallizes their thoughts he said the 
stories i hear about it are wonderful the song is dedicated to 
fathers brothers husbands it goes the whole boundaries of 
relationships and how people feel to each other 
henley says its become a catch phrase in america im very 
proud of that i think thats one of the things hardly anyone ever 
writes 
both writers said the song fit well in beaches a movie 
about friendship even though the tune was written years before the 
movie was conceived and was first a hit record by gary morris in 
the country music field 
the spot in the movie was the ultimate for a ballad silbar 
said 
it worked wonderfully in the movie henley said it was 
sort of a terms of endearment kind of movie it was funny then 
it makes you want to cry it leaves you with a very special 
feeling 
henley primarily wrote the lyrics which is ironic because such 
moving sentiments came from someone married and divorced four times 
ive been single now for about 10 years he said i think 
ive learned my lesson 
one of his exwives who inspired the song called him with 
congratulations the night the grammy awards were announced 
shes thrilled im sure henley said she was one of the 
heroes in my life ive always been grateful for some of the things 
she taught me 
henley owns a place in music trivia hell probably always be 
known for cowriting wind beneath my wings but in the 1960s he 
was lead singer for the newbeats rock n roll group it was his 
falsetto on such hits as bread and butter in 1964 and run 
baby run in 1965 
i think my story has been sort of interesting from bread and 
butter to wind beneath my wings by way of country music he 
mused from rock n roll to country to pop its sort of a 
strange route 
his fondest memory from the newbeats is doing a concert tour 
with the rolling stones and roy orbison in australia and new 
zealand 
it was the most fun i ever had henley recalled we had 
the world in our hands and didnt even know it

whats this john waters the impresario of 
bad taste hooked up with the people who gave you parenthood 
whats more his new film cry baby is being released by a 
mainstream company universal pictures has the onetime king of 
underground sleaze succumbed to the establishment 
ive always tried to make commercial movies he explains 
unapologetically think about it pink flamingos 1972 cost 
10000 all the hideousness i put in that movie was commercial 
nobody heard of us before all the people who left that movie said 
oh my god you wouldnt believe what i just saw 
i always try to be commercial on my terms it worked too 
that movies still playing two generations have been offended by 
that movie im proud of that its hard to do 
talk about inflation cry baby cost 8 million minor by 
hollywood standards but not waters the film is backed by 
universal and imagine films entertainment operated by ron howard 
and brian grazer makers of splash and parenthood 
they have been a wonderful support said waters they 
never said to me you cant do that they gave me the money to do 
everything i wanted to do hire all the stars in heaven 
well not quite cry baby stars johnny depp the teen rage 
of tvs 21 jump street and amy locane as starcrossed lovers 
in the 1950s the cast ranges from polly bergen and susan tyrell to 
traci lords and iggy pop with cameos by willem dafoe patty hearst 
david ozzie and harriet nelson and troy donahue its all set 
to the beat of early rock n roll 
i wanted it to look like a 50s musical like the girl cant 
help it or early elvis waters said or like the spinoff 
lower versions of the wild one or rebel without a cause i 
liked those movies but better i liked the cheap imitations 
a movie nut all his life waters confessed his lifelong 
ambition i always wanted to be a villain in a disney movie 
with his thin pallid face razorthin mustache and black suit he 
could easily have done so growing up in baltimore he gave puppet 
shows from the age of 8 to 14 when he feared his playmates would 
consider it uncool 
his first movie was shot in 8mm in 1964 when he was 19 the 
title hag in a black leather jacket 
its in my closet where it will stay he said it was 
filmed on the roof of my parents house it was about a black man 
marrying a white woman with a ku klux klan member performing the 
ceremony the man took her away on the honeymoon in a garbage can 
it was very influenced by the 1960s theater of the absurd it 
played once in a beatnik coffee house and that was it 
waters continued making films with his baltimore buddies until 
the breakthrough with mondo trasho 
it was the story of a hitrun driver on one hideous day in her 
life he recounted it starred divine and in the end divine 
died in a pig pen and the virgin mary appeared to her 
in multiple maniacs divine was raped by a 15foot broiled 
lobster pink flamingos was about a battle between the filthiest 
people alive female trouble was about a criminal who wanted to 
be famous so badly that she got the electric chair that was like 
the oscar in her chosen profession desperate living was about 
the worst town you could live in when youre so embarrassed about 
your life you have to move there 
polyester was a comedy about the hell of suburban life where 
everything smells bad it was released in odorama hairspray 
was a musical comedy about a teen dance show cry baby is a 
juvenile delinquent comedy 
so you can see that my sense of humor has been the same from 
the very beginning 
despite the outrageousness of his themes waters claims the 
critics have been good to me since the very beginning you get bad 
press when you start believing the nice things that you all sign 
bad reviews rex reed gave us the best where do these people 
come from where do they go when the sun goes down isnt there a 
law or something that quote was our whole campaign in selling the 
picture 
although waters films are treasured at saturday midnight 
screenings he insists that he enjoys a wide audience after 
hairspray had been out we found that 8 and 9yearolds really 
loved the films thats an audience i had never tested never even 
thought of they liked it on one level they didnt see the parody 
of it 
when we tested cry baby there were a lot of kids who said 
they thought it was a really romantic movie they can like it on a 
another level thats ok it is romantic it is sexy all juvenile 
delinquents were sexy thats why they had em the word itself is 
sexy we dont have juvenile delinquents anymore we have 
13yearold mass murderers

singer john mellencamps art is populated 
with characters from americas heartland but these days those 
characters are more likely to be found in oil paintings than on the 
radio 
for mellencamp painting has provided a respite from the 
pressures of rock n roll and the recent collapse of his second 
marriage 
his second exhibit of oil paintings opened april 12 at the 
churchmanfehsenfeld gallery of the indianapolis art league 
mellencamp first displayed his work last year at an exhibit with 
jazz artist miles davis in los angeles 
the 29 portraits depict the singersongwriters family and 
friends the facial expressions created by his muted brush strokes 
are always sad and they convey the same disillusionment found in 
his musical anthems about the nations heartland and the farm 
crisis 
i think you can say much more in a painting than you can in a 
stupid song he said in an interview with rolling stone magazine 
last year 
some days i start at seven oclock in the morning and i paint 
until five eat dinner and come back and paint till midnight i 
dont have to see anybody i dont have to talk to anybody its 
better than sex for me 
however mellencamps wealth hardly fits the stereotype of a 
struggling artist his albums have sold millions he records in his 
own studio and he could afford to spend much of the last year in an 
art studio he had built next to his home near bloomington 
he and his wife vicky are in the middle of a divorce they are 
the parents of teddi joe 8 and justice 4 who currently are 
living with their mother 
mellencamps manager harry sandler said the singer did not 
want to be interviewed about his venture into the art world john 
wants to let the paintings stand on their own sandler said he 
just chooses not to speak at this time 
mellencamp has not hinted that his music career is over but it 
has certainly taken an extended vacation his growing discontent 
with pop stardom surfaced in his last album big daddy 
never wanted to be no pop singer never wanted to write no pop 
songs goes the bitter refrain of the hit single pop singer 
which offers mellencamps cynical view of todays music scene 
he refused to tour in support of big daddy and his only 
stage appearance in recent months came at the farm aid iv concert 
in indianapolis march 7 the rousing ovation he received and his 
energetic threesong performance were far removed from the solitude 
of a blank canvas 
mellencamp organized the first farm aid back in 1984 with willie 
nelson as a benefit for struggling farmers 
i think people my age need to start taking their position in 
the community seriously and start dealing with local problems 
within the system he said in an interview with the associated 
press i dont mean standing in the back rows and throwing stuff 
any coward can do that we tried that in the 60s and it didnt 
work out too good i mean to take affirmative action and to make 
positive steps to change in a country that needs to go through that 
right now 
but those who have worked with mellencamp say he is serious 
about painting and that it is not merely a hobby jan royce 
traveled to mellencamps studio several times last summer to help 
him learn oil techniques 
hes very bright very eager to learn very driven said 
royce a portrait painter from indianapolis he paints from the 
heart just as his music is from the heart 
royce said the immediacy of creating a painting appeals to 
mellencamps impatient nature 
he works very fast and tries to capture what hes feeling 
immediately said julia l muney exhibits curator at the art 
league 
by displaying his paintings to the public and critics muney 
said mellencamp wanted some validation for himself he wants the 
public to confirm am i going in the right direction 
at least some buyers think so three of his selfportraits 
ranging in price from 2000 to 6000 were sold before the show 
opened muney said 
reaction to the show was enthusiastic among 450 guests invited 
to a preopening party attended by mellencamp muney said 
they liked the work a lot they might have been skeptical but 
they are no longer muney said i was expecting things to look 
a little more folksy i was surprised at the expertness of the 
painthandling 
in yet another paradox mellencamp chose to personally oversee 
all aspects of the indianapolis showing 
muney said he helped set up the exhibit fussed over the titles 
of each painting and wired the frames himself in preparation for 
hanging 
hell deprecate his paintings its very strange because hes 
serious about painting but after a while he wont be satisfied with 
the results 
we were looking at some of these paintings and he told me 
this is crummy but you can hang it anyway muney said 
gesturing toward the exhibit 
mellencamp insisted on removing two paintings from the exhibit 
because he wasnt satisfied with them muney said 
he may not want to discuss his paintings but the prices on his 
works speak volumes 
his two least expensive works are a selfportrait of himself and 
another titled big j showing his daughter justice in a pink 
dress both sell for 2000 three paintings are priced at 15000 
they are among the largest works in the exhibit measuring roughly 
72 inches long by 48 inches wide 
his first wife priscilla is the subject of cil which 
shows her wearing 50sstyle glasses and large earrings 
in the beach or the bar said to be mellencamps favorite 
he portrays seven people gathered around an outdoor bar at his 
showing last fall in los angeles the painting carried a 25500 
price tag in indianapolis its practically a steal at 12000 
paintings cost more in la he adjusted his prices down for 
the midwestern market muney said 
muney said mellencamp asked her if his prices were too high 
given his name and what hes putting into them frankly i said 
no she said 
but muney admits few artists who have been painting for less 
than two years can tag such elaborate prices on their works 
yes theyre paying for the name she said of potential 
mellencamp collectors

john trudell can still remember the date jan 
14 1979 the place vancouver british columbia and what he was 
doing riding in a car when he wrote his first lyrics 
suddenly these lines came into my head gently the rains of 
purification wash my mind recalled the 44yearold trudell a 
longtime indian activist who has recorded several albums of his 
poetry something told me to write them down and ive been 
writing since then 
i wrote a set of 20 lines it was not something i expected 
then i started writing and i started writing a lot and i saw 
well theres some reason im doing this and ill see where the 
writing takes me 
his writing found its way on tape with friend and guitarist 
jesse ed davis composing backing tracks for two albums unable to 
sign with any record label trudell formed peace music and released 
the songs on mailorder cassettes in 1986 aka grafitti man 
wound up in the hands of bob dylan who called it the best record 
of the year 
i think he was doing the grateful dead tour that year and he 
played our tape at his concerts trudell recalled the effect 
wasnt monetary at that time what it was was more recognition from 
other artists 
so rock stars jackson browne george harrison and bono became 
fans too and midnight oil made trudell the opening act for their 
1988 tour trudell is a rock n roll fan himself paying tribute 
to elvis presley in baby boom che 
but while many of his costars are musicians who developed 
politically trudell is an activist now giving live recitals 
i knew how to handle the stage for myself but i had never 
worked it this way with four or five other people thats 
something that im not trained for trudell said 
im not familiar with the poets i never really listened to 
any poets their lines may have had great symbolic meanings but 
they were not real to my world what was real to my world was 
country music and rock n roll music and blues 
why he began writing is almost too painful to talk about a time 
he refers to as when things changed in my life in 1979 after 
leading a march in washington and speaking out against fbi policy 
towards indians a mysterious fire at his nevada home killed his 
wife his three children and his motherinlaw 
i realized i needed to survive but surviving isnt enough 
said trudell who soon developed a compulsion to write 
theres got to be something else that goes with it otherwise a 
lot of things lose their meaning and purpose i was trying to 
figure out how i was going to deal with that 
he was born in omaha neb in 1946 and lived on and off the 
santee reservation until joining the navy in 1963 
i knew the realities in my reservation and life of the 
reservations and i knew the reality of racism and a whole lot 
things but when i was in the military it showed me that there were 
a lot of indians around the world as far as america was 
concerned said trudell who served in vietnam 
i had the experiences of the military and then i went to 
college for a little while basically college taught me the same 
thing the navy taught me there are many realities here and what 
the controlling class taught me was youve got to submit to be 
successful 
he became a leader of the indian rights movement in the late 
1960s serving as chair of indians of all tribes during the 
occupation of alcatraz island in 1969 and heading the american 
indian movement in the 70s when protests took place at mount 
rushmore washington and wounded knee 
graffiti man includes political songs such as rich mans 
war and love songs such as stardreamer woman trudell speaks 
of his writing as the next new wave in music sounding like a true 
punk rocker whos tired of the state of the art 
because the music industry with all its high tech has 
basically gone as far as it could go its stagnant it needs a new 
infusion of human energy i think spoken word can be that infusion 
of human energy 
people are used to langauge being spoken used to being talked 
to he said in our generation all our poets got sucked up as 
musicians and are identified as musicians and that put it out of 
reach of your average person poets are within every persons 
reach

americas military veterans are growing older 
as a group forcing the veterans affairs department to reevaluate 
its health care system for the first time in a quartercentury 
by may va secretary edward j derwinski plans to have in place 
a commission to review the mission of the departments 172 
hospitals nearly 400 outpatient clinics nursing homes and other 
facilities 
medicine has changed greatly since 1965 but the politics of 
closing a hospital have not in 1965 the va barely managed to 
close seven of the 15 hospitals and old soldiers homes it had 
recommended should be shut down the emphasis has shifted from 
inhospital care to outpatient and extended care and prevention 
government medicine like private care costs more today and va 
hospitals must compete for federal budget dollars to pay adequate 
salaries for doctors and nurses while maintaining uptodate 
equipment 
congress has complained that for the last 10 years the system 
has been underfunded and it says the va needs 250 million more 
this year to keep a barebones operation through september 
derwinskis proposal for the next fiscal year calls for a record 
31 billion for health care 
the cost of medical care grows with the age of the patient and 
the main point that derwinski has driven home in one congressional 
hearing after another is the rapid change in the veteran population 
of the nations 271 million veterans more than onethird 
served during world war ii the average age of those world war ii 
veterans is 68 the number of veterans age 65 or older is supposed 
to peak at 9 million in 1999 according to the va 
veterans 75 and older will grow from 14 million today to 26 
million in 1995 and to 44 million in the year 2010 the va says 
by the year 2010 veterans 65 and older will comprise 40 
percent of the eligible veteran population as compared to 26 
percent in 1989 derwinski said in recent testimony before the 
senate veterans affairs committee 
by 2010 derwinski said 35 percent of va hospital patients will 
be at least 75 years old and 60 percent will be over 65 
major adjustments to the va system may be needed to meet 
these veterans needs derwinski said 
like the rest of the population some veteran retirees are 
moving from their homes in the northeast and midwest where many of 
the older va facilities are to arizona florida and other sunnier 
states the va has not kept up with this population shift 
with those trends in mind the va commission on the future 
structure of veterans health care will begin meeting next month to 
come up with a set of recommendations by october 1991 
derwinski has already promised that no facilities will be 
closed even though a city like his own chicago may have three 
hospitals with overlapping services 
va facilities like dams and highways are prime cuts of pork 
congress gave derwinski a cool reception last summer when he 
proposed legislation that would give lawmakers a role in choosing 
the commission members lawmakers were reluctant to be connected 
with a group that could recommend closing a facility in their 
districts 
congress was still up in arms over another panels 
recommendation to close domestic military bases so derwinski 
decided to appoint his own commission 
what the va can do is convert a hospital to another use such as 
nursing care and allow only one hospital in a population center to 
offer expensive specialized equipment or surgery 
still members of congress and other groups are wary of the va 
in light of past budgetcutting when the agency was dominated by 
the office of management and budget also there are questions of 
how independent the commission will be especially since its 
support staff will be drawn from within the va 
all too often in the past when there was talk of reexamining 
the vas mission reducing services was the hidden agenda james 
n magill of the veterans of foreign wars recently testified 
theres a major reason for leaving some slack in the system a 
reason few like to think about war or largescale armed conflict 
if the work of the commission will be undertaken with the 
assumption there will not be a new generation of wartime veterans 
by the year 2000 then the final report of the commission may not 
be totally germane by the beginning of the next century john f 
sommer of the american legion said in recent testimony

lonnie layne hall lives alone in 
his house on the outskirts of this village so his drivers license 
is also his ticket to independence 
the license says hes 110 he insists hes five years younger 
either way he is new yorks oldest driver according to the state 
department of motor vehicles 
how many times a week do i go out driving said hall oh 
whenever i have to maybe once or twice i take my laundry out i 
buy my groceries 
hall has a clean record but the dmv is reviewing regulations 
dealing with the fastestgrowing segment of the driving population 
senior citizens 
new york has 19 million drivers over 60 said john boffa of the 
governors traffic safety committee which is conducting the review 
along with the state office for the aging 
the basic directive was to identify ways to make driving safer 
for elderly people without imposing additional burdens on them 
said boffa 
studies show the eyes provide 95 percent of the information 
drivers use to make decisions said boffa 
so the width of stripes on the new york state thruway 559 
miles from new york city to niagara falls has been increased from 
four to six inches the rest of the states interstates also will 
get wider stripes boffa said 
and over the next few years the thruways 15000 signs will be 
replaced with ones that have greater reflectivity and larger 
letters 
those changes are relatively easy the more complicated issue 
is how to deal with the drivers boffa said 
according to the national highway traffic safety administration 
drivers in most age groups can expect to be involved in an average 
of five crashes per million vehicle miles traveled 
the exceptions the youngest and oldest drivers for teenagers 
the figure is about 30 for those 80 and over it is close to 40 
three states indiana illinois and new hampshire and the 
district of columbia require drivers to retake road tests after a 
certain age generally 75 
but boffa said new york officials are not convinced of the 
merits of that because it would overwhelm the department of motor 
vehicles 
it also would be discriminatory said steve stiles at the 
american association for retired persons 
the difficulty we have is when a state selects older drivers 
and says at age 65 you go through some special testing different 
from everybody else he said 
lets do better testing stiles said but lets do it on a 
performance basis not age 
boffa said new york is moving deliberately as it considers older 
drivers 
the automobile provides mobility and individuality for people 
in many cases he said selfesteem is pretty deeply interwoven 
with the ability to drive when you take that away from people it 
can be pretty devastating 
in rural areas driving is essential 
automobiles are the only means of transportation for people to 
get to the doctors office and the pharmacy boffa said 
were trying to balance safety considerations with concern and 
sensitivity to the elderly population he added its not an 
easy dilemma to resolve to be frank

growing numbers of older americans want to 
stay in their homes and never move but more than half have done 
little or no planning for their housing needs in later years a 
national survey shows 
the survey of 1500 people aged 55 and older commissioned by 
the american association of retired persons found that 86 percent 
wanted to age in place up from 78 percent in 1986 
fiftythree percent had done little or no planning for their 
housing those most likely to have done no planning were those over 
75 with less than 12000 annual income widowed divorced or 
never married and with health problems 
in general the people who have the strongest desire to stay 
put are also the most vulnerable the oldold the poor and the 
widowed the report said they are more likely to be forced out 
of their homes because of some crisis 
fortythree percent of older americans have lived in their homes 
for more than 20 years while only 17 percent have moved within the 
past five years of those who move 63 percent stay in the same 
city or county 
the survey found that 22 percent of older people expect to move 
but only 13 percent want to 
midlife and older people need to evaluate housing options 
before a crisis occurs the aarp said a lack of planning may 
force many older people out of their home against their wishes 
those who are willing to move especially the oldest respondents 
and those in poor health were more receptive to agesegregated 
housing than they were in aarps previous survey in 1986 forty 
percent prefer a senior citizens building to one for all age 
groups up from 32 percent in 1986 
the latest survey conducted in 1989 also found a growing 
expectation among the elderly that they will need help around their 
homes sixtyfive percent anticipate needing help with outside 
maintenance such as mowing lawns up from 40 percent in 1986 
fiftyfive percent expect to need help with heavy housework up 
from 33 percent 
individuals decision to move or stay may be influenced by how 
affordable reliable and accessible home and outdoor maintenance 
services become the aarp said 
the survey found that 23 percent of older people live alone 
with women those 75 and older and those with incomes below 12000 
most likely to do so five percent live in a retirement community 
or building planned for older adults twentyseven percent live in 
a neighborhood or building where a majority of the residents are 60 
or older 
the telephone survey was conducted by market facts inc in june 
1989 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points results of the survey were released by the aarp this month

the capacity and need for sexual expression 
continues into old age 
love and sex can be expressed in many ways the joy of 
companionship between two people can be shown by touching and 
holding hands caressing or by conversation and doing things 
together 
while some physical responses slow with age individuals of all 
ages can benefit both physically and psychologically by expressing 
their sexuality 
most older people want and can lead an active satisfying 
sex life indeed many 80 and 90yearold men and women have 
satisfying sexual relations 
with age women do not ordinarily lose their physical capacity 
for orgasm nor men their capacity for erecton and ejaculation 
there is often however a slowing of response 
for women changes that occur in the shape flexibility and 
lubrication of the vagina can usually be traced to lowered levels 
of the hormone estrogen during and after menopause many women say 
that after menopause when the fear of pregnancy and distractions 
of midlife have passed they become especially responsive sexually 
most healthy older men maintain their production of sex hormones 
at levels found in younger men however it usually takes an older 
man longer to achieve full erection 
although a pattern of regular sexual activity helps to preserve 
sexual ability research shows a gradual decline of sexual activity 
with age studies at the national institute on agings gerontology 
research center found that levels of sexual activity expressed in 
early adulthood usually predicted activity later in life 
overall health is of primary importance in maintaining sexual 
relationships in a study of 241 married men 60 and older 75 
percent of those without mobility problems reported they were 
sexually active while only 16 percent of those with mobility 
problems were 
even a serious disease rarely warrants stopping sexual 
relations one distressing myth is that sex is bad for your heart 
although cardiac patients should check with a doctor before 
resuming sexual activities generally the risk of a heart attack 
during sexual intercourse is about equal to the risk from climbing 
a flight of stairs 
several diseases such as arthritis can limit sexual activity 
depression a treatable disorder is one of the most common causes 
of altered sexual motivation 
diabetes is one of the few diseases that can cause impotence 
however once diabetes is diagnosed and controlled potency may be 
restored 
excessive use of alcohol which may reduce potency in men and 
delay orgasm in women is probably the most widespread drugrelated 
cause of sexual problems tranquilizers antidepressants and 
certain high blood pressure drugs may also cause impotence other 
drugs may reduce sexual desire 
almost everyone experiences a sexual problem at some time or 
another because sexual functioning is emotional and psychological 
as well as physical whats happening in the family or at work can 
have an important influence 
when problems occur they should not be viewed as a sign of 
aging but rather as the possible result of disease disability 
drug reactions or emotinal upset many sexual problems have 
emotional or organic causes that can be treated 
one barrier to a healthy sex life in old age stems from the 
disturbing myth that older people lose their sex appeal negative 
stereotypes are still too common any expression of sexual interest 
by an older woman who has no partner is typically viewed as 
unacceptable in our society the dirty old man who seeks sexual 
expression is the object of many jokes 
with the increasing lifespan and improvement of the overall 
health of older people sexual activity becomes an important aspect 
in overall quality of life

to most gardeners in this country whiteflies are 
minor nuisances that look like flakes of dandruff when disturbed 
but forget foreign invaders like killer bees fire ants and 
japanese beetles the ash whitefly now is in the united states 
so far its been spotted mainly around los angeles but dave 
langston entomologist for the university of arizonastate 
extension service says there are some suspicious areas in arizona 
and hes pretty sure confirmed outbreaks will be found this summer 
in this state and possibly others 
that would be consistent with californias experience 
california agriculture published by the university of 
california says in the januaryfebruary edition that since the 
first north american report of ash whitefly in the summer of 1988 
populations have reached extraordinary levels in los angeles 
county and may affect fruit and nursery crops throughout the 
state 
the scientific name of this super whitefly is siphoninus 
phillyreae first recorded in 1835 its now known in most of 
europe northern africa the middle east southern russia pakistan 
and india natural enemies limit severe outbreaks in the old world 
unfortunately there dont seem to be any on this continent 
california is experimenting this spring with imported biological 
controls including a tiny wasp 
meantime gardeners should be prepared 
insecticides never have been effective against even our native 
whiteflies but for the most part damage has been isolated 
the ash whitefly is like comparing a tiger to a cat climate 
hot or cold doesnt seem a problem it reproduces in about 25 days 
and passes through four stages all of which feed by sucking sap 
from leaves there frequently are reports of clusters on every leaf 
of a mature tree adults often are inhaled or caught in peoples 
eyes known hosts besides ash trees include citrus olive 
pomegranate jujube apple peach pear loquat apricot plum and 
many ornamental shrubs and trees 
the common name ash whitefly was applied in this country after 
the first ones were found on ash trees in europe its usually 
known as the pear whitefly or peach whitefly because of damage to 
those crops some textbooks call it the pomegranate whitefly 
whiteflies were more numerous than usual last year in arizona 
is it possible some were ash whitefly 
not a chance says langston once you get this one youll 
know it trees turn yellow some die its not like now when you 
get just honeydew and whiteflies flying around these arent 
necessarily any bigger in size but they feed a lot more and suck 
large quantities of fluid so theres major symptoms on foliage 
california agriculture says populations grow to enormous 
densities often covering 100 percent of available foliage and 
producing substantial amounts of honeydew and sooty molds 
to entomologists appearance of the species is unique because of 
40 to 50 tiny dorsal siphon tubes in the pupal stage but 
whiteflies are too small for gardeners to spot this so damage will 
be the clue 
i think this summer well see a couple isolated cases in 
arizona where well have to treat for it says langston what 
well use i have no idea since i understand nothing works 
biological control probably is the ultimate answer 
pesticide treatment in the california experience may be 
successful in small areas such as nurseries sprays or water or 
insecticidal soap seem to reduce the population on smaller plants 
however reinfestation is likely from nearby vegetation 
many nurserytrade groups and government agencies including the 
california department of food and agriculture are participating 
with the university of california in the biological control 
program encarsia wasps supplied by israel and italy have been 
promising in field tests the wasps reproduce by laying eggs inside 
ash whitefly nymphs which are eaten by the wasp larvae 
the ash whitefly probably entered this country on plants sent to 
los angeles either by air or sea according to california 
agriculture infestation in los angeles county was widespread 
when first reported justdetectable levels were found then in an 
adjoining county however between the following spring and autumn 
that infestation grew to nearly equal that in los angeles

a senior citizens group is urging president 
bush to fill two vacancies on the social security board of 
trustees saying the public is being denied a voice in oversight of 
the giant retirement program 
the national council of senior citizens said the administration 
has failed to fill two positions reserved for the public one 
democrat and one republican leaving the board controlled by the 
three government officials on it 
the board is charged with oversight of social securitys giant 
trust funds and of operations at the social security 
administration the two public trustee positions have been vacant 
since november according to the council 
the president has elected to ignore the virtues of a system of 
checks and balances because that very system might further expose 
unsound management principles and inadequate resources within the 
social security administration said lawrence smedley executive

legislation has been introduced in the senate 
to allow the a national seniors competition to use the word 
olympics 
the first national senior olympics in st louis in 1987 
attracted more than 2500 participants including athletes from 
canada and taiwan the competition was open to people over 55 
however after the 1987 games the us olympic committee said 
the games could no longer use the word olympics arguing it 
would compete programmatically or financially with the united 
states olympic effort 
sen john danforth rmo was among 18 senators who wrote to 
the us olympic committee in 1988 asking that the us national 
senior olympics be allowed to continue under that name but the 
committee refused the request 
danforth this month introduced legislation that would authorize 
the us national senior olympics to use the term and to register 
the name as its trademark 
the next games now called the us senior sports classic are 
to be held june 28july 3 1991 in syracuse ny

a coalition of national groups representing 
older americans is urging members of congress to cut defense 
spending to help reduce the federal budget deficit 
members of the leadership council of aging organizations sent a 
letter to members of the house and senate budget committees stating 
that the reduced threat of communism around the world means massive 
defense spending no longer is justified 
without a significant reduction in military spending 
acrosstheboard federal spending cuts may be necessary which 
would have a disproportionate effect on domestic programs the 
groups added 
the groups said at least 20 billion should be cut from the 
defense budget in fiscal 1991 perhaps through eliminating new 
weapons systems reducing troops sharing defense responsiblities 
with us allies and stricter regulation of defense procurement

nearly twothirds of workingage americans do 
not think medicare will provide them with the same level of 
benefits that it does today when they become eligible for coverage 
according to a nationwide survey 
the january survey of 1001 americans age 18 and older was 
conducted for the employee benefit research institute by the gallup 
organization sixtyfour percent of those not yet eligible for 
medicare said they did not expect to get the same benefits as 
todays medicare beneficiaries 
respondents approaching retirement age were most confident in 
the systems ability to pay benefits thirtysix percent of those 
aged 55 and older said they expect the program to be able to pay 
them todays level of benefits while 19 percent of those aged 
3554 and 26 percent of those aged 1834 had that view 
those surveyed were divided about whether they would be willing 
to pay more now to guarantee medicare benefits later fortyeight 
percent said they would be willing to pay an increased social 
security contribution during working years to insure that they 
receive the current level of medicare in the future 47 pecent said 
they would not be willing to do so and 5 percent were unsure 
eightysix percent of respondents thought they would need 
additional health insurance beyond what is provided by medicare 
the survey showed a lack of understanding about the medicare 
program more than half of those surveyed thought medicare covered 
individuals when they retire rather than when they reach the 
eligibility age of 65 
thirtyseven percent thought medicare covers home health care 
and 26 percent thought it covered extended stays in nursing homes 
neither of which is covered

gulf i nuclear plant near port gibson miss a project that cost 
about six times more than original estimates 
middle south utilities built the plant and ordered its 
subsidiaries to share in the financing the costs then were passed 
on to consumers in the form of higher rates 
mississippi officials said consumers from their state are being 
forced to pay unfairly to help operate other nuclear plants in the 
middle south utilities system 
that argument was rejected by the federal energy regulatory 
commission when it adopted a rate formula for the four utilities 
the formula was pegged to each utilitys demand for electricity 
generated by the entire system 
mississippi officials said consumers there are helping pay for 
nuclear plants that supply no power to mississippians 
the us circuit court of appeals here last year upheld the 
commissions rate formula 
the appeals court said the commission properly allocated costs 
by basing them on overall demand by each utility and by taking into 
account that consumers in one state benefit indirectly from the 
systems nuclear units that only serve customers in the other 
states 
for example the appeals court said a nuclear plant in arkansas 
produces extra power available to be used by utilities from the 
other states 
the case is mississippi vs federal energy regulatory 
commission 891041

internal revenue service form 4868 is one of 
the mostsought pieces of paper in the nation today as an estimated 
6 million americans abandon hopes of meeting the midnight deadline 
for filing a federal tax return 
filing a form 4868 along with a check for estimated taxes owed 
automatically extends the return deadline to aug 15 
irs offices and postal service branches in many parts of the 
country planned extra hours today to accommodate those who put off 
the inevitable 
the irs did not estimate how many couples and individuals were 
waiting until the last minute to file but the agency predicted 
that about 34 million returns more than 30 percent of the 111 
million expected this year would be filed april 7 or later 
residents of new england and new yorkers who mail their returns 
to the irs service center in andover mass have until midnight 
tuesday because monday is patriots day a state holiday in 
massachusetts 
as the 1989 returnfiling season drew to a close the tax 
foundation offered some sobering news the average person will have 
to work 125 days this year through may 5 just to pay his or her 
share of federal state and local taxes 
that is the latest ever for the organizations tax freedom 
day last year the nonpartisan research organization put the 
date at may 3 it reached may 4 in 1981 before the 
acrosstheboard tax cuts voted that year took effect 
this year the foundation calculated tax freedom day in each 
state and found new hampshire and south dakota the earliest april 
19 residents of the district of columbia and new york will have to 
work through may 23 to settle their taxes 
the state figures are influenced not only by state and local 
taxes but by personal incomes those with higher incomes tend to 
have a later tax freedom day 
the foundation attributed the growing tax burden to new laws 
reducing itemized deductions a social security tax increase that 
will cost workers more than 10 billion this year boosts in state 
and local taxes and a gradually slowing economy 
the nations nominal income is estimated to grow only 57 
percent in 1990 while the total tax take is projected to increase 
72 percent the organization said 
viewed from another perspective the average worker will toil 
three minutes longer each day this year a total of 2 hours 45 
minutes of each eighthour day to pay taxes that is one minute 
longer for federal taxes and two minutes more for state and local 
the foundation says more bad news may be on the way 
the combined pressures of a persistent federal budget deficit 
demands to expand funding for new and existing programs budget 
crises in numerous states and the slowdown in income growth could 
easily make tax freedom day even later on our calendars the 
foundation said 
the tax foundation calculations assume that individuals pay all 
taxes including those collected from corporations 
about eight of 10 tax returns filed so far this year have 
qualified for refunds averaging more than 850 each 
the irs cautioned that taxpayers who owe but dont have the 
money to pay should not let that deter them from filing by the 
deadline since that could result in separate penalties for failing 
to file on time and not paying on time 
if you cannot pay the irs advises file your return on time and 
attach a letter of explanation you still may face a late payment 
penalty 
other tips for eleventhhour filers 
about 14 percent of taxpayers are making mistakes on their 
returns one of the most common is copying the wrong figure from 
the tax tables doublecheck your arithmetic if a parent or 
someone else can claim you as a dependent check the proper box 
if you do not itemize deductions remember to write in your 
standard deduction 
attach your w2 forms and any schedules and supplemental forms 
in the proper sequence youll find the sequence number in the 
upper right corner just under 1989 
your return will not be accepted if not signed if it is a 
joint return both spouses must sign 
dont forget the correct postage use of the barcoded irs 
envelope expedites the mail and use of the gummed label on the 
front of your return could mean a quicker refund

torchmark corp began calling for proxies monday 
for a slate of five independent nominees to american general 
corps board who face selection at the insurance and financial 
firms annual meeting may 2 
the action follows thursdays ruling by the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals that stayed a preliminary injunction prohibiting 
torchmark from soliciting proxies for directors 
american general based in houston has argued that nominees for 
the board had to be presented by march 3 or 20 days after it 
notified shareholders of its annual meeting 
but the threejudge panel questioned the validity of the march 3 
date since american generals feb 15 report did not mention vital 
information including the fact american general had expanded its 
board from 13 to 15 members and that shareholders were being asked 
to vote for six directors instead of four 
torchmark said monday it had mailed the supplemental proxy 
materials to american general shareholders over the weekend proxy 
materials initially had been sent soliciting support for a 
nonbinding resolution calling for the board to seek a sale or 
merger of american general 
a spokesman for torchmark said if the independent nominees are 
elected and the shareholder resolution is adopted torchmark 
intends to submit another bid for american general

weak demand for paper products coupled with 
higher prices for logs and wood chips sent boise cascade corps 
firstquarter profit plunging 57 percent the company said monday 
the woodproducts company said firstquarter earnings totaled 
336 million or 73 cents per share down from 782 million or 
178 a share in the januarymarch quarter a year ago 
sales were off fractionally to remain over 1 billion in the 
first quarter 
the decline in firstquarter income was the result of 
continuing adverse market conditions for the companys paper 
business board chairman john fery said in a statement 
he also said deliveredlog costs for the companys building 
products segment were higher than those of the same period in 1989 
particularly in the pacific northwest 
operating income from the companys paper segment which has 
accounted for up to twothirds of boise cascades income dropped 
to under 51 million in the first quarter of this year from nearly 
127 million in the same period a year earlier 
fery said sluggish demand for most paper grades manufactured by 
the company along with higher prices for wood chips in the pacific 
northwest hurt results 
operating income from the building products segment slumped to 
191 million from 221 million the previous year as log prices 
were up and lumber prices down fery said 
the company said its office products segment reported record 
sales and operating income in the first quarter sales jumped 12 
percent and income was up 16 percent on what fery said was 
seasonally robust demand combined with increased corporate emphasis 
on operating efficiency 
in the current quarter fery expects the office products 
business should be seasonally down while the building products 
business should show some improvement 
pricing in the companys pulp and paper business should show 
little change overall while we expect additional downtime 
associated with several paper mill capital projects and continued 
sluggish demand for some products he said

grain and soybean futures prices advanced monday 
at the chicago board of trade reversing an early retreat as rumors 
circulated about a possible soviet wheat deal 
earlier in the day prices dipped as wet weekend weather and a 
forecast for more rain in the midwest sparked selling in the grain 
and bean pits analysts said 
but talk about the russians possibly being in the market for 
wheat 300000 to 600000 tons encouraged a wave of buying said 
victor lespinasse a grains trader for dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
concerns about the weather in the midwest were tempered by 
bullish rains in brazil that could curb the south american soybean 
harvest he said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 369 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents higher with may at 269 a bushel oats were 1 cent to

citicorp on monday gave its 132 california 
branches the flagship citibank name 
the nations largest banking concern which is based in new 
york had been forced to keep its california operations separate 
since it began operating in the state in 1982 after acquiring san 
franciscobased fidelity savings 
but the barriers came down in last years thrift bailout law 
known as the financial institutions reform recovery and 
enforcement act or firrea 
california is not allowing the big commercial banks from new 
york inside its borders until 1991 but citicorp does not fall 
under that restriction because its state operations are chartered 
as a savings and loan formerly known as citicorp savings 
the citibank branches in california are now able to sell retail 
banking services to state residents who already conduct business 
with the company through its new york headquarters 
one example of the new freedom is the right for california 
branches to contact the 15 million residents who have a citibank 
credit card and attempt to sign them up for a checking or savings 
account 
the old regulations meant that the savings branches in 
california could not crossmarket to any customers with the new 
york branches the rigorous regulations forced citicorp to hire an 
independent electronic network to allow its california customers 
the use of automatic teller machines in new york 
there were a lot of people in california who didnt know that 
citicorp savings was part of the largest bank in the united 
states said david a brooks in charge of citicorps consumer 
banking in the west 
its the end of a disadvantage for citicorp said donald k 
crowley an analyst with keefe bruyette and woods in san 
francisco they are now in position to bring more of their 
consumer products and muscle to california

chase manhattan corp and manufacturers hanover 
corp said monday that their first quarter earnings declined over a 
year ago while another large banking company jp morgan amp co 
reported higher profit 
all three banks however continued to feel the pinch of the 
third world debt problem 
chase manhattan said it netted 44 million or 20 cents per 
share for the first three months of 1990 down 66 percent from 
132 million or 127 a share earned in 1989 
manufacturers hanover said net income declined 68 percent to 
96 million or 121 per share from 103 million or 184 per 
share in 1989 the 1990 quarter reflects issuance of more than 18 
million shares of new stock last year 
jp morgans quarterly earnings more than doubled to 399 
million or 209 per share from 180 million or 96 cents in the 
same period last year 
chase said its earnings were hurt by a 75 million increase in 
provisions for losses from bad loans mostly because of 
deterioration in some us commercial real estate markets 
the company added 225 million to reserves against possible loan 
losses in the first quarter up from 150 million a year ago and 
130 million in the 1989 fourth quarter 
if economic conditions in domestic commercial real estate 
markets deteriorate further it is likely that the provision for 
possible credit losses will continue at relatively high levels 
chase said in a statement 
total loan loss reserves at chase on march 31 were 319 
billion including 235 billion to developing countries compared 
with 273 billion a year ago 
the bank said it wrote off 325 million in bad loans in the 
quarter including 114 million to third world countries up from a 
total of 159 million in the yearago period 
manufacturers hanover said it wrote off 246 million in loans to 
developing countries in the quarter compared with 10 million a 
year ago and 73 million for other loans down from 89 million 
the bad foreign loans included debt exchanges on loans to mexico 
and argentina 
manufactures hanover said it added 73 million to its loan loss 
reserves in the quarter down from 87 million a year earlier its 
total reserve against bad loans was 243 billion as of march 31 
including 197 billion for loans to developing countries those 
figures were up from 221 billion and 168 billion respectively 
in the 1989 quarter 
jp morgan attributed its gain largely to increases in revenue 
from trading investment management and other services but it said 
net interest revenue was down 11 percent mainly because it received 
no interest on loans to brazil in the quarter 
the company said it increased its reserve against loan loasses 
to 235 billion from 149 billion a year earlier the bank said 
it had 31 billion in outstanding loans to developing counties 
down from 46 billion a year earlier 
the bank added 10 million to its loan loss reserves in the 
quarter same as in the yearago period 
jp morgan also reported 265 million in losses from the sale 
or exchange of third world loans in the first quarter

about 50 steelworkers waved signs and 
black flags outside wheelingpittsburgh steel corp headquarters 
monday to protest sluggish contract negotiations on the fifth 
anniversary of the companys bankruptcy 
its april 16th a day of mourning said galvie gardner one 
of the demonstrators and president of united steelworkers union 
local 1187 at wheelingpitts allenport pa plant 
five years of working for substandard wages gardner said 
most of the steelworkers wore black armbands and some carried 
signs aimed at wheelingpittsburgh executives that read restore 
our standard of living and we helped you now you help us 
the steelworkers union buttressed the protest with 4638 in 
fullpage newspaper advertisements in four newspapers 
the ad and the protest are both for the same purpose said 
dick fontana a spokesman at the unions headquarters in 
pittsburgh we want to protest the lack of progress in the 
negotiations 
our wages and benefits have been frozen at low levels for five 
long years said the ad signed by usw international president 
lynn williams district directors representing usw locals in ohio 
pennsylvania and west virginia and the presidents of 11 union 
locals 
and wheelingpitt and its creditors demand that we agree to be 
frozen into secondclass status for three more years the 
advertisement said thats not right 
wheelingpittsburgh filed for protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code on april 16 1985 
contract talks between the steelworkers and the company stalled 
in february when the union accused wheelingpittsburgh of refusing 
to file an amended reorganization plan 
on monday lawyers representing the groups discussed amendments 
to the reorganization plan proposed by unsecured creditors and 
supported by the company 
the steelworkers have been working under terms of a 
concessionary contract they accepted after a 98day strike that 
ended about six months after the company filed for bankruptcy 
that contract is to remain in effect until 10 days after a 
reorganization plan is confirmed by us bankruptcy judge warren 
bentz in pittsburgh 
the steelmaker filed its plan on april 3 along with a plan 
drafted by goldman sachs amp co a new york investment firm lawyers 
representing the company the unsecured creditors and goldman 
sachs told the bankruptcy court last week they had reached a 
compromise more favorable to shareholders

the accounting firm of laventhol amp horvath 
hit by costly litigation payments is cutting profit payouts and 
personnel but its executive partnerelect said monday that 
business was generally strong 
robert n levine said layoffs were following the usual 
accounting industry pattern of spring cuts and fall hiring 
thats the cycle our cycle is no different this year than 
its been in past years he said 
he declined to say how many people would be laid off but said 
it would be no more than usual certainly below 10 percent 
we look at productivity and performance when we make these 
cuts he said we dont look at a number 
the firm seventh largest accounting concern in the country has 
been hit hard by lawsuits in recent years alleging poor work 
leading to large payments 
levine said a quarterly profit payout to partners in april to 
pay taxes was cut in half because litigation payments reduced 
taxable income and tax liabilities 
we reduced that payment accordingly levine said but added 
that the firm plans to increase 12 monthly profit payouts this 
year 
laventhol has 425 partners 3500 professional staffers and 
1200 administrative workers in 51 offices nationwide levine 
officially becomes executive partner june 1 but is running the 
firms operations now 
revenue for the fiscal year ending jan 31 was 345 million up 
52 percent from the previous year he said operating profit not 
counting litigation costs was down 9 percent from a year ago 
he said the firm took on two major clients this month that would 
be the top two clients in terms of fees and number of staff serving 
them he would not name the clients 
im looking forward to the best year we ever had levine 
said 
he said reports of hard times for the firm came from jealous 
competitors 
laventhol settled a classaction lawsuit in december with 
investors in several fraudulent limited partnerships for which it 
prepared audited financial statements insurance covered only 44 
million of the 135 million settlement 
a settlement in october with nine creditor banks stemming from a 
holdingcompany bankruptcy proceeding cost the firm 30 million of 
which 20 million was covered in 1988 it paid 15 million to 
settle an antiracketeering suit that was covered by insurance he 
said 
besides the profit payout cut and layoffs the company is 
offering early retirement to some partners 
were seeking greater productivity and are streamlining our 
firm he said 
according to bowmans accounting report revenue growth for 
major firms slowed to 128 percent in 1989 from 1725 percent a 
year earlier 
i think that the industry as a whole just as american 
business as a whole has been tightening up and everyone is 
scrambling to be prodcutive levine said

energy futures finished higher monday as fresh 
buying emerged after last weeks sharp selloff 
oil prices also got a boost from news that ministers from three 
opec countries would meet informally tuesday to discuss the 
weakness in world markets due to an abundance of crude 
the heaviest buying occurred in the unleaded gasoline pits on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline jumped 166 
cents to 6021 cents a gallon more than making up for a loss of 
103 cents on thursday the last previous day of trading markets 
were closed for the good friday holiday contracts for delivery 
further in the future also ended with substantial gains 
among other refined petroleum products traded on the merc home 
heating oil for may delivery rose 089 to 5472 cents a gallon 
adding to thursdays increase of 020 cent later contracts posted 
slightly smaller advances 
the may contract of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade 
of us crude oil edged up 7 cents to 1785 a 42gallon barrel 
after retreating 28 cents on thursday the june july and august 
crude contracts had stronger increases 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery settled at 1598 per 
million british thermal units the same as thursdays close the 
july and august contracts also ended unchanged 
much of the renewed buying monday appeared to be technical in 
nature and didnt reflect a shift in sentiment toward the energy 
market analysts said in particular the gasoline buying was 
attributed to short covering as market participants bought to 
compensate for previous selling 
a report that oil ministers from saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates would meet in jiddah saudi arabia on tuesday 
offered some encouragment to oil traders worried about the impact 
plentiful oil supplies are having on prices 
the saudi press agency quoted the saudi oil minister hisham 
nazer as saying the meeting would take place he also expressed 
concern about some opec members violating the cartels oil 
production quotas it was saudi arabias first official response to 
last weeks wild price swings 
but the positive reaction to the news was blunted by the belief 
that the organization of petroleum exporting countries is not about 
to enact a sweeping cut in production to shore up prices 
nothings really happened fundamentally to change the market 
around said energy analyst james steel at refco inc theres 
no real reason to reverse the downtrend just because these three 
oil ministers are meeting

primerica corp said monday its firstquarter 
earnings rose 62 percent including a 149 percent gain at its wall 
street subsidiary smith barney harris upham amp co 
analysts said the rise at smith barney was strong during a 
slowdown in the securities industry and that worse results were 
expected at other firms smith barney was the first brokerage to 
report firstquarter earnings 
smith barney reported it had a profit of 131 million on 
revenue of 384 million in the quarter ended march 31 up from a 
profit of 114 million on revenue of 291 million in the same 1989 
quarter 
overall primerica a diversified financial company reported 
earnings of 832 million or 73 a share on revenue of 144 
billion that compared with net income of 514 million or 53 
cents a share on revenue of 124 billion in the same period a 
year ago 
primerica reported earnings increases of 21 percent in its 
consumer finance division and 37 percent in its insurance services 
business which includes al williams and gulf insurance 
in new york stock exchange trading monday primerica rose 75 
cents to close at 3025 
the rise at smith barney comes during a prolonged slump in wall 
street business including retail brokerage activity and investment 
banking services such as stock and bond underwriting 
if they had a good quarter i think thats notable said 
lawrence eckenfelder who follows the industry for prudentialbache 
securities inc in san francisco i dont think youre going to 
see too many of the other firms show that kind of a gain 
because smith barney is a subsidiary of a larger corporation 
analysts have difficulty tracking its business in detail 
primerica said in a statement that smith barneys results 
reflected good performance in most businesses particularly in 
retail brokerage asset management and investment banking 
in a sign of better retail brokerage activity primerica said 
smith barney benefitted from the acquisition of 16 retail offices 
of collapsed drexel burnham lambert inc last may 
analysts said individual investment activity for the first 
quarter was better than in the same 1989 period

the aluminum company of america said monday 
its earnings plunged 46 percent in the first quarter and blamed the 
decrease in part on a 36 million decline in results from its 
brazilian affiliate 
alcoa the worlds largest aluminum producer said earnings also 
suffered because of reduced shipments of fabricated products and a 
drop in prices for those items and for ingots the company said 
increased sales of ingot also contributed to the slump 
for the first quarter alcoa reported earnings of 1486 
million or 169 a share on sales of 26 billion that compared 
with earnings in the first quarter of 1989 of 276 million or 
312 per share on sales of 26 billion 
alcoa chairman paul h oneill said the companys share of 
earnings from brazilian affiliate alcoa aluminio was at 
breakeven the first quarter of this year during the same period 
of 1989 brazilian earnings for alcoa amounted to 36 million he 
said 
alcoas order rates in march were better than in recent 
months oneill said in a statement given the softness in the 
economy we are pleased by the level of first quarter earnings 
oneill said alcoa expects its earnings from the brazilian 
venture to be hurt throughout the year but he said the company 
expects to benefit in the long run from measures being taken to 
curb rampant inflation in the country

international business machines corp helped 
give the stock market a boost monday after reporting a 
betterthanexpected 9 percent jump in first quarter earnings over 
a year ago 
the worlds biggest computer company considered a bellwether 
stock on wall street said continued worldwide demand for its 
product line resulted in stronger revenue and higher profits 
some analysts said the improvement was partly a rebound from a 
depressed first quarter 1989 when ibm experienced shipment 
problems in its mainframe computer line 
for the three months ended march 31 ibm earned 103 billion 
or 181 per share compared with a profit of 950 million or 
161 a share in 1989 revenue rose 11 percent to 1418 billion 
from 1273 billion 
ibms results exceeded expectations of most analysts who were 
predicting earnings per share of between 135 and 170 ibm had 
been forecasting 155 to 165 a share profit some analysts said 
ibm closed up 375 to 11087 a share monday in active 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
the rise in ibm considered one of the most heavily weighted 
stocks in the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip 
companies helped boost the dow by 1126 to 276306 without it 
the dow which rose as much as 41 points before giving back some of 
its gains would have been little changed analysts said 
don young a computer analyst with sanford c bernstein amp co 
called ibms quarterly revenue gain its best in several years he 
also noted that operating income was up 33 percent to 213 billion 
from 160 billion expenses led by higher income taxes rose to 
1204 billion from 1112 billion 
but young stopped short of predicting a major turnaround for 
ibm which has seen its earnings and stock performance weaken in 
recent years 
the worlds largest computer maker was hurt by the dollars 
volatility and the companys difficulty in making transitions to 
new products it also has faced slow growth in demand for its big 
mainframe computers which were being overtaken by speedy personal 
computers and workstations 
william j milton jr a computer analyst with brown brothers 
harriman agreed it was too early to say ibm had turned the corner 
for good ibm has said nothing about a resurgence we do know 
from dealer surveys in recent months that ibm has been gaining 
market share in its personal computer share as far as demand for 
other products we dont know 
he said in the yearago quarter ibms earnings were depressed 
because a chip problem caused a delay in shipment of mainframe 
computers the biggest and most profitable part of ibms product 
line 
still market observers said mondays results helped push 
bluechip stocks higher by dispelling worries that first quarter 
corporate profits would be widely disappointing 
ibms results are among the first of a deluge of firstquarter 
earnings reports expected over the next several days analyst say 
the reports could have a major impact on the stock market in the 
near term 
ibm chairman john f akers said he was encouraged by the latest 
results 
our strategy of listening to our customers and improving the 
competitiveness of our products and services is working he said 
in a statement we are focusing our investments to take advantage 
of the opportunities in our industry and we are streamlining our 
operations while we improve our product line 
in the first quarter ibm introduced several products among 
them were its risc system6000 workstations aimed at capturing a 
share of the small but fastgrowing market for such machines 
the new machines have garnered favorable comments from industry 
analysts who called them impressive for their performance pricing 
and features 
the application of new technology to customers business 
problems is really the key to ibms future success said sam 
albert who runs the computer consulting firm sam albert associates 
inc of scarsdale ny 
those applications are starting to pay off

zenith electronics corp said monday that 
the french company groupe bull had agreed to pay an additional 15 
million plus interest for zeniths computer products business 
that brought the final sale price to about 511 million 
when zenith sold the business to parisbased groupe bull on dec 
28 it received an advance payment of 4964 million in cash 
effectively closing the sale of zenith data systems 
zenith said in a statement that 30 days of negotiations led to 
the agreement for groupe bull to pay the additional money 
groupe bull had contended earlier that postclosing adjustments 
should result in a refund from zenith of about 49 million while 
zenith contended groupe bull still owed it an additional payment 
the dispute would have been submitted to arbitration if the 
companies had not reached an agreement 
zenith said its firstquarter results for fiscal 1990 would 
reflect a charge to discontinued operations of about 11 million 
because the negotiated final payment was less than the net 
receivable that zenith had recorded on its books at year end 
on oct 2 zenith had announced an agreement to sell the 
computer unit to bull for 919 million plus the adjusted net book 
value of the assets sold for a total that zenith initially 
estimated at 635 million and later lowered to an estimated 610 
million 
no one answered the telephone at groupe bulls us offices in

a federal bankruptcy judge on monday approved a 
plan that allows troubled general development corp to receive 
105 million in temporary financing for six weeks until it can 
arrange permanent financing 
general development already owes 175 million to the eight banks 
who guaranteed the interim financing according to a schedule 
submitted monday to us bankruptcy judge aj cristol 
each bank will put up a proportionate amount of the 105 
million based on the total owed to them under the plan submitted 
by attorneys for gdc and the banks and approved by cristol 
general development filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy april 6 
claiming a severe cash shortage after failing to secure 60 million 
in shortterm credit 
cristol heard objections from lawyers representing property 
owners from all over the united states who objected to a clause in 
the agreement under which gdc had to give the subscribing banks 
liens on the properties 
but lawyers for the property owners appeared satisfied when they 
were assured by attorneys for gdc and the banks that those who had 
paid in full for their property believed to number about 12000 
would not be encumbered with a bank lien when their deeds are 
delivered 
but they were reminded that as previously agreed the property 
owners might not get the same lot they paid for but might get one 
of equal or greater value in a portion of the development already 
built the company is not involved in property improvements for the 
time being 
attorneys for other property owners appeared skeptical 
if everybody works together this thing will work the judge 
told them the alternative is to see everything swept away 
the financing arrangement will expire june 1 and under the 
proposal it will be secured by a lien on all of gdcs assets 
including the collateral and all other real and personal property 
 
the collateral is identified as accounts receivable payments 
from property owners real estate and fixtures mortgages 
contracts and stock and various subsidiaries of general development 
cristol directed that the banks participating in the new 105 
million temporary loan should not be permitted to enhance their 
position in relation to other creditors 
cristols order says in part among other things entry of 
this order will minimize the disruption of gdcs businesses and 
operations as going concerns and will increase the possibility of a 
successful reorganization 
the entry of this order appears to be in the best interest of 
the debtors their creditors and the estates

resorts international inc said monday it 
lost 303 million in 1989 and planned to sell its lucrative 
properties in the bahamas to help pay off its debts and emerge from 
bankruptcy 
resorts also filed an amended bankruptcy reorganization plan 
that called for bondholders to exchange their securities for new 
debt and 78 percent of the companys stock the plan made minor 
changes to a proposal the company filed late last year 
spokesman harris diamond said the property sale would erase 
hundreds of millions of dollars of debt resorts has been carrying 
since entertainer merv griffin purchased the company from donald 
trump in late 1988 
if you look at the company debt structure it just made the 
most sense diamond said assuming everything goes ok were 
hoping to be out of bankruptcy by summer 
the chapter 11 reorganization plan which will reduce griffins 
stake to 22 percent of resorts stock has to be approved by the 
us bankruptcy court owners of twothirds of the bonds and the 
state casino control commission 
the government of the commonwealth of the bahamas also must 
approve any deals involving resorts holdings which include a 
casino four hotels a golf course and undeveloped land on paradise 
island and grand bahama island 
resorts said it posted a net loss of 3028 million for 1989 
compared with 3814 million a year earlier last years loss 
reflected a writeoff of 1813 million in goodwill or the amount 
by which griffins purchase price exceeded resorts assets and 
interest payments of 1215 million 
operating losses were 78 million in 1989 compared with 
profits of 284 million in 1988 
industry observers say the sale of paradise island with 
estimated profits of 25 million to 30 million a year makes sense 
for resorts and will help it to refurbish its sagging atlantic city 
casino 
paradise island is a very successful place and it ought to be 
very marketable said dan lee a gaming analyst with first boston 
corp who added that the resort is the leading casino in the 
caribbean 
something had to be done the bondholders were insisting on 
cash and there was a building that needed refurbishing he said 
if they can sell and recoup substantial values then it would 
make sense to go forward said ron grobeck a research analyst 
with rd smith a new york brokerage that specializes in 
distressed securities 
grobeck said resorts has 200 undeveloped acres in paradise 
island and 1500 undeveloped acres on grand bahama 
they are not generating any value he said to the extent 
that they could put it on the block maybe it makes sense to cash 
in 
the amended reorganization plan calls for holders of certain 
resorts debt to receive an additional 20 million in new bonds it 
also calls for griffin to invest a total of 26 million into the 
company 
resorts outstanding debts include about 600 million in bonds 
that were issued before griffins takeover and another 325 million 
of junk bonds griffin issued to finance the acquisition 
the reorganization blueprint keeps intact plans for a 
fraudulent conveyance lawsuit against trump for which a 5 
million litigation fund is to be established 
the suit would claim that something of value was transferred to 
trump in the buyout without him giving a fair return to the 
company one such asset is the taj mahal which trump bought for 
273 million as part of his deal with griffin after resorts spent 
about 500 million on it
