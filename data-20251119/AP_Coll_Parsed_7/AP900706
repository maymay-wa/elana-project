a heroic soviet helicopter pilot who developed 
leukemia after helping entomb the burning chernobyl nuclear reactor 
did not die in vain his widow said at a memorial service thursday 
galina grischenko spoke of the treatment her husband anatoly 
grischenko received at the fred hutchinson cancer research center 
where he died monday at age 53 
i think that this example of good cooperation will help all 
others who have suffered in the chernobyl disaster mrs 
grischenko said speaking through an interpreter 
about 50 hospital officials friends of mrs grischenko and 
wellwishers attended the service at a funeral home 
grischenko was among the pilots who flew helicopters over the 
damaged highly radioactive chernobyl nuclear plant for three days 
after the 1986 disaster dropping huge loads of sand and wet cement 
to encase the burning reactor 
he and several others in the operation were designated heroes of 
the soviet union that countrys highest honor 
grishchenko suffered acute radiation sickness after the disaster 
and was found to have leukemia last year because the only bone 
marrow transplant center in the soviet union could not treat him 
he was flown to seattle on april 11 a bone marrow transplant was 
performed at the cancer center later that month 
doctors reported encouraging progress after the transplant but 
grishchenkos condition worsened when a monthsold lung infection 
flared up and he had to undergo surgery june 12 he was placed on a 
respirator june 15 and died monday night 
the term hero is well applied to him dr richard 
vanderjagt said at the memorial service 
it is sometimes used loosely but certainly not with regards to 
him said vanderjagt i really do feel that anatoly was a great 
hero 
dr john hansen an associate director of the hutchinson center 
said grishchenko has helped focus renewed attention on chernobyl 
there is a lot to be done about the chernobyl disaster 
hansen said and of course there is a lot to be done about world 
peace 
grishchenkos body was to be flown back to moscow this weekend 
accompanied by mrs grishchenko and the pilots soviet physician 
dr eugenia margulis

piece of cake the pbs miniseries on 
masterpiece theater for the next six sunday nights is the 
compellingly watchable tale of a raf fighter squadron during the 
first year of world war ii 
thats not to say the london weekend television production 
doesnt have its flaws but theyre not significant enough to 
hamper an american audiences enjoyment of a fine cast great 
aerial photography and a good story 
piece of cake raf slang for a task as pleasant as it is 
easy opens in 1939 when germany invaded poland great britain 
declared war on germany and nobody did anything in particular 
it was sitzkrieg or phony war and germany consolidated its 
gains on the continent before pushing the allies out of france it 
was more than a year before hitler launched the air war that became 
known as the battle of britain 
so we have time to learn about the gallant lads of hornet 
squadron before they defend their homeland from the luftwaffe days 
after war is declared their squadron leader dies in a fourfoot 
tumble from his cockpit 
then in their first combat theyre scrambled up against a 
flight of incoming planes and shoot down a fighter 
their donnish and impious intelligence officer skull 
skelton wonderfully played by richard hope the upmarket mobster 
of bellman and true notes an unusual circumstance 
there isnt a german fighter base within 400 miles theyve 
splashed one of their own 
things seem to improve a bit with the arrival of squadron leader 
rex ramsey tim woodward a very wealthy very public school very 
bullying upperclass nob who runs the squadron like his private 
gentlemens flying club 
he transfers the squadron to france installs it in a chateau 
with an excellent wine cellar and concentrates on teaching its 
members how to fly in tight formations the tactical air doctrine 
of the day 
the british didnt know the doctrine was outmoded until the 
german pilots proved it by whipping them 
the squadron leaders popularity plummets when the other pilots 
realize his insistence on formation flying is getting them killed 
rexs main antagonist is flying officer chris hart boyd 
gaines an american veteran of the spanish civil war who joined 
the raf to fight fascism his american notions of equality and his 
air combat experience with the nazis immediately put him into 
conflict with rex 
another memorable character is the utterly nasty moggy 
cattermole neil dudgeon a dashing pilot and cruel philandering 
bully whos got to be seen to be appreciated 
ive lost my hands radios a pilot after being raked by 
enemy fire 
that was careless of you old chap replies moggy 
youll be rooting for the luftwaffe 
no fighting force in history deserved its apotheosis as much as 
the royal air force for its heroic defense of britain in world war 
ii and piece of cake took its share of flak from british 
audiences 
the british didnt like how the miniseries violated the image of 
gallant chaps sitting about with lashings of tea and cakes then 
winging their battered kites up to have a go at bashing the filthy 
jerries 
piece of cake also took heat from military historians for 
using the spitfire fighter plane 
the spitfire they noted was not operational in significant 
numbers until mid1940 it was the doughty hawker hurricane fighter 
that bore the brunt of the fighting until then 
producer andrew holmes explained the lapse there are sadly 
only two hurrricanes flying today in the world and they hardly form 
a squadron but fortunately there are a dozen or so spitfires 
its a forgivable lapse since the gullwinged spitfire is one 
of the prettiest warplanes ever to take to the skies 
when a halfdozen spits claw up into the air it approaches 
poetry and director ian toyntons aerial unit captures the cruel 
balletic beauty of 300mph dogfights 
piece of cake is a treat

police in riot gear arrested about 50 people at a 
demonstration thursday by haitianamericans at a shopping center 
where last week a haitian immigrant was allegedly beaten by 
hispanic employees 
the incident occurred at the biscayne plaza shopping center when 
police began trying to disperse the crowd which swelled from about 
50 to 100 demonstrators said officer george law 
about 160 officers outfitted with nightsticks shields and 
helmets with face guards were called to the scene north of 
downtown near little haiti police said 
we told them to disperse and they failed to so we moved in 
said police spokesman roberto navarro a community cant hold 
someone hostage like that 
four of those arrested were in stable condition late thursday at 
jackson memorial hospital after treatment for minor facial cuts 
scrapes and bruises said hospital spokesman don del vecchio 
three were being held in the hospitals prison ward a fourth 
was undergoing treatment in the emergency room 
the rest of those arrested were taken to the dade county jail on 
charges including assault resisting arrest disorderly conduct and 
failure to disperse 
the protests in front of the rapid transit factory outlet store 
began june 29 after a dispute between the store owner and a 
haitianamerican customer over alterations for a pair of pants the 
customer abner alezi claimed he was beaten 
alezi 44 and several others were later arrested for 
trespassing when they returned to the store to complain 
when store owner luis reyes tried to open the store on saturday 
more than 1000 haitians turned out in a peaceful protest the 
store then remained closed until thursday 
police chief perry anderson said his department had tried to 
mediate the dispute 
we are being extremely tolerant anderson said there have 
been rocks and bottles thrown for two days the owner of the store 
has been held hostage we have been very very tolerant 
at least 40 officers remained at the store late thursday 
reyes said he planned to reopen his store friday 
we are here to do business and to set a principle that not us 
not any merchant and not the city of miami police department will 
be intimidated by something like this said reyes a 65yearold 
cubanamerican the violence will not take over 
the fracas left protesters shoes coats and hats strewn across 
the rainy parking lot 
the confrontation at the shopping center followed tension 
between blacks and hispanics over the recent visit of south african 
antiapartheid leader nelson mandela 
demonstrators had complained about the alleged beating at the 
store and the snub of mandela by cubanamerican leaders after the 
african national congress leader refused to disavow his support of 
cuban president fidel castro 
but they also cited what they said was preferential treatment 
given to cuban immigrants over haitians contending that cubans are 
given freedom while haitians are detained or sent home

when the streets of pakistans largest 
city explode in gunfire abdul sattar edhi rushes out into the 
urban battlefield 
with the siren on his beatup minivan blaring he weaves through 
the streets on a mission of mercy picking up the the dead the 
dying and the wounded 
a resurgence of ethnic and political violence has claimed more 
than 400 lives in karachi and hyderabad 150 miles to the north in 
the past month 
when i go out on the streets of karachi i feel very sad 
edhi said of the bloodshed which has transformed this once 
tranquil city on the sunbaked arabian sea into camps of heavily 
armed gangs 
edhi 62 operates the edhi welfare foundation a 5 million a 
year charity he founded 30 years ago using a battered pickup truck 
as a oneman free ambulance service 
steadily he built it into one of the subcontinents biggest and 
bestorganized social service networks boasting a fleet of 615 
ambulances a rescue helicopter dozens of blood banks and shelters 
for mental patients heroin addicts battered wives orphans 
runaways and anyone else his staff finds wandering without help or 
hope 
i was born a moslem but true religion is the service of 
humanity said edhi a stalky man with a flowing white beard and 
a gruff voice im just one man i just want to help people 
he is called saint an angel of mercy and his deeds have earned 
him the nickname father teresa the counterpart of the tiny 
roman catholic nun who has spent her life working with the 
destitute and dying in the slums of calcutta india 
his telephone rings at all hours he is ready for any emergency 
always carrying a packed bag with a small satchel that contains a 
change of clothes gray baggy pants and a matching shirt rubber 
sandals glasses a toothbrush and a neartoothless comb 
although his work reaches every part of pakistan the heart of 
his operation is karachi a city crowded with 9 million people 
mostly poor and illiterate 
born in the western indian state of gujarat edhi immigrated to 
pakistan during the 1947 partition that ended british colonial rule 
of the subcontinent and in many ways edhis simple lifestyle 
mirrors mohandas k gandhi the mahatma or great soul who led 
that freedom struggle 
edhi and his wife bilquis live in a stark room sandwiched 
between an office and a narrow room with only a wooden table where 
the bodies of karachis unwanted and unclaimed are laid out for 
burial 
edhis bed is a wooden plank resting on a steel frame his wife 
has a mattress her only concession to comfort 
mrs edhi mother of four children looks around the room at the 
twoburner hot plate a wooden table and a cupbord crammed with 
their possessions this is my paradise she said 
the walls outside the dilapidated building are lined with fuzzy 
photographs resembling wanted posters pictures of beggars who died 
in the alleyways around town 
there are so many people lost and alone in this world he 
sighed they die alone and no one cares so we take their 
pictures and hope that maybe somebody will know them 
edhi has buried a small city over the past three decades 
washing more than 60000 unidentified bodies and wrapping them in 
traditional white shrouds 
in less than three hours three bodies arrived for burial he 
had already washed and prepared two earlier in the day where 
else would they go he asked 
while edhi cares for the dead his wife looks after the living 
setting up adoptions 
i have seen so many children die they were thrown in garbage 
cans in gutters so i thought ill give them to the people who 
want them she said 
she and her husband have set up homes for battered wives and 
centers to treat the citys 1 million heroin addicts they also 
established a home for the handicapped and a girls orphanage in 
two donated mansions in karachis affluent clifton area where 
prime minister benazir bhutto maintains a home 
he is helping everyone said farhad naz a social worker in 
karachi without him these women would have nowhere to go 
in this desperately poor and troubled country edhis work fills 
the widening gap created by the governments inability or 
unwillingness he does it solely with private donations 
when my mother died i promised that as long as god gave me 
energy i would work to help the poor and the sick said edhi 
who has a sixthgrade education 
i was not educated so when i started my efforts were small 
simple and practical but the public like it and now they give me 
money my work is still simple but its no longer small

in 1940 17yearold lukas foss packed his 
bags and headed for the berkshires eager to check out a new school 
that offered fledgling musicians a chance to get their hands on a 
real orchestra 
everybody knew about it recalls the composer one of a 
string of distinguished alumni returning this summer to celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the boston symphony orchestras training 
school 
we very rarely got a chance to conduct an orchestra at 
tanglewood you would it was something that everybody knew and 
everybody wanted right from the start he said 
that 1940 season at the tanglewood music center founded by the 
great bso director serge koussevitzky glittered with the names of 
20thcentury music foss and leonard bernstein as students 
composers aaron copland and paul hindemith among the teachers 
for foss who has been composerinresidence at tanglewood for 
two years theres an element of nostalgia to this years 
celebration 
i dont think i ever thought as a student that i would be back 
as the paul hindemith and conducting the bso this is very 
special he said 
the 1990 season is the last of four in a celebration of 
tanglewoods founding this years observance begins with a gala 
concert friday night featuring the premiere of an overture 
celebration written by foss for the occasion 
seiji ozawa who studied at the center in 1960 will lead the 
bso in a program of stravinsky verdi and puccini 
other former students scheduled to appear this summer include 
bernstein charles dutoit conductor of the montreal symphony 
orchestra and zubin mehta conductor of the new york philharmonic 
some things have changed in 50 years foss said 
in those days it was very different because the teacher really 
launched your life they didnt call it a career either they 
called it your life your work nowadays they call it your career 
and your manager does all that foss said 
todays students enroll here very often or not to do what they 
call networking foss said the students are much older now 
there are no 17yearolds 
the shift has its good and bad sides said foss careerdriven 
musicians are motivated to work hard but if they come for career 
purposes instead of wanting to learn something thats not so good 
he said 
recalling his days at tanglewood foss said he worried 
koussevitzky by signing up for classes under the russianborn 
conductor and hindemith but when koussevitzky suggested foss take 
a lighter load the teenager asked for an audition to show he 
could handle it 
after the audition he said if you want you will have he 
was a wonderful fatherlike figure to me foss said 
foss said he proved a difficult pupil 
hindemith once wrote to koussevitzky and said he will not 
teach me again because lukas wants to know but he doesnt want to 
follow koussevitzky said thats wonderful foss recalled 
this week an army of lawn mowers rolled over the wide sloping 
lawns of the tanglewood estate readying the green expanses for the 
onslaught of the thousands of people who descend each weekend from 
new york and massachusetts to hear the bso and celebrity guests 
the history of tanglewood a country estate in the berkshire 
hills town of lenox dates back to 1937 when the bso first began 
giving its popular weekend concerts the festivals continue this 
weekend featuring violinist itzhak perlman 
concertgoers pay 16 to 58 for tickets to the 4000seat 
tanglewood shed a semiopen structure or 10 to sit on the vast 
lawns in front of the shed 
across the lawns is the world of the music center where a group 
of 100 or so tanglewood fellows meet in july and by the end of 
summer have created an orchestra of their own at the end of this 
summer the orchestra will tour europe under bernsteins direction 
its a fun place to be foss said its not like some 
drudging kind of concert work but of course the more talented the 
person is the harder he works 
mainly you see what tanglewood has it has very wonderful 
people in charge it has the right people leading it the right 
people teaching and thats really the secret of its success

house and senate negotiators are a few pen 
strokes from requiring double hulls on oil tankers but industry 
officials say preventing oil spills carries a high price tag and 
some risk 
with shipyards already receiving orders to build an extra layer 
of steel around the outside of oil tankers congress moves into the 
final stages of negotiations next week over provisions of a major 
oil spill bill that has been 15 years in the making 
already set are key provisions to increase penalties for 
shippers found liable for spills and to establish coast guard oil 
spill response centers along us coasts the bill also establishes 
a 1 billion cleanup fund through a fivecent tax on each barrel of 
oil produced in or imported to the united states 
environmentalists hail the doublehull requirement as an 
environmental safety net capable of preventing some of the major 
oil spills that have soiled coasts from alaska to rhode island 
double hulls work said clifton curtis an ocean specialist 
with the environmental group friends of the earth the evidence 
shows that they do add an important additional protection against 
spills occurring and they reduce the amount of oil that is 
released 
oil interests while resigned to a law requiring double hulls 
warn that it comes with a price tag 30 million per ship a cost 
increase that will likely trickle down to consumers wallets 
concessions won from congress to allow time to build 
doublehulled ships are an attempt to keep those costs under 
control 
weve been pointing out the cost figures since the issue first 
emerged said bill taylor of the american petroleum institute a 
washingtonbased industry group whatever adjustments that have 
been made from the original legislative proposals reflect the 
tremendous costs involved 
although details remain to be worked out sources said the final 
bill will require that new tankers and oceangoing barges weighing 
over 5000 gross tons have double hulls which consist of a second 
layer of steel and an air space between the sea and the cargo 
older vessels would have to be either phased out of operation or 
refitted with second hulls 
at this point the double hull requirement is a foregone 
conclusion said a house staff aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
refitting the 153 usflagged tankers with double hulls would 
cost nearly 46 billion or 30 million each taylor said the 
same amount would be added on to the cost of building new tankers 
meaning a 15 percent cost increase 
the roughly 900 foreignflagged tankers that call in us ports 
would cost 20 million apiece to refit at lowercost foreign 
shipyards taylor said 
in addition to the added cost shipping interests contend it is 
uncertain whether double hulls work 
the national academy of sciences is working on a study expected 
to detail some of the weaknesses of double hulls the senate wants 
to give the secretary of transportation authority to review that 
study along with other data to see if alternatives to double hulls 
would work as well or better 
ernie corrado president of the american institute of merchant 
marine shipping said preliminary results of the study show that 
gases trapped between the hull walls could cause an explosion and a 
breach in the outer wall could allow water in the cavity between 
the hulls capsizing the vessel 
its not simply a question of economics its a question of 
safety said joe farrell president of the american waterways 
operators a trade association representing coastal shippers 
including oil barge haulers 
the oil spill legislation has been debated in congress for 15

main street is quiet except for a few 
children riding their bikes dodging the many holes and bumps their 
town cant afford to fix 
for two years this community of 1100 has been on the verge of 
becoming the first in north dakota history to declare bankruptcy 
outside town on the edge of the scenic badlands an oil well 
reminds residents of better days as well as belfields uncertain 
future 
its pretty much at a standstill said george kessel 77 
who was born and raised here everybodys hanging on waiting for 
things to get better 
oilfield worker driggers bob tyndall has been in town for 
just three weeks but hes been reading and hearing about 
belfields prosperous past and troubled present 
when it was up it was booming it was alive tyndall said 
but look at it now its dead 
in the late 1970s belfields future looked as promising as the 
states oil industry oil workers poured into the unprepared town 
forcing officials to sell 21 million worth of bonds in the early 
1980s to pay for water sewers and housing its population swelled 
by almost 300 
but by 1986 oil prices had dropped and belfield was stuck with 
more than 1 million in unpaid property taxes owed by unemployed 
workers who left 
city officials ruled out new taxes for people already 
complaining of skyrocketing costs instead they hoped to work out 
deals with the bondholders that would pay off part of the debt or 
set up a payment plan 
today the towns debt totals almost 19 million and no deals 
are in sight 
we were hoping we could avoid bankruptcy but as time is going 
by and no clearcut decisions are made were going back to the 
idea that bankruptcy is going to happen said former mayor phil 
dolyniuk who stepped down in april 
its going to be a battle the next four years are going to be 
very difficult 
attorney albert hardy told bondholders in a february letter that 
city services such as water sewer and streets were curtailed to 
the point where the health and wellbeing of the people remaining 
in belfield may be at risk 
dolyniuk said thursday that he doesnt expect any health 
problems although he noted that belfields landfill is getting 
full and the town may have problems paying to get its waste shipped 
elsewhere 
the number of fulltime municipal workers has declined from 
seven in 1984 to four today and the town police bought a used car 
last time they needed one the town has lost a grocery store and a 
car dealership although it has gained a service station and a 
dairy queen 
residents have formed a group called the community development 
corporation to give the town a moral and financial lift 
the group and others helped raise money to repair a swimming 
pool that had been closed for years it also put up signs along 
us 85 to attract travelers and turn a small conservation dam 
nearby into a recreation center 
a new 24page brochure was written to tell business prospects 
about belfields history recreation and climate 
some of the efforts seem to be paying off 
arcus environmental inc last month announced plans to hire 50 
people for a plant that turns hazardous waste into fuel belfield 
officials are wooing a dentist so people wont have to drive 20 
miles to dickinson to get their teeth fixed 
and mayor susan heck is cautiously very cautiously 
optimistic 
if we maintain i think well be lucky she said we just 
take it a step at a time its gradually coming around 
nobody expects a big oil boom again said duane indergaard 
owner of belfields fort houston museum its too early to tell 
its just too early to tell how belfields going to be

come saturday the moon will be full and 
so will ted walkers farm 
hundreds of pickers fiddlers and crooners will gather on 
walkers rural spread near nashville to pay tribute to luna from 
nightfall to sunrise at another full moon bluegrass party a 
13yearold tradition 
the parties have attracted crowds of 1000 to 1500 people and 
have seen wellknown musicians such as chet atkins and wynonna judd 
sitting in with carpenters accountants and housewives for 
impromptu jam sessions 
the full moon just brings out something special in people 
walker said theyre up tempo and the moon is up tempo and 
everything is full energy 
john hedgecoth foreman at a nashville guitar manufacturer 
rests up so he can stay up late to play banjo with the big boys 
spectators show up early and stay til about midnight and 
some of the musicians will brave the crowd he said but the 
serious musicians wait until about 11 pm to show up and the 
really good jam sessions start then and go all night 
its a great party a very folksytype atmosphere the quality 
of the music said kelly mullins who works in vanderbilt 
universitys publications department 
instruments range from banjos and guitars to spoons and 
washboards the singing ranges from great to terrible says walker 
a nashville lawyer when hes not throwing bluegrass parties 
im a terrible singer but they put up with me because its 
my party he said 
the full moon parties started in august 1977 when walker and 
some friends decided to have a jam session in the country where 
the moonlight is brighter than in the city they picked his 
homestead in williamson county about 20 miles southwest of 
nashville 
they enjoyed themselves so much they did it again the next full 
moon and the tradition was on 
fiddlers and frolickers used to gather at nightfall any day the 
full moon rose from april to october 
this year the parties will be held only on warm weekend nights 
that coincide with the full moon 
i guess im getting old said walker 48 
but partyers will continue to jam through the night every 
full moon is followed by a day off he said 
the gatherings have gotten so big that walker hires a parking 
crew and a cleanup crew and keeps everyone in touch with beepers 
and cellular phones 
walker realized in 1980 that the partys size had truly gotten 
out of hand a rowdy stranger told him to go home and not come 
back 
that was when he started charging 5 admission he later boosted 
it to 10 at musician john prines suggestion that it should be 
easier to make change 
musicians get in for free 
im talkin about bonafide bluegrass musicians who ive 
either seen personally or heard of by reputation walker said 
its not for just the casual player maybe for people who are one 
step above that 
groups form and reform with different members in different 
spots all night long but the theme is always the same have fun 
and play that fastdrivin music 
its kind of like having a buffet of music walker said 
if you cant find something you like you have no business out 
there but if you like bluegrass youll find plenty to like

in this summer of steinbrenner and zodiac 
shootings its this name that elicits maximum fear and loathing 
among thousands and thousands of new yorkers harold 
harold will hold up 110000 people this summer he is a 100 
million commuter headache the alias for a massive modernization of 
the switching system that directs 650 long island rail road and 
amtrak trains beneath the east river each day 
what does harold mean to the 110000 daily riders on the 
nations largest commuter railroad the lirr 
try systemwide delays overcrowded trains and elimination of 
some service overall commuters should expect fairly rotten 
service for the next nine weeks predicted sheldon schachter 
chairman of the lirr commuters council work began monday and runs 
through sept 4 
you know about harold its a nightmare said andy donnelly 
a manhattan financial analyst shortly after his train arrived 15 
minutes late thursday morning at penn station 
donnelly of huntington has traveled back and forth from long 
island most weekdays since 1986 but the arrival of harold has 
persuaded him to put those days behind him donnelly said 
my solution is im moving into the city upper east side 
said donnelly im not going to deal with it this summer 
theres already enough to deal with the heat george 
steinbrenners systematic destruction of the yankees a gunman 
selecting victims based on their birth signs 
but now theres harold short for the 80yearold harold 
interlock system roundtheclock work on the antiquated system 
will replace track switches and signals in harold bringing it 
into the 90s but until the work is finished 
did you ever have a bad day one of those days where nothing 
goes right well picture a whole summer like that said 
schachter who has traveled between rockville centre and manhattan 
for two decades 
state consumer watchdog richard kessel warned the lirr could 
become like the heavily congested long island expressway which is 
often more parking lot than parkway its going to be traffic 
jams on the rails kessel said 
harold derives its name from the days before the city had 
numbered streets said lirr spokeswoman susan mcgowan before 
becoming 39th street the road nearest the tower was harold street 
who the original harold was we dont know said mcgowan 
its a mystery 
everybody knows about harold now posters about the harold 
problems featuring a nifty little logo with a train switching 
signal as the o in harold are plastered on bulletin 
boards walls and pillars throughout penn station 
penn service suspended read the most severe notices 
alerting reverse commuters that morning rush hour service from 
manhattan to long island is history until after labor day these 
5000 riders are left to their own creative devices for rush hour 
transportation 
fourteen employees at cmp publications in manhasset have kicked 
in to rent a van each day that will carry them to the office and 
home matt sheerin an employee at cmp decided to try another 
option 
ive given up and bought a car said sheerin a manhattan 
resident and the proud new owner of a 1981 honda using the lirr 
sheerins commute was about 60 minutes taking the subway to the 
lirr in queens takes 90 minutes driving in this week ran 35 
minutes 
i think one of the things the lirr overlooked is the offpeak 
riders said sheerin theyll end up losing riders and im one 
of them i wont be back unless my car gets stolen

president bush gave an important but little 
noticed speech on hemispheric policy last week what set it apart 
from virtually every other presidential initiative for the americas 
over the past two generations was that it had nothing to do with 
fighting communism 
this week bush is attending the first postcold war nato summit 
and last weeks speech showed that with eastwest tensions in 
decline he now has the luxury of giving priority to the 
hemispheres economic troubles as opposed to security concerns 
bush said that to bolster the hemispheres newly emerging 
democracies there is need for more trade and investment and 
additional debt relief 
the speech was a departure from past initiatives which had the 
underlying rationale of keeping marxism out of the hemisphere 
the list is long there was the ciainitiated coup in guatemala 
in 1954 the americansponsored invasion of cuba in 1961 and the 
creation of the ambitious social and economic development program 
called the alliance for progress that same year 
there was the cuban missile crisis of 1962 the us military 
intervention in the dominican republic in 1965 and the efforts to 
undercut chiles leftist government from 197073 hemispheric 
policy during the reagan years was devoted largely to combating 
leftist forces in central america the caribbean basin initiative 
of the early 1980s was partly a response to leftist gains 
bushs new proposal is aimed at reversing the economic decline 
that afflicted much of latin america during the 1980s he offered 
some debt relief and promised to open the united states to more 
hemispheric exports if us goods are granted the same treatment 
the ultimate aim he said is a free trade system that links 
all of the americas north central and south and we look 
forward to the day when not only are the americas the first fully 
free democratic hemisphere but when all are equal partners in a 
free trade zone stretching from the port of anchorage to the tierra 
del fuego 
a long hard effort lies ahead but susan kaufman purcell of the 
americas society believes it is well worthwhile she points out 
that us exporters could benefit greatly from a market 
encompassing 435 million people 
ms purcell says latin americans have been worried about being 
ignored as a result of the end of the cold war as a result she 
says there is a new receptivity among latin americans for closer 
ties with the united states 
a hemispheric free trade zone is therefore an idea whose time 
has come ms purcell writes 
the washington post editorialized last friday that bushs 
proposal could bring immense benefits to latin american countries 
where closed economies and protection of monopolies have created 
great wealth for a few people at the top and great poverty for 
the rest 
opening up these economies will be bad for the monopolies but 
very good for the middle class and the people trying to climb into 
it the post said 
reaction to the bush proposal has been almost universally 
favorable in latin america the contrast in attitudes toward the 
united states during the 1980s is considerable those were the days 
when reagan administration tried mightily to enlist hemispheric 
support behind its policy of arming the nicaraguan contras but to 
little avail 
with nicaragua no longer an issue and communism less of a 
concern to washington many believe the prospects for a productive 
uslatin american relationship seem brighter than at any time in 
years 
the interamerican dialogue a gathering of 50 leaders from 
throughout the americas said bushs initiative is welcome 
timely and potentially significant indeed it could mark a turning 
point in interamerican relations if it is now turned from a 
broad vision to concrete and joint actions

the washington sex scandal that 
vaulted openly gay us rep barney frank to national notoriety is 
a remote worry for the local hero firmly entrenched among voters in 
this bastion of new england liberalism 
his widely publicized involvement with a homosexual prostitute 
remains an embarrassment but he faces no serious opposition in his 
bid for a sixth congressional term and refuses to dwell on his 
admitted indiscretions 
he called his relationship with male prostitute stephen gobie a 
stupid mistake but said it shouldnt interfere with his work 
talking about my personal angst does not have any bearing on 
the policies im elected to carry out he said thursday in an 
interview at his office in west newton square in suburban boston 
the house ethics committee is expected to release its report 
soon on his association with gobie but back home during the 
congressional recess its political business as usual for frank 
frank admitted paying gobie for sex and letting him move into 
his home but denied allegations he knew gobie was operating a 
prostitution ring under his roof 
the congressman greets visitors and the news media dressed in a 
rumpled blue tshirt and casual pants but is far from laid back 
all right im ready he grunted 
pleasantries fall by the wayside frank explained later because 
i do a lot of things at one time and i like to do them fast 
frank is one of only two openly gay members of congress and 
represents some of the most liberal communities in the countrys 
most liberal state but the only stereotype that applies is that of 
a veteran politician 
he is never far from the telephone and blends charm with firm 
stands on issues such as affordable housing health care 
education and reducing the defense budget 
frank 50 seems a shooin to win his sixth term in november 
the only serious republican contender james nuzzo recently 
dropped out of the race for personal reasons republican john soto 
his only other opponent recently called for frank to take an aids 
test and is not supported by party leaders 
after the relationship was disclosed by the washington times 
frank acknowledged hiring gobie for sex in 1985 he said he later 
hired gobie as an aide and driver and paid him with personal funds 
gobie has claimed that he based his prostitution ring at franks 
capitol hill apartment with franks knowledge 
frank denied that allegation and said he fired gobie in august 
1987 after learning of the prostitution ring 
members of the house ethics comittee are reportedly split over 
how severely to punish frank with some favoring a light sanction 
such as a letter criticizing his behavior but any mild sanction is 
expected to be challenged on the floor of the house 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif has promised to push for 
an expulsion resolution and others reportedly will introduce 
resolutions for reprimand or censure 
frank said he minimized damage from the scandal by telling the 
truth 
it was better than i expected frank said the important 
thing was that i explained what happened 
if all it was that i hired a prostitute people will think 
simply that you showed pretty bad judgment if you lied and if this 
is a pattern that would be bad 
outside residents confirmed franks salvaged popularity 
personally i like barney frank said bill andrews 43 i 
think hes been straightforward and honest i think hes done good 
work and as far as that whole thing hes satisfied all the 
questions i had with what hes said 
frank said he is working on a book for random house that will 
focus on his pet philosophy that while liberal issues are popular 
liberalism is not 
we let the right look as if theyre proamerica said frank 
liberals should start talking more about whats good about 
america rather than saying how badly flawed it is

almost every week since midmay bombs 
blamed on leftists have rocked the greek capital but while terror 
groups have been wiped out elsewhere in europe greece has failed 
to arrest a single suspect 
most of the bombings in greece are believed to be the work of a 
shadowy group called november 17 or of other groups inspired by 
them 
november 17 which takes its name from the day in 1973 when the 
rightwing military junta crushed a student rebellion first 
surfaced in december 1975 with the assassination of athens cia 
station chief richard welch 
the united states has called november 17 one of the deadliest 
terrorist groups in europe in the past 14 years the group has 
assassinated 14 people including three us officials 
despite promises to crack down on terrorism successive greek 
governments both conservative and socialist have failed to 
arrest a single homegrown terrorist 
experts say november 17s success in evading arrest depends 
mainly on their own ruthless efficiency small membership and a 
police force that appears to have been unprepared to deal with 
urban terrorism 
premier constantine mitsotakis whose conservative new democracy 
party won a slender victory in aprils election has a personal 
reason to want to do better than his predecessors in stamping out 
terrorism last year november 17 assassinated his soninlaw 
pavlos bakoyannis 
if there is any danger to greece it is from terrorism the 
conservative politician warned parliament in january 
terrorist attacks here in the mid1980s with arab involvement 
led to claims that greece was soft on terrorism in the past two 
years there have been no international terrorist incidents but 
november 17 and similar domestic groups remain active even though 
they have failed to create a broad climate of terror 
our problem is domestic terrorism and that means november 
17 a top state security official said in a recent interview 
they are trying to create the impression that there is 
widespread terrorism and they encourage other groups to copy 
them said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
november 17 has claimed responsibility for only two of seven 
recent bombings the other attacks have been claimed by a 
previously unknown group calling itself popular rage no one has 
been seriously injured in the attacks 
various reasons are put forth for greeces failure in combating 
terrorism 
conservatives suggest that during the 198189 socialist 
administration the state security apparatus was indecisive 
as soon as there is systematic work the necessary political 
will and cooperation with all other countries of the world 
terrorism will be confronted mitsotakis daughter dora 
bakoyannis said in an interview 
she was elected to her slain husbands seat in parliament and is 
one of the premiers closest aides 
the latest state budget has increased funding by 27 percent for 
the public order ministry more money and material have been 
promised to the antiterrorist units and the government has 
pledged to work with foreign intelligence agencies 
the conservatives want to wipe out any impression left from the 
eightyear socialist administration of andreas papandreou that 
greece is lax in fighting terrorism 
the united states issued a highly publicized travel advisory in 
1985 warning its citizens that athens airport was unsafe after 
arab terrorists hijacked a twa jet shortly after it left the greek 
capital 
in 1987 the united states accused greece of allowing the 
notorious abu nidal organization to operate a logistics office in 
athens allegedly in exchange for immunity from terrorist attacks 
the socialists threatened to call off negotiations on a new 
defense pact with the united states and washington withdrew the 
accusation 
but subsequent refusals to extradite palestinians wanted in 
italy and the united states made greece appear to be a haven for 
terrorists and may have deprived greek security services of 
foreign intelligence material a foreign diplomat said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
mitsotakis has said that the palestinian sought by the united 
states on charges of planting a bomb on an american airliner in 
1982 will either be extradited or tried in greece the blast over 
hawaii killed one person and wounded 15 
some experts have suggested that part of the problem in fighting 
domestic terrorism is the bad reputation gained by the security 
services from 1967 to 1974 when they supported the military junta 
november 17 has played on the police links with past repression 
trying to present itself as a latterday robin hoodtype group that 
chooses selective targets and wont harm common people 
its long messages to newspapers emblazoned with a red 
fivepointed star offer a mixture of intellectual arguments and 
revolutionary jargon it urges armed struggle as the only means to 
overturn what it calls a corrupt society 
an opinion poll published early last year indicated that almost 
6 percent of those polled would consider voting for november 17 in 
an election

the nations largest teachers union 
abandoned its resistance to allowing engineers scientists and 
other midcareer professionals into the classroom while they study 
to become teachers 
the 2 millionmember national education association had opposed 
socalled alternative certification programs because it said 
recruiting nonteachers to combat faculty shortages undercut 
traditional licensing programs 
the policy adopted thursday during the first day of the unions 
fourday convention won passage because it established standards 
like mandatory bachelors degrees supervision by certified 
teachers and enrollment in teacher accreditation courses officials 
said 
im not in favor of blanket alternative certification said 
rosanne bacon president of the massachusetts teachers association 
a former opponent of such teacher recruitment efforts 
this proposal sets up clear high standards for teachers 
coming in on a nontraditional route it carefully opens access to 
the teaching profession she said 
the policy statement said alternativeroute certification can 
attract sorely needed minorities and experts in math science 
foreign languages and special education 
rising teacher shortages in recent years prompted officials to 
begin luring professionals from fields outside education but 
teachers objected to allowing them into the classroom before they 
completed teacher certification programs according to the nea 
there will be a demand for 13 million new teachers by 1994 in a 
survey of 191 of the nations largest school districts 48 percent 
reported a shortage of teacher applicants 
a new study by the national center for education information 
found that 33 states are implementing alternative routes up from 
23 less than two years ago eight states hired such instructors in 
1983 
not everyone agreed with the vote 
bernard anderson of reno nev said nontraditional 
certification routes mask the real issues behind the nationwide 
teacher shortage 
had they raised teacher salaries then we would have been able 
to attract people with proper credentials into our profession 
said anderson speaking for the nevada delegation of about 70 
teachers 
the nea document is the first official support by the entire 
union for the concept it takes a middle ground between outright 
opposition to alternative certification and those who feel that any 
college graduate can teach school 
the national education association remains committed to 
ensuring that there is a fully licensed qualified teacher in every 
classroom but recognizes that there may be more than one way to 
prepare such teachers the policy statement said 
nea president keith geiger said the union succeeded in getting 
the policy adopted mainly because it emphasized those taking 
alternative routes would have to meet strict standards 
the policy statement stresses that the objective of both a 
traditional and nontraditional route is to rigorously prepare an 
individual to obtain a standard full teaching license 
a nontraditional route does not lead to an alternative 
license the document said 
standards listed in the nea policy include 
programs must be conducted in conjunction with a stateapproved 
college or university teacher education program 
every candidate should have at least a bachelors degree 
candidates must receive substantial training in how to teach 
before beginning classroom work 
candidates working in the classroom must be supervised by a 
fullylicensed trained mentor and be evaluated frequently 
to become fully licensed the candidate must meet the same 
state requirements as those required of traditionalroute teachers

forty years ago this week the young men 
of the us armys task force smith were sent in search of the 
north korean army with the order to stop the enemy where you find 
them 
task force smith found its enemy on a hillside 22 miles south of 
seoul after fighting for seven hours against overwhelming odds 
with weapons incapable of stopping tanks the unit was overrun 
gen carl e vuono the armys current chief of staff said the 
object lesson in the story of task force smith is that the unit 
symbolized an army paralyzed by the rapid demobilization and deep 
budget cuts that followed world war ii 
the story could be repeated he said if the army of 1990 is cut 
too quickly and deeply in search of a peace dividend as 
eastwest tensions relax 
that fifth of july was one of the worst days of my life 
said floyd r martin 79 of tucker ga who on that day was an 
army major and executive officer of task force smith a hurriedly 
assembled force of two infantry companies and an artillery unit 
i just couldnt believe we were forced off that hill and we 
were very reluctant to leave that hill martin said thursday 
night i could not believe that would happen to us we were 
pretty dejected at the end of that day 
but we just didnt have what we needed to do the job smith 
said as 15 or so former comrades milled around him at a unit 
reunion retelling the stories of battle and retreat 
task force smith named for its commander lt col charles 
bradford smith was the first us fighting force to enter combat 
in the korean war what was missing in the unit was just about 
everything it needed 
pulled with little notice from occupation duty in japan the 
officers and men of task force smith say they had inadequate 
training 
when the sun rose on july 5 and they looked down on a mileslong 
column of north korean infantry in trucks and 33 soviet t34 tanks 
the 400plus soldiers discovered other shortcomings 
they had been issued exactly six artillery rounds powerful 
enough to pierce the armor of such tanks 
their bazookas were too light to do the job their rockets 
simply bouncing off the armor their radios failed and could not be 
used to call for help or artillery support they had little or no 
intelligence about the enemy there was no medical evacuation 
system and when the order came to withdraw 30 of the most 
seriously injured had to be left behind 
and when task force smith broke for cover chewed up by north 
korean automatic fire with heavy casualties no maps had been 
issued to tell them where they were or where friendly forces might 
be found 
i did not know that those bazookas would not knock out a 
tank martin said 
all we could do is scratch the paint on the tanks and annoy 
the tankers said carl bernard 64 a platoon leader in task 
force smith and like martin a retired army colonel 
although many of those present said they would not have believed 
it when they stumbled off their hill in defeat four decades ago 
gen vuono was present to give their keynote address and to hail 
them as a symbol of counterproductive costcutting 
you did all that your nation had a right to expect but you 
were the victims of those who believed there was little need for 
trained and ready military forces in peacetime he said 
the army is ready to cut back he said 
but precipitous cuts of more than about 35000 active soldiers 
in any single year will fracture the combat capability that may be 
required to defend our nations vital interests vuono added 
martin said he agrees 
the moral of task force smith he said is never again send 
people into combat illprepared and without proper weapons

a profile of us agriculture shows farmers 
are moving toward the 21st century with a financial condition much 
improved from a few years ago 
but the report issued thursday by the agriculture department 
also further nailed down an old trend showing that farm numbers are 
still declining and that big superfarms continue to grow 
the proportion of farms that are financially vulnerable today 
is half that of 1985 the report said farmland prices have 
stabilized and are beginning to rise 
the number of farms in the united states continued to decline 
throughout the 1980s as they have almost unabated since 1935 
the report said according to the 1987 census of agriculture there 
were just over 2 million farms down 7 percent from 1982 when the 
previous census was taken 
small farms although fewer in number increased as a proportion 
of total farms midsized farms declined both in number and their 
share of the total 
the number of large farms continued to increase the report 
said this trend shows little prospect of reversing in the near 
future 
the analysis by usdas economic research service was based on an 
annual report to congress on the status of family farms 
virtually all farms in the united states are familyowned 
businesses the report said fewer than 3 percent of all farms 
are organized as corporations most of which are family held 
only 03 percent are corporations owned and operated by people 
other than a family single families own 87 percent of all farms 
and multifamily partnerships operate the remainder 
because almost all farms are owned and operated by one or more 
families we did not define family farm for this report the 
agency said 
thomas a carlin one of the editors said a snapshot of the 
farm sector shows that most us farms are small noncommercial 
and usually familyowned and operated 
noncommercial units were defined as those having gross farm 
sales of less than 40000 a year 
small noncommercial farms produce a minor share of total 
us food and fiber carlin said in the reports overview they 
are typically located near more densely settle urban areas where 
nonfarm employment opportunities abound 
the small farms often operate at a loss with farm expenditures 
exceeding commodity sales government payments and other 
farmrelated income 
family wellbeing for these small farms depends primarily on 
offfarm income and their average total income in most years is 
commensurate with that of all us families carlin wrote 
most of the nations food and fiber is produced by very large 
commercial farms that are highly capitalized carlin said owners 
of such large farms typically control several million dollars of 
land machinery and other assets 
many of the largest farms produce fruits vegetables and 
horticultural specialty crops crops not covered by federal price 
and income support programs he said 
farming is the dominant occupation for families operating large 
holdings and annual income in most years is above that of the us 
average 
families with large operations do report offfarm income but 
that is typically from interest rent or dividends rather than from 
a job paycheck with some exceptions most big farms are located 
away from major urban centers in areas conducive to largescale 
operations 
the number of midsized commercial farms continues to 
shrink carlin said most of these farms produce food and feed 
grains that are included in federal commodity programs 
thus he said midsized farms get more than half of all direct 
government payments operators are usually employed full time on 
the farm but often someone else in the household works off the 
farm

beef consumption is rising slowly in japan 
but an agriculture department trade report says high prices are 
discouraging allout dining on steaks and roasts 
the item in agexporter magazine said recent japanese government 
figures put per capita beef consumption at 54 kilograms or 119 
pounds in 198889 up 8 percent from the previous year reflecting 
larger imports 
beef consumption in japan is still well below us consumption 
of 317 kilograms 699 pounds the report said one deterrent 
to even faster increases in beef consumption is the high prices of 
beef 
recently the report said some tokyo supermarkets were selling 
us frozen tenderloin steaks for 15 per pound chilled tenderloin 
steaks from fed holstein steers for 20 per pound australian 
chilled tenderloin blocks for 12 per pound and fed holstein round 
for 13 per pound 
that would be at least two to four times the retail prices paid 
by american consumers for comparable cuts of beef 
james v parker us ministercounselor for agricultural 
affairs in tokyo said japanese consumers apparently are waiting 
for trade liberalization next year when they expect beef prices to 
drop sharply 
however consumers are likely to be disappointed according to 
some importers because of the tariff increase to 70 percent and 
the likelihood of further depreciation of the yen against the 
dollar he said 
currently the landed price of beef in japan is about the same 
as what it will be under liberalization 
parker said japan now charges a 25 percent tariff on beef plus a 
surcharge of roughly 50 percent for the domestic livestock 
industry that is only slightly above the 70 percent tariff that 
will take effect with liberalization on april 1 1991 
however parker said competition among japanese distributors and 
retailers may reduce beef prices

judge thomas penfield jackson that the two should be admitted to 
barrys trial 
a federal appeals court refused thursday to order that farrakhan 
and stallings be admitted but sent the matter to jackson for 
further consideration saying the two could not be barred simply 
because they advocate a particular viewpoint jackson barred the 
two last week saying their presence would be potentially 
disruptive and intimidating

business cards were not conducted until midjune there was no 
explanation for the delay 
lynch also testified that crack cocaine was recovered from a

cocaine in the bathroom of an apartment

she declined 
minutes before jacksons testimony the prosecution played a 
videotape of barry on sept 26 1986 announcing a police

the american institute of architects is 
agreeing to a consent decree settling a government lawsuit that 
charged it unlawfully restrained competition among its members for 
design services 
the civil antitrust suit which the justice department filed 
simultaneously in federal court with the proposed consent decree 
accused the aia of trying to prohibit its 54000 members from 
engaging in competitive bidding giving discounts and providing 
free services 
the consent decree will force architects to compete to provide 
customers not only the best design but also the best price for 
their services justice department spokesman frank kelly said 
thursday 
the departments complaint charged that national officers of the 
washingtonbased professional society endorsed and promoted a 1984 
policy statement of the aias chicago chapter that barred 
architects from submitting bids giving discounts or providing free 
design services 
the chicago chapters statement said it was unethical for 
architects to submit price quotations where price was the sole or 
dominant consideration in the selection of an architect 
according to us district court papers 
the complaint charged that the aia entered into a conspiracy 
between september 1984 when the chicago statement was issued that 
lasted at least through february 1985 to restrain price competition 
the proposed consent decree which was submitted for court 
approval following a 60day comment period requires the aia to 
implement an elaborate antitrust compliance program to educate its 
members about the law

the operator of a kentucky mine where 10 
workers died in an explosion last year has to pay more than 
500000 in fines the largest penalty ever assessed by the 
government in a mine disaster 
pyro mining co said it would appeal the fine which was levied 
thursday by the labor departments mine safety and health 
administration the penalty stemmed from 121 alleged violations of 
federal safety laws 
were just not making any comment at all beyond the fact that 
were surprised by the size of the penalty the appeal is in 
process and we will continue that said james greenlee executive 
vice president of evansville indbased costain coal inc which 
owns pyro mining 
the labor department contends pyro managers knew explosive 
methane gas was accumulating in the mine four days before the 
explosion but failed to take action 
we consider the violations in this case so flagrant and 
indicative of the companys negligence that this fine is 
warranted william j tattersall assistant labor secretary for 
mine safety said of the record fine 
before thursday the largest penalty ever assessed for a mine 
accident stemmed from a 1976 blast that killed 26 workers at the

air traffic controllers and electrical 
workers pledged to join a general strike by supporters of the 
ousted sandinista leadership that threatens to paralyze the country 
president violeta barrios de chamorro has declared the strikes 
illegal and accused the leftist sandinistas of trying to undermine 
her governments economic recovery program 
the sandinistas who spearheaded the walkouts that began monday 
accuse chamorros 2monthold conservative government of breaking a 
promise not to fire public employees 
they also accuse the government of violating the constitution by 
denying union leaders a say in making economic policy 
sandinistaled strikes in may won government employees a 100 
percent salary increase and other concessions from mrs chamorros 
administration 
banking postal and telephone services were disrupted and 
hundreds of government employees held sitin strikes in public 
buildings 
about 3800 telephone and post office workers walked out 
wednesday night virtually halting operatorassisted international 
calls nicaragua has no direct dialing telex service continued 
normally however 
about 12500 bank employees and 3500 more at the agriculture 
ministry walked out on thursday the banks were opened by managers 
but there was no service 
customs and the ministries of foreign affairs labor 
construction transportation commerce and finance were also 
struck as were most of the countrys universities 
the air traffic controllers said they planned to stop monitoring 
all flights as of this morning and the workers at the state power 
monopoly threatened electricity cuts 
thousands of farm workers whose title to their lands could be 
affected by the new governments policies were also reported to be 
on strike 
labor leader lucio jimenez claimed a total of 80000 workers had 
walked off their jobs nationwide but estimates of the number of 
strikers by the sandinistaled unions have often been exaggerated 
in the past 
jiminez was among seven sandinista strike leaders briefly 
detained by the government wednesday 
since taking office april 25 mrs chamorro has been trying to 
whittle the governments topheavy bureaucracy cut expenditures 
and eliminate a host of subsidies from urban transportation to 
basic foods 
her administration also sharply devalued the currency and has 
been trying to do away with state controls on the economy imposed 
by the sandinistas when they seized power in a 1979 revolution that 
overthrew rightist dictator anastasio somoza 
the sandinistas were defeated in the feb 25 elections by mrs 
chamorros 14party coalition 
government economists say a decade of sandinista rule left 
nicaragua saddled with a huge foreign debt a treasury that is 
almost broke an annual inflation rate of 36300 percent and 
agriculture and industry in near shambles 
the sandinistas blame nicaraguas economic woes in large measure 
on the decadelong usbacked contra insurgency and us economic

a judge declined to release a television 
reporter held in jail for contempt of court despite the apparent 
public disclosure of the source the reporter has refused to 
identify 
bexar county sheriff harlon copeland said thursday the source 
was a cousin of a capital murder suspect that kmoltv reporter 
brian karem interviewed by telephone from the county jail last year 
however the disclosure had no immediate effect on karems 
status he has been in the bexar county adult detention center 
since june 27 serving a sixmonth term for contempt of court 
prosecutor beth taylor said the district attorneys office wants 
the disclosure from karem 
he still has to produce a piece of paper of his sources we 
need to see that she said 
larry macon karems attorney filed a motion to dismiss the 
contemptofcourt finding but state district judge pat priest told 
macon in chambers that the motion was meaningless the judge said 
only karems statements not those of another person could relieve 
the contemptofcourt finding according to cathy granados 
priests court coordinator 
thats not going to happen in my lifetime karem said after 
the sheriffs annoucement in a telephone interview from jail 
i have a promise between myself and that source that source 
has not absolved me of my promise he said im sure as hell 
not going to be intimidated by a judge or by a prosecutor or by a 
defense attorney 
a formal hearing will be set for the dismissal motion granados 
said 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press in washington said following copelands 
revelation that the only reason karem is still in jail is to punish 
him 
once youve got the name of the source you dont have to keep 
the journalist jailed unless youre just offended that the 
journalist wouldnt buckle under to you she said at this 
point theres not even an arguable purpose to continue to jail him 
other than to punish him 
karem has repeatedly refused to say who arranged an interview 
with henry david hernandez accused of killing a san antonio police 
officer last year in the interview hernandez said he shot the 
officer in selfdefense 
defense attorneys and prosecutors say they have to know who 
arranged the interview to determine if the interview is admissible 
in his trial 
before about 60 reporters gathered at the jail to show support 
for karem copeland identified the source as deborah ledesma a 
cousin of hernandez 
copeland said he learned the name last friday through his own 
investigation and tried to tell the judge but was told priest could 
not discuss the case with him 
there is no deborah ledesma listed in san antonios telephone 
directory so she could not be immediately reached for comment 
hernandez and his brother julian are charged with capital 
murder in the shooting of officer gary williams last march 
a federal judge upheld priests contempt order two weeks ago and 
refused to extend a stay while karem appealed the order in federal 
courts karem was jailed after a us supreme court justice also 
refused to extend the stay

a highranking military officer 
accused of covering up the murder of six jesuit priests remained in 
command of an elite infantry batallion nine days after a judge 
ordered his arrest 
the priests brutal slayings in november provoked an 
international outcry and calls from some in congress for cuts in 
the millions of dollars of us aid that keep el salvadors 
government and military afloat 
the officer lt col camilo hernandez said last week he would 
turn himself in when ordered to do so by defense minister humberto 
larios or by col rene emilio ponce head of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
ponce said the defense ministry did not receive a copy of the 
arrest warrant until thursday more than a week after it was issued 
we will proceed with the detention of lt col hernandez 
ponce said in a telephone interview 
on thursday hernandez was still on duty at the headquarters of 
the elite belloso infantry battalion just outside the capital and 
security forces had made no effort to arrest him 
the case with its human rights implications could be pivotal 
in in peace negotiations between the rightist government of 
president alfredo cristiani and leftist rebels of the farabundo 
marti national liberation front 
the insurgents have demanded an end to military impunity in 
human rights cases as a condition for ending the 10yearold civil 
war that has claimed an estimated 72000 lives 
that lt col hernandez remains at his post is one more proof 
that military impunity is a concrete reality that must be 
eradicated it is a demonstration of contempt for the judiciary 
said miguel saenz a member of the rebels politicaldiplomatic 
commission in a telephone interview from mexico city 
though international human rights groups blame the armed forces 
or militarylinked death squads for the abduction and murder of up 
to 30000 suspected government opponents in the past decade no 
officer has been tried for human rights abuses 
judge ricardo zamora of the 4th criminal court ordered 
hernandez arrest on june 26 for covering up the murder of six 
jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
the priests were dragged from their beds and shot to death on 
nov 16 during a major rebel offensive in the capital rightwing 
extremists had long considered them subversive because they 
publicly maintained the civil war stemmed from social and economic 
injustice instead of outside communist aggression 
hernandez was the no 2 officer of the military college in 
november when the jesuits were killed by an army detail based at 
the school he allegedly ordered the burning of log books detailing 
troop movements 
hernandez denied the allegation in sworn testimony before the 
arrest warrant was issued 
lt col guillermo benavides commander of the military college 
when the killings took place has been charged with murder along 
with three lieutenants and five privates all but one a private 
who is a fugitive are under arrest 
despite his arrest benavides was spotted at a militaryowned 
beach resort earlier this year after the sightings he was 
confined to national police headquarters where he reportedly 
enjoys catered meals and visits from family and colleagues

three medical researchers say a british sailor who 
died in 1959 had the aids virus which would mean the disease was 
present in britain more than 20 years earlier than had been thought 
the researchers at the medical school at the university of 
manchester reported their findings in the lancet a londonbased 
weekly medical journal 
the report made available today was based on tests on tissue 
preserved from the royal navy sailors body 
according to the report the sailor had an immune deficiency 
that at the time could not be explained as well as pneumocystis 
pneumonia one of the opportunistic diseases now associated with 
aids 
the discovery stemmed from the persistence of one of the three 
researchers pathologist george williams who performed the 
original examination of the sailors body 
in a report in the lancet in the 1960s williams described it as 
a unique case of pneumonia accompanied by overwhelming 
complications and secondary infections 
when aids was recognized in the 1980s williams reminded his 
colleagues of the similarity and asked if they could reopen the 
sailors case by then the sailors only physical remains were 
samples of tissue stored in paraffin blocks 
in their report in the lancet williams virologist andrew 
bailey and gerald corbitt reported that the hiv virus was found in 
tissue taken from the sailors kidneys bone marrow spleen and 
pharyngeal mucosa 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or aids 
taking into account the incubation time of several years 
between infection and development of the fullblown disease the 
seaman would have contracted the virus in the early 1950s the 
times of london quoted bailey as saying in an interview 
the researchers said the earliest accepted case of human blood 
serum with antibodies indicating the donor was hivpositive was a 
sample taken in zaire in 1959 
aids breaks down the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers it is 
usually transmitted through sexual contact blood transfusions or 
infected needles there is no known cure 
as of june 1 1990 the world health organization counted a 
cumulative total of 263051 cases of aids worldwide but who 
estimates the true number to be closer to 700000 
the organization says 156 countries have officially reported at 
least one case of aids

north korea announced friday that it 
will open a portion of its border with south korea next month to 
encourage unification a south korean news agency said 
naewoe press a semiofficial news agency specializing in 
communist affairs said north koreas committee for the peaceful 
reunification of the fatherland made the announcement in a 
broadcast monitored in seoul on friday 
the north korean announcement said the communist sector of the 
truce village of panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone dmz will 
be opened aug 15 to allow free travel between the two koreas 
it was not immediately clear whether both north and south 
koreans or foreigners would be permitted to freely cross the 
border in addition south korea also controls any passage through 
the heavily guarded border 
in seoul south korean officials denounced the communist move as 
propaganda officials claimed it was aimed at encouraging south 
korean radical groups to hold a unification rally at the border 
village on the countrys national liberation day which also is 
aug 15 
the north korean move also is insignifiant because it affects 
only its sector of panmunjom which is very small said a senior 
seoul govenment official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
panmunjom is an ovalshaped joint security area straddling a 
portion of the 155mile border between the two koreas it is where 
military officials of both sides irregularly meet to discuss 
alleged armistice violations 
the north korean action would affect about 800 yards of the 
border 
the north korean annoucement came while officials of both sides 
were holding talks at panmunjom village to discuss an accord that 
would outline terms for the first meeting between the prime 
ministers of the two koreas 
at a border meeting on tuesday the two koreas agreed in 
principle to hold the first prime ministers meeting possibly in 
august in seoul they agreed to adopt a formal agreement on such 
talks july 26 
it would be the first meeting between top officials of the two 
koreas since the divison of their peninsula in 1945 the korean 
border is tightly sealed and no one can cross the border without 
government approval which is rarely given 
the date announced for the border opening aug 15 is symbolic 
to both koreas on aug 15 1945 korea was liberated from japan 
after 35 years of colonial rule 
north and south korea are still technically at war because no 
peace treaty was signed after the 19501953 korean war 
the war began june 25 1950 when north korea sent thousands of 
troops across the 38th parallel into south korea and ended with a 
ceasefire 37 months later the conflict killed more than a million 
people including 54000 american soldiers

thousands of florida inmates have been 
barred from workrelease programs after a convicted murderer 
escaped from a community detail and allegedly stabbed a woman to 
death in a mall 
the new prison policy means 50 percent of the entire prison 
population of 42700 inmates will be held in the states most 
secure prisons about 40 percent or 18127 were in such prisons 
before the new policy was announced by gov bob martinez thursday 
martinez said the old system was antiquated and allowed 
prison officials too much discretion in deciding whether hardcore 
criminals could get assigned to work details for community jobs 
road work and prison industries 
we cant stop every criminal from committing criminal acts 
he said but we can stop giving the worst of them the opportunity 
to walk the streets of our communities where they have the 
greatest chance to escape and threaten lawabiding citizens 
about 3400 inmates now classified for minimum or 
mediumsecurity institutions will be shifted to more secure 
socalled closecustody prisons and it will be more difficult for 
violent or longterm inmates to get into workrelease programs 
martinez blamed the old policy for donald david dillbecks 
escape on june 22 from a catering detail out of the quincy 
vocational center 
dillbeck convicted of the 1979 murder of a lee county sheriffs 
deputy is charged with fatally stabbing 44yearold faye lamb vann 
on june 24 as she sat in her car at a tallahassee mall 
three corrections officials were fired for letting dillbeck into 
the program and onto the catering detail 
the judgment was faulty no question martinez said but 
the discretion allowed to corrections officials led the fault to 
occur 
eight other prison officials involved in the dillbeck case will 
not be fired martinez said but remain on administrative leave 
pending possible department disciplinary action 
the case became a political issue when former sen lawton 
chiles a candidate in the democratic primary for governor blamed 
it on prison policies of martinez whose reelection campaign touts 
his lawandorder record 
the old rules let those prisoners required to serve a specific 
sentence before being eligible for parole to be moved to 
lesssecure custody status after they finished 40 percent of their 
mandatory sentences dillbeck for instance had served 44 percent 
of his 25yearminimum term 
the new policy requires that all such inmates serve the entire 
minimum portion of their sentences in close custody before they can 
be assigned to a workrelease program 
inmates will be ineligible for workrelease or other community 
jobs if they have been convicted of first or seconddegree murder 
unless they are within one year of release and have served all 
mandatory time

a statement purportedly from 
communist rebels says a us peace corps volunteer and a japanese 
aid worker would be released this month but that guerrillas would 
not permit the groups to work on negros island again 
the new peoples army is believed holding peace corps volunteer 
timothy swanson 26 of cheyenne wyo and fumio mizuno 36 of 
the japanese organization for industrial spiritual and cultural 
advancement in the rugged mountains of negros island 
today news organizations received a statement purportedly from 
ka comrade efren who identified himself as chief of the 
regional command on the island located about 300 miles southeast of 
manila 
there was no way to verify whether the statement came from the 
rebels reporters familiar with the negros rebels said they were 
unfamiliar with the alias ka efren 
retired roman catholic bishop antonio fortich who has good 
contacts with the rebels said he had heard unofficially that the 
two might be released soon but he had no confirmation 
i would suppose they cannot hold them any longer fortich 
said by telephone from negros these two gentlemen have been very 
good and their have not committed human rights violations usually 
the npas do not hold people like this 
in the statement ka efren said swanson and mizuno were 
invited to a dialogue because the rebels suspected their 
organizations were involved in the governments counterinsurgency 
swanson was abducted june 13 from his home in patag about 330 
miles southeast of manila mizuno was taken at gunpoint may 29 
while inspecting a silkworm farm about 10 miles south of patag 
they are safe the statement said we will turn them over 
within the month but an offensive by the enemy might endanger 
their lives 
the statement said swanson and mizuno were unaware that their 
organizations were used to spy against the rebels but the 
statement accused both groups of working for the government and 
rich landlords 
we will prepare charges against their organizations the 
statement said after this after we have aired our evidence 
anybody who pursues these antipeople activities are consciously 
risking their lives the statement said 
the united states suspended peace corps operations in the 
philippines last month and recalled all 261 volunteers because of 
reports the rebels planned to target members of the organization 
us officials said the decision was taken before they knew 
swanson had been kidnapped they learned of the incident after 
trying unsuccessfully to contact him about the pullout 
the rebel statement described swanson as american rahrah boy 
ready to spread goodwill not knowing he was being used in an evil 
scheme 
philippine officials said that swanson was one of seven peace 
corps volunteers on negros 
on wednesday about 200 patag residents staged a rally in their 
mountain village urging the rebels to release swanson 
villagers including schoolchildren teachers and others 
carried placards asking the rebels to return tim swanson and 
we love tim 
swanson had lived in the area for two years and married a local 
schoolteacher on may 29 the day mizuno was kidnapped swanson had 
been teaching agricultural and reforestation techniques to local 
residents

a protester camped in front of the motel 
where martin luther king jr was assassinated has stopped 
construction of a civil rights museum there 
the lorraine motel where the civil rights leader was killed in 
1968 is to become the centerpiece of a 9 million civil rights 
museum but protester jacqueline smith describes the lorraine as 
sacred ground she contends it should become housing for the 
homeless not a museum 
construction manager anthony vaccaro said thursday he stopped 
the staterun project on monday because ms smith a former 
resident and employee of the motel is camped on a sidewalk that 
must be torn up for utility lines 
the museum is scheduled to open on july 4 1991 
state architect mike fitts said last week he was seeking legal 
advice on getting rid of ms smith 
but vaccaro said the state informed him this week that he is 
responsible for removing ms smith since she was an existing site 
condition when the construction contract was awarded 
apparently nobody wants to take the blame for doing this 
vaccaro said ms smith has been living in a tent on the sidewalk 
in front of the motel since march 2 1988 she has refused requests 
to move across the street where her protest could continue 
vaccaro said he expected to seek a court order by next week 
requiring law enforcement authorities to remove ms smith 
sheriffs deputies carried ms smith from the motel when it was 
shut down to make way for the museum since then authorities have 
pretty much ignored her 
police spokesman john bennett said city authorities expected the 
state to deal with ms smith we have never received a complaint 
from anybody regarding her presence down there bennett said 
site preparation and preliminary construction got under way last 
year but ms smith did not hinder that work the major phase of 
museum construction began last month 
a group of concerned citizens bought the lorraine at a 
foreclosure auction in 1982 and spent the next couple of years 
convincing the state county and city governments to finance the 
museum

nato leaders feasted on champagne and truffles at 
their summit celebrating the end of the cold war maybe theyll 
dine on caviar when soviet president mikhail gorbachev shows up 
it was supposed to be the summit of no surprises 
everyone was talking about troop cuts modifying nato policy to 
use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and the future of 
the 16nation alliance formed in 1949 at a time of eastwest 
hostility 
suddenly a buzz spread through the summit that president bush 
had invited gorbachev to address a future nato meeting and the man 
trying to fend off attacks at the communist party congress in 
moscow became the man of the hour in london 
several observers quipped that gorbachev probably wished he were 
here right now 
its a spectacular coup to show that nato is open to relations 
with the warsaw pact said british lawmaker bruce george a 
member of the house of commons select committee on defense who is 
writing janes nato handbook

international meetings but only narrowly missed arriving late twice

the first summit meeting for about 15 minutes 
for the nato family portrait british prime minister 
margaret thatcher helped get the front row lined up on the grand 
staircase with marks where each was to stand 
mitterrand was missing but he arrived just before danish prime 
minister poul schluter

actor gene hackman has been told to 
exercise and improve his diet after he narrowly avoided a heart 
attack 
hackman was listed in good condition early today at st vincent 
hospital amp medical center said nursing supervisor marymae 
zimmerman 
he feels much relieved said dr herber semler the 
cardiologist who treated hackman the pain is gone he is up and 
around and ready to make another movie 
an artery leading to hackmans heart narrowed dangerously and 
doctors had to reinflate it with a balloon catheter semler said a 
news conference thursday 
semler said that if hackman hadnt entered the hospital when he 
did the artery would have completely shut down and he would have 
possibly had a heart attack 
hackman 60 was admitted to the hospital tuesday 
semler said the rest of hackmans coronary arteries look good 
and the actor can return to an active life he said hackman is not 
overweight doesnt smoke and has no history of medical problems 
thats the interesting part we see this in otherwise healthy 
people he said the narrowing comes on as a natural process 
like gray hair it could happen to anyone 
however semler said he is recommending an exercise and diet 
plan for hackman who lives in beverly hills calif 
hackman had just finished filming a movie in europe called 
dinosaur and was vacationing on the oregon coast when he began 
suffering chest pain he came to portland and the pain expanded to 
include his arm 
we think we got him just in the nick of time semler said 
hackman thought the chest pain was only indigestion but felt it 
was a good idea to have it checked said his publicist dick 
guttman in los angeles 
the son of a journeyman pressman hackman is a former truck 
driver and soda jerk who did not pursue acting until he was in his 
30s his most acclaimed role was as the roughandtumble narcotics 
cop popeye doyle in 1971s the french connection that 
performance won him an academy award

police said no group claimed immediate responsibility for the 
blast but because the targets were blacks they said suspicion 
fell on extreme rightwing white groups who had threatened earlier 
this week to step up a bombing campaign 
the groups oppose steps by president fw de klerk toward 
dismantling apartheid laws that segregate whites and blacks 
the bomb went off in an area where buses used by black people 
pick up and let off passengers thousands of blacks from townships 
outside johannesburg pass through the area every day on their way 
to work 
three minibuses were rocked by the blast and riddled with 
debris eyewitnesses said and up to 15 vehicles were damaged 
witnesses said people caught by the blast stood in the street 
frozen by fear and disbelief 
some of the injured were buying food in nearby shops when they 
were hit by flying debris witnesses said 
everything was clouded with smoke i saw about six people 
running toward me with shredded clothing and some with no shoes 
said shopkeeper isha charassi 
police explosive experts were combed the area to ensure there 
were no other bombs 
several bomb attacks earlier this week in johannesburg were 
aimed at whites involved in efforts to end apartheid but they 
caused no injuries and minor damage 
rightwing groups claimed responsibility for those attacks 
police defused a large bomb thursday in a black miners union in 
the town of oberholzer west of johannesburg the bomb made of six 
sticks of dynamite would have caused major damage if it had 
detonated police said

lace and spandex peel away readily 
aboard the wayward princess a detroit river cruise ship where men 
delight in discarded gstrings and women watch musclemen shed 
doublebreasted suits 
the 110foot threedecked vessel opened for a preview voyage 
thursday with dozens of photographers and reporters getting the 
first peek at the sexy gyrations of one male and four female 
dancers 
im doing it for the fun of it said jacques beauchamp who 
developed the nudedancing cruises when his business of renting the 
boat for private parties waned 
i think we are going to prove that its just a good thing for 
the city of windsor 
ontario strippers unlike their michigan counterparts are 
allowed to remove all clothing in establishments where alcohol is 
sold 
windsor a city of about 195000 people lies across the detroit 
river from detroit it regularly attracts us visitors to downtown 
clubs where women dance nude on stage or for 5 a song atop a box 
next to the table 
beauchamp had staged chartered strip shows on the wayward 
princess until windsor officials revoked his license two years ago 
the city grudgingly approved a license two weeks ago 
personally id rather not see it city licensing 
commissioner ronald reaume said but were not there to license 
the morality of the situation 
beauchamp could face fines or imprisonment if the wayward 
princess crosses the rivers international boundary said detroit 
police officer dan smith neither detroit police nor the us coast 
guard could say what penalties are involved 
kara a tall brunette with braces and a deep tan opened the 
show thursday with a dance to the song all around the world 
the 21yearold detroitarea woman who didnt give her full name 
strutted around the tiny stage in nothing but a gstring the 
gstrings will drop on subsequent cruises 
its kind of exciting because its the only boat in the world 
thats a strip bar where you can get totally nude kara said 
elizabeth hall an inspector with windsors license division 
was on the cruise thursday checking the dancers licenses and 
telling one woman she couldnt perform until her paperwork cleared 
the ships maiden voyage for paying customers will be tonight 
beauchamp said he expected a capacity crowd of 325 passengers 
male strippers will perform on the lower level and female 
strippers on the second deck the openair top level loosely 
termed the friendship deck is designed for socializing 
zsolt szanati 22 immigrated to windsor from hungary three 
years ago he worked several jobs before he discovered stripping 
nudity on the water will offer audiences an extra allure he said 
it is going to be more exciting for people on board szanati

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki ousted 
all but one former communist from his cabinet today to counter 
criticism of his 10monthold governments performance 
but some solidarity activists said the changes werent sweeping 
enough 
in a speech before parliament that was broadcast nationwide 
mazowiecki said political battles in the noncommunistled 
government were threatening the countrys peaceful evolution to 
democracy 
the prime minister announced the resignation of five cabinet 
ministers including three of the four former communists who 
remained in the government as the price for solidarity replacing 
the communist regime in september 
prominent among those ousted was the interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak who is in charge of the police and defense 
minister florian siwicki 
mazowiecki retained excommunist marcin swiecicki the young 
foreign trade minister who has been instrumental in trade talks 
with the soviet union 
some solidarity activists said they were not satisfied with the 
shakeup 
these changes are not sufficient said bogdan lis a 
solidarity senator from gdansk he urged the ouster of government 
spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska and cabinet director jacek 
ambroziak as well 
the state news agency pap said mazowiecki met with solidarity 
lawmakers immediately after his speech and told them more changes 
may be forthcoming 
the prime minister suggested earlier parliamentary elections 
which are currently scheduled for spring 1991 but he did not set a 
date 
he also urged more rapid privatization of state enterprises 
under fire from the nations farmers and from his former ally 
and mentor solidarity leader lech walesa mazowieckis speech was 
high political drama 
today standing in front of you and in front of the entire 
society i have to say clearly that i see danger on the peaceful 
polish road to democracy mazowiecki declared 
the sense of responsibility for the country is getting weaker 
in political life he said substantial arguments are being 
replaced by the language of brutal struggle even in this hall 
mazowieckis spokesman on thursday said the speech should be 
considered a turning point in the history of the east blocs first 
noncommunist government which was seated sept 12 in a wave of 
national optimism 
lately that hope has diminished the government has had to 
grapple with a major rail strike use police to break up two farm 
protests and answer a steady stream of criticism from walesa 
believed to be mounting a campaign to take over the presidency from 
former communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
walesa aides said he had no comment after mazowieckis speech 
the solidarity leader has urged mazowiecki to replace holdover 
communists in the government and staterun industries hold early 
elections and speed privatization of state enterprises the prime 
minister responded to all three points in his speech 
besides kiszczak and siwicki the third excommunist to be 
ousted from the cabinet was transport minister franciszek wieladek 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki of the peasant party and 
communications minister marek kucharski of the democratic party

14 as soviet troops leave eastern europe and a treaty limiting 
conventional armed forces is implemented the alliances integrated 
force structure and its strategy will change fundamentally to 
include the following elements 
nato will field smaller and restructured active forces these 
forces will be highly mobile and versatile so that allied leaders 
will have maximum flexibility in deciding how to respond to a 
crisis it will rely increasingly on multinational corps made up of 
national units 
nato will scale back the readiness of its active units 
reducing training requirements and the number of exercises 
nato will rely more heavily on the ability to build up larger 
forces if and when they might be needed 
 
15 to keep the peace the alliance must maintain for the 
foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional 
forces based in europe and kept up to date where necessary but 
as a defensive alliance nato has always stressed that none of its 
weapons will ever be used except in selfdefense and that we seek 
the lowest and most stable level of nuclear forces needed to secure 
the prevention of war 
 
16 the political and military changes in europe and the 
prospects of further changes now allow the allies concerned to go 
further they will thus modify the size and adapt the tasks of 
their nuclear deterrent forces they have concluded that as a 
result of the new political and military conditions in europe 
there will be a significantly reduced role for substrategic 
nuclear systems of the shortest range they have decided 
specifically that once negotiations begin on shortrange nuclear 
forces the alliance will propose in return for reciprocal action 
by the soviet union the elimination of all its nuclear artillery 
shells from europe 
 
17 new negotiations between the united states and the soviet 
union on the reduction of shortrange nuclear forces should begin 
shortly after a cfe agreement is signed the allies concerned will 
develop an arms control framework for these negotiations which 
takes into account our requirements for far fewer nuclear weapons 
and the diminished need for substrategic nuclear systems of the 
shortest range 
 
18 finally with the total withdrawal of soviet stationed 
forces and the implementation of a cfe agreement the allies 
concerned can reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons these will 
continue to fulfill an essential role in the overall strategy of 
the alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are no 
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military 
action might be discounted however in the transformed europe 
they will be able to adopt a new nato strategy making nuclear 
forces truly weapons of last resort 
 
19 we approve the mandate given in turnberry to the north 
atlantic council in permanent session to oversee the ongoing work 
on the adaptation of the alliance to the new circumstances it 
should report its conclusions as soon as possible 
 
20 in the context of these revised plans for defense and arms 
control and with the advice of nato military authorities and all 
member states concerned nato will prepare a new allied military 
strategy moving way from forward defense where appropriate 
towards a reduced forward presence and modifying flexible 
response to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons in 
that connection nato will elaborate new force plans consistent 
with the revolutionary changes in europe nato will also provide a 
forum for allied consultation on the upcoming negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear forces 
 
21 the conference on security and cooperation in europe csce 
should become more prominent in europes future bringing together 
the countries of europe and north america we support a csce summit 
later this year in paris which would include the signature of a cfe 
agreement and would set new standards for the establishment and 
preservation of free societies it should endorse inter alia 
csce principles on the right to free and fair elections 
csce commitments to respect and uphold the rule of law 
csce guidelines for enhancing economic cooperation based on 
the development of free and competitive market economies and 
csce cooperation on environmental protection 
 
22 we further propose that the csce summit in paris decide how 
the csce can be institutionalized to provide a forum for wider 
political dialogue in a more united europe we recommend that csce 
governments establish 
a program for regular consultations among member governments at 
the heads of state and government or ministerial level at least 
once each year with other periodic meetings of officials to 
prepare for and follow up on these consultations 
a schedule of csce review conferences once every two years to 
assess progress toward a europe whole and free 
a small csce secretariat to coordinate these meetings and 
conferences 
a csce mechanism to monitor elections in all the csce 
countries on the basis of the copenhagen document 
a csce center for the prevention of conflict that might serve 
as a forum for exchanges of military information discussion of 
unusual military activities and the conciliation of disputes 
involving csce member states and 
a csce parliamentary body the assembly of europe to be based 
on the existing parliamentary assembly of the council of europe in 
strasbourg and include representatives of all csce member states 
the sites of these new institutions should reflect the fact that 
the newly democratic countries of central and eastern europe form 
part of the political structures of the new europe 
 
23 today our alliance begins a major transformation working 
with all the countries of europe we are determined to create 
enduring peace on this continent

here is the text of the final declaration issued 
friday by nato summit leaders 
 
london declaration on a transformed north atlantic alliance 
issued by the heads of state and government participating in the 
meeting of the north atlantic council in london on 5th6th july 
1990 
 
1 europe has entered a new promising era central and eastern 
europe is liberating itself the soviet union has embarked on the 
long journey toward a free society the walls that once confined 
people and ideas are collapsing europeans are determining their 
own destiny they are choosing freedom they are choosing economic 
liberty they are choosing peace they are choosing a europe whole 
and free as a consequence this alliance must and will adapt 
 
2 the north atlantic alliance has been the most succesful 
defensive alliance in history as our alliance enters its fifth 
decade and looks ahead to a new century it must continue to 
provide for the common defense this alliance has done much to 
bring about the new europe no one however can be certain of the 
future we need to keep standing together to extend the long peace 
we have enjoyed these past four decades yet our alliance must be 
even more an agent of change it can help build the structures of a 
more united continent supporting security and stability with the 
strength of our shared faith in democracy the rights of the 
individual and the peaceful resolution of disputes we reaffirm 
that security and stability do not lie solely in the military 
dimension and we intend to enhance the political component of our 
alliance as provided for by article 2 of our treaty 
 
3 the unification of germany means that the division of europe 
is also being overcome a united germany in the atlantic alliance 
of free democracies and part of the growing political and economic 
integration of the european community will be an indispensable 
factor of stability which is needed in the heart of europe the 
move within the european community towards political union 
including the development of a european identity in the domain of 
security will also contribute to atlantic solidarity and to the 
establishment of a just and lasting order of peace throughout the 
whole of europe 
 
4 we recognize that in the new europe the security of every 
state is inseparably linked to the security of its neighbors nato 
must become an institution where europeans canadians and americans 
work together not only for the common defense but to build new 
partnerships with all the nations of europe the atlantic community 
must reach out to the countries of the east which were our 
adversaries in the cold war and extend to them the hand of 
friendship 
 
5 we will remain a defensive alliance and will continue to 
defend all the territory of all of our members we have no 
aggressive intentions and we commit ourselves to the peaceful 
resolution of all disputes we will never in any circumstance be 
the first to use force 
 
6 the member states of the north atlantic alliance propose to 
the member states of the warsaw treaty organization a joint 
declaration in which we solemnly state that we are no longer 
adversaries and reaffirm our intention to refrain from the threat 
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political 
independence of any state or from acting in any other manner 
inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the united nations 
charter and with the csce the 35nation conference on security and 
cooperation in europe final act we invite all other csce member 
states to join us in this commitment to nonaggression 
 
7 in that spirit and to reflect the changing political role of 
the alliance we today invite president mikhail s gorbachev on 
behalf of the soviet union and representatives of the other 
central and eastern european countries to come to brussels and 
address the north atlantic council we today also invite the 
governments of the union of soviet socialist republics the czech 
and slovak federal republic the hungarian republic the republic 
of poland the peoples republic of bulgaria and romania to come to 
nato not just to visit but to establish regular diplomatic 
liaison with nato this will make it possible for us to share with 
them our thinking and deliberations in this historic period of 
change 
 
8 our alliance will do its share to overcome the legacy of 
decades of suspicion we are ready to intensify military contacts 
including those of nato military commanders with moscow and other 
central and eastern european capitals 
 
9 we welcome the invitation to nato secretary general manfred 
woerner to visit moscow and meet with soviet leaders 
 
10 military leaders from throughout europe gathered earlier 
this year in vienna to talk about their forces and doctrine nato 
proposes another such meeting this autumn to promote common 
understanding we intend to establish an entirely different quality 
of openness in europe including an agreement on open skies 
 
11 the significant presence of north american conventional and 
us nuclear forces in europe demonstrates the underlying political 
compact that binds north americas fate to europes democracies 
but as europe changes we must profoundly alter the way we think 
about defense 
 
12 to reduce our military requirements sound arms control 
agreements are essential that is why we put the highest priority 
on completing this year the first treaty to reduce and limit 
conventional armed forces in europe cfe along with the completion 
of a meaningful csbm confidencebuilding measures package these 
talks should remain in continuous session until the work is done 
yet we hope to go further we propose that once a cfe treaty is 
signed followon talks should begin with the same membership and 
mandate with the goal of building on the current agreement with 
additional measures including measures to limit manpower in 
europe with this goal in mind a commitment will be given at the 
time of signature of the cfe treaty concerning the manpower levels 
of a unified germany 
 
13 our objective will be to conclude the negotiations on the 
followon to cfe and csbms as soon as possible and looking to the 
followup meeting of the csce to be held in helsinki in 1992 we 
will seek through new conventional arms control negotiations 
within the csce framework further farreaching measures in the 
1990s to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed 
forces in europe so as to prevent any nation from maintaining 
disproportionate military power on the continent natos high level 
task force will formulate a detailed position for these followon 
conventional arms control talks we will make provisions as needed 
for different regions to redress disparities and to ensure that no 
ones security is harmed at any stage furthermore we will explore 
broader arms control and confidencebuilding opportunities this is 
an ambitious agenda but it matches our goal enduring peace in 
europe

boris n yeltsin told soviet communists today they 
are following their eastern european comrades down the path to ruin 
and could even be brought to trial by a society demanding 
punishment for their misdeeds 
yeltsin the president of the russian republic and populist 
rival of mikhail s gorbachev shook up the sleepy fifth day of the 
communist party congress with a blistering attack on the 
hardliners who dominate it 
yeltsin is calling for more drastic marketoriented reforms to 
revive the faltering soviet economy than those favored by president 
gorbachev the leader of the communist party 
if the party does not change inevitably representatives of 
the apparatus will be dragged out of the bodies of legal power 
he said such a party will be unable to hold onto its vanguard 
role or even its representatives in the legislature 
citing a growing demand to nationalize party property yeltsin 
said its possible to imagine that a struggle will begin to 
bring to trial leaders of the party at all levels for damages they 
personally brought to the people and the country 
the more than 4600 delegates in the kremlins palace of 
congresses listened intently to yeltsin but he received only a 
smattering of applause 
gorbachev asked later about yeltsins speech said i expected 
more 
hammering home his point yeltsin told delegates 
if you think there is a different possibility look at the 
fate of the communist parties of eastern europe they separated 
themselves from the people didnt understand their role and were 
left on the side of the road 
the only way out he said is for the soviet communist party to 
accept all the trappings of democracy that party leaders endorsed 
earlier this year 
yeltsin is a sympathizer of the democratic platform faction 
within the communist party the group has indicated that if the 
commmunist party cannot be reformed it will found its own party 
in his speech yeltsin said many new parties are forming later 
yeltsin predicted the democratic platform would join an alliance of 
more democraticminded political parties 
on monday the first day of the 10day congress leningrad 
reformer yuri boldyrev called for nationalization of party 
property democratic platform says taking back the partys vast 
holdings is a key issue for the group 
yeltsin parlayed his popularity among russian citizens in may 
into election as president of russia the largest of the 15 soviet 
republics 
since quarreling with gorbachev in late 1987 yelstin has been a 
constant critic of the soviet leader and an advocate of faster 
reform 
but the congress so far has been a forum for gorbachevs 
hardline critics 
yeltsin also has called upon the congress to change its name to 
the party of democratic socialism 
party spokesmen said thursday that idea will be brought to the 
congress floor for a vote despite a poll indicating that 80 
percent of the delegates were against changing the name 
ivan k polozkov newly elected head of russias communist party 
organization told reporters he was against changing the partys 
name 
to replace the communist party is to change the sign on a firm 
that has hurt its own reputation but its essence wont change 
he said the task is to renew the party and to show people it can 
fill an avantgarde role in society 
polozkov said he also supported gorbachevs statement on 
wednesday that the leadership should quit if it cannot make any 
improvements in soviets lives in the next two years 
the congress comes at a time of crisis for the soviet party it 
is not in immediate danger of losing its dominance of the political 
scene but its authority is low and there has been talk of a split 
the congress is technically the highest organ of the communist 
party empowered to set the party line change the leadership and 
alter party structure

president mikhail s gorbachev indicated today he 
would accept an invitation from nato to visit its headquarters and 
a foreign ministry spokesman gave the alliances latest session a 
glowing review 
gorbachev speaking to reporters and delegates during a break in 
the communist party congress in the kremlin said he had not 
received a formal invitation yet but i am always ready to go 
nato leaders ending their summit in london today approved a 
communique that proposed a mutual nonaggression pact with the 
soviet union and extended the unprecedented invitation to gorbachev 
and other warsaw pact leaders to visit nato headquarters in 
brussels belgium probably in december 
gennady gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman told 
reporters in moscow the soviet union had followed the nato summit 
with high expectations and we welcome the results of the session 
as a practical step to reexamine the philosophy of confrontation 
in europe 
he announced that the alliances secretary general manfred 
woerner would come to moscow on july 14 in a good continuation 
of the london forum 
gerasimov said natos moves away from military confrontation 
were an effective answer to several soviet officers who have 
complained the countrys foreign policy under gorbachev has 
consisted mainly of onesided concessions 
the results of the nato session show that our good example 
brings answering steps from nato he said noting that western 
moves thus bolstered gorbachevs position at home as well as abroad 
ivan polozkov head of the russian federations communist party 
told reporters earlier today he supports the idea of western aid 
for the ailing soviet economy i think we have no basis to refuse 
aid if its proposed said polozkov who is considered a leading 
hardliner in the party 
gorbachev reportedly appealed for economic aid in a letter to 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain at the nato meeting 
the issue of western economic aid to the soviet union was not 
resolved at the london meeting and is expected to be tackled at an 
economic summit of seven major industrial democracies that opens in 
houston on monday

more than 150 wildfires raced across 
alaskas interior forcing the evacuation of a town of 900 people 
and disrupting travel on highways choked by heat and smoke 
gov steve cowper declared a statewide state of emergency and 
called on the alaska national guard to help fight the fires that 
raged over 270 square miles of forest and open tundra an elite 
firefighting team from california was being flown in later today 
no injuries were reported 
the biggest fire covered about 47 square miles near beaver 
about 110 miles north of fairbanks but no structures were 
threatened there 
the greater threat was a wildfire that took only 24 hours to 
nearly double in size to at least 39 square miles today flames 
swelled up over trees and drew to within a quarter mile of the east 
edge of tok a town about 175 miles southeast of fairbanks 
emergency workers thursday afternoon went door to door urging 
people to leave their homes the evacuation remained in effect 
early today 
authorities closed portions of the glenn highway leading south 
to anchorage and the alaska highway a main road from the canada 
border for the day thursday but the smoke hazard diminished 
overnight and traffic resumed 
state troopers said there was a steady line of cars passing 
through tok early today many were tourists hauling campers who 
spent the night camped at the village airstip 
more than 400 firefighters spent thursday cutting firebreaks and 
dumping loads of chemical retardant on the crackling forests from 
airplanes flying through thick smoke a fresh crew of about 150 
arrived at fairbanks early this morning 
sharon wilson an interagency fire spokeswoman in fairbanks 
said a shift in the wind helped firefighters keep damage to almost 
zero in tok 
only a few abandoned buildings burned she said adding that 
todays work would center on widening breaks that are keeping fire 
from a neighborhood north of town 
its not moving now at any drastic rate wilson said the 
fire tends to get more quiet at night but the problem is the 
forecast is for more hot and dry weather and a possible 
thunderstorm 
the fire burned mainly black spruce birch aspen and brush on 
the flat terrain around the town some tok residents wore masks to 
filter out smoke 
whats bothering us the most is breathing theres burnt 
spruce needles falling out of the air said one resident mellie 
terwilliger you can see but you go around with your lights on 
earlier reports that the towns coast guard navigational station 
had been burned were incorrect said sue mitchell a spokeswoman 
for the bureau of land management in fairbanks the evacuated 
station which provides electronic signals to guide aviators and 
mariners only lost power she said 
seventeen firefighter managers from california were expected to 
arrive at tok later today a similar team battled the yellowstone 
national park fire that claimed more than a million acres in the 
summer of 1988 
on thursday state forester bob dick said the fire is out of 
control were throwing everything at it we have tankers 
bulldozers people and it isnt working 
the governor who flew over the region thursday said we had 
to get upwind of it before we could actually see it the fires are 
that massive 
most of the fires were blamed on heat low humidity and a rash 
of lightning strikes the fire danger was extremely high in much of 
alaska mitchell said temperatures approached 90 degrees 
throughout much of the interior wednesday 
the heat dries out alaskas forests and gives rise to late 
afternoon thunderstorms and wind gusts mitchell said there were 
more than 1800 lightning strikes in alaska on tuesday and a 
record 2192 on sunday 
on the kenai peninsula however drizzle and temperatures in the 
40s and 50s helped firefighters curb a series of blazes that broke 
out near ninilchik all the blazes there were expected to be 
contained by saturday 
nearly four dozen fires were being ignored by firefighting crews 
because of their limited ability to respond mitchell said

communist north korea said today it 
will open part of its border with south korea next month to promote 
reunification and it challenged the south to do the same 
according to news reports 
but officials in the capitalist south denounced the action as 
propaganda 
the norths plans appeared to be largely symbolic and it was 
unclear whether any citizens from the north would be allowed to 
cross into the south 
it would be the first time either of the two korean states had 
opened a portion of their border since the korean war ended in 1953 
word of the norths move came from naewoe press a semiofficial 
south korean news agency specializing in communist affairs it said 
north koreas committee for the peaceful reunification of the 
fatherland announced the plans in a broadcast monitored in seoul 
today 
for a successful progress of contact and visit between the 
north and the south we will open the portion of our side and 
hope that the south side too will take a corresponding measure 
the announcement said 
but it said only those interested in promoting reunification 
would be allowed into the north 
the north korean announcement said about 800 yards of the border 
would be opened aug 15 the day in 1945 when korea was liberated 
from japan after 35 years of colonial rule 
the north said the stretch of border to be opened was in the 
communist sector of the truce village of panmunjom inside the 
demilitarized zone about 35 miles north of seoul but no civilian 
can enter the area without approval from military authorities of 
both sides 
south koreas defense ministry said it had not been officially 
notified of the norths plans and would not comment on whether 
anyone would be allowed into the area during the border opening 
it also was not clear whether north koreans would be allowed to 
cross into the south during the opening 
south korean officials claimed the announcement was aimed at 
encouraging south korean radical groups to hold a unification rally 
at panmunjom 
south korean dissident groups immediately welcomed the north 
korean announcement and asked the government to approve their plans 
to send up to 300 representatives to meet with north koreans 
a spokesman for an umbrella dissident group chonminyon said 
the south korean governments response had been negative but we 
will push ahead with our plans 
a senior seoul government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity also said the norths move was insignificant because 
it affected only a small section of the border 
panmunjom is an ovalshaped joint security area straddling a 
portion of the 155mile border between the two koreas military 
officials of both sides meet there to discuss alleged armistice 
violations 
the announcement came as negotiations were being held to arrange 
for historic talks between prime ministers of the two nations 
possibly in seoul in august the talks would be the highestlevel 
contact between the koreas since the division of the peninsula in 
1945 
a south korean statement issued after todays talks said the 
prime ministers meeting appeared certain to be held 
on tuesday the two sides had agreed in principle to the 
meeting possibly in august in seoul they agreed to adopt a formal 
agreement on the talks july 26 
north and south korea are still technically at war because no 
peace treaty was signed after the 19501953 korean war which began 
june 25 1950 and ended with a ceasefire 37 months later 
the korean border is tightly sealed with more than 15 million 
troops deployed behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire on either 
side there is no mail telephone contact and no communications and 
travel between citizens

western leaders agreed today to transform natos 
nuclear strategy and president bush said the alliance was offering 
a solemn commitment to nonaggression to the soviet union and 
the new democracies of eastern europe 
at a news conference wrapping up a twoday nato summit bush 
said there would be negotiations to limit a unified germanys 
armies after the united states and the soviet union conclude a 
treaty reducing their conventional forces in europe 
our alliance extends the hand of friendship bush said we 
reaffirm that we shall never be the first to use force he said 
nato is changing and that the soviet union should no longer 
regard the western alliance as posing a military threat 
in moscow soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said he was 
ready to accept the nato leaders invitation to address a meeting 
of the western alliance probably in december 
i am always ready to go gorbachev said during a break in a 
contentious communist party congress at the kremlin the soviet 
leader said he had not received a formal invitation 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said we 
welcome the results of the nato session 
bush renewed his support for gorbachevs reforms but said he has 
big problems with direct us assistance to the soviet economy 
so long as moscow spends 5 billion annually for cuba and billions 
more on military modernization 
bush said perhaps there are ways to help the soviet economy 
by extending financial credits before moving on to direct 
government loans 
diplomatic sources said gorbachev wrote british prime minister 
margaret thatcher during the nato summit with an appeal for 
economic aid 
from london bush was flying to houston and next weeks economic 
summit of the worlds seven leading industrialized nations the 
issue of direct western aid to the soviet economy is regarded as 
certain to dominate discussions in houston 
nato leaders made a dramatic overture to the soviet union 
expressed by bush this way we say to president gorbachev come 
to nato nato secretary general manfred woerner was dispatched to 
brief gorbachev next week 
the nato meeting was called to consider western security needs 
in light of the virtual collapse of the sovietled warsaw pact in 
eastern europe whose member nations have thrown off communist 
control 
the north atlantic treaty organization was founded after world 
war ii as a military counterweight to the soviet military bloc in 
europe 
even as he offered friendship to east european countries bush 
made it clear he is not ready to accept any of the former soviet 
satellites into nato asked whether he would oppose hungarys 
application bush said not forever 
woerner said the changes in nato policy would ease the threat of 
war 
at long last we have the chance to make for the first time in 
history military aggression in europe materially impossible and 
also politically meaningless he told reporters at a separate 
news conference 
on nuclear weapons woerner said the nato leaders said they will 
modify and adapt the tasks of their nuclear deterrent forces 
and offered to eliminate all nuclear artillery shells from europe 
in return for reciprocal action by the soviet union 
in another important development the allies proposed that once 
a treaty is signed probably next fall on limiting conventional 
arms and military equipment talks would begin immediately on 
reducing the number of us and soviet troops in europe 
with this goal in mind a commitment will be given at the time 
of signature of the cfe treaty concerning the manpower levels of a 
unified germany said a closing communique bush said much the 
same in his news conference 
the arms talks are being held between the nato and warsaw pact 
nations to sharply reduce tanks artillery and other nonnuclear 
weapons in europe the united states and the soviet union already 
have agreed to limit each side to 195000 troops in the central 
region the united states would maintain an additonal 30000 in 
britain and southern europe 
the commitment by west germany to limit the forces of a united 
germany was seen as a key move to reassure the soviet union 
western leaders want a unified germany to be part of nato but 
gorbachev is opposed 
overall bush described the nato decision as a historic 
turning point and said the london declaration transformed 
natos nuclear strategy 
in a written statement the leaders proposed a mutual 
nonaggression pact with the soviet union and the other nations of 
the fading warsaw pact alliance 
the 20paragraph communique also 
tightened the trigger guard on european nuclear missiles by 
stating they would be used only as a last resort 
invited the soviet union czechoslovakia hungary poland 
bulgaria and romania to come to nato not just to visit but to 
establish regular diplomatic liaison 
the walls that once confined people and ideas are 
collapsing the nato leaders declared europeans are 
determining their own destiny they are choosing a europe whole 
and free 
proposed the eventual elimination of nuclear artillery shells 
by reciprocal arrangement 
asked what message he wants gorbachev to receive from the london 
meeting bush said heres an alliance that you should view mr 
gorbachev as defensive not threatening and please convince your 
military and others in the soviet union of that fact

bush met british prime minister margaret thatcher over breakfast 
and the president made clear he was satisfied with the communique 
mrs thatcher had expressed misgivings about the change in 
nuclear doctrine but she agreed and in their final communique the 
leaders said there are no cricumstances in which nuclear 
retaliation in response to military action might be discounted 
the houston summit is expected to tackle an issue left 
unresolved here whether the west will commit billions of dollars 
in emergency assistance to help salvage the soviet unions 
crumbling economy 
the communique also proposed a permanent secretariat for the 
35nation eastwest conference on security and cooperation in 
europe as well as regular meetings between member heads of 
government 
in a letter to mrs thatcher at the nato meeting gorbachev 
appealed for economic aid to salvage his troubled economic reform 
program sources said 
the letter made no mention of any figures but gorbachev said he 
was hoping for positive conclusions at both the london and 
houston summits on the aid issue 
west germany and france have been pushing a 15 billion aid 
package from the west bush has been cool to the proposal but 
appears to be softening his stand japan says it will oppose it 
gorbachev could use an infusion of western cash to calm domestic 
unrest by putting a greater variety of foods and consumer items on 
soviet store shelves and to reduce a balanceofpayments deficit 
that exceeds 2 billion half the total is owed to west german 
companies and creditors 
the nato communique was fashioned early today by foreign 
ministers of the 16 alliance nations and approved virtually intact 
by the heads of state at their midmorning concluding session it 
was pretty much our draft said bushs spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
white house national security adviser brent scowcroft said it 
was an agreement not to be the first to use force between 
individual nations rather than the two alliances otherwise he 
said it would give a kind of blessing and legitimacy to the 
warsaw pact that we didnt want to do 
for nearly a quartercentury nato officially has reserved the 
strategic option of quickly unleashing nuclear weapons if natos 
conventional european defenses could not repulse an invasion by 
soviet forces that earlyuse doctrine is being set aside with a 
declaration that nuclear arms would be a weapon of last resort 
however the united states will have fewer nuclear weapons in 
europe bush pledged to begin withdrawing the arsenal of 1470 
nucleartipped artillery shells now based mostly in west germany 
as soviet troops pull out of central and eastern europe 
in a corresponding move west germany agreed to reduce the 
military manpower of a reunited germany to ease concerns in moscow 
german sources said bonn is prepared to reduce the size of the 
joint armed forces to about 400000 or nearly 150000 fewer than 
the combined troops of west and east germany

curators checking the louvre after the theft of a 
renoir painting this week discovered that a dozen ancient 
necklaces bracelets and earrings had been stolen from a display 
case officials announced today 
the officials said the second and thirdcentury jewelry was 
stolen from the department of egyptian antiquities it was 
discovered missing during an inspection by department curators on 
wednesday 
the announcement of the theft came one day after authorities 
took the unprecedented step of closing five paris museums to 
individual visitors following art thefts at the louvre and two 
other paris musuems on the same day 
but the director of the museums of france jacques sallois said 
the jewelry theft occurred long before the paintings were stolen 
the disappearance of these objects which are not of great 
value and are often seen on the market is certainly quite old 
sallois said it is prior to that of the paintings 
the jewelry was discovered missing during an inspection by 
curators ordered after a renoir was cut from its frame at the 
louvre on wednesday and two other paintings were stolen from two 
smaller museums 
police said it was possible that the same person or group robbed 
all three museums during a span of several hours moving from one 
to another in the middle of the day 
the citys major museums will remain open but security will be 
tightened said sallois authorities plan to examine existing 
security systems and develop new ones similar to those used in 
banks 
in addition to the renoir an 1816 painting by paul huet was 
stolen from the carnavalet museum and an 1870 work by ernest 
hebert was stolen from a museum named after the artist 
the hebert was one of the five museums closed as of thursday to 
individual visitors the others also relatively small 
institutions focusing on the works or the collections of a 
particular individual are the eugene delacroix gustave moreau 
jeanjacques henner and ennery museums 
from now on group visits to these museums must be arranged in 
advance sallois said 
police have complained previously that museum officials were not 
aggressive enough or candid enough in dealing with security 
sallois who took up his post only five weeks ago vowed this would 
change and said art theft would no longer be a taboo subject 
for public discussion 
the louvres director michel laclotte said the theft of 
renoirs portrait of a seated woman 189095 appeared to be 
the work of an especially clever professional 
the work by huet a french landscape painter was lifted off its 
hook wednesday morning at the history museum in one of the oldest 
sections of paris the painting les moulins de la glaciere 
was estimated to be worth about 14500 
the louvre and hebert museums are run by the national 
government the carnavalet is run by the city of paris

mitch snyder who was found hanged in the 
shelter he founded was eulogized today as a man of justice who 
answered a moral call to help the nations homeless 
snyder 46 was discovered dead thursday afternoon in a 
1400bed homeless shelter in a ragged neighborhood a few blocks 
from the us capitol autopsy results were not made public but 
police called his death an apparent suicide 
the rev jesse jackson told a memorial service at bible way 
church that snyder was a man who heard and answered a moral 
call to help the homeless 
the fact that birds have a home foxes have a home and yet 
men and women veterans of foreign wars mothers and fathers 
working poor people have no place to lay their head he found that 
to be a moral disgrace jackson told the mourners 
friends of snyder who spoke with him tuesday described him as 
despondent he was really down in the dumps and we had a long 
talk about his personal situation said a friend who asked not to 
be identified 
jackson called snyder a man of justice who taught us all that 
you can still regroup and get your life together 
dont you surrender and dont you give up jackson told the 
crowd of about 600 mourners many of whom lived at snyders shelter 
a funeral is scheduled for tuesday outside the shelter 
the gray threestory building where snyders body was found 
symbolized the cause in which he achieved national prominence and 
the tactics he used in his fight 
his group the community for creative nonviolence was given 
the rundown government building by the reagan administration only 
after he staged a hunger strike in 1984 to demand federal aid and 
publicize the plight of the homeless 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee which handles housing issues called snyder a man of 
action who at times became depressed by the problems of the 
homeless 
he was a man on the edge at the cutting edge of the homeless 
and the street people and his own ethos and rationale for 
existence said gonzalez 
a police statement called the death an apparent suicide by 
hanging spokesman lt reginald smith said a note containing 
suicidal references was found near snyders body 
the washington post reported today that police believe he died 
tuesday night or wednesday and that he had not been seen since 
tuesday 
it was a domestic situation something to do with his 
girlfriend one source said the note indicates there were 
problems there 
a second note found in snyders room and written last spring 
talked about this possibility sort of outlined what he might 
do said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
carol fennelly snyders companion of 15 years and partner in 
running the shelter read a statement on the buildings steps amid 
the drops of an approaching thunderstorm she said the community 
was greatly shocked and saddened 
moments later she departed from the written text and said 
mitch always said good things happen when it rains he was wrong 
today 
fennelly said last spring that the couple would marry in 
september she did not return telephone calls seeking comment on 
the notes 
soon after the discovery of snyders body scores of shelter 
residents lingered outside the shelter some with tears in their 
eyes others angry many blamed the relentless pressures snyder 
faced in his fight for the poor 
the man had done all he could do said richard coles 28 a 
former shelter resident who visited after hearing the news he 
was under a lot of pressure the daytoday struggle 
shortly after word of snyders death spread the shelter was 
visited by jackson and mayor marion barry 
its tragic hes gone well miss him said barry whose 
drug possession and perjury trial is under way at the federal 
courthouse nearby 
actor martin sheen who portrayed snyder in a 1986 television 
movie and later spent an evening on a sidewalk grate with him to 
call attention to homelessness said he was devastated by the news 
of the activists death 
its hard to come to grips with sheen told the starbanner 
in ocala fla where he was filming a movie i just pray that a 
very special angel meets him at the gate and escorts him to 
paradise 
last spring snyder refused to let census bureau workers into 
the shelter to count its residents calling the governments effort 
grandstanding he was criticized by other homeless advocates 
for his stance 
in recent weeks he came under pressure from some volunteer 
staff aides at the shelter to fire other workers who they said were 
engaged in illegal activities such as drug use 
snyder grew up in new york city he remembered his father 
ordering him to keep his car windows closed when he drove in the 
bowery to keep out the bums 
snyder worked selling washing machines and vacuum cleaners and 
as a job counselor before quitting and leaving his wife and two 
children in 1969 he later was sent to the federal prison in 
danbury conn for auto theft while there he met antiwar priests 
daniel and philip berrigan who were serving time for destroying 
draft records 
snyder moved to washington in 1973 as the vietnam war was 
winding down he was arrested christmas day that year trying to 
climb the white house fence

the possible exposure of 120 people to a 
fatal leukemia virus was an unacceptable break in procedure but 
probably didnt put anyone at serious risk university of 
pennsylvania officials said 
about 20 veterinary students and staff and 100 visiting 
preschool children unknowingly handled 14 newborn lambs that had 
been inoculated with a slowacting virus htlv1 the human tcell 
lymphotropic virus can cause a lethal form of leukemia in people 
but does not grow in sheep 
it was an unacceptable break of procedure said penns vice 
provost for research barry cooperman 
he said many of the veterinary school researchers expressed 
concern that allegations of misconduct would damage the public 
perception of science and hinder research efforts 
the universitys concern is that the public puts its trust in 
us he said we owe the public scrupulous responsibility in 
conducting experiments 
penn officials investigating the violation are now waiting for 
test results of blood samples from those people exposed to the 
animals to determine if they were infected according to cooperman 
the exposure occurred sometime in april when the lambs were 
inoculated but not separated from the rest of their flock at penns 
600acre new bolton center in suburban chester county 
both the schools environmental health and safety office and the 
institutional animal care and use committee had specified that the 
inoculated lambs should be isolated from the rest of the flock 
it was a serious breach of responsibility said dr aron b 
fisher chairman of penns animal care committee 
cooperman said officials investigating the problem did not learn 
until early june that the veterinary students had worked with the 
lambs and that children from the kennett square cooperative 
preschool had visited the site and played with the animals 
because htlv1 is transmitted only through blood mothers milk 
and sexual intercourse school and health officials believe it is 
unlikely that anyone was infected 
the risk to children is essentially nil said cooperman 
and to our own people a minimal risk 
the experiment which was approved by a faculty committee was

a court has ordered a country house mercedes car 
furniture a weapons collection and thousands of dollars in cash 
returned to galina brezhnev daughter of the former soviet leader 
a newspaper said today 
the property and cash were seized when ms brezhnevs husband 
yuri churbanov was imprisoned in december 1988 for accepting 
bribes 
ms brezhnev filed suit in a moscow court arguing she inherited 
the car and money from her father leonid brezhnev according to 
komsomolskaya pravda the young communist leagues newspaper 
brezhnev ruled the soviet union from 1964 until his death in 
1982 
the court apparently agreed the property and cash were owned by 
ms brezhnev rather than her husband 
the paper said the court ordered the government to return a 
country house worth 108474 a mercedes given to brezhnev by an 
unidentified foreign government furniture and chandeliers also 
seized was a weapons collection worth 200000 stuffed animals 
valued at 137011 and 111000 in savings 
if it were not for the loud name of the plaintiff i wouldnt 
even remember the case the unidentified judge said in the 
article 
under the law galina brezhnev was within her rights since 
most of the property belonged to her and not her husband and the 
supreme court had no right after sentencing yuri churbanov to 
confiscate it 
the paper did not say when the decision regarding ms brezhnevs 
property was made 
ms brezhnevs flamboyant lifestyle shocked moscow during her 
fathers tenure the soviet press has accused her of speculating in 
diamonds and she has been linked to a bribery scandal involving a 
moscus circus performer 
churbanov was fired from his job as first deputy interior 
minister in 1984 four years later he was convicted of accepting 
150000 in bribes and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp

since may they have led a loose alliance of lawyers and church 
leaders seeking legalized opposition in this oneparty state 
the us state department in a statement released by the us 
embassy in nairobi said in recent weeks we have made clear our 
hope that matiba and rubia and others who may speak out against the 
government would not be persecuted 
we believe very strongly in the principle of public expression 
of dissent and the right of peaceful assembly the statement 
said we are obviously distressed to see this action by the 
kenyan government 
the us embassy on thursday delivered a note to kenyas foreign 
ministry expressing the bush administrations interest and 
concern over the situation an embassy spokesman said 
rubia and matiba had urged the government to allow opposition 
activists to hold a public rally on saturday but president daniel 
arap moi has called the prodemocracy supporters traitors and 
subversives and he told citizens not to attend any rallies 
the president says that multiparty politics would create ethnic 
strife among kenyas 40 tribes and lead to tribal warfare 
the opposition accuses the government of corruption and election 
rigging

the iron curtain may be down but margaret 
thatchers still the iron lady 
true to form britains prime minister was the least eager among 
the nato summit participants to lower the wests voice or guard in 
the wake of kremlin reforms and the collapse of the soviet unions 
satellite regimes in eastern europe 
she delivered stern warnings about dismantling arsenals too soon 
and balked at president bushs proposal that the alliance stiffen 
its policy restraint on the use of theater nuclear weapons 
in the end she agreed to the new last resort strategy her 
aides said because it still means that moscow can never be sure 
that nuclear weapons wouldnt be used to respond to soviet 
aggression in europe 
mrs thatcher called the summit outcome good for nato and good 
for mr gorbachev 
the nato leaders final communique said there are no 
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military 
action might be discounted 
nato has long openly reserved the nuclear option in the face of 
potentially overpowering warsaw pact conventional forces the 
agreement to confine that option to the lastresort category was 
reaced by foreign ministers of the 16nation nato alliance early 
friday diplomatic sources said 
their heads of government approved the shift as part of their 
closing communique today 
as drafted by the ministers the document also included an 
invitation for the sevennation warsaw pact led by the soviets to 
sign a nonaggression pact with the western alliance 
her aides said mrs thatcher feared the lastresort language 
could mean losing the sense of the unknown which is essential to 
deterrence at all levels 
but she finally was satisfied that the language that was 
worked out will keep the sense of mystery said one british 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
some observers noted that mrs thatcher would have had a tough 
time trying to block the policy shift in any case the us 
proposal was strongly backed by west germany soon to be an even 
more powerful european force as part of a united germany 
however mrs thatcher struck a series of warning notes through 
the crucial meeting saying that while things have changed 
dramatically in europe glasnost and the collapse of satellite 
communist governments shouldnt mean the winding down of nato 
the prime minister dubbed the iron lady by the soviets in the 
cold war era reeled off statistics about continued soviet weapons 
production during a closed session of the leaders on thursday her 
aides reported 
to remind people of this might put me in danger of being 
called a cold war warrior a british official quoted her as 
saying 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said mrs 
thatcher then added that she could not be called a cold war 
warrior but she certainly could be accused of being very cautious 
on defense 
she was just as forceful in open session 
nato has defended peace with freedom and justice but it has 
never threatened anyone she said the cornerstone of that sure 
defense must remain for we do not know what the future holds but 
its architecture may change in the new situation 
but she also acknowledged soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
need for reassurance 
our former adversaries need our help and also our assurance 
that their own security is not threatened by the changes taking 
place she said 
she believes her forthright approach is the one best understood 
by gorbachev behind the tough words mrs thatcher is however 
looking to cash in on the peace dividend her government is 
undertaking a major overhaul of its defense spending and already 
has canceled an order for 33 tornado warplanes to trim 1 billion 
off this years 377 billion defense budget

iran and saudi arabia are providing military 
and financial support to moslem militants fighting for independence 
from india in disputed kashmir a us senator said today 
sen alan cranston a senior member of the foreign relations 
committee indicated that iranian and saudi help to the separatists 
was maintaining the flow of arms and trained fighters across the 
pakistanindian frontier 
my impression is that pakistan has greatly reduced and 
perhaps ended its assistance to those wanting to cross the 
border cranston told reporters but i believe there are others 
engaged in this process 
the california democrat said he understood that iran and perhaps 
some afghans were training kashmiri insurgents and that saudi 
arabia was giving financial aid to help the separatists counter a 
harsh indian crackdown 
in a meeting with the senator later indian prime minister vp 
singh took issue with cranstons claim that pakistan was scaling 
down its help to the militants 
pakistani aid had actually shown a sharp increase in the last 
couple of months this help was the main obstacle to the 
improvement of relations with pakistan foreign ministry 
spokesman aftab seth quoted singh as telling cranston 
he said cranston was given documents supporting indias claim of 
growing pakistani help but he declined to elaborate 
indian sources said the flow of arms across the frontier was 
several times greater in the last two months than it had been 
earlier in the year 
seth declined to comment on the reported aid to the separatists 
by iran and saudi arabia but he said if that is his 
cranstons perception he must have solid and concrete evidence 
to draw his conclusions 
pakistan and india both claim the entire kashmir region but it 
is divided between them two of the three wars they have fought 
since gaining independence from britain in 1947 began over kashmir 
more than 650 people have died since tensions began growing in 
january jammukashmir is the only one of the 25 states in 
hindudominated india with a moslem majority although the nation 
is officially secular 
two more people were reported killed today during clashes 
between indian security forces and the militants one 60yearold 
woman was shot in the head when closed a window witnesses said 
cranston said he been assured that amnesty international the 
londonbased human rights group will be allowed to investigate 
allegations of abuses by indian troops in kashmir 
until now india has resisted any outside inspection as an 
infringement of its sovereignty the government still appears 
divided on how much freedom amnesty officials would have 
cranston who visited kashmiri refugee camps during a threeday 
trip to pakistan said indian troops were clearly guilty of human 
rights violations during the sevenmonth rebellion 
although the threat of an indiapakistan war over kashmir has 
eased recently he said any conflict carried the risk of a nuclear 
confrontation 
my impression is that neither side possesses a nuclear bomb 
but both have the capability to produce a small number of nuclear 
weapons in a number of weeks if it wants to he said 
if war goes on for some time nations are likely to deploy 
whatever weapons they have to win

the nato alliance isnt about to call it quits 
but its reaching out to moscow with a less menacing countenance 
formed in 1949 to contain the red army the alliance suddenly 
finds itself in search of a mission and with the prospect of 
fewer american soldiers tanks and nuclear weapons at its disposal 
its rival military bloc the warsaw pact is unraveling soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev is ready to withdraw tens of 
thousands of troops and tanks from europe 
nato ended a twoday summit today with a new strategic doctrine 
nuclear weapons will remain in natos arsenal along with a threat 
to use them in the event of a ground war in europe 
but propelled by president bush the pivotal figure at the 
twoday meeting the allies have scrapped the threat of early first 
use 
bush asked what message gorbachev should take from the action 
said heres an alliance that you should view mr gorbachev as 
defensive not threatening and please convince your military and 
others in the soviet union of that fact 
our alliance extends the hand of friendship bush said we 
reaffirm that we shall never be the first to use force 
the west now views a soviet invasion of europe as far less 
likely than when the theater nuclear doctrine was formulated 25 
years ago so nuclear weapons under the new vernacular will 
become a deterrent of unlikely last resort 
british prime minister margaret thatcher fought to keep nato 
from tempering its nuclear posture but her holdout ended thursday 
night when the 16 foreign ministers agreed to keep the threat 
however diminished in the books 
so radical is the change sweeping europe the western allies 
decided to solicit a nonaggression agreement from the warsaw pact 
to invite gorbachev to visit the north atlantic council in 
december to begin dismantling 1470 us nucleartipped artillery 
shells once the soviets withdrawn troops from central and eastern 
europe 
the withdrawal is being negotiated between nato and the warsaw 
pact in vienna along with a more modest us pullout the 
artillery shells are targeted mostly on east germany which by 
december may be part of a united germany and nato itself 
gorbachev remember still heads the soviet union and what used 
to be called the soviet empire opening natos door to even a 
gorbachev speech is an act of high symbolism 
similarly liaison is being established with hungary and any 
other interested warsaw pact members who want to approach europes 
future in concert with nato at least as much as with moscow 
we will show that nato has a new dimension of cooperation with 
the soviet union and with the new democracies of eastern europe 
bush told the 15 other western leaders meeting in a chandeliered 
room in lancaster house 
what a difference from the rhetoric of just years ago 
i am not in favor of anything that would artificially 
perpetuate bloctobloc relations when this no longer reflects the 
reality said french president francois mitterrand 
backing bushs call for a formal end to the longstanding 
hostility between the two alliances the french leader said he 
would go further and seek a solemn declaration renouncing 
aggression or first use of force 
that is a little more than bush and most of the other allies are 
willing to offer similarly the united states is not yet prepared 
to pull all its nuclear weapons from europe 
for the time being at least some 700 lance missiles with 
battlefield nuclear missiles will remain with most of them in west 
germany 
and the bush administration is planning to produce a new 
airtosurface missile called tasm and also will divert some 
sealaunched cruise missiles to the west european nuclear arsenal 
but with the cancellation of new lances by bush in may and now 
the promise to scrap nucleartipped artillery shells the trend in 
europe cannot be misread

serbian authorities clamped a lid 
today on kosovo the troubled southern province it administers 
detaining two ethnic albanian opposition leaders and deploying 
police 
tension was high in kosovo a day after serbia dissolved the 
local legislature and government in pristina the provinces 
capital the crackdown followed mondays vote by kosovos 
legislature to secede 
police patrolled pristina 150 miles south of belgrade and 
heavy security was reported elsewhere in the province today 
yesterdays decisions are both illegal and 
unconstitutional said jusuf budzovi a member of the opposition 
democratic forum at a news conference in pristina 
kosovo is now a special zone in europe in which nothing except 
the police can function budzovi said he spoke before a building 
housing the forums offices which were sealed off by serbian 
police 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
nominally autonomous provinces kosovo 90 percent of whose 19 
million inhabitants are ethnic albanian has progressively lost 
control of its affairs to serbia 
at least 60 ethnic albanians in kosovo have died in clashes with 
the security forces since kosovos autonomy was severely limited in 
march 1989 
serbs consider kosovo the countrys leastdeveloped region the 
cradle of their medieval kingdom they have accused ethnic 
albanians of pressuring remaining slavs to move out to pave the way 
for independence 
under the crackdown serbian authorities took albanianlanguage 
programs on pristina radio and television off the air thursday 
they replaced management and leading journalists at broadcast media 
and the main provincial newspaper 
serbian authorities accused the albanianlanguage media of 
preparing to broadcast and print calls for a general uprising by 
ethnic albanians 
but the albanianlanguage rilindija daily appeared on the stands 
today yugoslavias state tanjug news agency said kosovo was 
yesterday subjected to a coup by the serbian authorities said a 
commentary in rilindija 
riot police surrounded the television and radio buildings today 
and were preventing visitors from entering the rilindija publishing 
house sources said 
the journalists union from yugoslavias westernmost republic of 
slovenia sharply denounced the measures being implemented 
against journalists of albanian origin in kosovo 
serbian interior minister radmilo bogdanovic said disciplinary 
measures would be taken against an undetermined number of ethnic 
albanian policemen who refused to participate in the clampdown 
two prominent ethnic albanian politicians ibrahim rugova and 
zekeria cana contacted from belgrade said today they were detained 
overnight by state security police 
the latest moves by the communist leadership of serbia are 
generally seen as an effort to strip the last vestiges of 
selfgovernment kosovo had under a 1974 constitution until the 
charter was amended in march 
ethnic albanians who want free elections and a multiparty 
system say the issue has been used by the republics communist 
leader slobodan milosevic to gain popular support for his hardline 
policies 
serbias leadership has proposed a new state constitution that 
would abolish kosovos autonomy the elimination of kosovos 
parliament under a new constitution would make ethnic albanians a 
small minority in the serbian legislature 
the republic of slovenia and croatia this spring held the 
nations first free local elections in 45 years and three other 
republics plan ballots later this year hardline serbia opposes 
westernstyle democracy

today that it says have enough signatures to force lawmakers to 
draft legislation requiring minor girls to get a parents 
permission to end a pregnancy 
right to life of michigan submitted petitions with 333187 
signatures to the board of state canvassers the michigan 
constitution requires about 192000 valid signatures to put the 
parental consent measure before the legislature 
lawmakers earlier approved a law that would have required girls 
17 and under to get a parents or judges approval before having an 
abortion gov james blanchard vetoed the measure and the 
legislature failed to override his veto 
if the canvassers rule there are sufficient signatures the 
legislature would have 40 days to approve the measure or it 
automatically would go on a statewide ballot if lawmakers approve 
the measure it would become law exempt from a gubernatorial veto 
both houses have voted twice on it already because there were 
two different versions and a majority of the state house and 
senate have signed the petitions barbara listing president of 
right to life of michigan said thursday 
prochoice groups say the parental consent measure would hurt 
young people and hinder communication between parents and children

requiring minor girls seeking abortions to notify a parent or seek 
judicial approval

in a grubby field jacket with burning eyes 
mitch snyder knew how to use his hunger as a weapon he stared down 
a president and got him to turn over a decaying federal building 
for a homeless shelter 
that took a 51day fast in 1984 cbs cameras were about to 
capture the showdown for 60 minutes the presidential election 
was two days off ronald reagan capitulated 
snyder got the navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear 
submarine corpus christi after the city in texas he said no 
warship should bear the name the body of christ and the navy 
changed it to the uss city of corpus christi that took 11 days of 
selfdeprivation 
it took 30 days without food to get the department of health and 
human services to release surplus food to the homeless 
but frail scornful confrontational mitch snyder had failures 
too he walked out of a marriage leaving behind two small 
children forcing his wife onto welfare he said he couldnt stand 
his life of selling electrolux vacuum cleaners and maytag washing 
machines 
and 10 days ago snyder failed to keep the city of washington 
from slashing funds for the homeless and gutting a law ensuring a 
nights shelter to everyone in need 
the law had been snyders triumph he persuaded voters to enact 
it in an initiative six years ago 
this law was strangling us said a city councilman hr 
crawford we are broke the new amendment which awaits the 
mayors signature would require homeless people to go though a 
screening process before being approved for shelter 
now mitch snyder has suffered his ultimate failure he has 
killed himself his body was found thursday his motives are far 
from clear police sources suggest private demons not policy 
issues compelled snyder to give up living 
snyder 46 was known everywhere he described himself as 
liberator of the destitute he was the hero of a tv movie 
samaritan the mitch snyder story its star martin sheen 
called him a saint he led congressmen and hollywood 
celebrities to a night of sleeping on the street he hobnobbed 
this spring his life took new twists he announced he would 
enter a trappist monastery to renew his relationship with god to 
do simple work like baking bread 
a month later a change in plans carol fennelly snyders 
companion for 15 years said she and snyder would marry in 
september on the street in front of the 1400bed shelter that had 
been the focus of snyders work the place that snyder had forced 
from a reluctant reagan 
the wedding ceremony was to have been performed by daniel 
berrigan the antivietnam war priest berrigan and his brother 
philip introduced snyder to activism in prison in danbury conn 
the berrigans were there for destroying draft records snyder 
was there for stealing a car out west that he once explained had 
been back in his jack kerouac days of finding himself 
after prison snyder abandoned his old life he drifted to 
washington activism hunger strikes 
he became top dog at the community for creative nonviolence 
turning it from a religious antiwar group into a noisy shelter for 
the roofless poor 
his former wife ellen daly described him in an interview with 
the washington post in 1988 as driven unhappy 
i was married to him i lived with him i slept with him i 
had children by him and yet theres parts of him i really dont 
know she said 
after seeing him portrayed on television the sons ricky and 
dean made contact they visited snyder at the shelter they once 
helped serve thanksgiving dinner there 
snyders first act of defiance in washington occurred on 
christmas day 1973 he climbed the white house fence apparently 
intent on confronting president nixon 
he had no more luck in 1978 persuading the rev james english 
pastor of the fashionable holy trinity church in georgetown to 
give the homeless money intended for church repairs 
english told the washington times that snyder said i know how 
to deal with you picketed brought the homeless into the 
sanctuary during services staged a sleepin in the convent 
gardens fasted 
the congregation stood firm it was the starving snyder who 
from a hospital bed gave in 
more recently he outraged other homeless advocates by refusing 
to allow census workers into the shelter

the bush administration is engaged in a 
longterm study of ways to combat poverty and it is unlikely that 
any new proposals will result before the end of the year officials 
said today 
this is a longterm process deputy white house press 
secretary stephen hart said no decisions have been made 
certainly no final decision on what options should be considered by 
the president have been made 
douglas j besharov a scholar at the conservative american 
enterprise institute said i think they are in the process of a 
longterm examination of what could be done they just are not 
going to propose anything this year 
besharov was among a group of outside experts on poverty 
summoned to the white house for a meeting in september 
it could well go into next year before any final decisions are 
made said an administration official who spoke on condition he 
not be identified you may see in the shorter term some decisions 
that give an indication of what direction we are headed in but 
there will be no final decisions for quite some time 
besharov said that in the short term the administration believes 
that what is important is to improve the programs that are in 
place now 
we had a major welfare reform bill passed just two years ago 
that is just now being implemented by the states he said it 
is very important that this be given a chance to do something 
the president is just not coming forward and saying i have a 
new program that will solve all the problems although that may 
disappoint people that is probably the wisest thing to do at this 
stage he said 
however isabel v sawhill of the urban institute an expert on 
poverty who also took part in the september meeting said it 
looks like they went through a lot of effort and came up with a 
mouse i am frankly quite disappointed that they could not agree on 
an overall strategy 
there were a lot of good ideas put forward both from people 
who were consulted externally and also generated internally within 
the administration and i think it was a serious and worthy effort 
but it seems to have fallen victim to some combination of ideology 
and budgetary pressures 
besharov said proposals from the administration that were 
considered included having the government help residents of poor 
areas establish management corporations that would fight crime 
improve schools and repair housing allocating a larger proportion 
of federal aid to highpoverty areas and providing financial 
subsidies to job contractors to steer people from high poverty 
areas to job openings

liberian president samuel doe asked 
the united states to ferry him and 100 troops to his home region of 
grand gedeh but the us government has refused diplomatic 
sources said today 
doe was believed to have about 3000 loyal troops from his krahn 
tribe in the area 300 miles northeast of the capital 
in washington a senior administration official denied that doe 
had made any such request the official insisting on anonymity 
said doe suggested to us diplomats in monrovia earlier this week 
that he would like to stop off in his home region but made no 
formal request for us help in getting there 
the united states has offered to help doe leave the country and 
the us envoys made it clear to him that the offer of 
transportation applies only to international travel the official 
said the question of us transportation for troops loyal to doe 
has not arisen the official said 
transporting doe and 100 soldiers to grand jeddah effectively 
would enable the president to launch his own campaign against the 
rebels but the diplomatic sources in the ivory coast who also 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the united states refused to 
help relocate doe in the country 
does remaining forces in the capital monrovia have been 
surounded by rebels charles taylor the leader of the rebel 
national patriotic front said doe must leave the country before he 
will accept a ceasefire 
a senior rebel leader in the united states rejected a reported 
plan by six west african states to send a peacekeeping force to 
liberia that would remain there until free elections could be held 
tom woewiyu said from east orange nj under no 
circumstances will the patriotic front allow troops of any kind to 
step on liberian soil 
if it was not necessary to impose a peacekeeping force on the 
murderous and cannibalistic regime of doe why is it necessary to 
impose it on us its being done under a camouflage of protecting 
tribesmen the real intent is to keep the flames of popular 
revolt from spreading throughout africa 
doe reportedly has set as a condition for his resignation 
assurances that his krahn people will be protected against any 
revenge attacks by the national patriotic front who draws its 
members from the gio and mano tribes 
the 6monthold guerrilla campaign to overthrow doe has 
degenerated into a tribal war does forces killed hundreds of gio 
and mano civilians in an unsuccessful effort to halt the 
insurgents advance the rebels have been accused of killing krahns 
and other civilians in revenge 
diplomatic sources in freetown sierra leone in contact with 
monrovia by radio said the rebels were moving slowly and had not 
entered monrovia from the surrounding suburbs the diplomats said 
the citys streets remained deserted today except for bands of 
soldiers looting and robbing 
rebels have cut all roads into monrovia and also have occupied 
the port since monday morning all international telephone and 
telex lines into the city also have been cut 
foreign journalists in the city sending their stories by radio 
telex have reported widespread looting by government troops 
operating under cover of a dusktodawn curfew soldiers also have 
frequently robbed the few people who have risked going out on the 
citys streets 
the president and his 500man presidential guard were in the 
heavily fortified presidential mansion 
the peacekeeping plan came from a sixnation mediation committee 
set up by the economic community of west african states 
representatives of the countries nigeria the gambia mali togo 
sierra leone and guinea met in freetown but adjourned today 
pending the expected arrival of a rebel delegation 
although woewiyu criticized the plan for a peacekeeping force 
he said he would go to freetown this coupled with the rebels 
inability to live up to their boast that they would take monrovia 
within 12 hours of launching their attack could mean they lacked 
the firepower to oust doe from his stronghold 
woewiyu repeating earlier statements said the united states 
was responsible for the peacekeeping proposal they are not 
convinced it will be to their benefit that the national patriotic 
front under mr taylor takes control of the country he said 
a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said in washington its not our role to assist 
charles taylor to come to power in liberia our position is that 
there needs to be a political settlement to this conflict we have 
tried to facilitate that by lending our support to various 
negotiation efforts the state department has said it has 
reservations about taylors commitment to democracy

gov buddy roemer

london ap here is a transcript of president bushs press 
conference at the conclusion of the twoday nato summit 
 
president bush prime minister margaret thatcher for hosting 
this splendid meeting and i want to express my appreciation also 
to manfred woerner not only for his kind remarks just now but for 
his outstanding leadership in nato and in this alliance which is 
at a turning point in its history 
im pleased to announce that my colleagues and i have begun a 
major transformation of the north atlantic alliance and we view it 
at a historic turning point nato has set a new path for peace 
its kept the peace for 40 years and today charted a new course 
for stability and cooperation in europe 
were as you know issuing a document the london declaration 
and it makes specific proposals and established directions for the 
future in four key areas 
first the london declaration transforms our relationship with 
old adversaries to those governments who have confronted us in the 
cold war our alliance extends the hand of friendship we reaffirm 
that we shall never be the first to use force against other states 
in europe and we propose a joint declaration between members of 
the alliance and member states of the warsaw pact which other csce 
states could join in in making a solemn commitment to 
nonaggression we say to president gorbachev come to nato we 
say to all the member states of the warsaw pacts come to nato 
and establish regular diplomatic liaison with the alliance 
and second the london declaration transforms the character of 
natos conventional defenses we can start and must start by 
finishing the current cfe talks this year once cfe is signed we 
would begin followon negotiations to adopt additional measures 
including measures to limit manpower in europe with this goal in 
mind a commitment will be given when the cfe treaty is signed 
concerning the manpower levels of the armed forces of a united 
germany 
we will also seek in the 90s to achieve further farreaching 
measures to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed 
forces well charge our strategy for conventional defense we 
agreed to move away from natos current strategy of forward defense 
to a reduced forward presence we agreed in addition to make the 
principle of collective defense even more evident by organizing 
nato troops into multinational corps 
and third the london declaration transforms natos nuclear 
strategy for 23 years weve had a nuclear strategy called 
flexible response developed to meet a danger of sudden 
overwhelming conventional attack as that danger recedes weve 
agreed to modify flexible response nuclear deterrence has given us 
an unprecedented period of peace and it will remain fundamental to 
an unprecedented period of peace and it will remain fundamental to 
our strategy but by reducing its reliance on nuclear weapons nato 
in the new europe will adopt a new strategy making its nuclear 
forces truly weapons of last resort 
this new strategy will require different forces weve decided 
that once negotiations begin on shortrange nuclear forces we are 
prepared to eliminate all nato nuclear artillery shells from europe 
in return for reciprocal action by the soviet union we agreed that 
this review should report its conclusions as soon as possible 
and fourth the london declaration transforms the alliances 
vision for the csce and the structure for building a europe whole 
and free we know the csce process bringing together north america 
and all of europe can provide a structure for europes continued 
political development and that means new standards for free 
elections the role of law economic liberty and environmental 
cooperation and we agreed today on six initiatives to give life to 
csces principles and realize its potential 
as you can see the london declaration will bring fundamental 
change to every aspect of the alliances work this is indeed a day 
of renewal for the atlantic community for more than 40 years weve 
looked for this day a day when we have already moved beyond 
containment with unity on continent overcoming division and now 
that day is here and all peoples from the atlantic to the urals 
from the baltic to the adriatic can share in its promise 
id be glad to take some questions helen 
q mr president with the end of the cold war the drawdown in 
forces the eventual denuclearization of europe are you now ready 
to give some economic help and with what other allies want to the 
soviet union and eastern europe so that they can get back on their 
feet as we did in world war ii with germany and japan 
a well we have given substantial help to certain countries in 
eastern europe i have had a discussion not here at nato but with 
mr gorbachev and others at different times about support for the 
soviet union we are most interested in helping them go forward 
with their reforms but there was no decision taken certainly to 
send money to the soviet union i have some big problems with that 
one i think the american people do but there are ways that we can 
assist in this transformation in this reform that is taking place 
in the soviet union 
q but youre not opposed to other countries giving it 
a no if the germans decide they want to do that thats their 
business but i have made very clear to those who have spoken to me 
about this at this juncture we have some serious problems and i 
have not been under any false colors about that at all 
terry 
q president gorbachev has imposed a twoyear deadline on 
himself and the communist leaders for reversing their countrys 
economic tailspin does your reluctance to give the soviets any 
financial aid complicate his chances for success in meeting that 
deadline 
a i hope not because as you know not only have i spoken very 
fondly and enthusiastically about what hes trying to do in terms 
of reform but i have spoken about him personally and about our 
interest in seeing him succeed and hes got some extraordinarily 
difficult problems but i dont think that our position on 
financial aid at this time should hopefully it will not 
complicate his standing he deserves support for this reform 
q do you view western aid for the soviet union now as subsidy 
for its military regime 
a well ill tell you weve got some problems that ive been 
very frank with concerning the soviets and one of them is a great 
percentage of their gnp going into the military another is some 
regional problems that perhaps are unique to the united states but 
things that concern me spending 5 billion a year in cuba for 
example to sustain a totalitarian regime that is highly critical 
of the soviet union from time to time so we have regional 
problems we have some reform probvlems that should take place 
before financial support can be given but perhaps there are ways 
that we can assist them as we go forward with credit or other 
matters before we go to direct government loans

a man demonstrating at the state capitol in 
support of nature did it au naturel 
the naked demonstrator climbed atop a wall flanking the capitol 
steps and covered it with a red and blue banner proclaiming 
natures forum 
he sat there in the rain for 20 minutes thursday until state 
police arrived with a ladder then he descended peacefully 
i thought it would be a good way to get peoples attention 
said david hughes 29 of los angeles 
its just time hughes said spiritually people need to 
come together 
his stunt didnt promote spiritual harmony with everyone 
mister i dont know what youre trying to do but defacing 
our state isnt the way shouted dustin cox 16 of salem 
im not sure it really makes a point said erin rose of 
salem i think its kind of silly when people try to draw 
attention to themselves 
but karl bien 41 of cottage grove applauded the act 
anything you have to do to bring peoples concern to the 
environment is great bien said 
state police lt bob smit said statutes against disorderly 
conduct and indecent exposure might apply against hughes who was 
taken to the oregon state hospital for up to five days of

a couple were sentenced to 10 years probation 
today for allowing their son to die while treating him with 
christian science healing methods rather than taking him to a 
doctor 
david and ginger twitchell were ordered to take their surviving 
children for regular medical checkups as a part of their 
probationary sentence for manslaughter 
weve always tried to obey the law and will try to obey 
the judges instructions twitchell said after leaving the 
courtroom well try to balance the law and the judges 
instructions with our trust in god 
suffolk superior court judge sandra hamlin rejected a 
prosecution request that the couple be automatically jailed if they 
violate any term of the probationary sentence instead if there is 
a violation a hearing would be held and punishment would be 
decided upon then 
the twitchells both 34 and lifelong christian scientists faced 
up to 20 years in prison hamlin had indicated thursday however 
that she did not believe the couple should be behind bars for the 
1986 death of their 2yearold son robyn 
the couple were found guilty of manslaughter wednesday their 
lawyer has said they would appeal 
under terms of the probation hamlin said that american medical 
association standards should be followed for checkups of the 
twitchells three surviving sons and any children they might have 
in the future if there was any sign of serious illness they were 
to take their children to a doctor 
the judge said she would continue jurisdiction of the case and 
wanted monthly probation reports 
after a twomonth trial a jury found the twitchells former 
boston residents now living in brentwood ny guilty of 
involuntary manslaughter 
the key issue in their trial is one continually debated by legal 
scholars where should the government draw the line on freedom of 
religion 
nathan talbot a spokesman for the bostonbased christian 
science church said todays sentencing was the states effort to 
impose its own view 
its an effort to reeducate christian scientists into the 
states view of what healing ought to be he said 
medical experts applauded the verdict saying it would protect 
children no religion is going to be allowed to be a defense 
against abuse and neglect said dr michael grodin a 
pediatrician and medical ethicist at boston university the 
bottom line is we have to have standards for protecting children 
but laurence tribe a constitutional law expert at harvard said 
the decision reflects a fundamental unfairness because the 
twitchells thought they were protected by a 1971 state law that 
exempted spiritual healing from child abuse statutes 
the prosecution argued that the statute which states that 
children will not be considered neglected or abused when treated 
by spiritual means alone by an accredited practitioner did 
not exempt the couple from manslaughter laws 
special prosecutor john kiernan said the case was not an attack 
on religion but sent the message that parents must protect their 
children this is not a contest between medicine and religion 
rather it is a marriage of the two he said after the sentencing 
the twitchells were found to have caused robyns death by 
relying solely on christian science spiritual healing to treat his 
fiveday illness the boy died april 8 1986 an autopsy showed he 
suffered from a bowel obstruction 
lyons the defense attorney said his planned appeal would be 
based on the judges failure to consider or instruct the jury on 
the spiritual healing exemption and for allowing a mocking and 
sarcastic trial of christian science doctrine to occur 
the twitchells were not allowed to explain their beliefs to show 
the jury they acted reasonably in response to robyns symptoms he 
said 
the trial received national attention in part because it was 
held in boston the headquarters of the christian science church 
the church has long taught that sickness and disease can be healed 
by prayer alone 
church officials have said the verdict will not deter them from 
practicing their religion and expressed hope it will be overturned 
on appeal 
since 1980 there have been seven prosecutions of christian 
science parents five have been convicted one acquitted and one 
case was thrown out according to child rights activist rita swan 
a former christian scientist who actively seeks such prosecutions

a dozen pieces of ancient roman jewelry were stolen 
from the louvre museum officials said friday it was the latest in 
a series of art thefts that has prompted an overhaul of security in 
paris museums 
the second and thirdcentury earrings bracelets and necklaces 
were discovered missing wednesday the same day a renoir was cut 
from its frame at the louvre and two other works taken from two 
small museums 
but the jewelry found missing in an inventory check ordered 
after the renoir theft was removed long before said jacques 
sallois director of the museums of france 
the disappearance of these objects which are not of great 
value and are often seen on the market is certainly quite old 
sallois said it is prior to that of the paintings 
shaken by thefts carried out in broad daylight officials have 
announced a series of measures to tighten security at paris museums 
the interior ministry is assigning a special police unit to work 
with museum security personnel systematic inventories are to be 
carried out and five small museums have been closed indefinitely 
to individual visitors 
were not going to put a war machine behind each painting or 
object but were going to study procedures types of behavior that 
can help us to tighten security sallois said 
louvre director michel laclotte said the museum would shut at 
least four rooms 
were trying to study with architects ways to seal off certain 
spaces that are too open he told reporters in a palace like 
the louvre you cant just close doors 
officials estimated the worth of the stolen jewelry at about 
910 and said that above all it had historic value 
experts said the stolen paintings a landscape and two 
portraits all small formats were considered of limited market 
value 
the most valuable of them renoirs portrait of a seated 
woman was estimated to be worth a few hundred thousand dollars 
at most a relatively small sum today for a wellknown artists 
work 
works of great value are less negotiable laclotte noted he 
declined to say whether there were suspicions the thefts were 
linked 
also stolen wednesday were an 1816 landscape painting by paul 
huet from the carnavalet museum and an 1870 portrait by ernest 
hebert from a museum named after the artist 
laclotte speaking to reporters denied that the four 
consecutive thefts amounted to a security crisis 
he said the louvre devotes 18 million of its annual budget to 
security and had the best in human and electronic sciences at its 
disposal but he said museums cannot become impregnable bastions 
all security measures are at the detriment of the art works 
laclotte said banditry is there it is international 
at least a dozen works have been stolen from french museums over 
the past year

the fbi had to search frantically to find the 
crack pipe and overlooked some of the cocaine used in the 
videotaped sting against marion barry an fbi agent testified today 
at the mayors drug and perjury trial 
fbi agent frank o steele said he found the crack pipe an hour 
and a half after barrys arrest at the vista hotel on the night of 
jan 18 
it was stuck inside an eyeglasses case that former model 
rasheeda moore had put in a dresser drawer a second crack pipe was 
found in the glasses case as well both devices had been supplied 
by the fbi to moore for the sting operation 
steeles testimony came on crossexamination by lawyers for 
barry the defense replayed segments of the fbi videotape to 
suggest ineptitude by the bureau 
steele also testified that he checked barrys coat pockets for 
the pipe the night of the arrest a week later an fbi evidence 
technician found crack cocaine from the sting in a pocket of the 
mayors coat steele said he had overlooked the pocket it was a 
small slit pocket on the inside of the garment 
seconds after barry was arrested a law enforcement officer 
agent opened the dresser drawer containing the eyeglasses case but 
closed it again without checking the fbi videotape of the sting 
showed barrys lawyers replayed the section of the tape showing 
the agent opening the drawer apparently searching for the pipe 
earlier in the day the trial judge said nation of islam 
minister louis farrakhan and imani temple bishop george stallings 
will be permitted to attend the trial as long as they observe the 
proprieties of the court 
last week us district court judge thomas penfield jackson 
refused to allow the two in as spectators saying their presence 
would be potentially disruptive and was likely to be intimidating 
he reversed himself after a court of appeals said spectators 
cannot be barred merely because they advocate a particular 
political or religious point of view farrakhan and stallings 
sought to attend the trial on passes given to barry 
stallings broke away from the washington archdiocese of the

a war on a bothersome insect called the 
ash whitefly is being broadened with squadrons of tiny stingless 
wasps from the mediterranean 
the flies have no natural enemies in california and are a 
nuisance to residents and a potential threat to the agriculture 
industry the state department of food and agriculture said they 
were first detected in california in august 1988 in los angeles 
county and have since been spotted in 17 counties and as far north 
as sacramento 
the tiny insects suck out plant juices infesting a variety of 
trees and shrubs including apple apricot citrus and pear they 
can defoliate trees and clouds of the insects have driven residents 
from their back yards 
now tiny encarsia wasps imported from israel and italy are 
being released and will be monitored to see how well they control 
the ash whiteflies 
the wasp controls the ash whitefly population by laying its eggs 
inside fly larvae after the wasps eggs hatch they eat their way 
out of the larvae killing the pest 
pesticides are not considered practical for use against the 
whitefly because the pests numbers are so large and it dwells on 
the undersides of leaves 
six southern california counties have been targeted for 
widespread release of the wasps said peter stoddard senior 
environmental research scientist with the state department of food 
and agriculture additional counties will get the wasps later this 
summer 
one of the initial sites chosen for release of the wasps was the 
fullerton arboretum on the edge of the california state university 
fullerton campus just southeast of los angeles hundreds of wasps 
were released there thursday 
wasps for future release are being reproduced at the university 
of california riverside and the rate of reproduction will 
determine how quickly other sites will receive them stoddard said 
a tiny ladybird beetle imported last year from israel also is 
being studied as a possible weapon against the fly 
california also is waging a battle against the mediterranean 
fruit fly using the pesticide malathion

a yes and then ill be over brit 
q mr president with the threat receding the way your 
communique describes do you think its inevitable that at some 
point in the next few years the europeans will decide its better 
that american troops just go home and what can you say to american 
taxpayers to convince them that its worth continuing to pay the 
bill to have them in europe 
a well i dont think the american troops will stay against the 
will of the host country i dont want to see american forces 
deployed where american forces are not wanted i dont want to see 
soviet forces deployed where soviet forces are not wanted and i 
expect the same would be true of other nationalities forces as 
well but i dont foresee that day because i think the alliance 
has spoken rather eloquently about the need for a common defense 
and all the members of the alliance are united in their view that a 
us force presence is stabilizing and very very important so i 
dont see that day looming up on the horizon 
q but do you fear that american taxpayers support for that 
continuation might be eroding 
a well i see some attacks on this and i think this nato 
declaration should help in that regard but i view it as my 
responsibility to make clear to the american taxpayer why it is in 
our interest to help keep the peace and thats exactly what these 
forces are engaged in 
yeah brit and then well go 
q mr president in light of the stress thats been placed here 
on the continued cohesion within this alliance sir would it not 
be a major breach of that cohesion if a country like west germany 
were to provide direct aid to the soviet union in light of the deep 
concerns which you have expressed about such aid from the west 
a no i dont feel thats to another member of the press 
excuse me ill be back 
i dont feel that thats a breach of alliance cohesion the 
germans have their own bilateral relationship with the soviet union 
and it doesnt concern me one bit ive not made one single effort 
to try to have the germans look differently at that question 
q mr president would it not than be possible that aid from 
our ally west germany would at least arguably or indirectly flow 
to a country like cuba 
a well if you want to say that anything that goes to the 
soviet union facilitates aid to cuba i suppose we could say the 
same about our trade but that isnt i dont think that would be 
a fair charge to make against the germans 
yes yes john excuse me 
q tonight in an interview to be broadcast in the united 
states fang lizhi the recently released chinese dissident says 
you owe him a dinner he couldnt make it to the one you threw in 
beijing and he would like to be invited to the white house for 
dinner would you do that and i have a follow up 
a well hes he is here in this country i thought he wanted 
to stay out of the public eye i thought he himself said so so 
youve got a little different information than that well just 
defer the rest of your question 
go ahead whats your follow up 
q if i can follow up if you do meet him he is going to 
complain that you have a double standard for human rights that you 
have one standard for the soviet union where you complain about 
human rights violations or have in the past at least 
pregorbachev and that you dont complain so much about human 
rights violations youre not as tough with the chinese he 
complains about sending brent scowcroft and larry eagleburger at 
cetera what would you say to him 
a id say that hes wrong hes got a little time warp here 
because we spoke out at the nato meeting indeed i think we took 
the lead at the last at a meeting in europe i guess it was the 
g7 meeting not nato where we took the lead in expressing our 
joint indignation in terms of the abuses of human rights at 
tiananmen square weve kept certain sanctions on china i am 
heartened that fang lizhi is free and free now to say whats on 
his mind like this so i would i would say that if he feels that 
way hes simply not expressing the facts as they are i dont 
agree with that i notice some of my critics in the united states 
congress say that and i think they are just as wrong as they can 
be 
yes lesley 
q mr president whoops back to the declaration you are 
inviting the warsaw pact countries to come to nato as observers 
what if they want to become members of nato hungary for 
instance or even poland are you saying by inviting them to 
just be observers that you do not look favorably on them 
becoming full members 
a i am saying nato views this as an open invitation and who 
knows what will happen in terms of membership down the line thats 
not in the cards right this minute we are just coming out of a 
adversarial environment varying i think there is varying degrees 
of enthusiasm for what you are talking about amongst the members of 
the warsaw pact at this juncture so id say its premature 
q well would you oppose would you oppose any country for 
instance hungary becoming a member of nato 
a not forever but at this juncture i support the nato 
doctrine 
q mr president in your communique you talk about nuclear 
weapons becoming truly weapons of last resort you say the 
fundamental strategy of the alliance is being transformed there as 
part of this review are considering going back home and taking 
another look at some of the strategic nuclear modernization 
programs that you have supported looking at some of the very 
expensive weapons programs that some say should be a bonus a part 
of the peace dividend 
a not as a result of anything thats transpired here in nato 
no we are interested in strategic arms agreements with the 
soviets the soviets as we all know have indeed modernized their 
forces we are on the horns of a dilemma in that question you 
might say because we have not to the degree they have but that 
was not a consideration here at nato nor has anything transpired 
here that will make me go home with a different approach to 
strategic arms 
q will you proceed if i may follow up sir youll proceed 
across the board with strategic modernization your commitment to 
that 
a i will proceed yeah i will proceed in negotiating with the 
soviet soviets to achieve a strategic arms agreement 
yes sir 
q mr president how much did the threats to perestroika and 
reforms in the soviet union play in the changes youve announced 
today in nato 
a you mean is whats going on at the congress none in my 
view i mean i think this i think whats contributed to the nato 
the changes in our approach nato are the changes that have 
taken place particularly since our last meeting in terms of 
eastern europe and in terms of the soviets willingness to withdraw 
forces hopefully through a cfe agreement so i dont think that 
i dont think anything was short that there was shortterm 
thinking as a result of the debates that are going on in moscow 
this very day 
q well if i could follow up then what kind of message do the 
changes announced today send to gorbachev

police arrested five people this morning as 
the city began enforcing a ban on sleeping in parks in an effort to 
empty a downtown plaza where more than 200 people have camped out 
for two years 
authorities said keith mchenry an activist who is one of the 
most vocal critics of the homeless removal plan was arrested 
before 6 am after about 20 officers began clearing the 
treeshaded civic center plaza four other people all 
unidentified were arrested later 
police encountered no violence sgt john goldberg said 
as an alternative to arrest for violating the public sleeping 
ban police offered vouchers for admittance to two new city 
shelters 
thursday evening a group of 50 activists and homeless people at 
the civic center decided to accept the citys offer the group 
noisily marched seven blocks to one of two new shelters where a 
worker told them all the rooms were filled 
city officials said the homeless could obtain vouchers for free 
shelter elsewhere but the group returned to the plaza a park 
surrounded by mostly government buildings 
theres no room said a homeless woman lima rashida we 
have no place to go but back to the civic center 
police had been under orders to begin making arrests at 
midnight but after the homeless marchers were faced with no 
shelter space officers on the scene did not immediately intervene 
of the five people arrested later in the morning three were 
booked on misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and interfering 
with police and mchenry and one other person was cited with 
illegal distribution of food police said 
the march came after a peaceful candlelight vigil mourning the 
death of mitch snyder a homeless activist in washington dc who 
was found hanged thursday in what police said was an apparent 
suicide 
the homeless people in the plaza said they paid for a red white 
and blue wreath by selling jewelry and other personal items 
police capt dennis martel said the plaza transients dont 
have the option to stay here anymore we are encouraging them to go 
to the shelters were handling this in a sensible humane 
fashion 
all this week vouchers for rooms have been handed out but many 
of those living in the park expressed no interest 
im safer in this park than in one of those hotline rooms 
said a woman who identified herself as jack howard she pledged to 
stay in the plaza until police begin moving the homeless out 
the hotline rooms are hotel rooms the city has available 
howard says occupants are often bothered by crack dealers rats and 
mice 
as a woman howard does not have access to the two maleonly 
multiservice shelters the city took over this week 
the shelters operated for the city by church groups combine 
shelter with such services as drug and alcohol treatment and job 
counseling 
we have to have compassion because a lot of these people have 
had a lot of misfortune in their lives said police officer harry 
soulette as he walked around the plaza we want to help them 
being turned away from the shelter reinforced what homeless 
activists have said since the plan was revealed by mayor art agnos 
that the city simply doesnt have enough beds 
homeless advocates also charge that the cleanup program 
forced 215 people already staying in one of the two shelters out on 
the streets to make way for the displaced civic center homeless 
in protest the coalition on homelessness said it plans to 
flood the system bringing in homeless people from other areas 
to the civic center to overwhelm the new shelters said a group 
leader josh brandon 
the citys plan unfairly targets the homeless at the civic 
center while others throughout the city desire shelter as well he 
said 
we simply want to give people who want to get off the streets 
the opportunity to get off the streets brandon said

the federal judge who presided over 
courtmandated efforts to desegregate pulaski county public schools 
for eight years stepped down friday 
in an order in which he announced his decision to leave the 
case us district judge henry woods lamented the plight of black 
students in the county and criticized the federal appeals court for 
stifling his orders 
woods 72 said he was leaving because he was unable to 
successfully implement a plan to bring educational equity to the 
children of the county under the restrictions imposed by the 
appeals court 
perhaps the application of a fresh mind and the perspective of 
another judge can find hope in a situation which i perceive as 
hopeless he said 
woods will continue to hear his full slate of cases 
it has been my intention to oversee a progressive educational 
plan to serve the children of these districts into the 21st 
century such a plan would bring peace to a community long plagued 
with a worldwide reputation for racial problems in its public 
schools woods said however i have steadfastly resisted the 
notion of peaceatanyprice 
woods decision follows a ruling monday by a threejudge panel 
of the 8th us circuit of appeals ordering the release of portions 
of the 129 million settlement of the states liability in the case 
woods presided over the case involving a federal suit filed in 
1982 by the little rock school district against the pulaski county 
and north little rock districts and the state department of 
education the little rock district sought consolidation with the 
other districts in the county to achieve racial balance 
woods criticized mondays order noting that the three pulaski 
county districts have maintained that they are not required to 
spend the money solely for desegregation purposes he said the 
districts will have received and spent tens of millions of 
dollars by the time the full order of the court is issued in the 
fall 
the district court will be left trying to implement a 
longterm desegregation plan yet to be announced with 
insufficient funds remaining to implement any meaningful plan he 
said 
the appeals court this week also hinted it would limit the 
metropolitan supervisors post the office woods set up to direct 
the districts desegregation efforts to merely monitoring those 
efforts

a court awarded the flamboyant daughter of former 
soviet leader leonid i brezhnev a luxury car country house and 
thousands of dollars in cash and collections that were confiscated 
from her husband a newspaper said friday 
the court said the cash and valuables rightly belonged to galina 
brezhnev and not to her husband yuri d churbanov who was 
convicted in december 1988 of accepting bribes he was sentenced to 
12 years in a labor camp and had his property confiscated 
ms brezhnev herself has been accused in soviet news accounts of 
speculating in diamonds and has been linked to a bribery scandal 
involving a gypsy performer in the moscow circus 
she often was seen driving the mercedes car of her father who 
died in 1982 through the streets of moscow 
the case was banal the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper 
quoted the moscow district judge as saying there were no 
telephone calls or threats nothing that could sway the trial 
if it were not for the loud name of the plaintiff i wouldnt 
even remember the case he was quoted as saying under the law 
galina brezhnev was within her rights since most of the property 
belonged to her and not her husband and the supreme court had no 
right after sentencing yuri churbanov to confiscate it 
the newspaper did not identify the judge 
it said the court had ordered the government to return a country 
house worth 108474 a mercedes car given to her father by an 
unidentified foreign government furniture and chandeliers a 
collection of weapons worth 200000 stuffed and mounted animals 
valued at 137011 and 111000 in savings 
churbanov was fired from his job as first deputy interior 
minister in 1984 and tried in 1988 he was widely believed to have 
been given the job because of his marriage to brezhnevs daughter 
brezhnev ruled the soviet union from 1964 until his death and 
now is widely blamed for allowing the country to slide into 
stagnation

communist north korea on friday 
offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote 
unification with south korea but its capitalist rival dismissed 
the gesture as insignificant 
the communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two 
nations prepared to hold historic talks perhaps as early as august 
north korea announced it would open the northern sector of 
panmunjom a border village on aug 15 according to naewoe press 
a semiofficial south korean news agency that specializes in 
communist affairs 
north korea said the opening about 800 yards long and 500 yards 
wide was aimed at promoting unification of the korean peninsula 
and urged south korea to do the same according to naewoe 
for successful progress of contact and visits between the 
north and the south we will open the portion of our side and 
hope that the south side will take a corresponding measure the 
agency quoted the communist government as saying 
the opening however would not permit foreigners to travel 
inland past the perimeter of panmunjom a truce village that 
straddles part of the 155mile border between the two koreas 
the village is jointly controlled by north korea and a united 
nations command comprising the united states and 15 other 
countries that fought with south korea in the 195053 korean war 
no civilians may enter the area from either side without approval 
south koreas defense ministry said it had not been officially 
notified of the norths plans and would not comment on whether 
anyone would be allowed to cross the border 
but a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that 
north koreas move was insignificant because it affected only a 
small restricted section of the heavily fortified border 
other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in 
south korea where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with 
their communist neighbors 
the south korean opposition welcomed the announcement 
dissidents asked seoul to allow 300 people to meet with north 
koreans at the border village aug 15 the day in 1945 that korea 
was freed from japanese colonial rule 
but a spokesman for south koreas umbrella dissident group 
chonminyon said the seoul response had been negative the south 
korean government bans unauthorized border talks with north korea 
after a fivemonth suspension south korean and north korean 
officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline 
terms for the first talks between their prime ministers 
on tuesday the koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime 
ministers meeting possibly in august in seoul they agreed to 
adopt a formal accord july 26 
talks have been held sporadically between the two koreas but 
little progress had been made until recently the border on both 
sides is heavily fortified and sealed blocking exchanges of mail 
and transportation 
north korea is one of the last totalitarian communist states 
and sweeping changes in eastern europe and its socialist allies 
have made little impact 
the two koreas are still technically at war no peace treaty has 
been signed since the threeyear korean war ended in 1953

motorists in southern california who run 
errands or commute alone during rush hour should be penalized 
financially a smogreduction task force recommended 
over 70 percent of our air pollution problem is caused by 
mobile sources said judy wright who led the group set up by the 
southern california association of governments 
there arent many more smokestacks to go after so we have to 
go after the mobile sources 
wright suggested that one way to penalize motorists would be 
through extra fees on a toll road or bridge if the driver is alone 
in the car 
stickers would show whether a vehicle was authorized to be on 
the road during specific hours the driver could be fined if found 
driving during unauthorized times she said 
the task force suggested test projects in western san bernardino 
county which has many homes and relatively few jobs and in los 
angeles countys south bay area which has lots of jobs but few 
homes both areas are besieged by commuter traffic 
the association set up the task force last year after another 
agency the south coast air quality management district issued a 
longterm plan for cutting smog 
the recommendations wont go into effect for at least a year and 
perhaps longer said association spokesman mario guerra 
we probably wont see a lot happening for a while but the 
proposals are important because they recognize that driving is a 
right not a responsibility and people need to realize that

the nations unemployment rate edged downward 
to 52 percent last month despite an ongoing slide in manufacturing 
and overall weakness in job growth the government reported friday 
fewer americans looking for work not any rebound in sluggish 
economic activity accounted for the improvement over mays 
jobless rate of 53 percent analysts said 
its not that more people are getting jobs fewer guys are 
looking said elliott platt an economist with donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette securities corp of new york 
the economy added just 40000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in june 
the labor department said 
however that figure would be closer to 97000 if the temporary 
census workers the federal government laid off in june were not 
included in the count the agency said 
for the first six months of 1990 private sector businesses have 
been adding about 110000 jobs a month or about half the 220000 
average jobs gain for the same period last year the government 
said 
theres no real zip in this economy but you dont have the 
combination of recessionary forces to drag it into negative 
territory either platt said 
the reports evidence of continued softness at a time when 
unemployment is still relatively low provides a puzzling picture 
for the federal reserve which has been under pressure to lower 
interest rates analysts said 
the fed is in a quandary now from the job creation side its 
a clear case for the fed to ease but with unemployment so low 
its a very tough call said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co 
sinai said junes job growth figures demonstrate that the 
economy is as close to a recession configuration as we can get 
without being in one 
revised figures for may showed that about 155000 new jobs were 
added that month excluding census workers up from the original 
report of just 19000 jobs the labor department said 
unemployment has been fluctuating within a tenth of a percentage 
point of 53 percent for more than a year after hitting a 15year 
low of 5 percent in march 1989 
the rate has managed to stay relatively low despite weak job 
growth because smaller numbers of americans are entering the labor 
force said janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor 
statistics 
so far this year only about 290000 americans have entered the 
work force compared with the 15 million americans who joined the 
labor force during the first half of 1989 mrs norwood said the 
labor force is defined as americans who are working or actively 
seeking jobs 
the nations manufacturing sector which has been on a downward 
spiral for months continued its slide in june as factory payrolls 
fell by 31000 jobs it was the 14th time in 15 months that 
manufacturing jobs declined 
since reaching a postrecession peak in march 1989 about 
335000 factory jobs have been lost 
the number of construction jobs fell in june for the fourth 
month in a row reflecting continued weakness in the housing 
market the government said construction payrolls after seasonal 
adjustment dropped 14000 
meanwhile the service sector which has been providing most of 
the economys steam over the past several months added 83000 
jobs including 40000 in the health services industry 
retail trade businesses lost 7000 jobs in june bringing the 
monthly increases in the first half of this year in that sector to 
15000 half the average for 1989 
general merchandise stores have been particularly hard hit in 
that sector losing 50000 jobs over the past year mrs norwood 
said 
the number of discouraged workers people who want a job but 
have given up looking averaged about 900000 for the april to may 
period an increase of nearly 150000 over the first quarter of 
1990 the agency said 
that increase brought the number of discouraged workers to its 
highest level since the end of 1988 
labor costs which have been pushing up and are being blamed for 
fueling the nations inflation problems continued to increase 
average hourly earnings posted a 03 percent rise in june to 
1001 up from the 998 the average worker earned per hour in may 
the average manufacturing work week was unchanged from may at 
410 hours manufacturing overtime held at 38 hours in june 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the june jobless 
rate was 51 percent down from 53 percent in may and the same as 
junes civilian rate

like the grubby beggars on the streets 
thrusting out their plastic coffee cups mitch snyder was a goad 
unlike them he would not be brushed aside 
he made the destitute of this city visible he got a roof over 
their heads 
he could be a nuisance he could exasperate the city and the 
citizenry he drove critics and allies to distraction by an 
insistent demand that the homeless be accorded the respect due 
humankind 
now that he is dead it dawned on washington washington the 
community not washington the world capital what he meant to this 
city 
the dispossessed will have to fend for themselves and so will 
the possessed the goad is gone it will be up to people to see the 
helpless poor without him 
by common estimate 15000 homeless people live on the streets 
and grates of washington 
one of snyders triumphs was the enactment of a 1984 law by 
the citizens in an initiative over the objections of officialdom 
compelling the city to guarantee them an indoor place to spend 
the night 
of that number 1200 found a spot in the shelter that snyder 
in his guerrilla warfare wrestled from ronald reagan in 1984 
he did that by fasting for 51 days snyder looked then like he 
was nearly dead cbs cameras were about to capture the showdown for 
60 minutes the presidential election was two days off 
reagan capitulated and gave snyders outfit the community for 
creative nonviolence a tumbledown federal building a few blocks 
from the capitol for use as a shelter and 6 million to 
rehabilitate it 
rep e clay shaw rfla didnt like the show boating he 
called snyder a masochist who influences government by 
threatening to starve himself 
snyder had a genius for attracting attention but no one ever 
accused him of capitalizing on the poor he hobnobbed with 
celebrities coming to their parties in the wrinkled clothes given 
to the shelter he always needed a shave 
he held public funerals for homeless people who died on the 
streets in the cold he scavenged through dumpsters with members of 
congress once he got movie stars to spend a night sleeping on the 
street he got cher to dish out the mashed potatoes at christmas 
dinner at the shelter 
he got the navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear submarine 
corpus christi after the city in texas he said no warship should 
bear the name the body of christ and the navy changed it to 
the uss city of corpus christi that fast lasted only 11 days 
but angry scornful confrontational mitch snyder had failures 
too he walked out of a middleclass marriage leaving behind in 
new york city two small children and forcing his wife onto welfare 
he said he could not spend his life selling electrolux vacuum 
cleaners and maytag washing machines 
eleven days ago snyder suffered his greatest defeat he could 
not keep the city council from voting to gut the homeless shelter 
law or slashing spending on the destitute 
the change awaiting mayor marion barrys signature would 
require homeless people to go though a screening process before 
being approved for shelter 
washington has accustomed itself to the sight of people sleeping 
on the streets the outrage and passion have diminished 
there were suggestions that difficulties with carol fennelly 
snyders companion for 15 years led him to take his life 
in his room at the shelter where he hanged himself snyder left 
behind a note discussing his failed love relationship with ms 
fennelly police sources said he was 46 
maybe he was a victim of that disease of the upwardly mobile 
burnout he had been at it for 17 years

gov buddy roemer kept his word today 
and vetoed a tough antiabortion bill but held off delivering his 
veto message to the legislature an administration attorney said 
roemer can hold on to the veto message for two days after 
signing it said john kennedy a special counsel to the governor 
if the legislators dont get the veto message until sunday they 
would have only the rest of the day sunday and all day monday to 
consider it before they must adjourn for the year at midnight 
monday 
were not ready to deliver the message just yet said 
kennedy 
throughout the legislative session that began in april roemer 
had said he would veto an abortion bill that didnt make exceptions 
for victims of rape or incest 
the bill eventually passed by the legislature contained no such 
exceptions and would send abortionists to prison for up to 10 
years it allows abortions only to save the life of the mother 
roemers decision not to immediately issue the veto message left 
open the question of when antiabortion supporters would be able to 
attempt an override house and senate leaders were waiting for the 
veto message to schedule debates on an override attempt it takes a 
twothirds vote in each chamber 26 of 39 senators and 70 of 105 
representatives to override a veto 
no louisiana governors veto has been overridden this century 
rep woody jenkins a key backer of the bill had said thursday 
that he planned to ask the house to debate and vote on an override 
on saturday assuming the veto message was received in time to do 
so 
should the house vote to override saturday jenkins had said he 
would then want the senate to take up the issue sunday or monday 
roemer has said during the past week that he would give 
lawmakers ample time to consider and vote on an override

boris n yeltsin warned communist party 
traditionalists friday that the price of their intransigence will 
be nationalization of party property and demands that they stand 
trial for ruining soviet society 
yeltsin brought the wave of public indignation that propelled 
him to the presidency of the huge russian republic to the fifth day 
of the 28th communist party congress at the kremlins palace of 
congresses 
reformers got their chance to fight back against the communist 
traditionalists who dominated the first week of the congress and 
blamed mikhail s gorbachev for the partys loss of popularity and 
ideological drift 
it is an illusion to think that after all dissenters all who 
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus quit the 
party it will retain all the property of the soviet communist 
party and the associated authority he said 
it will not be so if this is the case the people will 
start struggling for the full nationalization of the property of 
the party yeltsin said the party will be bankrupt obliged to 
repay its debts to the people if only with its property 
an effort might be made to prosecute party leaders at every 
level for the damage they personally have inflicted on the party 
and the people he said 
yeltsins warning was a prediction of a day of reckoning for the 
communist party which nationalized property and violently 
repressed its enemies when it seized power under lenin in 1917 
gorbachev a frequent target of yeltsins populist demands for 
quicker and more comprehensive reform was unimpressed by his 
speech i expected more he told reporters in a stroll outside 
the congress hall 
delegate yuri boldyrev of leningrad had urged the 
nationalization of party property on the first day of the congress 
party officials estimate the value of the property at 82 billion 
leaders of democratic platform a radical group that has 
declared its intention to split from the party say one of the key 
tactical questions is how to lay a claim to some of the partys 
vast holdings of newspapers the best buildings in cities all 
around the country a huge fleet of cars and bank accounts 
yeltsin warned that soviet communists are blindly following 
their eastern european comrades down the road to oblivion 
if you think there is a different possibility look at the 
fate of the communist parties of eastern europe they separated 
themselves from the people didnt understand their role and were 
left on the side of the road he said 
the only way out he said is for the communist party to fully 
accept all the trappings of the multiparty system that party 
leaders endorsed earlier this year 
yeltsin read rapidly and with little emotion from a prepared 
text more than 4600 delegates in the congress hall listened 
intently but reflecting the traditionalist mood of the congress 
gave him only a smattering of applause 
backing up yeltsins warning a leader of the democratic 
platform reform group and an actor who is an outspoken supporter of 
gorbachev also took the floor 
vyacheslav shostakovsky rector of moscows higher party school 
urged the party to abandon its stifling ideology 
no ideological cow will give us milk or meat he said 
actor mikhail ulyanov accused traditionalminded communists of 
trying to return to decades of repression 
hardly had our people begun to straighten up when voices rang 
out blaming gorbachev for letting the reins slip from his grasp 
for allowing the country to be plunged into chaos and anarchy and 
for the collapse of socialist ideals he said 
deep in their minds however theyre thinking how to return 
to the iron fist regular columns and uniformity he charged 
alexei sergeyev a leader of an orthodox communist movement 
formed in leningrad accused democratic platform of being openly 
procapitalist and charged that the soviet governments economic 
program resembles its approach 
yeltsin has said he is ready to suspend his party membership if 
the party does not seriously reform itself at the congress 
walking out of the congress hall after his speech the 
59yearold populist predicted democratic platform will leave the 
party and join an alliance of more democraticminded political 
parties 
at a news conference democratic platform leaders said they 
would found their own party at a gathering this fall

the bush administration said friday it is 
planning to enhance current seafood inspections with a voluntary 
program paid for by companies whose products could earn an official 
government seal 
the new program would use industry controls and government 
inspections to provide additional assurances to consumers that 
fish and fish products are safe wholesome and properly labeled 
officials said 
the program was proposed by the food and drug administration and 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the fda has a seafood inspection program that requires 
examinations of processors shippers packers and repackers 
labelers warehouses and importers of fish and fish products that 
program would continue separately 
noaas national marine fisheries service runs a voluntary 
feeforservice seafood inspection program which uses a government 
inspection mark that program would continue to provide grading 
services but continuation of other parts of the program would 
depend on the extent to which companies switch to the new system 
officials said 
the new plan would be based on inspections at various critical 
points at which health risks such as spoilage and bacterial 
growth can be controlled the fda said companies would pay a fee 
for inspections and could earn an official mark or seal they could 
display on their products label 
the fda said a twomonth pilot study is scheduled to begin oct 
1 to identify problems industry and government might have in 
implementing such a system the agencies are looking for industry 
volunteers for the study 
public voice for food and health policy a consumer group 
criticized the plans saying the government should instead 
strengthen its mandatory inspection system 
its like putting a bandaid on a festering sore said ellen 
haas executive director of the group 
its a totally inadequate response to a serious public health 
problem she said what consumers need is not a voluntary 
program paid for by those fish companies that chose to participate 
but a mandatory healthbased inspection program such as ones being 
considered in congress

s 
london ap the nato allies pledged friday to sharply reduce 
both nuclear and conventional defenses in europe extending the 
hand of friendship to mikhail s gorbachev and the rest of 
eastern europe 
solemnly president bush and his 15 western alliance partners 
assured the soviet leader who is under attack from left and right 
at the 28th communist party congress in moscow that they hold no 
aggressive intentions and will never in any circumstance be the 
first to use force 
in moscow gorbachev said he was ready to accept the leaders 
invitation to address a meeting of the western alliance probably 
in december and soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said we welcome the results of the nato session 
but gorbachev could take little comfort from bushs comment that 
he had big problems with the idea of direct western economic 
aid to the soviet union a subject likely to dominate the houston 
economic summit where bush and many of the other western leaders 
were flying after the nato meeting 
in london the allies agreed to shrink their arsenal of 
battlefield nuclear weapons in tandem with soviet action and 
relegate them to highly unlikely lastresort use 
they also said in their windup communique that once 
negotiations begin on shortrange nuclear forces the alliance will 
propose in return for reciprocal action by the soviet union the 
elimination of all its nuclear artillery shells from europe 
they also decided to field smaller and restructured ground 
forces in the newest sign that natos 40year job of containing 
potential sovietbloc aggression was nearing a successful end 
one shift in nato doctrine away from a quartercentury threat 
to use nuclear weapons promptly if attacked drew most of the 
notice more subtle but also significant was the decision to 
abandon the strategy of massing troops up against the eastwest 
frontier switching to smaller mobile units further back 
allied leaders will have maximum flexibility in deciding how 
to respond to a crisis the communique said 
and in a surprise move designed to allay one of gorbachevs 
deepest concerns the nato allies agreed to set a limit on the size 
of germanys military forces that could mean a cut of more than 
160000 soldiers from the combined troops of east and west germany 
after merger 
however despite gorbachevs stillunsuccessful effort to pump 
life into the soviet economy bush distanced himself from a plan 
devised by west germany and france to provide moscow with a 
bountiful package of direct financial assistance that could run 
into billions of dollars 
i have big problems with that one bush said i think the 
american people do because of the soviet unions financial 
support of cuba and because of its military spending at home but 
the president said he would consider credits or technical help for 
the soviets 
the economic summit next week bringing together leaders from 
the seven richest democracies in the world will have gorbachevs 
economic restructuring program at the top of the agenda 
bush said he hoped his resistance to direct us assistance 
would not impede gorbachev who this week gave himself a twoyear 
deadline to succeed 
i have spoken very fondly and enthusiastically about what hes 
trying to do in terms of reform bush said at a news conference 
after the allied leaders adopted their historymaking declaration 
on a transformed north atlantic alliance 
the documents many concessions to moscow which won support 
even from cautious british prime minister margaret thatcher 
reflected a joint judgment that the soviet union has embarked on 
the long journey to a free society 
together the allies offered a pledge of nonaggression to each 
of the seven members of the warsaw pact one of the innovative 
decisions taken at the summit was to establish liaisons to those 
that wish to establish closer political links to western europe 
the gesture seemed tailored to hungary czechoslovakia and 
poland all of which have adopted democratic governments while 
maintaining tenuous ties to moscow 
the london declaration transforms our relationship with old 
adversaries bush said to those governments who confronted us 
in the cold war our alliance extends the hand of friendship 
the communique also used the hand of friendship phrase 
even so hundreds of shortrange nuclear weapons will remain in 
natos arsenal the purpose mrs thatcher said at a separate news 
conference is that anyone who wanted to cross our borders could 
never be certain that nuclear weapons could not be used against 
him 
bush is planning the production of new airtosurface nuclear 
missiles and sealaunched us cruise missiles are taking over the 
mission of nucleartipped artillery shells that will be withdrawn 
as soviet troops and tanks leave eastern and central europe 
and french president francois mitterrand told reporters that his 
country had no intention of reducing its sizable nuclear arsenal 
until the soviet union and the united states take such steps 
when others have disarmed those countries with enormous 
superiority with regard to weaponry then we will mitterrand 
said its as simple as that 
the united states is in the midst of negotiations with the 
soviet union to cut longrange missiles bombers and submarines 
separate talks between nato and the warsaw pact in vienna are aimed 
at reducing us and soviet troops and such nonnuclear arms as 
tanks and helicopters by the end of the year 
bush said he would be in touch with gorbachev over the next few 
weeks they ought not to view nato as a threat and certainly 
ought not to view it as a roadblock to progress in arms control or 
withdrawal of conventional forces or whatever it might be the 
president said

another atlanta date in fulton county superior court 
joels former manager and onetime brotherinlaw frank weber 
filed an 11 million lawsuit against the rock star claiming breach 
of contract in his firing 
joel sued weber in september for 90 million claiming weber 
used the entertainers money for interestfree loans signed joels 
name to documents without consent and put the singers money in 
highrisk investments despite instructions to invest conservatively 
webers suit filed tuesday contends joel dismissed the manager 
without cause and that weber is entitled to 20 percent of joels 
gross income because frank management planned the singers atlanta 
tour 
daniel a gecker an attorney representing weber said he chose 
to sue in atlanta because the atlanta docket moves a lot faster 
than the new york courts do 
a similar lawsuit was dismissed in richmond earlier this year 
for lack of jurisdiction he said 
jane sanders a new york attorney representing joel said we 
view it as harassing tactics and a way to find a another judge to

nato leaders promised friday to spell out by 
autumn plans for massive german troop cuts in a move hailed by 
chancellor helmut kohl as an indispensable signpost on the path 
to german unification 
the allied leaders agreement to set such a timetable as part of 
the summitending communique was another dramatic effort to allay 
soviet anxieties about the looming merger of two germanys 
kohl the chancellor of west germany also urged the withdrawal 
of shortrange us missiles from his country 
the communique included a commitment to come up with a troop 
level for a unified germany by fall those force levels will in 
turn become part of a new round of negotiations with the soviets on 
reducing overall troop levels of both alliances 
bonns defense minister gerhard stoltenberg has agreed to cut 
more than 160000 from the current combined forces of west and east 
germany down to 400000 foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
has said an even greater cut to 350000 troops is acceptable 
kohl will discuss it during a july 15 visit to moscow in an 
attempt to clear away soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
objections to nato membership for the country expected to emerge 
later this year 
the soviets who still mourn their more than 20 million dead in 
world war ii fear a united german military in central europe 
but kohl while insisting on nato membership for a unified 
germany will point to the changes adopted at the twoday summit 
aimed at making the alliance less threatening to the kremlin 
the democratically elected governments in czechoslovakia poland 
and hungary in fact would prefer keeping the mammoth new german 
state with nearly 80 million people embedded in the western 
alliance kohl said 
for many people having a strong nato roof over germany is 
better than isolation he told reporters in london 
this is a wideranging offer said kohl of natos new 
stance this is nato offering a hand 
kohl called the commitment an indispensable signpost along the 
path leading to german unity 
seeking to appease west germans who for years have chafed 
against nuclear missiles in their country kohl also called for the 
removal of 700 aging american shortrange nuclear missiles from his 
territory 
the lance missiles are only capable of hitting neighboring 
czechoslovakia and east germany both of which have undergone major 
prodemocracy reforms 
only a few months ago kohl secured a us promise not to 
replace the missiles which will become technically obsolete by 
1995 anyway 
the united states is also removing mediumrange nuclear missiles 
from west germany and is willing to talk with the soviets about 
ridding europe of nucleartipped artillery shells most of the 
1470 american shells are in west germany 
nonetheless the chancellor urged the americans to keep some 
forces in europe or as he put it to maintain an apartment in 
the european house 
kohl lavished praise on president george bush saying the us 
president has a clear view of the changes in europe the 
chemistry is right between both men he said

mikhail s gorbachev indicated friday he would 
accept an invitation to visit nato headquarters and a foreign 
ministry spokesman said the alliance summit had bolstered the 
soviet leaders position at home 
gorbachev speaking during a break in the communist party 
congress said he had not received a formal invitation yet but i 
am always ready to go 
nato leaders ending talks in london friday approved a 
statement that proposed a mutual nonaggression pact with the 
soviet union and extended the unprecedented invitation to gorbachev 
and other warsaw pact leaders 
leaders of the rival alliance were invited to visit north 
atlantic treaty organization headquarters in brussels belgium 
probably in december 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said in moscow 
the soviet union welcomed the summit conclusions as a practical 
step toward reexamining the philosophy of confrontation in 
europe 
he said the session helps gorbachevs position in the soviet 
union 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in a statement 
carried by the official news agency tass that the nato summits 
decisions were realistic and constructive 
the decisions adopted move in the right direction and pave the 
way to a safe future for the entire european continent he said 
he welcomed natos appeal for a joint declaration with the 
warsaw pact saying the two sides are no longer opponents and 
pledging to refrain from the threat or use of force 
gerasimov said natos moves away from military confrontation 
were an answer to soviet officers who have complained recently that 
the countrys foreign policy under gorbachev has consisted mainly 
of concessions 
the results of the nato session show that our good example 
brings answering steps from nato he said 
valentin falin a top party official for foreign affairs was 
less enthusiastic he told reporters that nato was mainly at the 
stage of making promises hinging on future soviet behavior 
you cant build a house out of ifs he said adding that 
nonetheless the nato communique was a sign of progress 
on thursday several military officers speaking at section 
meetings during the communist party congress blasted gorbachevs 
foreign policy for weakening the countrys defenses and letting 
eastern europe slip away 
major gen ivan nikulin chief political officer of the soviet 
unions southern army group warned that the soviet union was 
allowing an upset in the military balance of europe 
he rejected gorbachevs idea of a common european home as a 
myth and warned that onesided soviet concessions would lead 
to the soviet union being pushed out of europe instead of joined 
with it 
the successes of soviet diplomacy on the international scene 
were mostly due to its ability to give in the interfax news 
service quoted one of gorbachevs critics as saying 
falin said the officers opinions dont reflect the opinion of 
the majority of the armed forces and naturally dont play a 
definitive role in the formulation of the practical actions of the 
defense ministry 
gerasimov formally announced that natos secretarygeneral 
manfred woerner would come to moscow on july 14 to continue the 
london forum 
gorbachev reportedly appealed for economic aid in a letter to 
british prime minister margaret thatcher at the nato meeting 
ivan k polozkov head of the russian republics communist 
party told reporters he backed the idea of western aid for the 
ailing soviet economy 
i think we have no basis to refuse aid if its proposed 
said polozkov considered a leading hardliner in the party 
falin asked if he was worried the soviet unions image would be 
tarnished if it accepted western aid said he was not concerned 
i think not one pearl will fall from our crown if we take the 
hand held out to us he said 
the issue of western economic aid to the soviet union was not 
resolved at the london meeting and is expected to be tackled at an 
economic summit of seven major industrial democracies that opens in 
houston on monday

traditionally at international gatherings theres 
not much love lost between french president francois mitterrand and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
but at the nato summit nuclear weapons brought them together 
both jealously guarding domestic arsenals and both uneasy about the 
alliances decision to rely on the armaments only as a last 
resort 
mrs thatcher had qualms but she went along with the decision 
announced at the end of a twoday summit friday saying it was 
acceptable because nato kept the option of using nuclear weapons 
but mitterrand remained flatly opposed he said the last resort 
concept seems to me to be totally contradictory to french 
strategy which is not to take the initiative to use force but to 
bring out whatever force is necessary when appropriate 
great britain and france had similar positions he said 
adding that mrs thatcher voted in favor of the strategy switch 
while he voted against it both because of strategic differences 
of opinion and because we are not part of the command 
frances withdrawal of its forces from the nato joint military 
command in 1966 is a sore point with mrs thatcher and is usually 
good for a british jibe 
instead at her endofsummit news conference friday she merely 
noted wistfully that french forces remained outside the nato 
command the position wouldnt change and we accept it she 
said 
then she launched into lavish praise of france for she said 
persuading west germany to deploy us nuclear missiles in the 
early 1980s 
the fact that she france had a slightly different position 
in nato was used to advantage and she was able to do a certain 
amount of persuasion which may continue to be very helpful in 
the future said mrs thatcher 
it was a far cry from frequent testiness between the british 
conservative party leader and the french socialist 
they met again at the nato summit fresh from their latest spat 
at a meeting of the leaders of the 12nation european community in 
dublin ireland 10 days ago 
in dublin mrs thatcher played a prime role in getting a 
frenchwest german proposal for an immediate 15 billion in soviet 
aid sidelined 
she and mitterrand also renewed exchanges over what he sees as 
her constant efforts to put the brake on european unity and what 
she sees as grandiose rhetoric from a country as eager to preserve 
its national identity as anyone else 
mitterrand said mrs thatcher was isolated in dublin although 
she got her way on the soviet aid proposal 
mrs thatcher brushed this aside when reporters asked her about 
reported crusty exchanges in closed session she said ah yes 
president mitterrand we usually have something 
in london they found they had a lot in common after the 
centuriesold shared history of friendship and rivalry the two 
former colonial powers now share a status as the only nations in 
western europe with their own nuclear arsenals 
and the two leaders share a wariness about letting down their 
military guard 
said mitterrand of natos offer to eastern european countries of 
a commitment to nonaggression we will follow the political line 
but not the strategic line

the agriculture department said friday it is 
seeking an alternative way of setting minimum prices paid dairy 
farmers under federal marketing orders 
the department currently uses a base known as the 
minnesotawisconsin or mw price an average of prices paid to 
farmers in the twostate area for grade b milk used only for 
manufacturing products such as cheese butter and nonfat dry milk 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said the mw base price has been used since the 
early 1960s and is widely accepted as a measure of change in the 
supply and demand for milk nationally 
but a continuing decline in the output of grade b milk partly 
because of tighter sanitary standards is gradually making the mw 
price unusable for setting milk prices he said 
haley said the departments national agricultural statistics 
service which compiles the mw price questions whether it will be 
able to do so after mid1992 
the dairy industry has asked usda to develop and test 
alternative methods and a national hearing on all federal milk 
orders has been tentatively set for september although no specific 
date and location have been announced 
haley said a separate hearing on the base price will be held 
later 
meanwhile specific proposals can be sent by july 25 to 
director dairy division ams usda room 2968s po box 96456

president petar mladenov whose political 
party of former communists won bulgarias first free election in 58 
years last month submitted his resignation today state media 
reported 
mladenov had been under mounting pressure to step down 
students and opposition parties who led the calls for his 
resignation accused him among other things of suggesting that 
tanks should be used to put down an antigovernment rally outside 
parliament late last year 
mladenovs letter of resignation was read on state televisions 
800 pm news program by a commentator 
students who have been on strike for nearly a month issued a 
declaration earlier today calling on bulgarians to go on a 
30minute warning strike saturday if mladenov did not step down 
today the state bta news agency said 
the resignation left premier andrei lukanov a member of 
mladenovs socialist party as head of the government a 
replacement for mladenov will likely be chosen when the new 
parliament first meets on tuesday 
demands for mladenovs resignation came after experts assessed 
as authentic a videotape in which he was heard to suggest the use 
of tanks on a large antigovernment rally outside parliament on 
dec 14 
in the videotape broadcast on an election program by the main 
opposition alliance union of democratic forces three days before 
runoff elections last month mladenov was heard to say let the 
tanks come 
no tanks were used 
in his reaction to the experts conclusion mladeonv said on 
state tv wednesday night that the phrase was taken out of context 
and did not reflect his political career and convictions 
the end of hardline communist rule in bulgaria came not as in 
romania czechoslovakia and east germany through street protest 
but in a communist party coup in which reformminded comrades 
including mladenov ousted party chief todor zhivkov the 
communists reorganized as the socialist party 
mladenov was appointed president and after peaceful 
demonstrations by the fragmented but quickly growing opposition 
the socialists began negotiations that led to the june elections 
in sofia a democratic forces stronghold nearly everybody 
including most western diplomats was shocked by the socialists 
211seat victory in the parliamentary elections the democratic 
forces won 144 seats 
lukanov had said he wanted to form a broad coalition government 
that might have more chance of attracting sorely needed foreign 
investment however the opposition refused to help the socialists 
solve the growing economic crisis created by their mismanagement 
the new parliament will serve a twoyear term and write a new 
constitution 
most of the original demands of the students who have been on 
strike since june 11 have been fulfilled they include the 
resignation of a tv director accused of biased reporting and 
publication of alleged election irregularities 
but according to bta the students drew up a new list of demands 
today they have called for a date to be set for a public trial of 
zhivkov 78 who is in detention he has been charged with 
misappropriation of state property inciting ethnic hostility and 
grave abuse of power 
about 1000 students have been conducting a sitin strike in 
front of the presidential building to press their demands for 
mladenovs resignation 
a students strike committee statement called for a general 
strike on monday one day before the new parliament is to hold its 
first session if mladenov had not resigned by then bta said 
the union of democratic forces also issued a statement earlier 
today calling on mladenov to resign before parliament opens tuesday 
other smaller opposition groups and the mainstream agrarian 
party a once docile ally of the communists also backed the 
students demands bta reported 
the former official trade unions which now call themselves 
independent also supported student demands as did miners at the 
balkan coalfield who support the opposition union podkrepa bta 
said 
on thursday the leader of the union of democratic forces 
zhelyu zhelev said in a statement that a head of state cannot 
permit himself to be dishonest before the people bta reported

a they send to him that heres an alliance that is purely 
that you should view mr gorbachev as defensive and not 
threatening and please convince your military and others in the 
soviet union of this fact you see from my discussions with mr 
gorbachev and others ive had the feeling that they have viewed 
nato as much more threatening to them than ive ever looked at 
than the way in which ive looked at nato but now as a result of 
the actions that weve taken here i think it should be clear to 
the soviet military to mr gorbachev to his adversaries and to 
his friends inside the soviet union that nato is changing and to 
the degree they had seen it as a threat to their shores or to their 
borders they should look at it not as a threat to their borders or 
to their people 
any time you sit down with people from the soviet union they 
tell you the fact that they lost from 20 to 27 million lives its 
ingrained in them and they do it not as a defensive mechanism but 
they do it because they feel very strongly about that i hope that 
they will look at the changes that nato has taken and say well 
if nato had been a threat to us it no longer is a threat to us 
and then i hope we can go forward to further document that spirit 
by mutual agreements on arms control 
yes jessie 
q mr president how are you going to communicate whats in 
this document to mr gorbachev and the people there are you going 
to talk with him personally did the nato leaders decide on some 
other method of communication with him to let him know what it 
means what the communique means 
a well id the nato leaders have decided that the secretary 
general will be going there and that will be a very good 
facetoface chance to discuss these matters i believe our 
secretary of state is meeting soon with mr shevardnadze you can 
be sure that matters will be discussed then and then i its in 
all likelihood i will discuss it personally by telephone with mr 
gorbachev 
i think its very important that the leader of the united states 
and the leader of the soviet union stay in touch and in fact 
when he was here in washington we talked about more such contacts 
so perhaps within the next couple of weeks i will be talking to him 
about what transpired because i want to make the some of these 
points here again particularly that he they ought not to view 
nato as a threat and certainly they ought not to view it as a 
roadblock to progress in arms control or withdrawal of conventional 
forces or whatever it might be 
yes margaret you had your hand up 
q mr president what kind of tangible response would you like 
to see from president gorbachev now to this and im thinking 
particularly the issue of germany and nato 
a well i think in terms of the question of germany and nato 
i would like to see the tangible respose be an acceptance of the 
concept that a unified germany in nato is not only good but that 
it certainly is no threat to them and weve had long talks with 
mr gorbachev about that and perhaps this declaration will be the 
be a document that he can use to convince others that a unified 
germany in nato is in the interest of stability and world peace 
so that would be i think that is probably the most important 
message and then id like to think that out of this he would feel 
more confident in going forward with with arms control bringing 
the twoplusfour talks to a conclusion and theres a wide array 
of other things as well 
way in the back yes sir 
q thank you jerry lewis israel radio did the topic of the 
middle east come up during your discussions in the margins of the 
nato summit and can you comment on press reports which indicate 
you might be considering resuming your dialogue with the plo and 
what conditions would you attach to such a resumption 
a the discussion of the middle east in the nato meeting did not 
come up it may have been discussed in the corridors but it was not 
a discussion of the in the in the meetings at all and i didnt 
have discussions in a nato context about the middle east 
my position on the dialogue with the plo is that one of the 
preconditions for discussion was a renunciation of terror and i 
viewed the aborted attack on the shores of israel by some 
palestinian commandos as a terrorist act so we didnt cancel we 
suspended the talks with the plo and i would like to think that 
mr arafat could some way bring his council not only to denounce 
the terror that particular terrorist act but also to take some 
action against the person that perpetrated it and then i think we 
would certainly give rapid consideration to renewal of the dialogue 
i happen to think the dialogue has been useful i dont think 
mr arafat particularly agrees with that and im quite confident 
that mr shamir doesnt agree with that but nevertheless we have 
thats the view of the united states 
yes ellen 
q mr president mikhail gorbachev is already under fire from 
conservatives for essentially giving away eastern europe are you 
at all concerned sir that by inviting him to speak today only 
further undermines him and i have a followup 
a no im not not only do i think were not undermining him 
but i would think that would send a signal that nato has no hostile 
intentions to the soviet union so i would hope nobody at home 
would consider this an effort to undermine mr gorbachev nor would 
it be nor would it have the effect of undermining a man who has 
clearly tried to move forward who has presided over the soviet 
union at a time when this fantastic change towards democracy and 
freedom has taken place in eastern europe and youre seeing that 
same kind of quest for change democratic change and economic 
change inside the soviet union so i dont think it would have the 
effect that the question suggests 
q if he accepts your invitation sir will you attend that 
meeting or would it be an occasion for some sort of a superpower 
summit 
a it has the this the level of the gorbachev meeting at 
nato has not been determined and i would be guided by what the 
other nato members think is appropriate but others have you know 
the level at which mr gorbachev would speak to nato has not been 
set if it was a headofstate level why of course i would attend 
others have addressed nato at varying levels 
yes right in the middle 
q having attended quite a number of these things of these nato 
conferences id like to ask a question mr president which i 
asked just two meetings ago is this to some extent a celebration 
of the victory of nato in the cold war the cold war is over and 
nato has won or dont you agree with the idea that nato has won 
the cold war 
a excuse me back up now i ive tried to avoid code words 
and the cold war being over is something that id rather not not 
comment on i i dont think were dealing in terms of victory and 
defeat were dealing in terms of how do we stabilize and guarantee 
the peace and security of europe so to the degree a chief of state 
or head of government dwells on the kinds of rhetoric that you 
understandably ask about i think it is counterproductive does 
that answer it 
q well would you say that nato has to a great extent caused 
gorbachev to be that the whole changes in eastern europe have to 
some extent been caused by whats been going on in western europe 
for the last 40 years 
a well i would say to some degree that the changes in eastern 
europe and in the soviet union have been because they have seen the 
success of market economies they have seen a craving for freedom 
and democracy on the parts of people and to the degree nato 
countries contributed to that proper perception so be it i think 
i like to think that im convinced that natos solidarity 
during the last 40 years has guaranteed the peace for europe and 
when you look back at history it is a long peace given some of 
the conflagrations on this continent so i think nato deserves a 
lot of credit but i think the yearning for freedom and democracy 
is pretty fundamental nato has nothing to do with the changes in 
our own western hemisphere and yet youre seeing now the 
emergence of democracies and youre seeing the emergence of free 
people there so its fundamental that people want democracy and 
freedom but i think natos major contribution has been to keeping 
the peace and yet its set an example that i think many in 
eastern europe now want to follow 
yes 
q mr president how do you square the concern over stability 
in europe which is the new purpose of nato with increasing signs 
of instability in the soviet union particularly on the political 
and economic front and what can you do to put those two pieces of 
the puzzle together 
a a very good and very difficult question because frankly 
one thing we do is stay out of the internal affairs of the soviet 
union i realize that some think that im not staying out of the 
internal affairs of the soviet union when i speak speak 
pleasantly about mr gorbachev but i think they have to sort it 
out now they have to decide what they want how much of their 
gross national product ought to go into arms whether the threat is 
much less than they have historically perceived and once they take 
that decision then we in the west will stand ready to work very 
cooperatively with them but i think the next move what im 
saying is up to them i think they have to make these 
determinations and in the meantime nato having seem the changes 
that have taken place in eastern europe and the predicted changes 
in terms of force levels can go forward with what i think people 
will view as an historic document 
excuse me i did tell you id get over here 
q thank you very much me 
a yes sir 
q how conditional is the proposal to remove nuclear artillery 
from europe are you actually saying that you will not do this 
unless the soviet union does likewise are you saying it should be 
part of negotiations or are you actually merely inviting the 
soviet union to withdraw their nuclear artillery

sineads coming to town oconnor that is 
shes hot the kids love her critics too the albums gone 
platinum her concerts sell out everywhere and that look her 
shaved head is as distinctive as the beatle moptop was in 1964 
thats what joe poggi is thinking hes the marketing director 
at knrg in houston he needs a gimmick a way to get more 
listeners something outrageous if necessary 
hes got it madonna was just in town one stop on her blond 
ambition tour why not play off that and go one better take 
oconnors name and shout it from the highest rooftops literally 
we had our afternoon jock get on the top of the summit which 
overlooks the southwest freeway explained poggi referring to 
the citys sports arena on the marquee we had them put energy 95 
presents the bald ambition tour 
you see the show sold out and we had a pair of front row 
tickets but you had to be the first person to come there and let 
professional stylists cut your hair 
we had a person show up at 315 with hair down to his 
shoulders hes a swim coach and we put him up on the marquee and 
at 430 just when rush hours really good we started cutting his 
hair people were laughing and honking some pulled over and 
watched 
highway haircuts and rushhour remotes may not seem the most 
dignified way to greet the bestselling author of songs about dead 
boyfriends and police brutality even if she does shave her head 
but this is hit radio and a new look plus a platinum lp means 
gold for the happyhappy world of morning zoos and celebrity 
wakeup calls 
i dont think we did it to make fun of her said mark todd 
operations manager for kqlz in los angeles another shave your 
head promoter people are fans and we did it out of fun we 
werent doing it to put her down we play her records constantly 
its basically intended to let the listeners participate in 
something it makes for good radio 
when it was discovered she was coming into town for a concert 
our phones were screaming said cris dockett assistant promotion 
manager at wmms in cleveland 
anybody willing to shave their head recieved tickets plus we 
gave them cash they were willing to do it one of them even 
brought her own hairdresser into the studio 
but all the hype has caused much sorrow for the 23yearold 
irish performer who toured north america from may 1 to june 11 
oconnor whose i do not want what i havent got album quickly 
topped the charts was especially upset when she learned that a san 
diego radio station had taken to the airwaves to track down her 
hotel 
in america people are obsessed the singer complained in a 
phone interview from austin texas its really really shocking 
its so frightening they follow you around and it freaks you out 
anything could be happening what am i supposed to do 
its all been a rude surprise for sinead said oconners 
publicist elaine schock shes used to walking the streets when 
i would go to see her in england shed greet me at the subway 
intellectually she understood that becoming famous would change 
things but in her heart she was hoping it wouldnt 
many promoters can sympathize but insist oconnor will have to 
get used to it its all part of being in the limelight they say 
rock n roll stars are fair game as are all celebrities they 
argue sell a million records and youd better bring a pair of 
sunglasses and keep the phone off the hook 
we can do stuff like that with anybody said producer 
telephone tony of whtz in new york another station on the shave 
your head network 
when prince was out he had the same type of thing and 
michael jackson too we had sightings for madonna around central 
park we were having listener reports it was great 
im sure it probably bothers her the producer said of 
oconnor ive listened to her album and its a really serious 
artistic piece but the fact that she has short hair and the fact 
shes very unique opens up the joke pile 
mike novack program managerdirector at kfmb in 
san diego calif said his station has a group of people they call 
hotel weasels who let them know where celebrities are staying 
and it gets worse much worse in chicago wlu and operations p morning 
host 
jonathon brandmeier likes to greet visiting luminaries with wakeup 
calls live wakeup calls 
jonathan winters pretended he was bob dell in town for a 
plumbers convention when he was called robert de niro hung up 
steve martin threatened legal action 
brandmeier was broadcasting from los angeles in june and 
switched from ringing phones to ringing doorbells sending a 
producer for surprise earlymorning visits to such stars as george 
burns peter falk and gene kelly none of whom ever came to the 
door 
its all done for for the sole purpose for garnering ratings 
for the radio station said carey curelop program director of 
wlos in los angeles some people have more scruples air controllers lost 
contact with the aircraft a few 
minutes after it took off it was earlier thought that the plane 
may have crashed and government planes and helicopters searched 
for the aircraft thursday and friday 
the three passengers who deboarded were arrested by colombian 
police on friday when they could not produce identification papers 
at a checkpoint bennet said they were on a bus traveling from 
viterbo to medellin when they were arrested bennet said he said 
the passengers were taken to bogota the colombian capital for 
questioning

a well id certainly invite them to do it and the document is 
fairly clear on that point i think that if they are the relation 
the withdrawal of nuclear artillery on the part of the west is 
conditioned on the withdrawal of soviet nuclear artillery 
way in the back 
q mr president paragraph 12 manpower levels of a united 
germany what happened to nonsingularization of germany 
a well i dont see that as singularization that was a 
question that had to be addressed anyway and i think that the 
youre going to see the united states addressing its force levels 
through cfe talks so i would i would think that this is not what 
i have always thought of as singularization trying to single 
germany out for example from not being a part of a united 
germany from being a part of nato 
so im simply saying i think what it simply says is this 
question at an appropriate time will be addressed and we are going 
forward addressing ourselves now to us force levels under our 
conventional force talks so i dont see any contradiction in that 
there was a guy on the aisle that i identified back there no 
im afraid it wasnt you but right there that had his hand up 
well hes vanished there was a guy in an open shirt here im 
sorry 
q thank you mr president 
a then i have to go go ahead well get these two and then i 
must audio break due to mike difficulties 
q thank you mr president inaudible that you are hoping 
that gorbachev can convince other people that through these 
documents that they have not to fear the nato are you saying that 
some other people in the soviet union are imposing this fear to 
nato to mr gorbachev and who are these people 
a well i think there has been 
q and a followup question please 
a yeah well if i got your first part of it correctly i think 
theres been a historic fear on the part of some about the west 
because of the soviets own history i happen to believe that that 
fear has been misplaced all along but to the degree people still 
have that fear and they look at this document it would seem to me 
to be de minimus and i cant single out which people they are but 
i think there has been a historic concern on the part of the 
soviets because of their own history in certainly as recently as 
world war ii with an enormous loss of life i think over the years 
as we improve our relations have improved our relations with the 
soviet union and indeed as they have changed those fears have 
diminished and i think given the new openness the glasnost i 
think theyre going to diminish even more 
and what was the followup 
q the followup was how do you expect that mr gorbachev can be 
helped in his present problems internal problems in the soviet 
union with this london declaration 
a im awful sorry im having difficulty hearing you from the 
back of the room could you say it one more time 
q how do you expect that mr gorbachev can be helped through 
this london declaration in his present internal problems in the 
soviet union 
a i think he will say look nato has indeed changed in 
response to the changes that have taken place in eastern europe 
if i were him id say ive been right theyre changing and 
now i want to go forward with the united states and negotiate some 
more deals and i want to see us reform i want to see us stop some 
of what weve been doing in various regions around the world that 
others view as detrimental to the interests of freedom and 
democracy and so i would if i were him i would take a hard 
look at this document i would listen carefully to what he hears 
from manfred woerner when he goes there and i would i would 
think he could say weve been right to reach out as we have 
tried to do to the united states and to agree and indeed to 
improve relations with countries in western europe theyre 
changing they have now changed their doctrine because of steps 
that i mr gorbachev have taken 
and id get on the offense and then let the rest of us help him 
with some of his hard liners and theres plenty of work to do 
but i would think that hed view this as a very positive step 
forward and one that vindicates some of the moves that hes made 
over the past year or two 
last one way in the back go ahead 
q mr president now that youve had a chance to digest prime 
minister shamirs letter to you of last week how does that letter 
leave you feeling does it leave you feeling as secretary baker 
said that maybe we should just leave him with the white house 
phone number and to call when hes serious or does it leave you 
feeling youre ready now to get involved in a prolonged negotiation 
with him once again spending another few months or years to try to 
modify his position 
a it leaves me feeling we need further clarification in terms 
of the questions that i put to him the answers clarification on 
some of the answers but look we want to see the peace process go 
forward 
we had good talks with i did and so did jim baker with the 
egyptian foreign minister the other day ive been on the phone to 
mr mubarak to king hussein to others and we want to see the 
process go forward and we have a united states policy and were 
going to stay with the policy in terms of settlements and other 
things of this question 
but we will do everything we can to encourage a discussion that 
will end up in peace there has got to be talks palestinians have 
to attend these talks and so the ground rules are out there and 
weve got to weve got to go forward but we need more 
clarification and very candidly id like to think that israel 
would now move forward again and thats about where we stand 
thank you all very much 
q your hand mr president 
a huh questioning 
q whats wrong with your hand 
a its skewered laughter i was cleaning the mackerel and i 
plunged the knife into it minor wound

mitch snyder whose personal demons apparently 
overwhelmed his fierce commitment to the nations homeless was 
remembered friday as a man of justice who worked tirelessly to 
assist the downtrodden 
jesse jackson told a memorial service at bible way church that 
snyder was a man who heard and answered a moral call to help 
the homeless 
the fact that birds have a home foxes have a home and yet 
men and women veterans of foreign wars mothers and fathers 
working poor people have no place to lay their head he found 
that to be a moral disgrace jackson told about 600 mourners 
snyders body was discovered thursday hanging from an electrical 
cord in his private room at the washington shelter he founded a 
police statement called the death an apparent suicide 
dr georges benjamin the citys public health commissioner 
said snyders death was the result of asphyxiation by hanging 
benjamin said investigators cannot pinpoint when snyder died 
the death has not yet been ruled a suicide but benjamin said there 
is no evidence of foul play 
police said a note containing suicidal references was found 
near snyders body and law enforcement sources said the note 
outlined personal problems snyder was having in his 15year 
relationship with fellow homeless advocate carol fennelly 
the two had said last month that they would be married in 
september 
at the memorial service jackson described snyders dramatic 
efforts to draw attention to homelessness which included hunger 
strikes and sitins 
mitch was a little eccentric mitch was a little off 
jackson said to appreciative laughs from the mourners many of whom 
live at snyders shelter but he was a man of justice theres 
something to be said about being a little off 
a close friend of snyders who spoke with him tuesday described 
him as very down very despondent 
we talked for about an hour said the friend who asked not 
to be named he was very upset about his relationship with carol 
very down in the dumps 
snyders friend reflected on their conversation and then 
repeatedly called snyder back to invite him to dinner 
he didnt return calls tuesday or then on wednesday which i 
found strange the friend said 
fennelly declined to discuss the situation after the memorial 
service this just isnt the time she said 
a funeral is scheduled for tuesday outside the shelter which is 
located in a rundown neighborhood just half a mile from the us 
capitol 
jackson will preach at the service and organizers said they are 
hoping that the rev phillip berrigan also will attend snyder 
credited berrigan and his brother daniel also a priest with 
helping him turn his life around 
snyder met the berrigans in a federal prison in 1973 while 
serving time on auto theft charge the berrigans were jailed for 
burning draft cards in antiwar protests and quickly made snyder a 
convert to their methods of social activism and nonviolent protest 
that commitment led snyder first to the antiwar movement and 
then to the cause of homelessness after he moved to the nations 
capital in 1973 
the gray threestory building where snyders body was found 
symbolized the cause in which he achieved national prominence and 
the tactics he used in his fight 
his group the community for creative nonviolence was given 
the government building by the reagan administration only after 
snyder staged a hunger strike in 1984 to demand federal aid and 
publicize the plight of the homeless 
snyder once described president ronald reagan as a nice man who 
had meanspirited politics 
mark weinberg the former presidents spokesman said from los 
angeles on friday president and mrs reagan are saddened and 
extend their sympathy and prayers to snyders family and 
friends 
after winning the government building snyder took his combative 
tactics to the national stage to publicize the problems of 
homeless in 1986 officials in santa barbara calif backed away 
from plans to ban sleeping in public places after snyder threatened 
to lead a march of homeless people into the city 
but snyder had suffered defeats in recent months particularly 
when the district of columbia council citing budget pressures 
scaled back a comprehensive law providing emergency shelter to all 
who requested it 
he was also criticized for his attempts to prevent us census 
bureau workers from interviewing homeless people snyder described 
the efforts of census workers as government grandstanding

the summit stage moved friday to president bushs 
hometown where leaders of the worlds seven largest industrialized 
nations will turn their attention to the economic configuration of 
the postcold war world 
houston was turned out in the summit nations colors flags 
sprouted on downtown skyscrapers and at the rice university summit 
site painters hurried to put the finishing touches on sprucedup 
buildings 
last years summit in paris adjourned early when the leaders ran 
out of things to talk about thats not likely to happen next week 
questions of direct economic aid to the soviets a contentious 
fight over farm subsidies and problems of global pollution were 
expected to dominate the negotiating sessions and working dinners 
which get under way monday 
on many of the issues the united states found itself at odds 
with the other summit countries japan west germany france 
britain italy and canada 
in many ways the houston meeting will be a continuation of the 
talks thursday and friday at the nato summit in london of the 
seven leaders only japans prime minister toshiki kaifu did not 
participate in the nato meeting 
as his first order of business bush was to hold private talks 
with kaifu on saturday officials said that in addition to briefing 
kaifu on the outcome of the nato meeting the two leaders would 
cover the various economic issues coming up in houston 
high on the economic agenda will be the question of whether the 
west should supply a 15 billion to 20 billion aid package to bail 
out soviet president mikhail gorbachevs floundering economic 
reform effort an idea being pushed by west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
bush repeated his objections to such aid on friday saying he 
has big problems in giving us assistance as long as moscow is 
spending billions of dollars annually in support for cuba but he 
appeared to open the door slightly to the possibility of extending 
some types of financial credits to the soviets 
diplomatic sources said that gorbachev had written an appeal for 
economic aid to british prime minister margaret thatcher who like 
bush is against the proposal until the soviets do more to reform 
their economy 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney predicted the economic 
summit would make substantial progress in resolving the soviet 
aid dispute 
however the most likely outcome was a vague statement of 
support which would not commit any specific amounts of money but 
would allow countries such as west germany to offer their own aid 
packages 
bush has told reporters that his top priority at the economic 
summit would be breaking a logjam on agriculture trade which has 
deadlocked an effort to reform the rules governing world trade 
the united states is pushing for agreement to phase out all 
tradedistorting farm subsidies over the next 10 years but that 
idea has drawn strong opposition from european countries whose 
leaders contend that such a proposal would cost the jobs of between 
2 million and 3 million european farmers 
the trade liberalization talks known as the uruguay round for 
the country where they were launched in 1986 are scheduled to 
conclude in december but us officials fear they could falter 
without agreement on the agriculture question 
the world leaders are also expected to consider a european 
proposal to cut back on greenhouse gases forms of pollution 
which scientists fear are trapping too much heat from the sun and 
causing global climate changes 
the us position is that more needs to be known about the 
possible threat before committing billions of dollars to cleanup 
efforts 
before all the serious talks begin the world leaders will be 
treated to a taste of texas on sunday night complete with a rodeo 
barbecue and a performance by the grand ol opry 
houston a city that suffered through hard times during the oil 
price bust of the 1980s raised 10 million in donations and 
assembled an army of volunteers to showcase houstons economic 
resurrection for the expected 3000 reporters from around the world 
on friday painters were still at work in one of the meeting 
rooms to be used during the three days of talks at rice university 
a 4000student private university five miles from downtown 
in deference to houstons notorious summer weather the outdoor 
arrival ceremony on monday was shortened and a special platform was 
constructed to pipe cool air underneath the dignataries seats

a bomb exploded friday at a 
crowded black bus terminal injuring 27 people in what appeared to 
be the work of rightwing extremists authorities said 
the bombing was the most serious of six explosions in the past 
week in johannesburg white extremists claimed responsibility for 
the previous blasts but there was no such claim following fridays 
explosion 
the ultraright and neofascist forces are on the 
rampage said the african national congress the countrys 
largest black opposition group the anc demands that authorities 
disarm and disband the ultraright groups 
the bomb went off in the city center during the morning rush 
hour in an area where buses used by blacks let off and pick up 
passengers thousands of blacks from townships outside johannesburg 
pass through the area every day 
police said the bomb hidden in a trash can sent pieces of 
concrete and debris hurtling through the air hitting people 
standing in bus lines and passersby 
doctors said most of the injuries were relatively minor and just 
two of the 27 blacks treated at a local hospital were required to 
stay for additional treatment 
police said the blast looked like the work of rightwing white 
extremists no arrests have been made 
three black minibuses were were riddled with debris and about 
15 other vehicles suffered lesser damage witnesses said 
we just heard a big noise everyone scattered people in the 
taxis got out and ran away said nhlandla mbatha who was waiting 
in a bus line when the bomb went off there were rocks flying 
into the air there was blood everywhere people were screaming 
and crying 
some of the injured were buying food in nearby shops when they 
were hit by flying debris witnesses said 
everything was clouded with smoke i saw about six people 
running toward me with shredded clothing and some with no shoes 
said shopkeeper isha charassi 
police cars and ambulances with wailing sirens rushed to the 
scene of the blast the most serious since the bombing campaign 
began a week ago 
rightwing whites have expressed outrage at president fw de 
klerks stated plans to end apartheid and share power with the 
countrys 30 million blacks at present the 5 million whites 
dominate politics and the economy 
the previous bombs were aimed at whites involved in efforts to 
end apartheid but caused no injuries and only minor damage a 
shadowy group calling itself the white wolves claimed 
responsibility 
in other developments friday 
police searched the home of robert van tonder leader of the 
rightwing boer state party no one was arrested but police said 
they confiscated documents from the home outside johannesburg 
if they the government carry on this way they can expect 
violence to escalate an angry van tonder said 
police said they arrested three anc guerrillas allegedly 
planning to attack black rivals in the eastern province of natal

negotiations will resume next week on final 
details of an agreement expanding us access to military 
facilities in singapore the pentagon said friday 
the proposed deal would not give the united states its own 
military base in singapore but it would greatly expand us 
military activity in the southeast asian citystate said lt cmdr 
edward h lundquist a pentagon spokesman 
lundquist said no us planes or ships would be based there 
permanently but a small contingent of american military personnel 
probably fewer than 200 would be stationed at the singapore 
facilities to keep them ready for us use 
lundquist stressed that the proposed use of singapore military 
facilities would not be a substitute for the larger us forces at 
clark air base and subic bay naval base in the philippines a 
military bases agreement between the united states and the 
philippines expires next year and the bush administration is 
seeking to negotiate some form of continued use of those facilities 
if the singapore deal is concluded us f16 fighter planes 
based elsewhere in asia would be allowed to conduct occasional 
training missions in singapore and navy ships could use 
singapores strategically located port lundquist said 
the negotiations began early this year after singapore prime 
minister lee kuan yew offered to permit greater us access to his 
countrys military facilities 
the los angeles times reported in fridays editions that it was 
possible that a final agreement would be signed when secretary of 
state james a baker iii visits singapore in august 
lundquist said he could not say how close the two sides were to 
final agreement but that the remaining issues were mainly legal 
technicalities he said a new round of talks was scheduled for next 
wednesday through friday in washington 
lundquist said the main outstanding issue was the legal status 
of american military personnel who would be stationed in singapore 
under the agreement one open question he said was what rights 
the americans would have in the event they were arrested on 
criminal charges singapore authorizes the death penalty for 
convicted drug traffickers 
singapore has one of the worlds largest harbors it lies in the 
strategic waterway through which japan and south korea get most of 
their oil from the persian gulf 
singapore is a member of the association of southeast asian 
nations a regional organization whose other members are thailand 
the philippines malaysia indonesia and brunei 
the philippines is the only asean member hosting a permanent 
us military base

reformers of the minority democratic platform 
fraction said friday they would vote to reelect mikhail s 
gorbachev as communist party leader but they still planned to 
consider leaving the party in the fall 
considering all variations we will have to support 
gorbachev dmitri karualov a democratic platform member from 
leningrad told a news conference at the end of the fifth day of 
the 28th soviet communist party congress 
karualov said alexander yakovlev a politburo member and close 
adviser to gorbachev refused a democratic platform proposal to 
dispute the top party job 
left without any alternative democratic platform a radical 
proreform group within ther communist party decided to support 
gorbachev 
karualov said however he believed gorbachev would likely 
become a hostage of the bureaucracy unable to carry out 
further economic and political reforms 
democratic platform had threatened to walk out of the congress 
an act that would have caused the first split in the party since 
1921 karualov said the group would hold a congress in the fall to 
consider its future he did not provide a date or any further 
details 
the entire democratic platform delegation however still must 
make a final decision about whether to break away 
democratic platform members are to meet with gorbachev late 
friday vladimir lysenko a faction leader said he didnt expect 
any deep answers from gorbachev and the meeting was unlikely to be 
a big spectacle 
the movement formed in january has only about 100 of the 4600 
congress delegates but its members say they have the support of 40 
percent of the party rankandfile 
democratic platform supports calls for the party to divest 
itself of its massive wealth an appeal that is unpopular with 
orthodox communists it also wants the party to give up its cells 
in the army and kgb 
leaders of the movement told reporters they were disappointed by 
the congress the main task of which lysenko said was to preserve 
status quo 
these events dont make me very happy lysenko said 
vyacheslav shostakovsky another democratic platform leader 
agreed for me nothing has been explained nothing is happening 
just as we predicted he voiced concern that the partys 
conservative wing was gaining strength and could endanger 
perestroika gorbachevs reform program he said the conservatives 
were drawing support from the party apparatus 
lysenko told a news conference that it was necessary to leave 
the communist party in its current form and to create a new 
political structure but he gave no details

leaders of the nations largest teachers 
union focused attention friday on ways to improve the training of 
americas future educators 
don cameron national education association executive director 
said a teacher education reform initiative will begin in november 
to link universities and colleges of education with local school 
districts so innovative curriculum ideas and teaching techniques 
can be tried out in classrooms 
too often teacher education programs seem rooted in the 
rarified air of academia rather than in the realities of the 
classroom he said 
cameron said negotiations are under way with several colleges 
and universities including the university of maryland eastern 
michigan university the university of delaware several 
traditionally black institutions in the south and three colleges in 
tennessee 
many school districts are enthusiastic about the idea said 
cameron 
the program will be coordinated by sharon robinson director of 
the nea national center for innovation she said the center will 
see that teacher education programs make sure future teachers can 
effectively use new classroom technologies such as computers and 
that their training includes the latest findings in educational 
research 
future teachers must be better prepared to help all their 
student think for themselves said cameron almost everybody 
agrees students must be better taught to analyze synthesize and 
use knowledge 
the announcement came one day after the 8100 nea delegates 
abandoned opposition to socalled alternative or nontraditional 
teacher certification and agreed to allow scientists 
mathematicians and other midcareer professionals to teach while 
receiving the training needed to obtain a license 
the initiative will not seek to impose any one particular 
model for teacher preparation on schools of education said 
cameron pointing to thursdays action as proof there can be many 
roads to licensure without the sacrifice of high standards 
arthur wise president of the national council for the 
accreditation of teacher education said about 200000 teachers are 
hired each year and the reform initiative should strengthen their 
preparation for the classroom 
wise said many of the criticisms of current programs are that 
they do not adequately prepare teachers academically and fail to 
provide rigorous teacher training or classroom methods 
before wrapping up its convention in boston this week the 
american federation of teachers announced a similar program 
officials selected los angeles minneapolis and rochester ny as 
sites for helping educators determine the best ways for student 
teachers to learn new skills that can be adapted to restructured 
schools 
each site selected from among proposals submitted jointly by 
teachers unions school districts and universities will receive a 
oneyear grant of about 30000 from the exxon education foundation 
for planning and preparation

black leaders on friday called for a federal probe 
of the violent arrests that ended a haitian protest police 
defended their actions and blamed the confrontation on 
wellorganized agitators 
fiftyeight haitian were arrested thursday outside a cubanowned 
store when clubwielding police waded into demonstrators who had 
refused orders to disperse fourteen demonstrators were 
hospitalized but all were released by friday 
the crowd was protesting the alleged beating of a haitian 
shopper by store employees in a dispute over a pair of pants last 
week a sign of heightened tensions between blacks and hispanics 
since nelson mandelas striferidden visit here 
the local national association for the advancement of colored 
people joined haitian exile leaders at a boisterous news conference 
in miamis little haiti neighborhood friday to criticize the 
arrests and call for a justice department civil rights 
investigation 
the naacp was simply outraged by the excessive use of 
force that has been committed on our brothers and sisters said 
local leader johnnie mcmillian we do not want to see them 
treated as secondclass citizens 
she said the violence should be seen as an attack on all blacks 
not just haitians 
haitian exile leader rev gerard jeanjuste called for a boycott 
against the store where the beating allegedly occurred and more 
broadly against any business that treated haitians poorly 
the demonstrations in the haitian community were initiated 
precisely because there has been an unfortunate pattern and history 
of violence directed against haitians by hispanic shopkeepers in 
our commnity jeanjuste said this pattern of violence cannot 
and will not be tolerated 
ms mcmillian said the situation was aggravated by the decision 
of police to transport 32 of the people arrested to the krome 
avenue detention center run by the us immigration and 
naturalization service most were released but seven remained 
there friday facing possible deportation for lack of legal 
residence papers 
the krome center is a source of frustration for haitians who 
say that while cubanamericans are granted instant freedom when 
they arrive haitians are turned back at sea or confined in the 
detention camp 
miami city officials have kept a low profile since the first 
protests over the june 29 altercation at the rapid transit factory 
outlet clothing store 
although cubanborn mayor xavier suarez was elected with 
widespread black support his snub of mandela over the south 
african antiapartheid leaders praise for fidel castro outraged 
many blacks

new hampshire bucked a national trend and 
was the only state to show a gain in wine consumption last year 
according to a survey 
americans last year drank 211 gallons of wine per capita the 
lowest consumption of any major wineproducing nation and a 58 
percent drop from 1988 according to figures released thursday by 
the trade publication wines amp vines 
by comparison americans over age 21 drank 337 gallons of beer 
216 gallons of distilled spirits and about 35 gallons of coffee 
adultonly wine consumption was 303 gallons per capita 
it was the second straight year wine consumption declined in 
1988 consumption dropped 5 percent from 1987 figures wines amp vines 
mississippi drank the least a mere halfgallon per capita in 
1989 and consumers in the district of columbia the most at 555 
gallons for every man woman and child 
drinkers in california new york and washington the top three 
wineproducing states drank more wine than the average per capita 
intake 
reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption 
individual states posted figures showing as much as a 195 percent 
drop from 1988 that distinction went to arizona where a 
halfgallon less of wine was consumed last year than in 1988 
domestic table wines still wines not over 14 percent alcohol 
fell 26 percent while production of domestic champagnes dropped 
63 percent last year marked the fourth straight year of decline 
for foreign champagne sales in this country they were down 78 
percent to 12 million gallons 
in 1985 champagne imports to the united states hit a peak of 
158 million gallons almost all of it from italy france and 
spain which together produce more than half of the wine consumed 
in the world 
california wines accounted for 728 percent of all wine consumed 
in the united states while the other 42 wineproducing states held 
126 percent of the market the rest of the market 146 percent 
were imports 
wines amp vines blamed the market drop on the continuing loss of 
ground of generic or jug wines nearly all of it produced in 
californias san joaquin valley and a 167 percent dip in wine 
cooler sales 
it was the second doubledigit loss in two years for the 
coolers sales phenomenon of the early 1980s that literally rescued 
california wine for several years in 1988 and 1989 cooler sales 
fell 333 million gallons falling from 21 percent of wine market 
share to 17 percent last year 
still the coolers mostly cheap white wine fruit juice and 
carbonated water represented one of six gallons of wine sold in 
this country last year 
us wine exports were up again in 1989 as foreign sales 
increased to a miniscule 221 million gallons in 1989 from 169 
gallons in 1988 the top two markets are canada 57 million 
gallons and japan 55 million gallons

president bush probably will not make a final 
decision this year on the development of an antipoverty program 
an administration official said friday 
it could well go into next year before any final decisions are 
made said a white house official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
the news drew differing reactions from two experts asked by the 
white house to offer suggestions for shaping a federal antipoverty 
policy 
isabell v sawhill of the urban institute said the 
administration went through a lot of effort and came up with a 
mouse in its slow approach to dealing with poverty 
but douglas j besharov of the conservative american enterprise 
institute defended the administration saying bush was just not 
coming forward and saying i have a new program that will solve 
all the problems 
besharov and sawhill were among outside experts summoned to the 
white house in september for a meeting on the poverty issue 
thirtytwo million americans live in poverty as defined by the 
government the issue had been studied by an interagency group 
convened last year and more recently by the administrations 
domestic policy council 
the official who spoke anonymously said you may see in the 
shorter term some decisions that give an indication of the 
direction we are headed in but there will be no final decisions 
for quite some time 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart confirmed that 
bush is waiting before deciding how to structure a program 
certainly no final decisions on what options should be 
considered by the president have been made this is a longterm 
process he said 
sawhill said however that she was frankly quite disappointed 
that they could not agree on an overall strategy 
there were a lot of good ideas put forward both from people 
who were consulted externally and also within the 
administration she added i think it was a serious and worthy 
effort but it seems to have fallen victim to some combination of 
ideology and budgetary pressures 
but besharov said that while some people might be disappointed 
by the administrations position he believes the administration is 
in the process of a longterm examination of what could be done 
and waiting to unveil a program is probably the wisest thing to 
do at this point 
he added what is important is to improve the programs that 
are in place 
besharov said a number of proposals were considered during the 
administrations deliberations 
they included 
having the government help residents of poor areas establish 
management corporations that would fight crime attempt to 
improve schools and repair housing 
allocating a larger share of federal aid to highpoverty areas 
providing financial subsidies to job contractors to help them 
match up applicants from high poverty areas with job openings

a judge friday placed a christian science couple 
on 10 years probation for denying medical care for the dying son 
and ordered periodic medical examinations for their other children 
the couple convicted of manslaughter in their sons death said 
they would comply the order 
we always tried to obey the law and well try to obey the 
judges instructions david twitchell said after he and his wife 
ginger were sentenced to 10 years probation by suffolk superior 
court judge sandra hamlin 
the twitchells lifelong christian scientists were convicted by 
a jury july 4 of recklessly and wantonly causing the death of their 
2yearold son robyn by relying solely on prayer to heal the boy 
robyn died april 8 1986 and an autopsy showed he suffered from a 
congenital defect that had caused a bowel obstruction 
on friday hamlin placed the twitchells who faced up to 20 
years in prison on 10 years probation and said that they must 
take their three children to periodic health checkups under 
guidelines for children set by the american medical association 
she said a doctor should be called at any signs of serious 
illness in the children elias 9 months old brian 2 years 
old and jeremy 8 
hamlin asked to receive monthly reports and said she would call 
for an immediate hearing if there were any violations of the 
conditions 
hamlin denied a defense motion to stay the sentence pending the 
outcome of an appeal which was filed thursday 
defense lawyer steve lyons said friday the defense would appeal 
that denial next week 
in a brief statement after the sentencing twitchell said that 
while he would obey the judges order he would always pray 
first for his childrens health 
we have never ruled out medical care we just feel prayer 
gods power is a lot better he said 
special prosecutor john kiernan had asked for a very lengthy 
period of probation for the twitchells who now live in brentwood 
ny periodic medical checkups of their children and that the 
couple perform community service designed to benefit young 
children 
suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan said that the 
commonwealth decided to prosecute the twitchells with the single 
intention of protecting the rights of children from neglect 
the trial attracted national attention in part because it was 
held in boston headquarters of the christian science church 
the church teaches that sickness and disease can be healed by 
spiritual means alone church officials have said the case 
represents an attack on their religion and expressed confidence it 
would be overturned on appeal 
the decision to go forward with this case may not been 
considered a popular one flanagan said after the sentencing 
however we proceeded with this case in the hope that parents of 
all children no matter what their religious beliefs must be held 
responsible and accountable for providing their children with 
proper medical care

an admitted cocaine addict testified in marion 
barrys drug and perjury trial friday that she supplied crack 
cocaine to the mayor about 25 times in three months and brought 
it to him once along with a job application 
lydia pearson testifying with immunity from prosecution said 
she delivered cocaine to barry once at the office of barry campaign 
manager anita bonds 
he gave me the money for the crack and i gave him the 
application she testified 
bonds was not there at the time pearson eventually did get a 
city job as a contract representative in public housing but said 
she recently left it 
pearson supporting statements by rasheeda moore the former 
model who cooperated in the fbi undercover sting against barry 
said she supplied cocaine to the mayor from julyseptember of 1988 
and lent the mayor her home for drugsmoking trysts 
she said barry would usually phone ahead from his official 
limousine to say he was coming 
i would let him in the house she said i would give him a 
bag and he gave me money 
she also delivered crack to barry at two hotels after the mayor 
called her she said 
she said she usually brought three 30 bags because that was 
his usual 
he would give me 100 a lot of times he would give me the 10 
change she said 
what did you do with the change asked assistant us 
attorney richard roberts asked 
buy some crack said the witness who described herself as a 
recovering drug addict 
pearson said she never saw barry using drugs 
moore testified earlier in the trial she and barry used drugs 
more than 100 times and that she got cocaine from pearson for the 
mayor 
barry 54 is facing trial on 10 charges of cocaine possession 
one count of conspiracy and three felony charges of perjury 
in another development us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson reversed his earlier ruling and said nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan and bishop george stallings may attend the trial as 
long as they observe the proprieties of the court 
stallings sat with barrys wife effi in the second row of 
spectators on friday farrakhan was not in court 
jackson reversed himself after an appeals court said spectators 
cannot be barred merely because they advocate a particular 
political or religious point of view 
pearson a lifelong friend of moores said moore first brought 
barry to her home in february 1988 on three occasions she said 
the mayor and moore spent about an hour in the bedroom 
did you ever get high with the defendant asked roberts 
no she said 
did you ever see him get high on crack cocaine 
no 
ms pearson said barry came to her house for drugs when miss 
moore stopped coming in july 1988 
the prosecution also introduced telephone records showing calls 
made from the mayors limousine to ms pearsons home 
in other testimony barrys lawyers sought to cast doubt on the 
fbis physical evidence including laboratory tests and the pipe 
taken from the hotel room after barrys arrest 
an fbi laboratory technician testified that after barrys 
arrest his blood showed an alcohol content of only 005 percent 
onetwentieth of the legal standard for intoxication a videotape 
of the sting shows barrys glass was refilled with alcohol at least 
three times 
and fbi agent frank o steele testified that investigators could 
not find critical evidence for 90 minutes after the vista hotel 
undercover sting 
steele said agents scoured the room for the pipe the mayor used 
to allegedly smoke crack cocaine and overlooked some of the cocaine 
used in the operation 
barry attorney robert mance played again the videotape of the 
sting operation seeking to portray a clumsy search of the hotel 
room where barry was arrested 
there was concern that the crack pipe could not be located and 
to find it as fast as possible said steele who said he learned 
of anxiety among fbi superiors over the pipes location 
steele was in charge of evidence the night the threeterm mayor 
was arrested 
steele said that in searching for the pipe he went through the 
mayors pinstriped suit jacket and did not notice what was later 
identified as cocaine in an inside pocket he testified he finally 
found the pipe in an eyeglass case placed in a dresser drawer by 
moore

state the lawyers associates said friday

its opponents it said it was distressed by the detentions of 
at least 11 people wednesday and thursday according to the 
statement released by the us embassy in nairobi 
the two lawyers gibson kamau kuria and paul muite disappeared 
thursday after police detained four of their associates the 
sources said on condition of anonymity 
kuria is an internationally known human rights lawyer and muite 
has joined in the call for multiparty democracy 
thursdays detentions brought to at least 11 the number of 
people seized since wednesday in the crackdown for months the 
government had been criticizing those calling for reform

days organizing their personal and business affairs before either 
surrendering to police or allowing themselves to be arrested 
kurias wife scholastica said she had urged the men to seek 
asylum at the us embassy in nairobi but that they rejected the 
suggestion 
they feel that if there is any fight they should fight it 
here she told the associated press in a telephone interview 
since the beginning of the year a loose coalition emboldened by 
the changes in eastern europe has repeatedly accused the ruling 
kenya african national union party of intolerance corruption and 
electionrigging 
however the government has rejected any move toward allowing 
other parties 
president daniel arap moi says that multiparty politics would 
create ethnic strife among kenyas 40 tribes and lead to tribal 
warfare he had threatened arrests vowing to hunt down advocates 
of multiparty democracy like rats

prodemocracy rally on saturday the government has promised to

federal reserve policy makers concluded in 
their may meeting that inflation posed too great a danger to allow 
interest rates to decline minutes of the meeting released friday 
show 
the 8weekold records were made available amid signs that the 
policy makers decided at their most recent gathering on monday and 
tuesday to shift their policy and stand ready to nudge interest 
rates lower if the economy weakens further 
unidentified government officials were quoted by the wall street 
journal friday as saying they believed the directive adopted 
earlier this week allows a relaxation of the tight credit policy if 
additional signs of economic sluggishness emerge 
analysts were split over whether the june employment report 
released friday by the labor department provided such evidence the 
unemployment rate slipped from 53 percent to 52 percent but 
nonfarm job growth was a weakerthanexpected 40000 
in may members of the federal open market committee voted 101 
to maintain the existing credit policy and directed central bank 
officials to be equally ready to raise or lower rates depending on 
developments on inflation and economic growth 
members agreed that current information on business conditions 
pointed on balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic 
expansion at the same time the members generally agreed that 
the prospects for significant reductions in inflation pressures 
during the quarters immediately ahead were not promising 
lee hoskins president of the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
and a prominent advocate of a tough antiinflation policy voted 
against the directive he argued for a tighter credit policy to 
help assure that progress would be made toward a reduced rate of 
inflation 
hoskins said tighter credit would enhance the credibility and 
effectiveness of monetary policy in countering the persisting 
strength of inflationary pressures according to the minutes 
other members who were not identified went along with the 
directive but said the need to contain and ultimately to reduce 
inflation might well require a firming of policy at some point 
the federal reserve has been fighting inflation with higher 
interest rates since early 1988 in mid1989 it began nudging rates 
down amid concern the economy might topple into a recession 
however since late december the fed has held steady the 
federal funds rate the interest charged among banks for overnight 
loans has been 825 percent since then 
in recent weeks bush administration officials who are counting 
on continued economic growth to bolster republican chances during 
the november congressional elections have stepped up public 
pressure on the central bank to lower rates 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady told reporters thursday 
that the fed should not wait for a budget deficit reduction 
agreement between the administration and congress but should lower 
rates now to counter any dampening effects of higher taxes and less 
government spending 
it seems to me that its not a wise idea to emphasize an 
undying forever attack on inflation if it jeopardizes growth in 
this country he said 
the open market committee comprised of the seven fed governors 
and five of the systems 12 regional bank presidents meets in 
secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy minutes are 
released about six weeks later a few days following the next 
meeting 
there was one vacancy among the governors at the time of the may 
meeting

the united nations should move to ban drift 
net fishing in the open seas if the practice continues to kill 
fish sea birds and dolphins at the rate shown in a study a us 
official said friday 
the deaths from high seas drift netting continue to be of 
great concern to the united states said william fox assistant 
administrator for fisheries at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
i believe we need the statistically reliable sampling that a 
program to be conducted this year will give us but i also believe 
that if the trend shown in last years pilot program continues the 
united nations must insist on an immediate moratorium of this 
practice said fox 
noaa released a preliminary report summarizing figures for 
catches reported by nine us five canadian and 32 japanese 
observers aboard highseas drift net vessels from june to december 
of last year the study was conducted by agreement between the 
united states japan and canada he said 
the commerce department agency reported 59060 albacore tuna 
58100 blue sharks 9173 sea birds and 914 dolphins were captured 
incidental to fishing operations 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash said the numbers confirm my 
worst fears wholesale destruction of our marine resources 
perhaps most distressing this new data has been withheld from 
the public and congress for the past six months while the 
administration negotiated with these foreign countries to conduct 
more studies she said 
we dont need more studies we need to ban high seas drift 
nets 
the agency said the pilot project covered only 4 percent of the 
japanese commercial squid drift net fishery and did not include 
vessels from south korea or taiwan and so is not conclusive for the 
entire fishery 
the program is scheduled to expand this year to cover the korean 
and taiwanese drift net fleets and to have additional observers in 
the japanese fleet altogether the agency said there will be 
three times as many observers as in the pilot program last year 
the united nations with us support has already recommended a 
ban on large scale open sea drift net fishing beginning in mid1992 
drift nets of up to 30 miles long have been used increasingly by 
japan taiwan and south korea in recent years to catch squid the 
incidental catch of other species especially salmon that originate 
in the united states has caused protests from the american fishing 
industry 
in 1987 congress required the commerce department and state 
department to negotiate monitoring and enforcement agreements with 
nations engaged in drift net fishing in the north pacific 
agreements for a twoyear phased monitoring program were signed 
last year 
the nets are invisible to sea life as they float from a cork 
line scooping down as deep as 50 feet 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said earlier that the noaa data 
was based on reports from observers who boarded only 32 boats in 
the 460boat japanese fleet 
the house has approved a bill that would ban drift net fishing 
and a similar measure has cleared the senate commerce committee 
tina harper a director in the washington office of the 
environmental investigation agency a londonbased conservation 
group said that organizations study showed 100000 dolphins 
killed every year in drift nets she said an analysis based on a 
un food and agriculture organization report indicated the figure 
could be between 300000 and a million

president ion iliescu resigned friday 
from the national salvation front the party that was swept to 
power by the december revolution and led to victory by iliescu in 
the may national elections 
the front under the charismatic leadership of iliescu and prime 
minister petre roman has dominated government since decembers 
violent ouster of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
iliescu resigned from the party to conform with a temporary 
electoral law enacted by the former provisional parliament that 
stipulates that the president cannot be a leader of a political 
party 
although the law does not apply to ministers foreign minister 
adrian nastase joined iliescu in resigning from the party friday 
a communique issued by the front said the party will be led by 
its five vice presidents until a congress expected in september 
when a new party president will be chosen to replace iliescu the 
five are bogdan patrascu ns dumitru sorin vornicu claudiu 
iordache and constantin costescu 
patrascu said the party would be willing to discuss iliescus 
readmittance if he should ever again wish to run for national 
president 
although bitterly opposed by many intellectuals and accused by 
opposition members of being a neocommunist iliescu received more 
than 80 percent of the vote in the race for the national presidency 
in another development the romania libera daily newspaper ran a 
frontpage appeal for concrete steps leading towards the 
reunification of soviet moldavia and romania 
the communique signed by six organizations favoring 
reunification also called for free movement across the frontier 
the soviet union occupied bessarabia then a part of romania in 
june 1940 and annexed it as the soviet republic of moldavia 
demands for the return of the region have increased since the 
ouster of the communists and a corresponding rise in nationalism 
the government has been cool to the idea of reunification but the 
media have increasingly promoted the concept

time is running out for farmers to refund up 
to 400 million in advance crop subsidies they received from the 
federal government in 1988 and 1989 when they were hit by drought 
the oftdelayed deadline for giving back the advance deficiency 
payments is july 31 and no change in the repayment date is likely 
this time 
the deadline already has been put off three times and sen kent 
conrad dnd tried unsuccessfully this spring to get congress to 
forgive the debt for some farmers who faced drought again this year 
its something kent tried very very hard to accomplish but 
wasnt able to do so said conrads press secretary laurie 
boeder 
county offices of the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service are to send notices later this month to the 
farmers who owe the refunds said ascs spokesman ray wagoner 
each spring the agriculture department will advance to farmers 
40 percent of the deficiency payments they expect to receive that 
year for wheat corn and other crops in the government farm program 
however if market prices rise during the year as they did 
during 1988 and 1989 and the deficiency payments are smaller than 
projected the farmers are required to refund the overpayments 
usda estimates that farmers who lost crops to the 1988 and 1989 
droughts owe 403 million in refunds corn growers owe 210 million 
and wheat producers owe 89 million 
conrad who believes the total is more like 200 million tried 
twice in may to amend an emergency appropriations bill to write off 
the 308 million in refunds he predicted would be owed by farmers 
who are likely to go through drought again this year 
the forgiveness would have applied only to advances that farmers 
received for crops that were never produced because of the drought 
farmers would still owe refunds on crops they produced 
many of these people virtually have no opportunity to pay back 
the advanced deficiency payments which they have received said 
sen tom daschle dsd during one of the debates 
in arguing for his amendment conrad said there probably would 
not be another bill that could reach the presidents desk in time 
to beat the deadline 
hes still looking for a vehicle that might get through the 
process in time boeder said this week 
although the deadline is july 31 usda will not charge interest 
on the amount it is owed for 30 days boeder said for the next 90 
days the government will charge 9 percent interest after that 
the rate goes to 12 percent she said

israels new defense minister intends to reduce 
the militarys presence in the occupied lands in an effort to break 
the stalemated peace process and avoid talks with the plo a report 
said friday 
the hebrewlanguage daily yediot ahronot said the move by 
defense minister moshe arens is also aimed at avoiding a possible 
cutback in us aid that is feared if the peace process does not 
progress 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh refused to confirm or deny 
the newspaper report 
if confirmed the relaxation would be a major departure from 
pledges by the new rightwing government to increase military 
measures to combat palestinian unrest in the occupied territories 
the plan is being prepared by arens as it becomes apparent that 
the ussupported idea of preliminary israelipalestinian peace 
talks in cairo has failed wrote ron benyishai a respected 
military commentator 
israeli hardliners have rejected the american proposal fearing 
it would mean negotiations with plo representatives 
israel views the palestine liberation organization as a 
terrorist organization but palestinians insist the plo is their 
sole legitimate representative 
the bush administration has shown an increasing impatience with 
israels reluctance to begin the preliminary talks 
bush speaking friday at a press conference at the conclusion of 
the twoday nato summit in london urged israel to take action 
there has got to be talks and we have got to go forward 
he said id like to think that israel would now move forward 
again 
the newspaper report said arens wants to bypass the talks and 
plo participation by initiating a series of confidencebuilding 
measures in the occupied territories that would culminate in 
municipal elections 
arens reportedly said he hopes to then enter into direct 
negotiations with elected city officials over israeli proposals to 
grant palestinians limited autonomy benyishai said 
according to yediot the confidencebuilding measures include a 
partial troop pullback from palestinian population centers a 
longstanding demand by palestinian leaders 
naveh said such a pullback was not ruled out 
our prescence in towns and refugee camps is contingent on the 
level of palestinian violence he said 
late last month arens ordered troops redeployed along main 
roads in the occupied territories emphasizing travel security for 
jewish settlers at the expense of patrols in palestinian towns 
he has made a number of other goodwill gestures in recent 
weeks two colleges were opened by the army last month and two 
others are due to open next week 
the army closed palestinian universities and colleges shortly 
after the start of the 30month uprising contending they were 
hotbeds of unrest 
in other developments two palestinians suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities were discovered dead in the 
occupied territories 
in a village near the occupied west bank town of tulkarem the 
body of 45yearold khaled mustafa toubeh was discovered arab 
reporters said 
they said toubeh had been kidnapped by masked palestinian 
activists in may and was slain on suspicion of cooperating with 
israeli authorities 
the army said it was checking the report 
in the occupied gaza strip 22yearold fadi abu aziz was found 
dead thursday the englishlanguage jerusalem post newspaper 
reported the paper said he was killed on suspicion of cooperating 
with israeli authorities 
the deaths raise the number of suspected collaborators killed by 
fellow palestinians to 232 at least 721 palestinians have also 
died of israeli gunfire during the uprising and 45 israelis have 
been slain

police attacked demonstrators friday in 
albanias capital near the embassy district where up to 4000 
asylumseekers jammed diplomatic missions albanias communist boss 
offered no generosity for defectors 
about 10000 albanians gathered in a central square following 
earlier protests demanding that leaders of the last hardline 
communist nation in eastern europe adopt major reforms according 
to a sketchy report from tirana by the austria press agency 
this rally remained silent however some demonstrators on its 
periphery scattered when police charged only to regroup according 
to the austrian agency which reported no injuries 
the apa reporter one of the few foreign correspondents in 
albania witnessed no other attacks 
the clash occurred in skanderbeg square not far from a 
sealedoff area of tirana containing embassies that became havens 
for albanians last week 
diplomats said more than 2300 albanians were holed up inside 
more than a dozen embassies one western diplomat contacted in 
tirana from athens put the number at up to 4000 and reported 
grave food and water supply problems 
at a crisis meeting of the communist party central comittee 
party leader ramiz alia assailed the refugeseekers and made clear 
albanias communists were not thinking of yielding power 
what is of fundamental importance is the fact that the masses 
should be led by the party said alia in comments reported by 
albanias state ata news agency 
there is no room for generosity in dealing with those who 
refused to leave the embassies he said 
the aims and actions of these destructive antidemocratic and 
antialbanian forces go too far we may be poor undoubtedly we 
have difficulties and shortages but the foreigner has never solved 
our troubles 
under 45 years of hardline communist rule travel for average 
albanians has been virtually impossible as the countrys late 
leader enver hoxha steered his 32 million people into increasing 
isolation 
but under alia who took over after hoxhas death in 1985 the 
country has increasingly sought ties abroad and has begun 
implementing some cautious reforms 
alia has given no hint the leadership was considering any form 
of political plurality of the kind now in place in formerly 
monolithic communist countries in europe 
alia pledged continued reforms friday but said only the 
communist party could realize the genuine democracy the human 
rights the countrys progress and the defense of its freedom and 
independence 
he promised a new election law but strongly implied it would 
not affect the communist partys monopoly on power the meeting 
will continue saturday 
the rush on the embassies continued friday even after the 
government repeated a pledge to issue travel documents for everyone 
seeking to leave the country 
many albanians with passports and exit visas were seeking entry 
visas from the various embassies some came and left during the 
day others mistrustful of their governments pledges joined 
those already holed up for days said diplomats 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
conditions were getting worse inside some of the embassies 
west german officials in bonn said well over 1000 
asylumseekers were in their tirana embassy an employee of the 
italian embassy in tirana said the number there had grown to 700 by 
evening other officials said the french embassy held 400 and the 
polish and czechoslovak embassies about 50 each 
authorities have rebuffed attempts by foreign governments to 
send supplies 
refugees began fleeing into the west german embassy on sunday 
night albanian guards shot and wounded two of them that night the 
bonn foreign ministry said it said from 30 to 40 asylumseekers 
were injured monday night as they crashed their truck into the west 
german compound to gain entry 
an italian embassy employee reached from rome described the 
situation on the crowded embassy grounds as more tragic than 
comic this is an embassy designed for 10 people you can 
imagine what conditions are like 
apa said embassies were growing short of food and medicine 
a hungarian diplomat describing the situation in the 
neighboring french mission said it was jammed with many sleeping 
in the embassy garden 
the sometimes violent rush to the embassies follows last years 
exodus of east germans to embassies in other east european 
countries shortly before the fall of east germanys hardline 
government 
the albanian foreign ministry on thursday promised to grant 
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in a 
desperate attempt to flee their homeland 
hundreds more continued to gather outside embassies and gained 
entry to embassy compounds 
west german and hungarian diplomats said police were not 
preventing people from approaching their embassies and were 
allowing relatives to talk to the refugees through embassy compound 
fences 
a package of new regulations entitling all albanians over the 
age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel took effect 
tuesday it did not check the flow of asylumseekers 
most of the albanians who fled to foreign embassies before 
thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began monday under 
fire from albanian security forces diplomats said at least three 
people were wounded 
ata denied there were casualties

more people than normal were at work 
in a section of a chemical plant that exploded into flames killing 
17 people because a contract cleaning crew was on the job 
some terrified workers at the arco chemical co plant were able 
to flee to safety 
we were running through the mud just as fast as we could get 
out of there said tommy mcbridge a plant worker who survived 
the blast late thursday we knew what it was 
we just heard a big explosion and everybody said run and we 
all took off said marlene viscus another plant worker 
a oneblock area of the arco plant exploded and burned for four 
hours before firefighters doused the flames 
ordinarily only about five of the 50 arco employees working at 
the plant at that time would have been in the area of the 
explosion manager earl mccaleb said the others were contract 
cleaning workers from austin industrial inc who were in for work 
done sporadically at the plant 
we use some contract workers in the plant for certain 
operations said earle bradford vice president of public affairs 
at arco chemicals headquarters in newtown pa he said he was 
unaware of any problems occurring when contract workers were used 
the oil chemical amp atomic workers union has been critical of 
petroleum companies use of contract workers 
last year a phillips petroleum co plant in nearby pasadena 
exploded killing 23 phillips and contract workers and injuring 130 
others union officials said the use of contract workers 
unfamiliar with operations contributed to safety hazards at the 
plant 
the plant arco chemicals largest produces intermediate 
chemicals used in the manufacture of seat cushions bedding paints 
and urethane packaging and gasoline additives bradford said 
the plant provides about 560 million pounds of propylene oxide 
a building block chemical used to make seat cushions and 
bedding and 13 billion pounds of styrene monomer used to make 
drinking cups and automotive parts each year 
in addition the plant produces about 20000 barrels a day of 
methyl tertiary butyl ether a gasoline additive used as an octane 
enhancer arco is the worlds largest producer of mtbe said al 
greenstein spokesman for los angelesbased arco parent company of 
arco chemical 
its not the only mtbe plant but we are the worlds largest 
manufacturer of mtbe and this is obviously a major plant for 
mtbe greenstein said 
the plant originally was built as oxirane chemical co a joint 
venture between arco chemical co and halcon international in 1974 
with production beginning in 1977 halcon sold its interest to arco 
chemical in 1980

an immigration hearing for arthur rudolph an 
83yearold us rocket scientist and alleged nazi war criminal 
was postponed friday after a dispute over who could attend the 
hearing 
the hearing is to determine whether rudolph can remain in canada 
as a visitor 
rudolph who was chief coordinator of the us space agencys 
saturn v rocket program that put the first man on the moon was 
detained on his arrival sunday from west germany and ordered to 
appear at an immigration hearing 
rudolph left the united states in 1984 in a deal with the us 
government he renounced his us citizenship and admitted his 
complicity in war crimes according to the us office of special 
investigation that allowed him to keep his pension from the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
he went to west germany where a government attempt to prosecute 
him for war crimes failed to turn up enough evidence 
rudolph now says he was coerced into the agreement to leave the 
united states and wants to return to clear his name 
rudolph appeared before anthony iozzo an adjudicator for the 
canadian immigration service but in nearly three hours of debate 
the only topic was whether the news media and two jewish 
organizations would be able to attend and who would get the 14 
chairs reserved for spectators in the tiny hearing room 
rudolphs attorney barbara kulaszka moved for adjournment 
citing her clients fatigue and her need to study documents just 
given to her by the three federal attorneys presenting the 
governments case at the hearing 
the next session was set for wednesday 
on advice from his lawyer rudolph refused to speak to 
reporters as did his wife and daughter 
us immigration officials had accused rudolph of working 
thousands of slave laborers to death to building v2 missiles for 
the nazis during world war ii 
rudolph a former nazi party member says he did not persecute 
laborers during his work on v2s

faced with complaints from lech walesa and 
other critics the prime minister friday expelled three 
excommunists from his cabinet and pleaded for political calm 
but tadeusz mazowiecki failed to soften the attacks on his 
government which is struggling to introduce a market economy and 
complete the transition to democracy 
even members of the prime ministers solidarity camp said they 
expected bolder moves to restructure his 10monthold 
solidarityled government 
mazowiecki accepted the resignations of five of 24 cabinet 
ministers including three of the four former communists who were 
included in the government last year as the price for solidarity 
taking power 
the most prominent former communists who departed were interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak and defense minister florian siwicki 
the prime minister used most of his parliamentary address to 
warn against party quarrels and struggles for personal ambitions 
at the expense of the state he said they could rob poland of its 
priceless stability 
the remarks appeared to be a reference to walesa the polish 
labor hero who led the fight against the old communist regime many 
people now believe walesa would like to succeed president wojciech 
jaruzelski another former communist as leader of poland 
in his speech mazowiecki declared i see danger on the 
peaceful polish road to democracy 
the sense of responsibility for the country is getting weaker 
in political life an opponent who should be defeated through 
argument is treated as an enemy to be destroyed he said 
these are occurrences that cannot be tolerated even in the 
most democratic country i appeal for selfcontrol poland needs 
wisdom peace and lawabidingness 
the prime minister appeared to be responding to criticism by 
walesa in ousting the excommunists and calling for parliamentary 
elections much earlier than spring 1991 when they have been 
scheduled 
walesa had no comment on mazowieckis nationally broadcast 
speech 
the solidarity chairman has struck a populist chord with his 
attacks on mazowiecki he has urged faster replacement of 
communists in the government and staterun industries new 
elections to remove communists still in the parliament and quicker 
privatization of state enterprise 
legislators kept up their attacks on the government after 
fridays speech 
sen jaroslaw kaczynki said he was only 30 percent satisfied 
with the changes kaczynki is a walesa ally 
the changes are much too small he should have reconstructed 
the whole government said deputy jan litynski a mazowiecki 
supporter 
litynski and other deputies interviewed urged fully free 
parliamentary elections as soon as possible 
mazowieckis cabinet made history sept 12 when it was seated as 
the east blocs first noncommunist government 
but it has been beset by difficulties the government has faced 
a major rail strike used police to break up two farm protests and 
defended itself against a steady stream of criticism from walesa 
the cabinet changes finally take the police and military forces 
out of the hands of former communists 
gen kiszczaks departure ends a 10year career as interior 
minister he oversaw the imposition of martial law to crush 
solidarity under gen jaruzelski in 1981 and he served as a 
chairman of the 1989 talks that made solidarity legal again 
gen siwicki another jaruzelski loyalist had been defense 
minister since 1983 
the third excommunist to be ousted was transport minister 
franciszek wieladek 
also resigning were agriculture minister czeslaw janicki of the 
peasant party and telecommunications minister marek kucharski of 
the democratic party 
the prime minister nominated four replacements parliament 
accepted krzysztof kozlowski a roman catholic editor who has been 
serving as deputy interior minister as head of that ministry rear 
adm piotr kolodziejczyk the navy chief as defense minister and 
ewaryst waligorski a longtime solidarity activist and deputy to 
the transport minister as the head of that ministry 
artur balazs the minister of rural life and cofounder of the 
farmers union rural solidarity was nominated for agriculture 
minister but failed to win committee approval because of peasant 
party demands that the post go to their group

the nations leadership friday 
warned the republic of slovenia to abandon its declaration of 
regional autonomy saying it threatens yugoslavias federation 
the countrys eightmember presidential council said it will 
take all measures to protect the integrity and sovereignty of 
yugoslavia the state news agency tanjug reported however the 
announcement did not elaborate 
slovenias new freely elected legislature proclaimed its 
autonomy on monday the move was viewed as a further challege to 
yugoslavias fragile communistruled federation 
the authority of the federal leadership has effectively been 
crippled since noncommunist centerright parties won elections 
this year in slovenia and croatia another liberal republic it was 
the first free balloting in yugoslavia in 50 years 
slovenia and croatia are demanding a looser national 
confederation 
the current federation of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces already allows each region to run its own government and 
communist party structure 
the decentralized system of government was devised by the late 
national leader josip broz tito in the 1974 constitution the 
arrangement was intended to prevent one republic from gaining sway 
over the others but ethnic and economic differences are again 
threatening the countrys unity 
in its statement friday the presidencial council said the 
slovenian declaration jeopardizes collective yugoslav interests 
and the countrys position in the world 
the slovenian declaration calls for the establishment of an 
independent legal system that would take precedence over federal 
laws it also says slovenian authorities should assert control over 
all armed forces stationed on the republics territory

as each port of call was reached the captain went through the 
motions of trying to get them off said dandrea they tried 
sending them ashore in trinidad gibralter naples italy and some 
other ports but they didnt succeed 
under us immigration law stowaways are the responsibility of 
the ship on which they are found said immigration and

the state bought its first 10acre 
parcel of land friday for construction of the superconducting super 
collider a mammoth 8 billion atom smasher 
more than 16000 acres still have to be acquired from more than 
700 ellis county landowners just south of dallas for the worlds 
largest scientific instrument 
the collider will be a 54mile underground ring in which 
protons will be accelerated to nearly the speed of light while 
superconducting magnets force them to travel a circle two groups 
of protons will be smashed together scientists hope the resulting 
wreckage of subatomic particles will offer new clues to the 
fundamentals of matter 
the first parcel was sold by retired banker er tut morris and 
his wife tommie morris of the dallas suburb of balch springs for 
45000 
the morrises drew applause when they removed a contract 
pending banner from a sign revealing contract sold 
underneath 
i think its a good thing for the history of the us and for 
ellis county and dallas county said morris were very pleased 
with the price 
the land was purchased for the state by the texas national 
research laboratory commission which proposed the ellis county 
site for the collider to the us department of energy 
ownership eventually will be transferred to the federal 
government 
the government is expected to spend 40 million to 100 million 
for 10000 acres of land and rights to the land underneath an 
additional 7000 acres acquisition is expected to be completed in 
1992 
phillip stafford associate director for site development said 
the commission hasnt yet encountered landowners unwilling to sell 
the process anticipates that there will be those who may not 
be a willing seller stafford said our commission and other 
state agencies or federal agencies have the power of eminent domain 
to ensure the project is not held up for those reasons 
hoyt gaston who owns 100 acres says hell be willing to sell 
if the price is right 
ill be satisfied if i get a deal as good as morris got 
he said gaston is expecting an appraisal on his land in about a 
month 
in may the house voted to build the collider and limited the 
federal governments share in the giant science project to 5 
billion 
costs above 5 billion would be left to texas which has pledged 
1 billion and other sources including foreign investors 
the collider scheduled to be completed in 1998 is expected to 
provide 4500 jobs during construction and 2500 permanently

any single accident of this dimension where weve had multiple loss 
of life to the extent we had here said jack johnson president 
of arco chemical of north america it certainly is a time that 
all of the employees and myself grieve the loss of fellow 
employees one loss of life is not acceptable 
assistant us secretary of labor gerard f scannell arrived at 
the plant friday afternoon to lead a federal investigation of the 
accident scannell said the occupational safety and health 
administration would conduct a comprehensive inspection

people as far as 20 miles away reported hearing the blast at the 
plant which has more than 350 employees 
i seen a big flash cross in front of my eyes i looked over to 
my left and i saw a big ball of fire it looked to me like a 
tank run off you know like a rocket just took off said mike 
zugel a truck driver 
i was in a trailer and i was sitting down about to get up and 
it sounded like a car ran into the side of the trailer said 
tommy mcbridge who was working at a janitorial service not far

explosion just orange flames 
it sounded like somebody was breaking the house in said 
deborah baumbach who lives six miles from the blast site 
plant manager earl mccaleb said two tanks that collected waste 
water and chemicals exploded for an unknown reason the larger tank 
held 900000 gallons he said the company had no capacity figure

the tanker exxon valdez source of the nations 
worst oil spill is headed back to sea after repairs to its 
shredded hull but it wont be going back to alaska and its name 
will be changed officials said friday 
the vessel that spilled nearly 11 million gallons in alaskas 
prince william sound will be called the exxon mediterranean when it 
returns to duty due next month said exxon shipping co president 
gus elmer 
due to declining alaskan crude oil the vessel will enter 
foreign service most likely loading crude in the mediterranean or 
the middle east it is consistent with our policy that the vessels 
be named according to their location elmer said 
he declined to say that the environmental disaster in alaska 16 
months ago was a major factor in renaming the vessel and changing 
its use 
it is strictly an economics decision he said 
alaska environmental commissioner dennis kelso however said he 
believes the name change is due as much to public relations as 
economics 
i think the key question is what kind of tankers do we have 
operating worldwide kelso said the accident happened here 
but it could have happened in puget sound or san francisco bay 
wherever tankers transport crude or its byproducts 
what broke down here was the system and the tanker was part of 
it 
former exxon shipping co president frank iarossi acknowledged 
concerns that the ships association with the disaster may make it 
unwelcome in alaskan ports he said last summer that the tanker 
might be renamed and possibly put to work elsewhere 
the tanker ran aground on a reef on march 24 1989 ripping the 
bottom of its hull open and spilling oil that polluted hundreds of 
miles of coastline and killed scores of animals 
the 987foot ship has been undergoing 30 million in repairs 
since august in a national steel and shipbuilding co dry dock in 
san diego the company built the ship in 1986 
the ships ready shes going smoothly said national steel 
spokesman fred hallett were finishing the painting on it right 
now and were doing some work in the machinery room 
a coast guard inspector lt bill uberti said national steel is 
scheduled to begin two weeks of trial runs after it is floated out 
of dry dock on july 20 
if theres a problem theyll have to fix it before it can go 
out into service but i dont anticipate any problems uberti 
said the only damage to the ship was structurally and thats 
all been fixed 
the repair work included installation of 3000 tons of new 
inchthick steel hull plates on the 30000ton tanker 
the ship had a single hull meaning only one layer of steel 
stood between its cargo and the open water 
exxon officials declined to retrofit the ship with a double hull 
because it was not feasible from an engineering standpoint exxon 
spokeswoman carrie chasin said in march 
but hallett said the ship could have been fitted with a double 
hull the question is the cost and the time he said 
kelso said he favors double hulls 
the fact the exxon valdez is being reassigned i expect it 
will always be known by its former name and bottom leads to the 
question do we have vessels operating worldwide that have all the 
protection they should have the alaskan official said

a national endowment for the arts advisory 
panel has denounced the agencys rejection of four grant 
recommendations and is urging reconsideration of the decision the 
panel chairman said friday 
i think it is really an issue of censorship said phillip 
arnoult founder and artistic director of the theatre project a 
performing arts center in baltimore 
the panel that advises the nea on financing solo performing 
artists met by conference call thursday and plans to issue a 
statement wednesday in new york arnoult had originally asked the 
nea to reconvene the panel so panel members could resign in protest 
if they chose no panel members have quit so far 
arnoult refused to discuss the statement the panel plans to 
issue but he said at least two of those whose recommended grants 
were vetoed would be present the nea accepted the panels 
recommendation of 14 other grants 
in protest of the rejection of the four grants one recipient 
rachel rosenthal refused her grant for 11250 last week arnoult 
said he did not know if any of the other 13 would renounce the 
money 
they may follow new york performance artist richard elovichs 
suggestion that each of the grantees donate part of their money to 
the four arnoult said 
the rejection of solo performance grants announced june 29 has 
created a furor in the arts world and prompted calls for the 
resignation of nea chairman john e frohnmayer 
some critics contend that frohnmayer vetoed the grants to try to 
pacify congress members outraged by the federal financing of 
provocative works 
congress is scheduled to debate neas funding this month some 
lawmakers are calling for the agencys abolition 
jessica andrews director of the endowments theater program 
declined to comment friday frohnmayer also had no comment 
the four artists who did not receive grants recommended by the 
advisory panel are karen finley holly hughes john fleck and tom 
miller the grants ranged from 5000 to 11250 each 
miller finley hughes and fleck all deal with political and 
sexual issues in provocative ways 
fleck urinated or appeared to urinate onstage during one 
performance finley whose work has been singled out for criticism 
by many conservatives in a recent series of performances disrobed 
placed alfalfa sprouts in her crotch and denounced conservative 
sen jesse helms rnc among others 
helms leads the drive to control nea funds 
he was instrumental in the adoption of antiobscenity 
restrictions attached to neas 1990 appropriation which was 
approved amid protests over works such as robert mapplethorpes 
homoerotic photography and andres serranos crucifix submerged in 
urine both of which received federal funds 
arnoult said frohnmayers action overturned a 25year tradition 
of peer review and described past awards of grants as 
statesmanlike 
while im deeply concerned about the careers and reputations 
of these four artists im also very concerned about the moral 
center of the endowment which has worked for 25 years which 
represents a massive amount of public service in the field 
arnoult said 
according to endowment records in seven years before 1989 the 
chairman has reversed advisory panels recommendations on only 35 
of 33700 grants 
the process is so clearly being politically manipulated and 
thats just wrong it censors some of the most talented artists in 
the country said william george producing director of 
touchstone theater in bethlehem pa and a member of the panel 
chaired by arnoult 
you kind of feel a little helpless

president bush arrived in his adopted hometown 
with a smile friday night after ushering his ideas for reshaping 
the western military alliance to quick and easy approval at the 
nato summit in london 
aboard air force one enroute to houston and another round of 
summitry this time with the leaders of the seven most 
industrialized nations bush boasted that the london 
declaration the communique issued earlier in the day by the nato 
leaders was the united states draft and that shaped the new 
direction for nato he said 
in london it was bush who announced at the conclusion of the 
two days of talks among the 16 allied leaders that im pleased 
that my colleagues and i have begun a major transformation of 
the north atlantic alliance and we view it as a historic turning 
point 
the presidents design for a remodeled western alliance gained 
unusually easy approval but he remained in the minority opposed to 
direct financial aid to the soviet union most european nato 
members say such aid would help stabilize a deteriorating soviet 
economy and send a positive political signal bush for his part 
ruled out any direct assistance pending changes in soviet military 
spending and its huge support for cuba but he indicated the united 
states might be willing to accord the kremlin some trading credits 
the soviet aid question is bound to be a major topic at the 
houston economic summit 
during the 10hour flight bush was informed that eduard 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister had said that natos 
decisions move in the right direction and pave the way to a 
safe future for the entire european continent the president said 
of that reaction thats very interesting and very positive 
bush confided he had received a recent communication from soviet 
leader mickhail s gorbachev himself but he merely winked and 
smiled when asked to describe its contents 
in london bush achieved his goal of preserving at least for 
now a nato that is the main instrument of us influence in 
europe while pushing it toward changes that could make it more 
acceptable to the soviet union 
nato has set a new path for peace bush said its kept 
the peace for 40 years and today charted a new course for 
stability and cooperation in europe 
france in particular has promoted the idea of diluting the 
influence of both military blocs nato and the nearly dead warsaw 
pact that the soviets dominated throughout the cold war paris 
wants a paneuropean organization such as the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe to play a bigger role 
bush said the london meeting reaffirmed that nato would survive 
and that while it would relax its military stance it would continue 
to rely on the us nuclear arsenal 
this is indeed a day of renewal for the atlantic community 
bush said for more than 40 years weve looked for this day and 
now that day is here and all peoples from the atlantic to the 
urals from the baltic to the adriatic can share in its promise 
the president managed to overcome initial skepticism from 
britain on his idea of modifying natos nuclear strategy and 
declare that nuclear arms are weapons of last resort but he 
remained at odds with west germany and france on the question of 
whether to provide direct financial aid to the soviet union 
i have big problems with that one bush said adding that he 
did not think the american public would accept sending money to 
moscow as long as soviet defense spending remained high and the 
kremlin continued underwriting fidel castros government in cuba 
bush added however that he would not stand in the way of other 
nato countries that wished to aid the soviets whose economy is in 
a shambles west germany has suggested a 15 billion western aid 
package for moscow the matter is expected to be discussed in more 
detail at the houston economic summit 
if the germans decide they want to do that thats their 
business but i have made very clear to those who have spoken to me 
about this at this juncture we have some serious problems and i 
have not been under any false colors about that at all bush said 
bush also acknowledged that he faced growing opposition in 
congress to keeping a large us troop presence in europe he said 
the nato reforms adopted at the london meeting could help him 
persuade his critics that the troops are necessary 
i view it as my responsibility to make clear to the american 
taxpayer why it is in our interest to help keep the peace and 
thats exactly what these forces are engaged in he said

fang lizhi the chinese dissident who took 
refuge for a year in the us embassy in beijing said the united 
states has a double standard on human rights 
in an interview with nbc news he said the united states was 
less demanding of china on human rights issues than of other 
countries but added of course they are better than before 
the west generally has less knowledge about chinas human rights 
record that it does of eastern europes and the soviet unions 
record he said 
the interview conducted thursday in london was broadcast in 
part on fridays nbc nightly news 
fang an astrophysicist and chinas best known dissident and 
his wife fellow dissident and physicist li shuxian took refuge 
in the embassy after the chinese army put down prodemocracy 
demonstrations on june 34 1989 killing hundreds perhaps 
thousands of people 
chinese authorities accused them of encouraging the protests and 
issued a warrant for their arrest but finally allowed them to 
leave on june 24 for england where fang will be a visiting fellow 
at cambridge university 
bush speaking friday at a news conference in london during the 
nato summit there was asked about fangs remarks alleging a double 
standard 
i dont agree with that i notice some of my critics in the 
united states congress say that and i think they are just as wrong 
as they can be bush said 
he said the united states had taken the lead in condemning the 
abuse of human rights in the suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement in china 
fang also spoke friday with cbs news after his son fang zhe an 
undergraduate at beijing university arrived in london from china 
now that all of his family members are out of china fang who 
has another son attending wayne state university in detroit felt 
free to speak out 
in an interview scheduled for broadcast sunday on nbcs meet 
the press he said he expects democratic change in china within 
the next decade 
chinas leadership wants economic openness but is trying at the 
same time to resist the worldwide trend toward democracy and 
freedom fang said 
fang said the world is getting smaller and mutual influences 
are getting progressively stronger and so the democratic reforms 
under way in eastern europe and the soviet union are certain to 
affect china

the federal governments share of public 
school costs dropped by onethird the last decade the nations 
largest teachers union said friday 
a report by the national education association showed the 
federal government paid 63 percent of the total dollar for public 
elementary and secondary schools this year compared to 92 percent 
in 1980 
with the declining federal support the report noted that state 
and local governments in 198990 added all but about 500 million 
to the 11 billion growth in school revenues over 198889 
according to the report school revenues are reaching the 200 
billion mark the 59 percent increase is the lowest since 1983 and 
leaves virtually no room to meet the costs of school reform and 
restructuring because it nearly matches projected expenditures the 
report showed 
also the report said there will be about 35 million additional 
students by the end of the decade 
local school districts picked up 56 percent of new school 
revenues in 198990 the states developed almost 40 percent of new 
school revenues while the federal government contributed 4 percent 
said the report 
the history of the relative federal contribution to school 
support is on the decline throughout the 1980s congressional 
action to reduce the national deficit will likely exert a 
continuing downward pressure on the federal governments share of 
public school finances and therefore increase pressure on state and 
local governments to meet the expanding financial needs of public 
education the survey said 
local revenues mostly from property taxes account for 50 
percent or more of school revenues in 20 states 
a breakdown by percentage includes 896 in new hampshire 708 
in nebraska 669 in oregon 634 in south dakota 606 in 
virginia 593 in nevada 59 in michigan 582 in vermont 57 in 
colorado and 568 in wisconsin 
also 564 in missouri 563 in maryland 547 in new jersey 
544 in illinois 532 in massachusetts 518 in rhode island 517 
in new york 516 in connecticut 515 in kansas and 502 in

the louisiana house on friday night 
voted to override gov buddy roemers veto of the nations 
strongest state abortion bill which contains no exceptions for 
rape or incest 
the vote was 7230 two more votes than needed for a house veto 
override 
the state senate was expected to vote later friday on overriding 
the veto roemer issued earlier in the day 
if the senate also voted to override it would be the first time 
a louisiana governor has had a veto overridden this century 
the measure would send doctors who perform abortions to jail for 
up to 10 years and fined them up to 100000 it was written for 
the purpose of challenging the 1973 supreme court decision that 
legalized abortion 
also friday antiabortion activists in michigan filed petitions 
with more than 330000 signatures to initiate a bill that would 
require girls to have a parents consent before obtaining an 
abortion 
roemer signed the veto friday morning according to his staff 
attorney john kennedy 
in his veto message roemer called the issue one of the most 
wrenching and divisive issues to be faced by this legislature 
he also responded to charges by backers of the bill that he has 
changed his position on abortion since he was a congressman 
running for governor in 1987 
as a member of congress i consistently voted to curb abortion 
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus roemer wrote in the 
veto message i initially voted for the exception to save the 
life of a mother but over the years of struggling with this issue 
i became acutely aware of the need to except those instances where 
conception occurred because of rape or incest 
women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences 
of these traumatic illegal acts 
roemer has repeatedly said he sides with antiabortion forces 
but cannot allow a bill without rape and incest exceptions to 
become law 
at an afternoon news conference the bills author state rep 
woody jenkins cited statistics showing that of more than 15000 
abortions performed in louisiana in 1987 only one was done to end 
a pregnancy that resulted from rape 
hes for killing 15000 unborn children a year in louisiana 
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also 
killed said jenkins 
robin rothrock leader of an abortion rights coalition said 
earlier she remained confident that the senate would sustain 
roemers veto 
in the senate we believe that we still have the 15 rothrock 
said referring to 15 senators who voted against the measure when 
it passed the senate with 24 votes an override requires a 
twothirds vote in each chamber 26 in the senate and 70 in the 
house 
the house passed the bill last week with 74 votes 
in michigan the legislature will have 40 days to pass the 
vetoproof measure once the petition signatures are validated 
failure of the measure would put the issue on the november 1992 
statewide ballot as a public referendum 
lawmakers passed a similar measure earlier this year but 
couldnt override democratic gov james blanchards veto 
a majority of house and senate members signed the petitions 
said michigan right to life president barbara listing 
the bill would require girls 17 and younger to have a parents 
consent for an abortion or to ask a judge for a waiver on the 
grounds that she is mature enough to make her own decision or the 
abortion would be in her best interest

a small mound of crumpled steel was 
all that remained friday of a threestory storage tank after a 
fatal explosion ripped through the arco chemical co plant 
the roof of the 900000gallon tank loaded with wastewater and 
flammable hydrocarbons blew off in the initial explosion late 
thursday and landed 100 yards away in the parking lot of an 
administration building 
the blast shattered windows in the building and left sheets of 
rumpled steel from the tank throughout the area 
the rest of the collapsed tower was spread over a blockwide 
area in the southern end of the 564acre complex 
two vehicles a vacuum truck from waste processors industries 
inc and a tractortrailer stood on their wheel rims at the north 
end of the area their tires melted into gooey globs of tar 
nearby blackened rubble remained of a portable air compressor the 
size of a boxcar 
ive been to a lot of fires at plants but this was a hot 
fire dennis calhoun an arco employee said during a tour of the 
area friday afternoon 
arco investigators were sifting through the twisted black metal 
in hopes of finding the cause of the explosion that claimed the 
lives of 17 workers including the driver of the vacuum truck 
a mesh of overhead pipes that led into the area resembled a 
toppled erector set six cooling towers for a nearby cogeneration 
plant stood idle under gray cloudy skies after the explosion ripped 
off panels 
firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze that could be 
felt as far as 20 miles away calhoun said 
a holding basin adjacent to the wastewater tank contained a 
black watery liquid spewing from the tanks and helped curb the 
blaze calhoun said the liquid will be tested before it can be 
disposed he said 
a smaller tank next to the one that exploded remained standing 
but was scorched and completely blackened

three crippled monkeys the subject of 
court fights by animal rights activists for nine years were 
humanely put to death friday after final experiments involving 
sensory perception officials said 
the three monkeys were among seven remaining animals seized from 
a silver spring md laboratory in 1981 they were part of a study 
of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation financed by the 
national institutes of health researchers had cut the sensory 
nerves to the animals left arms 
the silver spring monkeys have been kept at tulane universitys 
delta regional primate research center since they were seized by 
the government 
the way for the final experiments was cleared tuesday when a 
federal appeals court in washington rejected attempts by the 
physicians committee for responsible medicine to save them 
each monkey was put under deep surgical anesthesia said tulane 
medical center spokeswoman debbie grant while asleep electrodes 
were inserted in their brains to monitor signals produced when 
parts of the body were touched 
it was the same as the experiment performed on another silver 
spring monkey in january to test a theory that parts of the brain 
that are no longer used for one function might take over other 
functions 
the nerve endings to the monkeys arms were severed nine years 
ago in a study of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation the 
researchers wanted to know whether the part of the brain that was 
no longer used to sense feeling in the arms would start responding 
to stimuli on other parts of the body 
in the january experiment the unused part of the brain was 
found to respond when other parts of the body were touched the 
results of fridays experiments were not immediately known 
after the experiment while the monkeys were asleep they were 
put to death by lethal injection ms grant said no pain was 
involved 
conducting the experiments were tim pons of the national 
institutes of health and preston garraghty of vanderbilt university 
the decision for euthanasia was made because of the monkeys 
physical condition ms grant said unable to feel pain they had 
bitten and otherwise injured their arms sometimes severely 
the monkeys had been at the center of controversy since an 
animal rights group claimed they were being mistreated in 
experiments sponsored by the nih that led to the silver spring 
raid and charges of animal cruelty against dr edward taub whose 
conviction was overturned on appeal

wildfires charred about 400 square 
miles of alaska forests and tundra by friday and still threatened 
the town of tok where firefighters kept up a housetohouse battle 
against winddriven flames 
were afraid the fire will blow back down in a different 
direction said rob mcwhorter of the bureau of land management in 
tok a crossroads town on the alaska highway 80 miles from the 
canadian border 
the gusty winds that fanned flames around tok in recent days 
eased and the fires growth slowed but officials told residents to 
remain prepared to evacuate 
the fire which grew to more than 53 square miles leaped trees 
and fire lines thursday to come within a quartermile of some homes 
before sweeping northwest of town when the flames got that close 
some 300 of the towns 1200 residents evacuated most returned to 
their houses friday mcwhorter said 
firefighters widened fire lines friday but the blaze remained 
close 
in some cases there are some spot fires on the edge of town 
left over from yesterday mcwhorter said 
its not under control but the fire quieted down overnight 
said sue mitchell a spokeswoman for an interagency fire center in 
fairbanks the fire created its own lightning storm which dropped 
a little rain on the area it wasnt much but it helped a little 
bit 
a report thursday that toks coast guard navigational station 
burned was incorrect it only lost power the station was back on 
line early friday after the seven crewman stationed there returned 
to the unit 
our priority for today is to continue to defend the community 
to rebuild and expand lines on the flanks of the town mcwhorter 
said 
statewide an estimated 1200 firefighters were deployed as 37 
new fires friday brought to 184 the number burning out of control 
across alaskas interior said pat flowers an interagency 
spokesman 
the blazes consumed at least 253500 acres or 396 square miles 
flowers said 
gov steve cowper declared a statewide emergency and called on 
the alaska national guard to help fight the fires 
most of the fires were blamed on nearrecord heat low humidity 
and lightning strikes 
hot dry conditions were forecast to continue across alaskas 
midsection stirring up afternoon thunderstorms with unpredictable 
wind 
the winds are highly variable swinging like 90 degrees on the 
compass within a 60second period mcwhorter said thats one 
of the most dangerous combinations for firefighters you can 
possibly dream up 
the fire burned mainly black spruce birch aspen and brush on 
the flat terrain around tok where some residents wore masks to 
filter out smoke 
whats bothering us the most is breathing theres burnt 
spruce needles falling out of the air said one resident mellie 
terwilliger you can see but you go around with your lights on 
authorities closed two main roads thursday but traffic resumed 
early friday tok is about 260 miles northeast of anchorage at the 
junction of the glenn and alaska highways 
the cassiar creek fire 52 miles north of fairbanks charred 
about 2000 acres by early friday and threatened several 
structures none were threatened by another fire covering about 47 
square miles near beaver 110 miles north of fairbanks or by the 
780acre pedro dome fire also north of fairbanks

of two to fly to a clandestine airstrip in viterbo a small town in 
colombia near medellin a center for colombian cocaine trafficking

were found outside city bank amp trusts main office and two more 
bundles were found at a commercial national bank branch said 
bradford 
he said a fort polk demolition expert and one from the fire 
departments bomb squad had to deal with them because a bomb 
demolition robot failed to work 
suited up in about 65 pounds of bulletproof headtotoe armor 
the soldiers olive drab and the firemans black in case the 
bombs were real after all they went in and took polaroid 
photographs of the bundles

more than two dozen police officers rousted 
some 100 transients out of their illegal encampment across from 
city hall before dawn friday the deadline for mayor art agnos 
eviction order 
a few hours after the raid at civic center plaza where five 
people were arrested mothers wheeled their babies on the paths 
old men sat on benches reading newspapers and chatting and kids 
fed the pigeons there 
the plazas occupation by the homeless for more than two years 
seemed like it had never taken place 
i think this is very nice said a broadly smiling jack 
richards who moved to san francisco from ohio 20 years ago this 
is the way it used to be without the conflict the yelling the 
screaming 
some of the homeless had lived under the trees in the plaza one 
of san franciscos showplace sites 
the liberal mayor who had been under heavy pressure to restore 
the plaza to general public use promised months ago to find 
housing for the homeless whether they liked it or not one man was 
carried away in his sleeping bag 
keith mchenry of the food not bombs group was arrested and 
booked on a charge of interfering with police other charges 
included misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and illegal 
distribution of food police said 
some of the hardcore homeless who refused to leave the plaza 
and ignored the friday deadline called their home under the trees 
camp agnos 
five homeless people went to court friday asking a judge to 
order a stop to the arrests the five claimed that the city law 
against camping in parks violates dueprocess rights and that the 
arrests are cruel and unusual punishment because homeless people 
have nowhere else to go 
superior court judge john dearman refused without comment their 
request for a temporary restraining order but set a july 23 
hearing ordering the city to explain why a preliminary injunction 
should not be issued 
the plaza is bounded on the west by city hall the north by the 
earthquakeruined state office building the south by the civic 
auditorium and the east by the main public library 
as far as 25yearold dale forbis was concerned life in the 
middle of san franciscos seat of government was good enough for 
him and his wife patricia they moved to san francisco from 
chicago four years ago 
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness forbis said 
thats what this country was all about so why cant i pursue my 
happiness the way i choose as long as im not bothering anyone 
he said he has refused to take advantage of two city 
multiservice centers opened this week they like living in the 
streets 
living a hard life often on the edge of violence many of the 
homeless said they had formed strong friendships 
we have a small town here said oscar amezquita 33 who

the government on friday ordered hawaiibased 
discovery airways closed down in one week accusing the 3monthold 
carrier of violating us laws on foreign ownership 
the transportation department ordered the airline to cancel its 
flights and inform passengers how to obtain refunds or alternate 
transportation 
the department said it agreed with an administrative law judge 
that discoverys officers have consistently provided false 
information and have violated the terms of their temporary 
operating authority and federal law 
transportation secretary samuel skinner announced revocation of 
discoverys temporary operating authority nearly seven months 
before its scheduled expiration 
skinner said the carrier which operates six planes failed to 
show any credible inclination to correct problems with its 
ownership and control 
federal law allows us airlines to have no more than 25 percent 
foreign ownership and requires that they be controlled by us 
citizens 
discovery is 75 percent owned by philip ho president of the 
japanese nansay corps hawaii operations other airlines in the 
area claim that nansay bankrolled hos stake in discovery 
discovery has operated for three months on several interisland 
routes in competition with both hawaiian and aloha airlines those 
carriers claim that discovery is financed by japanese interests and 
run largely by an italian citizen 
in hawaii discovery president don straight said we do not 
agree with their evaluation the decision by the dot appears to 
run directly contrary to airline deregulation he said 
our primary concern is for our customers employees and 
shareholders straight said our objective today will be to see 
if this airline can continue to fly if that is not possible we 
will meet our obligations to our passengers employees and 
vendors 
finally it is our feeling that the real losers in this 
decision are the interisland travelers in the state of hawaii 
straight added airlines are public utilities which provide a 
service to the people this decision by the dot denies the public 
an opportunity to choose and is a disservice to us all 
the administrative law judge ronnie a yoder declared last 
month that cancellation of discoverys permit to operate would 
appear to be a more appropriate action than granting the airline 
a requested extension 
lawyers assigned by the departments public counsel section had 
proposed an arrangement with discovery that would have allowed it 
to operate but yoder recommended against the settlement the judge 
said the carrier had admitted to substantial prior 
misrepresentations when it applied for a permit 
the judge said the fact that the proposed settlement included 
sale of a share in the airline to qualify it as a us carrier was 
an admission that it had operated from its inception as a 
nonus citizen air carrier in violation of the federal aviation 
act and that its submissions to the department were false and 
constituted misrepresentation in violation of federal law 
the department gave discovery until next friday to end its 
service that deadline was set in order to avoid inconvenience to 
travelers spokesman ed ohara said 
if the airline wants to continue to seek a permanent license it 
may proceed with an evidentiary hearing before the law judge the 
spokesman said 
skinner said discovery was given a temporary authority because 
of the departments policy of promoting new entry and competition 
in the airline business 
but he said the airline failed to establish a voting trust that 
would have insulated it from possible foreign control 
the administrative law judge also cited evidence that franco 
mancassola an italian citizen is effectively discoverys 
executive vice president earning twice as much as its president 
hawaiian airlines has filed a 99 million suit against the new 
airline claiming lost revenue because of discoverys allegedly 
fraudulent actions

some women are looking over their shoulders 
while walking through midtown manhattan because of a mysterious 
attacker known as the dartman on friday he hit his 52nd victim 
police said 
over the last 10 days the dartman so dubbed by the citys 
tabloid newspapers has repeatedly blown homemade darts at the 
backs and buttocks of welldressed women 
not all of the darts have met their mark some becoming 
entangled in clothing no one has been seriously hurt 
on friday police commissioner lee brown appealed for help from 
the public since the attacker always has struck during daylight in 
the most crowded part of town somebody must have seen him do 
it brown said 
at this time its a nuisance he said adding it doesnt 
make sense we want to put a stop to it 
theres enough to worry about walking through the city without 
this said liz echauss 22 who was dressed in a crisp blue linen 
suit for a job interview 
another woman in a blue business suit was struck at 219 pm 
friday in the latest attack a passerby saw the attack and warned 
the woman who pulled the homemade dart out of her clothing and 
kept walking according to police 
the witness called a police hotline and reported the attack he 
said the man who appeared to have fired the dart fled on foot 
late friday police were trying to determine if a similar attack 
in the borough of queens was related to the manhattan attacks 
a woman in her 40s was walking in the jackson heights section 
around 6 pm when she was struck in her right arm with a 3inch 
dart said sgt nick vreeland she was not seriously hurt 
earlier brown asked people who work in the midtown area to call 
police if they spotted a man resembling the one drawn in a police 
sketch 
police officials have urged women to remain calm despite the 
media attention given the attacks which began june 26th 
for more than a week the dartman who witnesses say is black 
had fired only on white and hispanic women but thursday afternoon 
a 45yearold black woman was struck by a dart while walking to her 
office 
the dartman has struck throughout midtown leaving his mark on 
six women along fifth avenue and more than a dozen along bustling 
seventh avenue between pennsylvania station and times square 
the victims were struck in the buttocks or lower back with the 
2inch homemade darts which were fashioned out of straight pins 
and sewing needles with paper guides and apparently blown through 
straws no foreign substances have been found on any of the darts 
all of the attacks have occurred between 11 am and 7 pm 
illy brown a middleaged software developer looked worried 
when the dartman was mentioned my daughter works in the 
neighborhood my niece works in the neighborhood she said i 
find myself looking suspiciously at anyone on the street who fits 
the description 
debby wehman 23 seemed scared and nervous hes a sick man 
but unfortunately you still have to walk the streets she said 
im trying not to think about it if you walk around thinking 
about it youll make yourself crazy

sen gordon humphrey a steadfast foe of 
legalized abortion said friday he has softened his stand for the 
tactical reason of finally getting an updated abortion law passed 
in new hampshire 
the conservative republican who is running for a state senate 
seat even though he retires in january from the us senate after 
two terms said he has long supported abortion only to save the 
womans life but now would support exceptions for rape and incest 
victims 
in a telephone interview from his chichester home humphrey said 
hes easing his stance because thats probably the only way that 
we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the 
95 percent of abortions that have nothing to do with rape incest 
or the life of the mother 
earlier this year gov judd gregg vetoed a bill that would have 
made abortion legal until the fetus could live outside the womb 
last year gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the states existing 
antiabortion laws which date from the mid1800s 
humphrey faces state rep jack sherburne in the sept 11 
republican primary sherburne favors abortion rights as does the 
incumbent republican william johnson who is running for congress 
humphrey said his beliefs havent changed and that he hopes the 
public eventually will agree with him that each abortion kills a 
human being and a human being is a human being irrespective of his 
circumstances of conception 
asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and 
incest if the political climate were favorable humphrey said 
that would be my preference but i dont expect to see that day 
he said he had not discussed his new position with antiabortion 
supporters but expects some criticism 
warren aldrich legislative director for new hampshire for 
life would not comment directly on humphreys change but said 
his group would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill 
that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the 
circumstances of its conception 
rape and incest are tragic assaults on a womans life but we 
do not believe that abortion is in any way therapeutic for the 
woman he said 
peg dobbie state director of the national abortion rights 
action league was surprised by humphreys new stance he seems 
like the guy whos above it the maverick who stands up for his 
convictions no matter what she said 
even with the modifications humphreys stance is a very 
extreme antiabortion position dobbie said

kailuakona hawaii ap us rep joe kennedy dived into 
sharkfilled waters to help rescue a couple whose boat overturned 
in a tussle with a 485pound marlin according to kennedy and the 
skipper of his charter boat 
the massachusetts democrat on vacation with his twin 9yearold 
sons joseph jr and matthew was taking part in a fishing 
tournament sunday along with us rep bart gordon dtenn 
football player colin scott and exwashington redskin player john 
wilbur 
the crew of kennedys boat heard a distress call on the crafts 
radio sunday when the charter was about three miles off 
kailuakona on the west side of hawaii island said chuck harlan 
captain of the charter boat kealia 
the woman said their boat was sinking and she gave four 
different locations harland said in a telephone interview 
wednesday we saw lights out in the water and continued trolling 
in that direction 
when they got close they could see a man and a woman hanging 
onto an overturned fishing boat harlan said 
kennedy and others on the charter leapt in the water to save the 
couple harlan and kennedy said joe colin and my son mike 
jumped in and swam over to the boat harlan said 
i dont know if we got many points for intelligence kennedy 
told the boston herald in a telephone interview thursday it was 
tiger shark city 
she was really scared at that point kennedy said colin 
and i grabbed her and swam back to the boat 
the herald reported the rescued woman was mildred akaka the 
niece of us sen daniel akaka dhawaii akaka told the 
associated press earlier in the week that he hadnt heard about the 
incident 
after the rescue harlan said he saw a large marlin jump off to 
the north diving under the capsized boat he grabbed the vessels 
fishing pole still hooked to the marlin which apparently had sunk 
the couples boat in the first place 
the rescued woman worked the fish a while then turned the pole 
over to wilbur who eventually landed the 485pound marlin harlan 
said 
kennedy said a bleeding 300pound marlin the couple had caught 
earlier in the day probably attracted the sharks 
when he spotted the dead fish under the boat it kind of 
nearly gave me heart failure kennedy said 
kennedy 37 said of the incident it was classic old man and 
the sea stuff 
kennedy is the eldest son of the late sen robert kennedy since 
1987 he has represented the same district that his uncle john 
kennedy served before becoming senator and later president 
john kennedy gained fame during world war ii for his role in 
command of patroltorpedo boat pt109 in the solomon islands after 
the boat was rammed by a japanese warship kennedy towed a badly 
wounded soldier to safety american forces later rescued the crew

the nations largest teachers union 
abandoned its resistance to allowing engineers scientists and 
other midcareer professionals into the classroom while they study 
to become teachers 
the 2 millionmember national education association had opposed 
socalled alternative certification programs because it said 
recruiting nonteachers to combat faculty shortages undercut 
traditional licensing programs 
the policy adopted thursday during the first day of the unions 
fourday convention won passage because it established standards 
like mandatory bachelors degrees supervision by certified 
teachers and enrollment in teacher accreditation courses officials 
said 
im not in favor of blanket alternative certification said 
rosanne bacon president of the massachusetts teachers association 
a former opponent of such teacher recruitment efforts

whom shall we blame for the staggeringly inept 
really stupid comedy sweet revenge airing tonight on cables 
tnt network 
lets blame the french 
they produced sweet revenge and set it in paris because 
thats where they live not because its key to the story 
most everybody in the movie production crew and supporting 
cast included is french this is not a french movie however its 
an american movie about americans it uses french actors who think 
they can do american accents ehnd ouwhaat mekks yooo tink so 
yes blame the french they think jerry lewis is a comic genius 
by all means blame the french 
you also can blame carrie fisher she plays a bright ambitious 
corporate lawyer in an american law firms paris office huh who 
divorces her unpublished american writer husband hes played by 
john sessions pretending hes not british which he is 
the cheap plot device introduced by firsttime screenwriter 
janet brownwell is that fisher has agreed to support him after he 
put her through law school 
for some reason they divorce in new york instead of paris and 
the court orders her to pay him alimony until he remarries ah you 
say that sounds stupid well shes also sleeping with a senior 
partner 
but theres more she conceives the fiendishly lame idea of 
hiring an actress coached in the attributes of her exhusbands 
feminine ideal to seduce him into marriage 
brilliant eh but isnt this about what youd expect of a 
lawyer who represents herself in her own divorce 
maybe youd like to blame rosanna arquette 
she plays and this is a real stretch for her a neurotic 
flibbertigibbet of an actress she takes the job as feminine ideal 
dates the exhusband and finds herself whoops falling in 
love 
when a scintilla of sexual tension arises arquette confesses 
all he kicks her out but she returns to plead her love for him 
and they reunite despite the presumed lesson she learned she 
agrees to his doltish revenge scheme 
ok blame both arquette and fisher 
they could not have read this script and said this is a 
wellwritten romantic comedy that challenges me as an actress 
they must have read it and said hey this thing shoots for a 
month in paris 
blame brownwell whose screenplay turned an idle fancy into 
something really inane 
my husband and i were sitting around one morning at breakfast 
discussing what we would do to one another if we got divorced 
she told the movies publicists i said i would hire this 
incredibly beautiful woman to whom i would teach all his secrets 
he would fall in love with her and she would break his heart 
this is not the greatest idea ever to leave the breakfast table 
blame the director charlotte brandstrom who went to school at 
ucla and the american film institute directors program this is 
her second movie and her work shows how some film school graduates 
are versed in technique and utterly ignorant of real life 
she shot most of her outdoor scenes in the same exclusive 
parisian shopping streets where she shot most of her interiors in 
the exclusive hermes and ungaro stores 
she and brownwell said the major element of the story is fisher 
and arquettes relationship and what they learn from each other 
well maybe in some other movie 
sweet revenge is so fatuously conceived that it constantly 
calls attention to its lack of dramatic tension 
the climactic scene in which several loosely flapping plot ends 
must be tied up occurs at a paris news conference called by the 
faithless senior partner whos presumably been living and working 
in europe for a couple of years while sleeping with fisher 
the news conference is to announce the senior partners 
candidacy for the us senate thats right hes announcing his 
candidacy in paris 
hes no doubt hoping to represent a state with a large french 
population like the great state of grey poupon

elsewhere in television 
stupid pet tricks redux can you see the potential of an entire 
halfhour of stupid pet tricks well maybe thats why you 
shouldnt work at cbs tonight the network premieres prime time 
pets a summer replacement look at some of the nicest critters 
with fur feathers and scales hosted by wil shriner 
the home videostyle clips are mercifully brief some actually 
are funny and theres a nice segment on a trained dog who helps a 
disabled child 
none of the show is particularly memorable and cbs reluctance 
to pick it up in light of abcs hugely successful americas 
funniest home videos could be showing us the tailend of the home

after 15 years of guerrilla war east 
timor nationalists have added street protests to their campaign for 
independence in the former portuguese colony seized by indonesia 
in the mountains rebels snipe at government soldiers in one of 
the worlds leastknown insurgencies dating from the indonesian 
invasion in 1975 
many timorese apparently have accepted being part of indonesia 
but militants in the mainly roman catholic territory fiercely 
oppose rule by the predominantly moslem country 
young independence activists delivered their first public 
message oct 12 during a visit by pope john paul ii 
they surged toward the altar at the end of an outdoor mass 
attended by more than 100000 people shouting slogans and 
unfurling banners several were beaten and 18 detained 
independence demonstrators appeared again when john c monjo 
the us ambassador to indonesia visited east timor in january 
witnesses said several youths were injured by soldiers outside the 
hotel turismo 
at least one other public protest has has been reported since 
both government officials and rebel spokesmen confirm the 
nationalist tactics are changing 
mario v carrascalao the provincial governor said more 
demonstrations could be expected 
he said no more than 40 activists were involved during the 
popes visit about 200 turned out when monjo was in dili and we 
let them walk around for three days carrascalao siad in an 
interview 
a human rights organization said at least 25000 indonesian 
soldiers had moved into east timor for cleanup operations 
against guerrillas ahead of a visit by portuguese officials in 
september 
since february troop strength has been brought to 40000 from 
about 15000 said carmel budiarjo director of campaign tapol a 
group based in london that focuses on indonesia 
carrascalao the provincial governor said he anticipated 
demonstrations during the portuguese visit 
abilio araujo leader of the fretilin resistance movement told 
reporters in lisbon in february this year we plan to step up 
organized mass resistance in occupied territories we cant 
defeat indonesia militarily but they will never eradicate us 
either 
fretilin is a portuguese acronym for the leftist revolutionary 
front for an independent east timor a bid for power by the 
fretilin movement after portuguese officials fled a coup attempt in 
august 1975 gave indonesia the excuse to invade from west timor 
its half of the island 
indonesia annexed east timor as its 27th province in 1976 but 
the united nations still recognizes portugal as the administering 
power the portuguese closed their embassy in jakarta after the 
invasion and dutch diplomats look after portuguese interests in 
indonesia 
the united states recognized indonesias incorporation of east 
timor without acknowledging it was a valid act of 
selfdetermination a us embassy official said 
east timor one of the worlds leastdeveloped areas is on the 
eastern end of the indonesian archipelago 1300 miles from jakarta 
and only 350 from australias northwest coast 
it is blessed by balmy breezes and beautiful beaches but is no 
idyllic tropical isle 
inhospitable brown mountains are cut by parched valleys sparse 
vegetation and scars left by slashandburn farming make the 
highlands seem desolate the earth is cracked in the dry season and 
flooded when rains come 
per capita annual income was the equivalent of 40 in 1974 and 
now is 200 east timor has no industry only a tiny service sector 
and bleak prospects for those seeking work 
little information about the insurgency has been available 
because indonesia virtually sealed off east timor after annexing 
it east timorese were not allowed out and only a few foreigners 
got in with official permission 
farming stopped and starvation spread 
east timor faced disaster for a time it was averted by 
emergency food supplies starting in 1979 from the international 
committee of the red cross and catholic relief services of the 
united states 
critics claim thousands of lives could have been saved if 
indonesia and permitted relief operations earlier 
how many people died is not known 
in 1985 the human rights group amnesty international said 
200000 people may have died from all causes roman catholic 
clergymen estimate the total at more than 100000 and diplomats in 
jakarta say 60000 there are no official figures 
east timors population was given as 552954 in the 1980 census 
compared to the last colonial portuguese estimate of 635000 
carrascalao said the population now was 695000 
we are still in a period of transition said the provincial 
governor a native of timor who was an official of the colonial 
administration he estimated 5 to 10 percent of the people opposed 
integration with indonesia 
the 450 years of portuguese rule made us different even from 
people on the other half of the island he said west timor was 
part of the dutch east indies until indonesia won independence in 
1949 
carrascalao described the demonstrations as attempts by a very 
small minority to provoke the armed forces 
they are young high school graduates who cannot find jobs 
he said once educated they dont want to be farmers 
in lisbon fretilin spokesman jose guterres said the opposite 
its not that they are doing this because they dont want to be 
farmers its a political thing 
he said the protesters belonged to a clandestine group formed by 
the rebels in 1980 
hundreds of schools built by indonesia since annexation helped 
reduce illiteracy from more than 90 percent in colonial days to 31 
carrascalao said 
guterres acknowledged the new schools helped increase literacy 
but added only indonesian is taught indonesian language 
culture values ours are totally ignored the only way we learn 
them is at home in the family 
at carrascalaos prodding indonesia opened east timor in 
january 1989 timorese are free to come and go as they please 
foreigners no longer need permission in visit but must register on 
arrival 
anyone planning to travel outside dili must get a police pass 
that lists both destination and the amount of time allowed there 
officials said there were 6190 tourists last year 
when the dili grapevine identifies foreigners as journalists 
they are approached by timorese who want to talk about their 
plight none would be identified by name 
an unemployed man in his 20s said he was not necessarily in 
favor of fretilin but at least we should be allowed to vote on 
our future 
a teenager lifted his shirt to display multiple scars he said 
were from wounds inflicted by soldiers another insisted the 
atmosphere of terror has intensified since january but gave no 
specifics 
asked how many guerrillas remain carrascalao said i dont 
know exactly a very small number but with high mobility 
guterres who said he fought with the guerrillas before reaching 
portugal two years ago said fretilin had 5000 armed fighters 
plus its own militia within the local population 
indonesian military sources have said for four years the 
guerrillas number about 400 
about 90 percent of indonesias 175 million people are moslems 
but the population of east timor is predominantly catholic early 
last year bishop carlos ximenes belo head of the church in east 
timor urged the united nations to organize a referendum on the 
territorys future 
belo became bishop after his predecessor was forced to resign in 
1983 because church sources said he had criticized conditions 
in east timor

separatists holding out in east timor 
against indonesian rule have two counterparts in the outer reaches 
of the worlds largest archipelago 
one trouble spot is the special region of aceh conservatively 
moslem and historically rebellious at the tip of sumatra in the 
17th century aceh had a cavalry with persian horses an elephant 
corps and a navy strong enough to hold off the portuguese 
the other is 3100 miles to the east the former dutch territory 
of west irian which has been the indonesian province of irian jaya 
since 1963 and shares the island of new guinea with independent 
papua new guinea 
the colonial dutch never really succeeded in bringing aceh under 
control and fought a war with the local sultan that lasted 35 
years until 1903 
when the japanese occupied sumatra in 1942 aceh declared itself 
independent when the dutch tried to recolonize after world war ii 
aceh resisted 
aceh was cool to the idea of joining newly independent 
indonesia and declared itself an independent islamic republic in 
1951 that happened after the indonesians made the mistake of 
trying to incorporate it into the province of north sumatra 
only when it was designated in 1967 as a special region did aceh 
agree to end its rebellion in exchange for a promises that it would 
have a measure of real autonomy 
autonomy did not materialize but banda aceh the provincial 
capital has its own laws on culture religion and education in a 
country that portrays itself as a secular humanist state with a 
belief in one god but freedom of worship aceh is the most 
fervently moslem region 
a new independence movement emerged in the mid1970s when the 
aceh merdeka free aceh movement began supporting armed 
guerrillas it was believed to have been smothered years ago but 
some officials say it has revived in recent months 
ambush killings that started in april are blamed variously on 
drug gangs army deserters and libyantrained rebels at least 26 
people were reported slain in a threeweek period 
the killers are officially known as members of a security 
disturbing movement or gpk from the indonesian words gerakan 
pengacau keamanan this generic label is applied to all separatist 
groups in an apparent attempt to detract from the seriousness of 
rebel threats 
in irian jaya the organisasi papua merdeka free papua 
movement has been fighting for either independence or a merger 
with papua new guinea ever since incorporation into indonesia 
became final 
the dutch had promised the irianese they would have independence 
someday but thenpresident sukarno pushed indonesias claim to 
west irian 
indonesian troops invaded in 1962 and the united states helped 
prod indonesia and the netherlands into negotiations under un 
auspices 
jakarta was awarded administrative control of west irian in 
1963 with the understanding that a free election would determine 
the former colonys status in 1969 tribal chiefs voted 
unanimously to incorporate it into indonesia 
this act of free choice was criticized at the time for not 
being a vote of the people but indonesia argued that a 
consensusgathering exercise among tribal leaders was more 
appropriate to the culture 
irian jayas people are papuan ethnic melanesians whose 
cultural and linguistic heritage shares little with the rest of 
indonesias diverse ethnic groups especially the dominant javanese 
the armed struggle began in 1969 for the most part it is 
conducted without modern weapons or aid from abroad diplomats and 
foreign missionaries say the rebels have no chance of winning

the administration is apparently looking at 
the securities industry for new taxes prompting trade groups to 
counter with arguments than new levies would drive investors and 
traders overseas 
industry trade groups were responding thursday to word that the 
bush administration is considering an securities transfer excise 
tax of up to 05 percent on the sale of stocks bonds futures 
contracts and other financial products 
countries with securities transaction taxes are now reducing or 
eliminating them the trade groups said 
the taxes have made the countries less competitive with those 
that do not have the taxes the industry leaders said critics of 
transaction taxes in west germany and sweden have blamed them for 
driving away business to other financial centers like london 
it seems to defy common sense to have america embarking on a 
tax now said edward obrien president of the securities 
industry association 
it would be a real shootyourselfinthefoot if we were to 
institute anything like that when our market share is so 
vulnerable said john damgard president of the futures industry 
association 
a treasury spokesman declined to comment on a report in the wall 
street journal thursday that treasury secretary nicholas brady 
and budget director richard darman are said to be intrigued by the 
idea but not committed to it 
congress and the white house are trying to work out a way to cut 
the deficit through a series of negotiations 
the transaction tax was the latest idea to surface since 
president bush stirred things up by ending his read my lips no 
new taxes stance 
congress is not in session this week and most key committee 
aides were not available for comment 
industry officials noted the transaction tax idea is not new 
whats heating this issue up is the fact that suddenly now the 
president is purported to have said everything is on the table so 
every idea that anyones ever had is out there said the futures 
industry associations damgard 
sarah teslik executive director of the council of individual 
investors a group of 65 large pension funds with 300 billion in 
assets said the group has not yet issued an official position on 
the transaction tax 
but ms teslik noted that unlike legislation introduced last 
fall in an effort to curb shortterm trading and market volatility 
the ideas being kicked around do not single out pension funds and 
do not put a time limit on how long a stock must be held to avoid 
taxation 
that type of tax she said would be an administrative nightmare 
for fund managers and could cost pension funds as much as 100 
million a year 
its a bad idea particularly in light of the fact that other 
countries around the world have tried transaction taxes and have 
learned the very difficult lesson that its made them 
noncompetitive said fias damgard 
his claim was echoed by the securities association which 
released study findings that it said showed an independent 
movement underway in many countries to eliminate or reduce the rate 
of transfer taxes for competitive purposes 
of 15 countries surveyed six have either lowered the tax rate 
or are eliminating the tax entirely the sia survey also noted that 
four countries canada greece luxembourg and the united states 
have no transaction tax at all 
last month sias two top officials obrien and robert downey 
the chairman wrote treasury secretary brady asking him to oppose a 
securities transaction tax 
its a universally held view in the industry obrien said 
in a telephone interview thursday if there is some disagreement 
with our position we havent heard it 
he said a tax on transactions could induce individual investors 
to slow up or halt their trading that in turn would lessen 
market liquidity and drive down prices

gold held no luster for us mutual fund 
investors in the second quarter a new survey of mutual fund 
performance says 
goldoriented mutual funds were the lone category to post a 
negative rate of return for the apriljune period according to the 
latest quarterly survey of 1755 mutual funds by lipper analytical 
services inc 
the investment researcher said thursday the best performers were 
mutual funds of health and science stocks and added that funds 
invested in growth stocks generally did better than those invested 
in other stocks or in bonds 
lipper said health and biotechnology funds posted a 1711 
percent return in the second quarter funds invested in science and 
technology stocks had an 1108 percent return the survey said 
it was generally an upbeat quarter for mutual funds which had 
posted a negative rate of return on average in the first three 
months of the year 
the average stock fund including various international and 
speciality stock funds posted a 553 percent rate of return the 
survey said that compared to a negative rate of return of 280 
percent in the first quarter 
but the worst performers were gold funds with a negative return 
of 1027 percent in the quarter all 10 worstperforming funds were 
invested in gold 
a michael lipper president of lipper analytical attributed 
the dull performance to a decline in gold prices a feeling that 
inflation is under control and speculation that the soviet union 
may sell gold while moving toward creation of a marketbased 
economy 
he said the health stock funds appeared to benefit from drug 
introductions and a number of health and biotechnology company 
mergers 
the science and technology funds rose on an improved earnings 
outlook following a prolonged slump lipper said 
lipper said the average general equity fund posted a 589 
percent return in contrast to a negative 231 percent return in the 
first three months of 1990 
lipper said the turnaround occurred in part because of a decline 
in interest rates and the possibility that the opening of markets 
in eastern europe and the soviet union would create new customers 
for us companies 
stock funds invested in companies expected to show earnings 
growth achieved the highest rates of return among the general 
equity funds with 752 percent for small company growth funds and 
703 percent for all types of growth funds 
those performances beat the standard and poors 500 index which 
gained 629 percent in the quarter including estimated dividend 
reinvestment 
capital appreciation funds posted a 586 percernt rate of 
return while growth and income funds had a 473 percernt return 
and equity income funds had a 260 percent return fixed income 
funds had a 318 percent return 
counting funds invested in bonds convertible securities and 
mixtures of bonds and stocks the average longterm taxable fund 
had a rate of return of 465 percent in the quarter compared with 
a negative 195 percent in the first quarter lipper said 
pacific region stock funds had a return of 934 percent 
european region funds a return of 798 percent and international 
funds a 776 percent return 
lippers rankings of 1755 continuing funds for the quarter 
assume investors reinvest all dividends and capital gains 
distributions made by the funds 
the top performing fund was schield progressive environmental 
fund a specialty fund that posted a 2954 percent return 
the denverbased fund has less than 2 million in assets and was 
formed only four months ago in a telephone interview marshall 
schield president of schield management said the fund invests in 
sociallyresponsible companies whose business is cleaning up the 
environment 
that fund was followed by fidelity select biotechnology a 
health stock fund at 2357 percent and bull amp bear select 
equities which invests in stocks for capital appreciation at 
2238 percent 
the worst performer was strategic investments a gold fund with 
a negative return of 2355 percent next were us gold shares with 
a a negative return of 1653 percent and us new prospector fund

an investor groups plans to raise its stake in 
avon products inc to 198 percent would bring it just short of 
triggering the companys takeover defense 
partners of chartwell associates said thursday they had bought 
3976 million shares of avon common stock and members of the 
limited partnership have agreed to buy an additional 1233 million 
shares within 30 days 
the purchases pushed avon to the top of the new york stock 
exchanges list of active issues thursday it closed at 37 down 
75 cents on volume of more than 47 million shares 
the latest stock acquisition confirmed the partnerships 
previously stated ambition to enlarge its avon holdings 
periodically but there was no immediate indication that chartwell 
has adopted a more aggressive attitude toward avon or that it plans 
to launch a hostile bid for control of the big beauty products 
marketer 
lissa perlman a spokeswoman for the investor group said 
chartwell has said in the past that it would add to the avon stock 
it has amassed it views the stake as a longterm investment she 
said 
avons takeover defense would be triggered if one investment 
group acquired 20 percent or more of the stock avon spokesman john 
cox said 
when activated avons poison pill would allow stockholders 
other than those involved in a 20 percent or larger block to buy 
shares of the company at half price this would dilute the value of 
the 20 percent block and possibly concentrate a greater proportion 
of the outstanding stock in friendly hands 
a federal appeals court ruling in late june removed a legal 
impediment to chartwells further acquisitions of avon the ruling 
affirmed a lower court decision that declared an amendment to 
avons shareholders rights plan invalid the amendment would have 
reduced the level at which the poison pill becomes effective to 
125 percent from 20 percent 
chartwell which has close ties to one of avons competitors in 
the direct sales business mary kay corp is increasing its total 
holdings of avon common stock to 2619 percent from 17 percent with 
the two purchases 
the chartwell partners that did the buying were the fisher 
brothers of new york and the getty family trust 
chartwell said it bought most of the shares from aj 
partnership whose principals include the minneapolisbased 
investor irwin jacobs and amway corp a large privately held 
direct marketer 
amway and jacobs last year unsuccessfully attempted to take over 
avon avons board rejected their two separate takeover bids and 
has steadfastly maintained that the company is not for sale 
cox said the disposal of the aj partnership stock was not 
surprising given that the group was never regarded as a longterm 
investor in avon 
he said the sale eliminates a major source of instability in 
avon stock because it had been widely assumed that aj partnership 
could unload its stake on the market at any time 
chartwell has exerted pressure on avon on and off since last 
november a principal in chartwell john p rochon who is vice 
chairman of mary kay has made several takeover advances on avon 
chartwell threatened to wage a proxy fight earlier this year but 
a battle was averted in the spring when avon agreed to support 
chartwell nominees to two of the four slots available on its board 
the chartwell candidates were elected at avons annual meeting in 
may 
the settlement also led to the establishment of a special 
committee to consider ways of boosting value for avon stockholders 
including a recapitalization asset sales or even a sale of the 
entire company 
members of the committee include the two newly installed 
chartwellbacked board members plus four avon executives 
cox said the committee has held one meeting so far no timetable 
has been set for the panel to present recommendations

the giant accounting firm ernst amp young says 
it will not appeal a newly upheld securities and exchange 
commission administrative action dating from when the firm was 
known as ernst amp whinney 
on thursday an administrative law judge ruled in favor of the 
sec and imposed a 45day ban against new secrelated assignments 
for the firm 
in the same decision michael l ferrante a managing partner of 
the firms white plains ny office was censured 
this is a very old matter in which the civil litigation was 
concluded many years ago without any payment by the firm a 
spokesman for ernst amp young in new york after almost 10 years 
we believe it is time to put the entire matter behind us this will 
have no effect on our ability to serve our clients added the 
spokesman mort meyerson he noted that ferrante remains managing 
partner of the white plains office 
ernst amp whinney changed its name to ernst amp young and moved its 
headquarters from cleveland to new york after merging with arthur 
young last year 
the action stems from sec findings in 1985 that ernst amp whinney 
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct in 
handling the financial statements of us surgical corp a 
norwalk connbased medical prodcuts developer and manufacturer 
sec regulations require companies that sell publiclytraded 
stock to have their financial statements certified by outside 
public accountants to protect investors 
surgical which designed and developed surgical staplers and 
other woundclosing instruments overstated its pretax income by 
18 percent in 1980 and by 678 percent in 1981 allegedly to cover 
up expenses incurred in protecting patents and battling 
competitors the sec said 
the financial statements were cleared by ernst amp whinney 
auditors 
the firm contended that while accounting decisions were made 
and auditing procedures were performed whose appropriateness might 
be debatable it didnt amount to improper professional conduct 
after 50 days of hearings between aug 18 1986 and march 3 
1987 administrative law judge jerome k soffer upheld the sec 
soffer ruled that ernst amp whinney offices in the new york 
metropolitan area including white plains are barred for the 
next 45 days from taking on new clients who will have dealings with 
the sec 
but the firm can continue handling current client accounts

sharp disagreement among detroit automakers 
over the need for a gasoline tax increase could lessen the powerful 
lobbys impact on the debate over reducing the federal budget 
deficit an auto consumers group says 
ford motor co and chrysler corp favor boosting the 
9centspergallon federal levy on gasoline by a nickel a year for 
three to five years every penny increase would raise about 1 
billion 
but general motors corp the nations largest automobile 
manufacturer opposes any increase in gas taxes 
the squabble is unusual in an industry that often puts unity 
ahead of competition in lobbying congress 
they could be much more effective if they were together on 
this one said richard hebert spokesman for the american 
automobile association which is assembling a coalition to fight 
any attempt to boost the gas tax 
the tax frequently is mentioned as a potential source of new 
revenue as the white house and congressional leaders negotiate a 
deficit reduction plan 
the big three us automakers usually reach common positions on 
legislative issues with a major impact on their industry such as 
the pending clean air act rewrite 
but sometimes consensus eludes them 
it isnt the norm but it does happen said tim mccarthy 
lobbyist for the motor vehicle manufacturers association which 
represents the big three honda volvo and some truck companies 
its a competitive industry with differences of opinion 
mccarthy said it was too early to tell whether the automakers 
would clash if the budget negotiations produced a package including 
a higher gas tax 
currently the industry is more concerned with the clean air 
bill and a proposal to require a substantial improvement in 
gasoline mileage for new cars he said 
which isnt to say that the tax issue is going to fall through 
the cracks but its just kind of hazy as to how intense the 
lobbying will be mccarthy said 
at the heart of the big threes dispute is how a gas tax 
increase would affect auto sales 
gm contends many people would delay new car purchases the 
company has predicted that a 15centspergallon increase would 
reduce sales by 500000 and eliminate 120000 jobs 
i dont think the country wants to see lower car sales gm 
chairman roger smith said we have constantly said and i think 
congress has said that the gasoline tax is too regressive that it 
hurts the poor people 
chrysler agrees a higher tax might hurt sales but not 
significantly spokesman john guiniven said we also feel that 
reducing the budget deficit would reduce interest rates and that 
could spur car sales and the entire economy 
chrysler chairman lee iaccoca is an outspoken supporter of 
higher gas taxes which he says would encourage people to drive 
more fuelefficient cars in the 1980s chryslers marketing 
strategy emphasized more fuelefficient vehicles 
a higher tax would boost conservation lower the nations trade 
deficit and help counter global warming by curbing emissions 
iaccoca said 
consumers must demand more fuelefficient vehicles and today 
they have no reason to do that iaccoca said the cost of driving

natural gas 
ford would accept a gradual gas tax increase as part of a 
package of consumption taxes company spokesman mark miller said 
but we believe it should go toward reducing the deficit and not

savings and loan regulators are ordering 
president bushs son neil to answer conflictofinterest charges 
in public despite objections from the younger bushs attorney 
regulators said neil bush as an officer of a denver thrift 
institution voted to approve millions of dollars in loans from the 
sampl to one of his business partners 
the administrative charges filed in february were released 
thursday as part of a new policy at the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision the agency scheduled a public hearing 
for sept 25 before an administrative law judge in denver 
i think its unfortunate if it creates a political sideshow or 
a media sideshow said james nesland a lawyer for neil bush 
but im still confident the administrative law judge will decide 
the case on its merits 
the judge will make a recommendation to ots director timothy 
ryan who will decide whether or not to issue a ceaseanddesist 
order prohibiting bush from violating regulations in the future 
the agency is not seeking more serious penalties such as 
financial restitution or banning bush from working for a bank or 
savings and loan 
separately ots said it is seeking a record 24 million from the 
former chairman of a large california thrift columbia savings and 
loan of beverly hills it accused thomas spiegel of squandering 
deposits on luxury condominiums trips to europe and a gun 
collection 
spiegel a close associate of michael milken former drexel 
burnham lambert junk bond chief built the institution into one of 
the nations largest it had the industrys biggest portfolio of 
highyield highrisk bonds valued at 37 billion at the end of 
1989 
in a statement spiegel denied the charges and accused the 
agency of conducting a politically motivated trial by press 
release 
neil bush served on the board of silverado banking savings and 
loan association from august 1985 to august 1988 it collapsed in 
december 1988 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
the charges said bush voted to approve loans totaling 45 
million to bill l walters an investor in and lender to bushs oil 
exploration company jnb exploration co he also voted to approve 
silverados purchase of 584 million in properties from walters 
the document said 
the thrift office also said bush inadequately disclosed his ties 
to kenneth good a developer who defaulted on loans to silverado 
bush in a reply a month after the charges were filed said he 
had not violated his duty as a director he denied some specific 
charges and of others said he lacks sufficient present 
knowledge or information to form a belief as to the allegations 
the house banking committee obtained and released a preliminary 
draft of the charges in june 
last week president bush said he had full confidence in the 
integrity and honor of his son and pledged not to interfere with 
the investigation 
ryan appointed by the president in april said treasury 
department officials declined his offer to consider their advice on 
the disclosure policy he said he did not confer with the white 
house 
under the new ots policy the agency generally will release 
charges and conduct hearings in public for the officers of thrifts 
already closed or seized by the government and for the former 
officers of stillopen sampls 
in the past only final decisions had been made public 
to avoid the danger of depositor runs proceedings against 
current officers of open sampls generally will continue to be 
conducted in private ryan told a news conference 
the public has a major stake in the cleanup of the thrift 
industry and as a general rule i believe it is reasonable to make 
enforcement proceedings open when dealing with 
governmentcontrolled thrifts he said 
in the columbia case the thrift office is seeking 19 million 
in restitution which would go to the stillopen sampl and 5 
million in penalties which would go to the us treasury 
regulators allege spiegel improperly spent deposits on 
limousines corporate aircraft luxury resort condominiums for his 
own use 7000 in tickets for a michael jackson concert a 2000 
winetasting course and a 55000 gun collection that included uzi 
submachine guns 
edward harshfield who succeeded spiegel at columbia said in a 
statement that the institutions current management cooperated with 
the investigation he said the allegations do not reflect on 
current management or the institution as a whole

president bushs adopted hometown has scrubbed 
itself squeakyclean for next weeks economic summit but the real 
gleam in its welcoming smile reflects the pride of a city whose 
mood was as low as the price of texas crude a few years ago 
civic officials hope the foreign leaders from britain japan 
west germany italy canada and france will return home with an 
image of a houston that may not be as wealthy as it was in the 
glory days of the oil boom but is healthier and wiser 
certainly the city has come a long way since the oil price 
collapse of the mid1980s left it with clogged bankruptcy courts 
empty skyscrapers and emptier banks 
the energy industry still accounts for 40 percent of the local 
economy but growth in services electronics biotechnology and 
medicine coupled with a stable chunk of the us space program have 
made the renaissance possible 
according to local business executives 77 percent of the 
220000 jobs lost to the recession have been recovered with a 
majority of those positions unrelated to energy the jobless rate 
now hovers around 5 percent compared to nearly triple that in 1987 
even the real estate market has shown recent gains after 
devastation by a combination of overbuilding and the plunge in oil 
prices from 40 to 10 per barrel empty highrise buildings are a 
thing of the past and theres even talk of a new skyscraper rising 
in the heart of houston 
to help the city show off for the summit an army of volunteers 
has braved 90degreeplus temperatures to remove more than 3 
million pounds of trash and trim the citys foliage 
at rice university where the summit sessions will be held 
furniture and light fixtures are being replaced new sidewalks 
poured trees and bushes replanted flowers are everywhere 
the leaders of seven major industrial democracies will have a 
special platform to channel cool air beneath their seats during 
mondays outdoor welcoming ceremonies an early afternoon affair 
i felt like i needed to do something for the community said 
rita roy 28 one of the thousands of cleanup volunteers i think 
they should do this all the time and not just for the summit 
the business community has donated 4 million in cash plus 6 
million in time and services to make certain the city puts on a 
good show the federal government is spending another 52 million 
including security and law enforcement 
besides the big broom and coat of fresh paint city officials 
orchestrating summit hoopla for more than 3000 outoftown 
reporters covering the annual international event hoped to show a 
gentler and more sophisticated side of the city some of the 
presummit media feasts for example will be held at the citys 
museums 
but this is texas after all and the following day its back to 
the classic texas stereotype with a barbecue and rodeo and country 
music concert the heads of state will leave town carrying cowboy 
boots western hats and big belt buckles 
the timing couldnt be better for hotel operators who find 
steamy july one of their slowest periods 
any time you get business in july in this city you make 
money said john blanton director of marketing for the inn on 
the park hotel that will house some of the summit delegations 
its estimated the summit itself will pump from 50 million to 
125 million into the citys economy 
houston has fashioned a substantial economic recovery said 
m ray perryman director of the baylor university forecasting 
service the prospects for houston are outstanding

united airlines employees seeking to buy the 
carriers parent say ual corp still is likely to place an aircraft 
purchase order soon but not until the workers secure loans for 
the buyout 
the unionled buyout group and uals board of directors 
announced thursday that the company had suspended talks on a major 
order for widebody jets at the request of the buyout group the 
united employees acquisition corp 
the purpose of this temporary delay is to permit ueac to 
complete related financial negotiations with vendors while 
achieving the most efficient timing for placing an order the 
buyout group said in a statement 
this delay does not change the fact that a widebody aircraft 
order will likely take place soon 
ual directors said the aircraft order negotiations are on hold 
until aug 9 the deadline for the employees to secure financing 
for their proposed acquisiton of the company 
steven matthews a spokesman for the buyout group said the 
delay did not reflect concerns about the employees ability to find 
financing for both the 438 billion airline acquisition and the 
aircraft purchases 
the buyout group is trying to persuade a number of airframe and 
engine manufacturers to invest in the buyout 
published reports have indicated the employees are negotiating 
with boeing co and general electric co as well as european 
manufacturers trying to get the companies to put up some of the 
cash for the buyout the companies could become preferred suppliers 
for the airline as well as receiving either preferred stock or a 
note in ual 
an analyst says the delay in the order may indicate a more 
cautious approach by employees leaders who previously said theyd 
have no problem getting financing for the airline and plane 
purchases 
it sounds like theyre saying lets take care of the 
financing for the buyout first and then see what we can do on the 
aircraft acquisition said mark daugherty an airline analyst 
with dean witter reynolds inc in new york 
uals board said it had halted negotiations with aircraft and 
engine manufacturers until aug 9 the deadline for the buyout 
group to get financing for the acquisition of ual which is based 
near chicago in elk grove village 
the board said it took the action in an effort to be as 
accommodating as possible to the buyout group 
a spokesman for the buyout group steven matthews said the 
group is confident it can raise the money to buy both the airline 
and new planes 
ual had been expected to announce within a matter of weeks the 
largest order ever placed for widebody jetliners possibly 
including boeing cos proposed model 777 
although boeing is well into development of the 777 it has not 
formally committed to building the 350seat twinengine aircraft 
that decision expected this summer depends on boeing getting 
enough orders to make starting production worthwhile 
no orders have been announced to date 
in seattle boeing commercial airplane group spokesman craig 
martin said he assumed negotiations with ual would resume in august 
boeing has been negotiating hot and heavy as have airbus and 
mcdonnell douglas martin said things had been moving toward 
some resolution

analysts who forecast that gannetts net income would be below the 
1121 million or 70 cents a share of the yearearlier quarter 
however he would not predict specific earnings figures 
a decline in earnings would indicate how gannett is being 
affected by a slump that has hit the entire newspaper industry a 
number of wall street analysts have forecast declines for earnings 
of many newspaper publishers because of the soft ad revenue 
we started to see softness in advertising business in 1989

business conditions 
the expected earnings decline would come at a difficult time for

british airways plc announced today it had ordered 
as many as 33 boeing co 747 aircraft worth up to 69 billion the 
airlines biggestever investment in new planes 
the firm order for 21 747400s is the fourth largest for 
seattlebased boeing in dollar value 
british airways said it was seeking extra passenger capacity as 
well as replacements for its older aircraft 
analysts said the airline was placing the order now so it would 
not have to wait long for new planes amid growing world demand to 
replace older aircraft 
all theyre doing is protecting their position in terms of 
requirements they didnt want to be last in the queue said dan 
white an analyst with the london investment firm county natwest 
woodmac 
british airways said it has placed firm orders for 21 new boeing 
747400 longrange aircraft for 233 billion pounds the equivalent 
of 415 billion and has taken an option to buy 12 more for 155 
billion pounds or 28 billion 
deliveries will start in 1992 and are expected to be completed 
seven years later bringing british airways 747400 fleet to 42 
aircraft on the basis of firm orders 
the company has bought 21 747400s since 1986 and operates 224 
airplanes in all 
the aircraft will provide extra capacity as well as allowing 
us to replace older boeing 747 equipment british airways 
chairman lord king said our 747400s are delivering good 
performance and proving popular with intercontinental passengers 
rollsroyce plc won the 107 billion contract for the engines 
the airline said rollsroyce spokesman dick dalton in reston va 
said the deal was for 160 rb211524g engines including spares 
king said british airways obtained the right to convert any of 
the orders if boeing develops a larger version of the 747 
boeing executives have conjectured that in the late 1990s the 
company could build a 747 super the plane would be 
significantly larger than the model 400 which can carry 412 
passengers more than 8000 miles and more than 560 in shortrange 
versions 
however company officials have said no decision has been made 
to actually build such a plane and boeing has offered no specifics 
on how large the plane might be 
theres nothing in the works at all said john wheeler 
spokesman for boeing commercial airplane group in seattle 
he said the conversion options negotiated by british airways are 
just insurance on the part of the airline in case boeing does 
come up with another jet 
boeings largestever firm order for aircraft was a 94 billion 
deal from irish leasing company gpa ltd in april 1989 so far this 
year boeing has received orders for 240 aircraft worth a total 
253 billion its firmorder backlog now stands at more than 1700 
aircraft 
british airways also said it would begin a 30 million pound or 
53 million refurbishment program for its fleet of 747100 
aircraft to keep them operating at high standards until they 
progressively are replaced by the new fleet 
british airways did not say how it would pay for the new 
airplanes analysts said they expected the airline to own some of 
the aircraft and obtain leases on others to contain costs 
john lawson an analyst with nomura research institute in 
london said he would not be surprised if the airline sold 
ownership of some planes to a leasing company and then took out 
operating leases on them such arrangements are known as 
leasebacks 
british airways has said that it likes to own its aircraft but 
that it has used operating leases on a shortterm basis in the past 
to meet peak demand 
aircraft values have held up well analysts said british 
airways recently capitalized on the buoyant trend by selling some 
of its 737s and then leasing them back

amid us pressure on japan to open its rice 
market the government friday decided to cut by only 15 percent 
the price it will pay to rice farmers this year 
the price cut is the first in two years but it is much less 
than some government officials had hoped for to end us criticism 
of japans rice market which is virtually closed to imports 
an earlier plan by the agriculture ministry to cut the price 
paid to farmers for their rice crops by about 5 percent was killed 
when it was opposed by members of the ruling liberal democratic 
party who depend heavily on farmer support the party had 
requested a freeze on the price 
the government regulates and subsidizes the domestic rice 
market buying much of the rice crop and reselling it to consumers 
at lower prices 
the subsidy cost the government 3117 billion yen or 208 
billion in fiscal 1989 the 15 percent reduction is expected to 
help cut the budget by about 9 billion yen or 60 million 
japanese rice is about four times more expensive than us rice 
japans rice market is likely to be on the agenda at next weeks 
summit of seven major industrialized nations in houston texas 
producer prices were cut by 595 percent in 1987 and by 46 
percent in 1988 they remained unchanged last year when the ruling 
party faced national elections 
japan has been criticized for its rice ban during the current 
uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
but the nation has insisted on maintaining selfsufficiency for 
rice its staple food limited quantities of rice are imported for 
use in processed foods 
agriculture minister tomio yamamoto is adamantly opposed to 
opening the rice market 
there are signs however that some japanese would welcome a 
more flexible position on rice imports 
the secondlargest opposition party recently endorsed easing the 
ban on imports and former prime minister noboru takeshita praised 
the decision as courageous 
last month the paper published a national survey it conducted 
of 2397 eligible voters in may some 65 percent of those polled 
approved of opening japans rice market to some foreign imports 
and 21 percent favorded full liberalization

westinghouse electric co which offered to 
settle an age discrimination lawsuit two years ago for 35 million 
has won the case in federal appeals court 
the ruling thursday prodded by a recent us supreme court 
decision ended the court battle that began in 1983 when the 
federal equal employment opportunity commission challenged 
westinghouse for forcing laidoff employees to retire prior to age 
70 because severance pay was not available 
the settlement offer which would given some 4000 retirees an 
average payment of 8750 was rejected by government lawyers 
because they believed the workers would get more in court 
the 3rd us court of appeals last year found westinghouse 
guilty of age discrimination on grounds workers couldnt get both 
retirement and severance benefits when forced to retire prior to 
age 70 
however the supreme court vacated the decision and sent the 
7yearold case back for further review and on thursday the 
appeals court reversed itself based on the high courts standards 
set in another age discrimination case that involved employee 
benefit plans 
the choice between retirement and unpaid layoff doesnt 
constitute involuntary retirement where as here continued work 
was not an option for any of the affected employees and the 
employees layoff status was unrelated to age wrote judge 
anthony scirica 
nor do we believe that exclusion from the severance plan 
caused older employees to retire those who retired did so because 
they were laid off 
moreover after 1982 retirement eligible employees could 
choose between retirement benefits and severance pay with recall 
the court said 
this was not the government position when it sued westinghouse 
eeoc lawyers claimed westinghouse violated federal law by 
forcing laidoff employees under 70 to retire because they would 
not get severance pay and also denying those workers a chance to 
be recalled to work 
at the same time younger workers laid off could lose recall 
rights only if they took severance

some labor contractors are cheating 
migrant farm workers by collecting but not reporting 
unemployment and social security taxes an attorney who filed 
federal suits here alleged on friday 
in many cases the contractors fail to report any income by the 
worker leaving them destitute when the season ends or the worker 
retires said james boon of florida legal services inc 
with farm workers unemployment is a very important benefit 
because its a seasonal job and social security is the only 
pension plan these people are ever going to participate in boon 
said it really hurts and its a real serious violation of law 
the suits filed last week allege that farmers in alabama and 
migrant labor crew chiefs based in belle glade withheld thousands 
of dollars in social security and unemployment compensation 
benefits from palm beach county farm workers picking alabamas 
sweet corn crop in june 1986 june 1987 and june 1988 
most of the workers who filed suits are haitian immigrants 
fluent only in their native creole language and are generally 
unfamiliar with us and state labor laws boon said 
he said they are susceptible to abuses by crew chiefs who may 
try to underreport or fail to report the earned wages of farm 
workers 
crew chiefs work as contractors providing the labor to harvest 
fruit and vegetables and package the crops for shipping in 
addition to providing housing and transportation they distribute 
the migrants wages and are responsible for complying with federal 
labor laws 
but boon said only a small number of investigators police the 
crew chiefs 
there is a real big incentive not to report wages especially 
if you dont expect to get in trouble for not doing it he said 
boon said under current laws crew chiefs must set aside 15 for 
each 100 earned by a worker to be contributed as social security 
and about 5 for the state unemployment tax 
the migrants assume the money is sent in but what happens a 
lot of times is that nothing is sent and nothing is reported 
boon said

the marketing company said friday 
the organization said in a news release received in detroit that 
its overall customersatisfaction index rose about 3 percent to 122 
points this year from last year 
the survey checks consumer attitudes about a variety of aspects 
of their vehicles and the dealerships they used power surveyed 
about 100000 people who have owned 1989model cars for the last 12

the boeing co said today it expects to cut its 
washington state work force by another 2700 jobs in the second 
half of 1990 bringing total job reductions for the year to about 
5600 
boeing which employs 103800 people in the state and 161000 
worldwide had said in january that its work force would be reduced 
by 5000 in 1990 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the increase was due to 
defense program cuts that were unknown earlier this year the 
forecast could change again due to further defense spending 
decisions binder said 
in the first half of 1990 boeing reduced its state employment 
by about 2900 people of those about 2500 quit or retired and 
about 400 were laid off binder said 
boeing the free worlds largest builder of commercial jet 
aircraft has a backlog of more than 1700 firm orders for 
jetliners however fewer workers have been needed on its 
commercial side because production of its new 747400 jumbo jet 
which went into service in early 1989 is past the startup phase 
binder said 
boeing also is working on several defense contracts that have 
run into opposition in congress including the b2 stealth bomber 
boeing is a major subcontractor to northrop corp for the b2 
and has about 8000 people working on the batwing bomber in 
seattle 
dale shellhorn boeings b2 program manager said last month 
that up to 1500 workers would be laid off or reassigned because of 
expected congressional cuts in the bomber program 
at the beginning of the year boeing employed just under 106700 
workers in washington and 164600 worldwide

grain and soybean futures prices skidded for the 
second straight day on the chicago board of trade friday as more 
weather forecasters predicted ideal weather next week for 
midwestern crop development and winter wheat harvesting 
the selloff extended thursdays steep losses in the corn and 
soybean markets as it triggered waves of selling by speculators 
earlier this week some private forecasters were predicting hot 
dry weather for the western and southern reaches of the corn belt 
but by friday meteorologists were near unanimous in forecasting 
a week of mild temperatures and beneficial showers for the region 
the corn crop is nearing its pollination phase when heat and 
dryness could reduce yields 
if you dont get a drought at this time of year it means the 
corn crop generally will be developing under favorable 
conditions said katharina zimmer a grains analyst with merrill 
lynch capital markets inc 
the forecasts contained nothing that would adversely affect 
soybeans which reach their pollination phase in august 
and the relatively dry conditions expected in the great plains 
should allow winter wheat harvesting to accelerate 
at the close wheat futures were 5 cents to 9 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 310 a bushel corn was 4 
cents to 7 cents lower with july at 281 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 4 cents lower with july at 131 a bushel soybeans were 
7 cents to 12 cents lower with july at 618 a bushel

the pace of european monetary union is quickening 
bringing closer the day europe will have a single currency and a 
eurofed or central bank 
the result could merge the 12nation european community into one 
mighty economy with a currency rivaling the dollar in world 
importance 
the benefits are obvious travelers no longer would have to 
shuffle lire pesetas pounds francs guilders and crowns 
businesses would be freed from the paperwork and costs linked to 
fluctuating exchange rates 
although ec leaders have agreed to pursue economic and monetary 
union they now are engaged in an intense debate on how to go about 
it 
major unresolved questions include whether the currency would be 
a new monetary unit or a modification of an existing currency 
whether it would replace all 12 common market currencies or become 
a 13th parallel currency and how much power a central monetary 
body would have 
the momentum has considerably increased bertrand de 
maigret secretary general of the parisbased association for the 
monetary union of europe said in an interview 
just a year ago people did not dare talk about a single 
currency he said but now the discussion is full and open 
the july 1 monetary unification of the germanys and the collapse 
of communism in eastern europe have spurred monetary integration 
experts say 
another boost came last month when britain dropped its adamant 
opposition and made a counterproposal to the main monetary union 
plan mapped out by ec commission president jacques delors 
experts now say monetary union could happen by the mid1990s 
peter ludlow head of the center for european policy studies a 
think tank in brussels said use of a single european currency 
could spread to eastern europe and possibly the soviet union 
the dominance of the dollar would be called into question 
he said in an interview 
karl otto poehl president of the german bundesbank or central 
bank said in london on july 3 that he believed ec leaders already 
had reached loose agreement that monetary unity is desirable 
a decision has already been taken to aim for such change 
poehl said citing an agreement by ec leaders in june to discuss 
such matters at an intergovernmental conference in december 
however prime minister margaret thatcher who strongly opposes 
giving up the pound and relinquishing control over britains 
monetary affairs subsequently insisted on retaining the right to 
keep britain out of any full monetary union 
delors has proposed a threestage approach removing trade 
barriers and bringing all 12 ec countries into the 
currencystabilizing exchange rate mechanism a transitional 
period then full monetary union he has set no timetable 
britain says it is committed to the first stage and to the ecs 
plan to remove trade barriers by the end of 1992 and create one 
marketplace of 320 million people 
britain portugal and greece presently are outside the exchange 
rate mechanism 
delors advocates using the european currency unit or ecu a 
10yearold instrument made up of a basket of european currencies 
to replace the existing currencies the ecu already exists but is 
used mostly for accounting among countries 
poehl said the german mark or some other common currency must be 
at the core of any eventual monetary unity and that the eurofed 
should control its exchange rates 
while he said west germany might agree to give up the use of the 
mark under such a plan he rejected the ecu as a substitute 
west germany also has suggested twospeed monetary union under 
which it would join france belgium the netherlands and luxembourg 
in moving quickly toward monetary union while other ec nations 
come in later delors rejects this 
britain made its counterproposal on june 21 calling for the 
current ecu to be turned into a hard currency to be used alongside 
the existing 12 
a new institution called the european monetary fund would swap 
new ecu bank notes for european currencies thus minimizing any 
threat of inflation from pumping out new money the ecu would not 
be allowed to devaluate against other ec currencies 
in the very long term if peoples and governments so choose 
it could develop into a single currency says britains top 
treasury official chancellor of the exchequer john major 
delors and poehl said the idea should be studied but continued 
to press their own positions 
one possibility is that the british plan might become a phase 
toward full monetary union

beer drinkers are being enlisted in the brewing 
industrys lobbying effort against potential attempts to hike the 
federal excise tax on beer 
beer company employees and distributors also have been asked to 
let congress know about their oppostion to a beer tax hike while 
lawmakers were home for independence day parades and other 
festivities 
the lobbying offensive comes even though no specific proposal to 
boost the excise tax on beer has been offered 
but brewers who already have been under attack in the nations 
capital for questionable marketing tactics are fearful that beer 
will prove a handy target for lawmakers struggling to balance the 
federal budget 
when they talk about taxes the first thing they talk about 
are alcohol taxes said jeff becker a spokesman for the beer 
institute a trade group 
brewers say an increase in the tax on beer unfairly would hit 
middle and lowincome families because they drink most beer 
the federal excise tax on beer amounts to 9 a barrel or about 
16 cents for a sixpack the federal rate has not been changed 
since 1951 although state rates have been raised 
industry executives expect proposals may be made to double the 
federal excise tax on beer the beer institute estimates doubling 
the federal tax would cut beer sales volume by 4 percent at retail 
the beer industry sold 188 million barrels of beer in 1989 and 
expectations are that sales will rise less than 1 percent this 
year annual sales growth has been averaging 06 pecent to 07 
percent a year for the past five years the institute said 
the largest brewer anheuserbusch cos recently distributed 
petitions to its 960 wholesalers which it encouraged to gather 
thousands of signatures from people who want lawmakers to can the 
beer tax 
signatures were collected over the past week at concerts and 
festivals in several texas cities also this past week the 
connecticut beer wholesaler association hired a plane to carry a 
banner with the can the beer tax slogan along the coast 
anheuserbusch is considering developing radio and newspaper ads 
that would use the same theme 
company chairman august a busch iii encouraged employees last 
month to buttonhole legislators on the tax issue while the 
lawmakers were in their home districts for the july 4th holiday and 
to send letters to their washington offices so they would be 
reminded of those views when they returned 
the next several days are key busch wrote 
steven forsyth a spokesman for miller brewing co in milwaukee 
said miller sent letters and packets of information to its 
employees and suppliers detailing the companys opposition to a 
beer tax hike 
he said they and the companys 700 distributors were also asked 
let congresspeople know that we believe excise taxes are unfair 
and will have little impact on closing the budget defiucit 
on monday the beer institute plans to run ads in 65 newspapers 
that will show a fancy diamond bracelet and a can of beer above the 
headline you pay more excise tax on the beer 
the ad points out that federal excise taxes on luxury items such 
as jewelry were eliminated while beer is taxed at three times the 
rate of most other consumer goods 
as one of americas 80 million beer drinkers tell congress 
you dont mind paying your fair share of taxes but enough is 
enough the ad says 
the ads are being placed in areas represented by senators and 
house members expected to be influential in the upcoming talks 
between congress and the white house on a deficit reduction plan 
the ads list a tollfree telephone number and the institute 
plans to send letters under the callers name to his or her 
legislator expressing opposition to any hike in the beer tax 
in his letter to anheuserbusch employees busch warned a beer 
tax increase would hurt the company and the industry for years to 
come 
no one at anheuserbusch is against evenhanded efforts to 
curb the federal deficit we are all willing to do our part but 
excise taxes are anything but evenhanded he wrote

gov michael s dukakis signed a law friday that 
will open massachusetts borders to banks from other regions while 
trying to combat racial bias in lending 
the bill not only guarantees that every bank in the 
commonwealth meets the needs of all its customers but encourages 
those banks to compete in both national and international financial 
markets dukakis said 
interstate banking has been billed as a potential boon to the 
slumping state economy as more outofstate banks could bring new 
capital to massachusetts 
but analysts and representatives of the banking industry said 
friday they did not expect immediate changes 
i dont see any rush to come here said james moynihan a 
banking analyst with advest inc the profitability of new 
england banks is very poor the companies are not very sought 
after for now 
nonetheless robert sheridan of the massachusetts bankers 
association said it was important for massachusetts to make this 
move currently 26 states allow national interstate banking and 
seven more are scheduled to join the ranks within two years 
according to the bankers association 
until now massachusetts allowed interstate banking only on a 
regional basis the bill will take effect in 60 days but banks can 
opt out of the provisions until july 1 1992 if twothirds of the 
board of directors agree 
the community reinvestment provisions of the law will require 
the state to publicize the ratings banks receive based on their 
lending to minorities and lowincome people

the dollar finished mixed on domestic currency 
markets friday after closing higher overseas following the release 
of a betterthanexpected us unemployment report 
gold prices also ended mixed on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold bullion for current delivery slipped 30 cents from late 
wednesday to settle at 36110 a troy ounce republic national bank 
in new york quoted a late bid for gold at 36020 down 30 cents 
despite a continuing slump in the nations manufacturing and 
construction sectors the unemployment rate fell to 52 percent in 
june from 53 percent the previous month the labor department 
reported 
many traders had expected unemployment to shoot up as high as 
55 percent a move that could have encouraged the federal reserve 
to ease interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy 
the report however dispelled some anticipation that the fed 
might ease said ronald holzer chief dealer at harris trust and 
savings bank in chicago higher interest rates make 
dollardenominated securities more attractive and thereby enhance 
foreign investors needs for dollars to buy debt instruments 
nonfarm payrolls increased by 40000 jobs in june far lower 
than market expectations but linda mclaughlin a trader at 
chemical new york capital markets group said the fact that the 
overall unemployment rate fell generated enough interest in the 
dollar to override the impact of the payroll figure 
the dollar rose overseas but turned mixed when trading shifted 
to the united states dealers said however that the 
muchanticipated employment report failed to move the market 
significantly and activity was relatively thin 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 15095 yen down 005 yen from 
thursdays close later in london the dollar was quoted higher at

oil prices wound up a slow week with mostly 
minor changes friday as crude kept to a tight trading range 
volume was extremely light because many market participants took 
an extended break after the independence day holiday on wednesday 
reports of renewed output disruptions due to an illegal strike 
by norwegian oil workers initially inspired crude buying in the 
energy futures pits on the new york mercantile exchange 
but the rally fizzled after it became apparent that the bulk of 
norways oil production was resuming 
wholesale gasoline prices firmed on speculation that an 
explosion and fire at an arco chemical co plant in texas could 
cause a temporary shortage in a gas additive the plant makes an 
additive used to upgrade gas to premium 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate 
dipped 3 cents to 1647 per 42gallon barrel after slumping 30 
cents thursday contracts for delivery during september through 
november also posted modest losses 
unleaded gasoline for august delivery rose 046 cent to 5541 
cents a gallon after sliding 114 cents thursday the contracts for 
delivery through november also settled higher 
among other refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
home heating oil for august delivery settled at 4830 cents a 
gallon off 003 cent the contract ended down 013 cent on 
thursday the september through november contracts finished mixed

1000 cubic feet from 1514 thursday 
energy broker andrew lebow at edampf man international futures

tended to encourage buying of premium gas on the gulf coast

grain and soybean futures prices plunged for the second straight 
day friday as more weather forecasters predicted ideal weather next 
week for midwestern crop development and winter wheat harvesting 
on other commodity markets pork futures fell sharply copper 
futures climbed precious metals slipped and energy futures were 
mixed 
on the chicago board of trade wheat futures settled 5 cents to 
10 cents lower with the contract for delivery in july at 309 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents to 8 cents lower with july at 280 a 
bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents lower with july at 131 a 
bushel soybeans were 8 cents to 10 cents lower with july at 619 
a bushel 
the selloff extended thursdays steep losses in the corn and 
soybean markets as it triggered waves of selling by speculators 
earlier this week some private forecasters were predicting hot 
dry weather for the western and southern reaches of the corn belt 
but by friday theyre all saying the weathers going to be 
mild with good rain in the next week or so and that is the ball 
game said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president in the 
grain trading division of dean witter reynolds inc 
after the close the national weather service issued a new 
sixto10day forecast predicting normal temperatures and rainfall 
in the midwest during the period july 1216 
the corn crop is nearing its pollination phase when heat and 
dryness could reduce yields 
if you dont get a drought at this time of year it means the 
corn crop generally will be developing under favorable 
conditions said katharina zimmer a grains analyst with merrill 
lynch capital markets inc 
the forecasts contained nothing that would adversely affect 
soybeans which reach their pollination phase in august 
and the relatively dry conditions expected in the great plains 
should allow winter wheat harvesting to accelerate 
pork futures tumbled on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
selling linked to recent high hog slaughter figures and sluggish 
retail demand especially for bacon 
the agriculture departments hog slaughter estimates of 293000 
head thursday and 285000 friday were both about 15000 head higher 
than market expectations the high slaughter rates have increased 
supplies of all pork including the bellies from which bacon is 
made 
the heavy slaughter is not alarming but its enough to put 
people on edge said dale durchholz an analyst with agrivisor 
services inc in bloomington ill 
cattle futures were boosted in part by expectations for rising 
retail demand for beef 
live cattle settled 12 cent to 63 cent higher with august at 
7365 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 80 cent higher 
with august at 8455 cents a pound live hogs were 28 cent to 125 
cents higher with july at 6160 cents a pound frozen bellies for 
july and august delivery fell the permitted daily limit of 2 cents 
a pound with july settling at 5417 cents other belly contracts 
were 10 cent lower to 43 cent higher 
copper futures settled 07 cent to 25 cents higher on new 
yorks commodity exchange reflecting increasing worries about 
supply availability 
a strike at asarco incs ray copper mine in arizona stretched 
into its sixth day friday futures also were supported by news that 
production from the chilean copper cos el teniente mine would 
drop by 18000 metric tons this year due to a landslide thursday 
in precious metals trading on the commodity exchange gold 
futures settled 10 cents to 40 cents lower with august at 36290 a 
troy ounce silver was 03 cent to 05 cent lower with july at

the texas water commission recommended a 
2cent per barrel fee on crude oil moving through ports on the 
states gulf coast 
the money would help pay for cleanups of future oil spills 
the fee would be charged until the balance in the texas spill 
response fund is raised from 750000 to 50 million the levy 
would be applied as needed to maintain that balance the commission 
said 
approximately 560 million barrels of crude oil pass through 
oilloading facilities by tanker along the texas gulf coast every 
year the commission said it said the fee would raise more than 
11 million per year 
since several oil and chemical companies have large plants in 
both texas and louisiana the commission also said the new funding 
mechanism should be coordinated with louisiana otherwise shippers 
might go to louisiana to avoid the fee 
interest and principal of the fund would be used to finance 
standby oil spill response contracts and stateowned equipment 
stockpiles 
the money also could pay for a research and development program 
for new oil spill technology such as the bioremediation used in 
the mega borg spill 
in that process bacteria was used to eat the oil and turn it 
into a fatty acid that could be consumed by marine life

two measures of the nations money supply rose 
in late june while a broader money measure fell the federal 
reserve board reported friday 
in a report delayed by one day due to the independence day 
holiday the fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply 
m1 rose 13 billion to a seasonally adjusted 8088 billion in 
the week ended june 25 from a revised 8075 billion in the 
previous week 
the central bank said a measure known as m2 advanced 1 billion 
to a seasonally adjusted 32705 billion from 32695 billion the 
previous week 
but an even broader measure m3 dropped 41 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 40539 billion from 40580 billion

and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 44 percent 
which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the annual growth rate in m3 was 17 percent which is below the 
feds target range of 25 percent to 65 percent the fed has not 
set a target for m1 growth since early 1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 32673 billion a 34 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 40605 billion up 05 percent while m1 
rose 34 percent to an average of 8068 billion

shearson lehman hutton inc has agreed to pay 
the new york stock exchange a 500000 fine to settle allegations 
that it violated exchange rules in buying ef hutton amp co stock 
in 1986 the nyse said friday 
shearson agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying 
wrongdoing the nyse said 
shearson acquired a 49 percent stake in hutton in 1986 then 
sold the shares that october after the management of the troubled 
brokerage rejected a shearson takeover overture shearson then 
known as shearson lehman brothers succeeded in acquiring hutton 
the following year 
according to the nyse shearson violated exchange rules by 
failing to announce on the exchange floor as it bought the hutton 
shares that they were intended for shearsons own account as 
opposed to a customers account 
nyse rules require that any brokerage that is an exchange member 
must announce when it is buying shares for its own account the 
rules also require that orders from the public to purchase stock in 
the same company take priority over a brokerages order for its own 
account 
the nyse said in its disciplinary action that on at least 
three occasions the shearson floor broker failed to yield priority 
to public orders for purchases of shares of hutton 
the nyse also criticized the manner in which shearson sold its 
hutton stake 
shearson sold a third of its stake on oct 15 1986 the same 
day hutton management privately rejected shearsons takeover offer 
the next day hutton announced publicly that it was not engaged in 
any acquisition discussions with any party causing huttons stock 
price to plunge in heavy trading 
the exchange said neither shearson nor hutton ever stated 
publicly that they were involved in takeover talks 
while it did not allege that shearson violated nyse rules in 
selling the stake the exchange said shearson consented to findings 
that it engaged in conduct inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade andor engaged in acts detrimental to the 
interest or welfare of the exchange 
the sale of the stake which was concluded over three days 
coincided with heavy volatile trading in hutton stock fed by 
rumors that other companies were interested in taking over the 
brokerage 
in addition to paying the fine shearson agreed to retain a 
special lawyer for three years to advise the brokerage on laws and 
regulations it must follow in trading stock for its own account 
we determined to settle now rather than go through protracted 
litigation said mike oneill a vice president and spokesman for 
shearson whose majority owner is american express co 
sharon gamsin an nyse spokeswoman said the fine was a record 
for the exchange 
with respect to the sale of its hutton stake oneill said 
shearson didnt violate any law or existing interpretation of 
exchange rules 
in determining shearsons penalty the nyse said it considered 
that shearson consulted with lawyers before selling its hutton 
stake 
in addition after exchange officials questioned shearsons 
purchase of hutton shares shearson took steps to educate its 
employees about exchange rules pertaining to purchases for its own 
account the nyse said the exchange also said shearson took that 
action before it learned it was under investigation for its 
accumulation of hutton stock 
the exchange rules cited in the disciplinary action are based on 
federal laws governing stock trading raising the possibility that 
shearson could face legal sanctions 
it could not be determined whether the securities and exchange 
commission was investigating shearson over the hutton stock 
accumulation the sec does not comment on its investigtions 
however a wall street source close to the case speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the sec was not believed to be 
investigating shearson

mack trucks inc chairman ralph e reins 
said friday a plan by renault vehicules industriels to buy out 
macks remaining outstanding shares is essential to the truck 
manufacturing company 
mack announced friday that renault which holds about 445 
percent of outstanding shares of the american firm wants to buy 
all remaining shares at 6 a share 
the deal if renault succeeds would be worth about 987 
million 
reins who was attending a mack board meeting in france told 
employees he views renaults tender offer to be a very positive 
development according to mack spokesman james santanasto 
renaults financial and operational support is crucial to the 
survival of mack reins said 
new york business analyst charles harris of oppenheimer amp co 
said mack had been in a downward spiral in the last 10 years 
and said he did not think mack could survive as an independent 
company 
this company is dying on the vine and has to do something 
harris said 
mack shares closed at 650 in overthecounter trading friday 
up from 525 on thursday 
santanasto said renault now owns 1325 million shares of macks 
297 million outstanding shares and has warrants for an additional 
5 million 
renault which said it would make its offer july 12 also has 
50 million worth of convertible debentures if exercised and 
converted with the warrant the french firms ownership would 
increase to about 611 percent 
the renault offer expires aug 9 and is conditioned on enough 
shares being tendered to boost its interest in mack trucks to at 
least 90 percent of the truck manufacturers shares 
renault said it was making the offer because of the continuing 
deterioration of the financial condition of mack and the need to 
restructure the companys debt 
mack which lost a record 1854 million last year and 339 
million in the first quarter of 1990 said it expects a net loss of 
about 90 million for the six months ended june 30 
the mack board which includes four representatives of renault 
friday approved a fiveyear business plan which projects a net loss 
of about 130 million for the year ending dec 31 1990 
in a news release mack officials said they do not expect the 
company to show a profit before 1992 
mack officials said the company would probably default on its 
consolidated threeyear revolving bank loans with citibank of new 
york and credit lyonnais of france after its secondquarter results 
are announced 
mack trucks subsidiary mack financial corp has obtained a 
twoweek extension and is seeking a longterm extension of the july 
8 maturity date of its 350 million revolving credit agreement with 
chemical bank 
in the past year mack had tried to reduce business costs and 
conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks 
the effort to stem the companys failing fortunes included the 
resignation of john curcio as chairman last october when mack 
announced it expected to lose 50 million in the third quarter a 
figure eventually reported at 875 million 
curcio was replaced by reins who had predicted that 1990 would 
be a transitional year for the manufacturer 
the companys 1989 net sales totalled 175 billion 17 percent 
lower than 1988 net sales of 21 billion 
in june analysts predicted that macks options to save itself 
from bankruptcy could include closing plants in winnsboro and 
hagerstown md but santanasto said friday there were no such 
plans

approximately 2 million in assets belonging to walker and national 
county mutual the board said in a statement

federal agents have seized 315 million 
that the president of a failed savings and loan allegedly removed 
from the thrift after it was taken over by the governments 
resolution trust corp 
an assistant us attorney said friday it was the first time the 
government has made such a seizure under a law designed to prevent 
misuse of money from failed thrifts 
but no charges were filed against the thrift official who said 
the transaction was legal 
the us attorneys office in houston on monday filed a civil 
forfeiture complaint in us district court to seize the money 
it alleges that joe g garza thenpresident of mcallenbased 
valley federal savings association illegally removed the money 
from valley federal after it failed oct 19 1989 said assistant 
us attorney mike clark of houston 
garza however said he transferred the account and several 
others to various institutions with the approval of the rtc and the 
office of thrift supervision in dallas 
they were fully aware of what we were doing garza said 
friday they encouraged it they did not want us to have any 
accounts that were uninsured 
no charges were filed against garza 
the complaint alleges that garza transferred the 315 million 
to the ncnb texas bank in harlingen where federal agents this week 
seized it clark said the money was a certificate of deposit in 
the name of inversiones sagomar inc believed to be a panamanian 
corporation the federal prosecutor said 
clark said the account seizure completed thursday was the 
federal governments first under the financial institution reform 
recovery and enforcement act of 1989 the act allows for the 
forfeiture of funds misappropriated by employees of savings 
institutions which have been taken over by the rtc 
garza apparently was trying to protect the money from forfeiture 
to the rtc the federal corporation formed to sell assets from 
failed sampls in its effort to bail out the troubled industry clark 
said the rtc is a branch of the federal deposit insurance corp

the day after learning a potentially huge 
aircraft purchase had been put on hold boeing co was soothed 
friday by its fourthlargest order ever a deal for up to 33 747 
jumbo jets for british airways plc 
the order potentially worth 69 billion was the biggestever 
investment in new planes by londonbased british airways which 
said it needed extra passenger capacity as well as replacements for 
older jets 
the airline also said it had negotiated the right to buy a 
larger airplane that boeing hasnt even decided to develop 
british airways said it placed firm orders for 21 boeing 
747400s the worlds largest passenger jet for 233 billion 
pounds the equivalent of 415 billion it took options to buy 12 
more for 155 billion pounds or 28 billion 
in doing so it joined a growing number of carriers ordering 
aircraft nearly a decade in advance to ensure they will have enough 
passenger seats during the early 21st century 
all theyre doing is protecting their position in terms of 
requirements they didnt want to be last in the queue said dan 
white an analyst with the london investment firm county natwest 
woodmac 
the announcement came as boeing increased its forecast of work 
force reductions this year in washington state where most of its 
plants are located boeing said about 5600 jobs would be cut this 
year 600 more than its january estimate mostly because of 
uncertainties in defense contracts 
boeing currently has 103800 workers in washington and 161000 
worldwide 
british airways is to receive the first of its new planes in 
1992 and the 21st in 1999 bringing its 747400 fleet to 42 
aircraft 
the company has bought 21 747400s since 1986 and operates 224 
airplanes in all 
the aircraft will provide extra capacity as well as allowing 
us to replace older boeing 747 equipment british airways 
chairman lord king said our 747400s are delivering good 
performance and proving popular with intercontinental passengers 
ual corp the parent of united airlines had been expected to 
announce within the next few weeks the largest commercial jet 
purchase ever possibly to include boeings proposed new 777 
widebody 
however the employees group seeking to buy ual and the 
corporations board of directors announced thursday that talks with 
aircraft manufacturers had been suspended until the employee group 
could secure loans for the buyout 
ual directors said the aircraft negotiations are on hold until 
aug 9 the deadline for the employees to secure buyout financing 
boeings largestever firm order for aircraft was a 94 billion 
deal for 182 planes by irish leasing company gpa ltd in april 
1989 a week later united placed the secondlargest ordering 180 
planes worth 71 billion 
so far this year boeing has anounced orders for 240 aircraft 
worth a total 253 billion its firmorder backlog is for more 
than 1700 aircraft 
british airways order was the third multibilliondollar 
purchase of 747400s in as many months japan airlines ordered 20 
planes for 31 billion in may and korean air ordered 23 more for 
48 billion in june both those carriers also said they needed 
more capacity and likewise are to receive the last of their new 
planes at the end of the 1990s 
king said british airways obtained the right to convert any of 
the orders if boeing develops a larger version of the 747 
although no details have been confirmed we envisage that new 
747 variants could provide passenger capacities between 450 and 600 
seats he said 
boeing executives have conjectured that in the late 1990s the 
company could build a 747 super the plane would be 
significantly larger than the model 400 which can carry 412 
passengers more than 8000 miles and more than 560 in shortrange 
versions 
however company officials have made no decision on whether to 
build such a plane and offered no specifics on how large it might 
be 
theres nothing in the works at all said john wheeler 
spokesman for boeing commercial airplane group in seattle 
he said the conversion options negotiated by british airways are 
just insurance on the part of the airline in case boeing does 
come up with another jet 
rollsroyce plc won the 107 billion contract for the 747 
engines rollsroyce spokesman dick dalton in reston va said the 
deal was for 160 rb211524g engines including spares 
british airways also said it would begin a 30 million pound or 
53 million refurbishment program for its existing 747100s which 
eventually will be replaced by the new jets 
the airline did not say how it would pay for its new airplanes 
analysts said they expected the airline to own some of the 
aircraft and obtain leases on others to contain costs

raytheon corp has lost its bid for a 
100 million contract that would have allowed it to enter the 
lucrative international submarine electronics market a rhode 
island congresswoman said friday 
rep claudine schneider rri said in a statement that 
raytheon had been notified it lost the contract 
raytheon had hoped the contract to build combat systems for two 
israeli diesel submarines would provide an entrance to the 
submarine electronics market estimated by some to be worth 1 
billion that would provide longterm work and job stability at a 
time when defense department procurement budgets are shrinking 
but the contract was awarded to krupp atlas elektronik a german 
firm working in conjunction with loral corp of ohio according to 
sources in washington and portsmouth loral would perform about 60 
percent of the work 
according to a government official in washington the israeli 
government has asked that the contract be awarded to the 
germanamerican venture 
raytheon officials were unavailable for comment friday 
spokesman joseph debilio was not in the office late in the day 
raytheon based in lexington mass is a conglomerate that 
holds the fourthlargest share of us defense contracts 
it had courted the contract aggressively failure to win it 
could mean major layoffs at the companys submarine signal division 
in portsmouth as early as next week according to a company source 
cited in the newport daily news in fridays editions the facility 
employs about 2800 
the awarding of the contract was complicated because the program 
involves us military aid to foreign nations namely israel 
money given under the aid program is to be used exclusively for 
us or israelimade arms but because no us shipyards make 
diesel subs anymore israel was allowed to buy the subs from a west 
germany company 
however it would be unfair for israel to pay for the german 
portion of kruppsloral system with us taxpayer dollars while 
raytheon could build the same system schneider said this 
approval would directly conflict with the stated policy 
schneider said she wrote to defense secretary dick cheney friday 
asking him to withhold us aid for the contract pending an 
investigation 
rep ronald machtley rri said in june that israel had asked 
for a waiver of the aid program to purchase the german systems an 
israeli spokeswoman denied that 
at that time cheney said an exemption would not be granted but 
some officials including ohio sen john glenn a democrat had 
wanted the germanamerican team to get the contract

former columbia savings amp loan chief thomas 
spiegel won a reprieve friday from posting nearly 19 million while 
he fights charges he squandered thrift funds 
however us district judge stephen wilson restricted spiegels 
personal finances until a hearing later this month and ordered him 
to post a 1 million bond by wednesday 
spiegels lawyer called the ruling a victory in his war with 
us thrift regulators who had sought to freeze the 19 million in 
an escrow account friday and are seeking another 5 million in 
fines the 24 million is the largest civil case ever brought 
against an individual by the regulators 
spiegel has accused the regulators of making him a scapegoat to 
divert attention from their incompetence 
hes holding up fine and were confident that were going to 
be able to respond to all the charges against him said spiegels 
lawyer dennis perluss 
regulators say spiegel wasted columbia funds on guns rock 
concerts wine vacations partnerships and purchases with junk 
bond king michael milken loans to an auto dealer who provided free 
luxury cars to spiegel and 28 million in bonuses he drew even as 
columbia was losing money 
spiegel who earned multimilliondollar salaries while pouring 
beverly hillsbased columbias money heavily into milkens 
highrisk highyield bonds was charged thursday by the ots with 
improperly diverting the money 
acting on perluss request for a temporary restraining order 
wilson temporarily barred the federal office of thrift supervision 
from enforcing its cease and desist order requiring spiegel to 
put the 19 million in escrow 
perluss argued that the law authorizing such emergency freezes 
only applies to current directors or officers of a thrift spiegel 
resigned from columbia at the start of the year the thrift had 
lost 591 million during the year due to the sharp drop in the 
value of its junk bond portfolio 
the freeze also would violate spiegels right to due process 
unless a neutral arbitrator holds a hearing on the matter perluss 
argued 
wilson blocked the ots from forcing spiegel to put the money in 
the escrow account until at least july 30 when a hearing will be 
held before wilson 
but he also ordered spiegel to use his assets only for 
reasonable living expenses until then and to give the thrifts 
office 48 hours notice if he wants to spend more than 5000 on 
anything other than living expenses and lawyers the ots has the 
right to challenge any such expenditures in court 
under the direction of spiegel a close ally of former drexel 
burnham lambert junk bond chief milken columbia had the industrys 
largest portfolio of highyield highrisk junk bonds columbia is 
still operating but analysts predict junk bond losses eventually 
will force government seizure 
the 19 million in restitution if recovered would go to the 
thrift while the 5 million penalty would go to the us treasury 
perluss said the conditions imposed by the judge on spiegels 
finances were perfectly reasonable 
we certainly expect that mr spiegel will fully perform all of 
these conditions and be on the conservative side in doing so 
perluss said
