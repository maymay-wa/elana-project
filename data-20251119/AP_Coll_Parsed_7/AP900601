a tornado churned across a texas highway friday night causing 
accidents that killed at least two people and damaging nearby homes 
authorities said 
at least 19 people were reported injured when the twister struck 
along farm road 305 outside the west texas town of iraan said state 
department of public safety spokesman mike cox 
apparently it struck cars on the highway and well as ranch 
houses and possibly some oilfieldrelated structures in the area 
cox said 
two people were killed in car accidents caused by the twister 
he said there were five car accidents on 305 and four accidents on 
another highway he said 
the injured included two state troopers cut by flying glass when 
hail and high winds accompanying the tornado blew out the windows of 
their patrol car on the road 230 miles northwest of san antonio 
many of the injured were motorists said bonnie burton director 
of nurses at mccamey county hospital but not all of them were in 
cars she said we had one family whose whole house fell in on 
them 
the twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the 
mccamey water supply which warned the citys 2400 residents to 
conserve water for the next couple of days said city secretary 
stanley bryson 
several other tornadoes were reported in the area 
elsewhere friday residents of the texas panhandle town of 
spearman cleared wreckage left in the wake of a swarm of funnel 
clouds thursday and citizens in waterlogged vicksburg miss swept 
out mud left by record flash flooding 
damage in spearman was estimated at 55 million estimates were 
still being collected in vicksburg 
about 200 vicksburg residents were forced to higher ground 
thursday when thunderstorms dumped as much as 7 inches of rain 
overflowing creeks and drainage ditches 
water damage was reported to 187 homes and at least two 
businesses some bridges and roadways in warren county on the 
mississippi river also were damaged said civil defense chief 
luther warnock jr 
weve even had fire trucks out using their hoses to help wash 
the mud and debris out of houses before it dries warnock said 
ive been been here for 30 years and this was the worst 
flooding anyone can remember 
in spearman 10 mobile homes and 10 houses were reported 
destroyed a church also was reported demolished some of the mobile 
homes were smoothed off to the ground said mayor burl buchanan 
he estimated that 5 percent of the panhandle town of 3500 had 
property damage about 80 percent of the city was blacked out and 
phone service was spotty until friday morning 
there was disagreement over just what caused the damage in 
spearman late thursday residents and witnesses said three funnel 
clouds caused the damage even though they didnt quite touch down 
the national weather service said one tornado did scour the surface 
there was one that hit spearman itself and there were multiple 
tornadoes in the vicinity of spearman for several hours last 
night said steven cooper of the national weather service office 
in amarillo there were about three different storm systems two 
dropped tornadoes 
the funnel clouds were too numerous to count he said 
state trooper wayne beighle of amarillo said 10 twisters were 
spotted in the area thursday night 
we were up there until 100 am and there were still 
tornadoes dancing around they were all over the place beighle 
said none touched the ground they were hovering just above the 
ground but that was enough to do the damage 
in vicksburg officials declared a state of emergency friday 
any time there is this kind of flood where people are forced 
to evacuate their homes it is a bad situation said mayor robert 
walker and this time it was very bad 
ive been back to my home and everything is turned over and 
destroyed hope williams said after water drained from her home 
that was my first year in the subdivision and i hope it was my 
last year i mean water was 6 feet deep in that house 
williams and her six children ranging from age 2 to 17 spent 
the night with other flood victims at an emergency shelter 
the water came up so rapidly that people didnt have time to 
get out police chief jimmy brooks said as he surveyed his own 
soaked home we had people in aluminum boats going up and down the 
street trying to help others

the soviets cannot go back to a controlled 
economy and cannot go forward to a successful freemarket economy 
without help from the west soviet academicians said friday at a 
meeting with us experts 
the old system is bankrupt said stanislav shatalin head of 
the economics division of the soviet academy of science it is 
difficult for me to admit that but it is a fact 
the soviets he said still have not decided the degree we will 
work with the west in changing the economy 
without the help of the west we cannot establish a successful 
market system shatalin said 
the comments came at a meeting between 10 soviet academicians and 
a group of us industry education and government leaders the 
2hour session at the national academy of sciences centered on a 
candid report by the soviet experts on their nations efforts to 
radically change their economy 
shatalin a member of the presidents council which advises 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said the soviets have tried to 
shift slowly toward a market economy with measures that included 
elements of both a free market and the old centrally controlled 
economy 
the result he said has been like trying to prop up the 
economy with two rocking chairs 
under the measures shatalin said the economic situation has 
worsened and is getting worse every day 
gorbachev who appealed on television for the soviet public to 
remain calm as prices increased does not approve of the entire 
reform package shatalin said 
the president and the presidents council feel quite 
differently he said there is a very big difference between 
their position and the position of the government 
shatalin said he and other advisers to gorbachev are looking at 
other economic options that could be adopted in the coming months 
and yet he said its widely recognized that the soviet union 
cant return to the old centrally controlled economy which he said 
had collapsed 
even our most reactionary thinkers know it is impossible to 
return to the old system even though many believe that system 
provided a minimum floor to protect the population by providing 
assured employment and income shatalin said 
the majority of the population along with the parliaments and 
the local soviets all agree that there is no longer any 
opportunity except to shift to a market system he said 
there is recognition that we have no other path shatalin 
said 
the soviet government plans to raise the price of bread later 
this year and may organize some form of compensation for people who 
would have to pay a larger percentage of their income for bread 
for lowincome workers shatalin said bread represents a major 
part of their diet and they will not be able to tolerate a steep 
rise in prices without government compensation 
and yet he said the question of compensation has been thought 
through in a very slipshod fashion 
shatalin said that many in the soviet union are confused and 
apprehensive about the effects of a freemarket economy and that the 
expected benefits have not been fully explained 
despite that said academician georgiy arbatov the director of 
the soviet institute for studies of the usa and canada there is an 
entrepreneurial gift among the soviet people 
we fought against entrepreneurs for two generations he said 
but was soon as we stopped they broke out and some are very 
gifted 
among the major economic problems that soviet experts are still 
thinking through according to shatalin are 
how to raise interest rates on savings the government pays 3 
percent on rubles deposited in savings accounts yet inflation is 
about 10 percent were going to have to raise interest rates on 
the order of 12 to 15 percent shatalin said 
how to build a system of selling government bonds to the public 
and how to build a stock market for soviet investors 
how to design laws to permit private ownership of land and other 
property we need to make changes in all types of ownership 
shatalin said otherwise we end up in a closed circle 
how to convert the military equipment complexes into factories 
producing consumer goods 
how to develop a banking system that would provide capital loans 
needed by entrepreneurs in a free market

palestinian guerrillas intended to attack the 
us embassy in tel aviv when they were intercepted off the israeli 
coast this week an israeli official said friday 
the highranking source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said maps seized from the guerrillas indicated they were headed for 
the densely populated beachfront hotel district of tel aviv the 
american embassy is in the district 
during the debriefing we conductedit was established that 
the us embassy was one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel 
district said the source 
an army spokesman said he was not authorized to comment on the 
report 
there was no immediate comment from the united states in 
condemning the abortive raid wednesday the state department left 
open the possibility the incident could affect us dialogue with 
the plo that dialogue began after plo leader yasser arafat 
denounced terrorism in 1988 
israel claims libya helped mount wednesdays strike which was 
aimed at crowded israeli beaches an israeli major general in an 
interview with the yediot ahronot daily provided the most detailed 
account yet of that alleged involvement 
maj gen amnon shahak said the guerrillas involved in the 
seaborne raid trained in a camp set aside for them by libyan 
authorities on the mediterranean coast 
the investigation shows beyond doubt that libyan military 
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation shahak said 
in the newspaper interview 
but a libyan official denied libyan involvement in the raid 
gadallah azouz eltalhi libyas foreign minister said some news 
media claimed that a libyan ship carried the speedboats that tried 
to go to shore libya has no connection at all with the operation 
eltalhi said during a visit to egypt 
israeli forces in helicopter gunships and patrol boats foiled the 
attempted raid as 16 guerrillas headed for the coast in speedboats 
the palestine liberation front a faction of the plo claimed 
responsibility for the attempted attack 
the day of the incident israels beaches and hotels were crowded 
with israelis celebrating the jewish holiday of shavuot 
locations circled on maps found in the guerrillas possession 
indicated a large tel aviv department store as another potential 
target in addition to the hotel district the source said 
wherever they guerrillas can they try to accomplish a 
spectacular mass killing the us embassy was a good target that 
would make headlines the official said 
the embassy almost always crowded with people seeking visas is 
on a busy street off the beachfront 
the armys chief of staff lt gen dan shomron on friday again 
blamed arafat for the raid arafat has denied involvement 
it is difficult for me to say if he personally participated in 
the secrets of the act itself and its preparations shomron said 
on israel television but i have no doubt that his people know 
something and that he has responsibility as the head of the 
organization 
however israels military intelligence chief maj gen amnon 
shahak was quoted as saying earlier friday that arafat probably did 
not know beforehand about the raid 
shahak also said israel knew with complete certainty that the 
plo has planned attacks on soviet jewish immigrants to israel in 
every possible location and at every opportunity 
the statement was the first public comment by security officials 
about threats against soviet immigrants israeli newspapers have 
quoted officials as saying israel stepped up security because of 
expected guerrilla attacks on soviet jews who are expected to pour 
into israel by the thousands as a result of relaxed emigration rules 
in the soviet union 
arab nations oppose the influx saying many of the immigrants may 
choose to settle in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
and drive out palestinians

first came game boy a paperbacksize video game 
introduced less than a year ago by nintendo the batteryoperated 
goanywhere toy has the potential to be a 1 billion a year business 
then came lynx marketed nationwide a month ago by atari computer 
corp as the first handheld game with a color screen its twice as 
pricey as the 90 game boy 
now get ready for turboexpress necs flashier version of putting 
an arcade game into the palm of the hand it has twice the computing 
power of its competitors and uses the same game cartridges in its 
home consoles something its competitors cant match 
and get this turboexpress comes with an option that converts 
the video game into a tv set the cost per unit will be about 200 
to 250 and the tv option is about 80 
people pay for value said kenneth wirt vice president of 
home entertainment for nec technologies inc if you get a lot of 
use out of it theyre willing to pay more this is something you 
cant get from nintendo 
it will be unveiled this weekend at the consumer electronics show 
in chicago and will be on the market in the fall just in time for 
christmas 
but anything that hopes to compete with nintendo the undisputed 
leader of home video games has to be good 
about 1 million copies of game boys blackandwhite 2inch 
diagonal screen were sold last year after it hit the market in 
august 
this year nintendo expects to sell 5 million sets the handheld 
business will account for nearly 1 billion of the companys 
projected sales of 41 billion which gives nintendo about 80 
percent of the us video game market 
the nintendo name rules said larry carlat editor of the new 
yorkbased toy and game magazine anything with a nintendo name 
puts everything else to shame as far as the mass market goes if you 
go head to head with nintendo youre going to lose its the kiss 
of death 
he praised the wizardry of turboexpress but questioned whether 
kids would pay that much for it 
the product is spectacular the technology is startling 
innovative and brilliant carlat said but i dont think its 
for everyone they can get little pieces of the action at the high 
end of the market if they get the price down they could give 
nintendo a run for the money 
handheld games are the latest advancements in the video game 
world that atari created with the introduction of pong in 1976 
the improvements are like video game plots things get flashier and 
more sophisticated as the games go along 
and if there are miniature stereos and cameras why not miniature 
arcades kids play them on school buses and in cars businessmen 
have been spotted with them on airline flights and trains 
since going nationwide in may lynx has sold 90 percent of the 
50000 units it shipped and expects to sell 500000 units this year 
lynx is about the size of a video casette slightly more than 4 
inches high 10 inches long and 1 inch thick it has a 3inch 
screen and runs on six aa batteries although another power source 
is an adapter that plugs into a cars cigarette lighter 
game boy takes four batteries and gets 30 hours of play about 
five times of its competitors 
we wanted to be at the high end of the technology and the 
market said larry siegel vice president of software development 
for atari 
and he considers nintendo not nec to be his real competition 
nec is not the one that keeps me awake at nights siegel 
said when you sleep next to an elephant youre not worried about 
getting scratched by the cat at the end of the bed 
necs turboexpress can show 512 colors at once on its 27inch 
diagonal screen compared with 16 colors shown at once on lynx the 
unit is slightly more than 4 inches wide 7 inches high and 1 inch 
thick like lynx it weighs 1 pound and runs on six aa batteries it 
also has a cigarette lighter adapter

a threeday arab summit ended with a whimper 
rather than the antiamerican bang that iraqi president saddam 
hussein wanted because his hardline allies were outnumbered by 
more cautious heads 
but if the conference which ended wednesday did little to 
bolster the unity the arabs have sought or produce evidence of 
cohesion in a bloc running from the atlantic to the persian gulf it 
did boost saddams image as the new tough guy on the block 
there was no sign that either saddam or syrian president hafez 
assad is prepared to end their 11yearold feud the main obstacle 
to arab unity 
assad saddams main arab rival boycotted the summit along with 
lebanese president elias hrawi not surprisingly since syrian 
troops occupy twothirds of his country 
but saddam can claim some success in simply gathering 16 of the 
21 arab heads of state in his capital 
the iraqi leader has palpable ambitions to be the arab worlds 
paramount leader he portrays himself as the arab champion for 
fighting iran to a standstill in the 198088 iraniraq war saying 
this saved the arabs from a persian onslaught 
saddam can point to the summit as a display of arab support 
against what is perceived as a western campaign against his 
burgeoning military power 
but he failed to parlay this into the broadside of condemnation 
of us support for israel that he sought 
moderate leaders like king fahd of saudi arabia and president 
hosni mubarak of egypt mustered enough support to mute criticism of 
washington and its perceived antiarab bias 
the ostensible reason for the meeting was to find ways to block 
largescale emigration of soviet jews to israel israeli officials 
estimate about 750000 soviet jews will arrive in the next few years 
that would dramatically alter the demographic equation to which 
the arabs have subscribed for so long that the arab population of 
what used to be palestine will eventually outstrip the number of 
jews 
arab hardliners wanted to put the blame more on washington and 
less on moscow because of what they see as the us failure to 
pressure israel into peace negotiations 
the saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal reportedly 
insisted the soviet union also be condemned for the wave of 
emigration to israel 
antiamerican sentiment was aggravated by a us administration 
letter urging the summit to moderate both action and rhetoric 
and avoid overheating the middle east situation 
washington has accused iraq of trying to illegally obtain 
usmade devices that could be used as triggers for nuclear 
weapons baghdad denied this saying the devices were needed for 
laser research 
but in a new climate of uncertainty in the middle east caused by 
the soviet jewish emigration the events in eastern europe and 
growing economic pressures the hardliners had to back off 
at the end of the day the summit showed commendable 
maturity one gulf arab minister said speaking on condition of 
anonymity the summit communique avoided direct condemnation of 
the us government 
the united states and the soviet union have ended their cold war 
and we arabs can no longer count on playing east against west to 
score political gains he contended 
besides we dont seem to have much leverage on either moscow 
or washington he added 
america hijacked the baghdad summit lamented a palestinian 
leader 
in the end the arabs threatened unspecified economic and 
political sanctions against countries that assist soviet jews 
travel to israel 
but what effect this might have remains questionable with 
eastern and western europe drawing closer together

after 12 years of pushing the conservative 
cause in the us senate political maverick gordon humphrey is 
going home to new hampshire to run for a 100ayear seat in the 
state senate 
humphreys run for the parttime job is no surprise to those who 
watched the former airline pilot and political novice rise to the 
national forefront of conservatism 
given his political career nothing about it would surprise 
me said republican political consultant thomas rath he puts 
the un in unorthodox 
humphrey 49 calls himself probably the senates most outspoken 
antiabortion voice and at times has criticized presidents reagan 
and bush for not being conservative enough notably on taxes and 
sanctions against china 
he said he is running for state office partly because he thinks 
new hampshire is straying from its conservative roots 
i think the conservative character of the state is being eroded 
and that weve got to try to stop that he said 
he also believes politicians should not make congress a career 
he has said hed like to run for governor at some point but not 
while his friend gov judd gregg holds the office 
humphreys reputation as a conservatives conservative is a far 
cry from his early political experience he was a democratic 
campaign volunteer and local democratic official in virginia in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s which he once called his shameful 
past 
humphrey moved to new hampshire in 1974 and registered 
republican he emerged as state coordinator of the new hampshire 
conservative caucus in 1977 and was elected senator the next year 
the state senate seat opened up because republican william 
johnson is running for congress to succeed bob smith whos 
running for humphreys senate seat 
humphrey who will make his candidacy official in about two 
weeks has one announced opponent in the sept 11 primary 
republican jack sherburne a state representative for eight years 
and a selectman in deerfield for 12 
though humphrey already is looking beyond the primary and general 
election to the internal contest for senate president sherburne 
66 says humphreys candidacy does not faze him 
i think it will make a heck of an interesting race he said 
humphrey is vocally antiabortion sherburne supports abortion 
rights saying society is not wise enough to substitute laws for a 
womans choice 
humphrey says the way to balance budgets is to cut spending 
sherburne says everything should be on the table when new 
hampshire which has no general sales or general income tax writes 
its next budget pinched by a sagging economy and widespread revolts 
against everincreasing property taxes the state is in the midst of 
a debate on tax reform 
rath and others predict that humphrey will face a major 
adjustment away from a multimedia statewide campaign to a 
doortodoor race in one of the states 24 senate districts 
when the media focus goes away what is left for him to work on 
are basically the same issues we spend day in and day out working 
on and they are not as glamorous as those he worked on in 
washington said senate republican leader edward dupont a likely 
senate president candidate 
new hampshires senators usually work three days a week six 
months a year most share office space and the senate has one 
shared media spokesman 
you have to do it on your feet in the state senate rath 
said it is a solitary job youve got to read every bill 
yourself you just dont have a lot of staff to rely on 
humphrey whose annual us senate salary was 98400 
anticipates no trouble adjusting 
i feel very strongly about the importance of state and local 
government and i have no doubt that one can be as fully engaged at 
this level as in the congress he said 
no democrats have announced for the seat but state party 
chairman ned helms said that if humphrey wins the primary the seat 
would become more winable for democrats he called humphrey a 
rightwing zealot far removed from the mainstream of either party

to review or not to review 
the dilemma has spun a web of controversy and conflict around 
kiss of the spider woman the first offering of an ambitious 
forprofit laboratory for new american musicals 
a musical version of the film that won william hurt an oscar was 
reviewed friday in the new york times by its chief theater critic 
frank rich despite pleas by the organization presenting what it 
calls a workshop production 
the organization new musicals says it had sought a noreview 
policy from the media for its season of shows that began may 1 with 
spider woman the musical is being performed through june 24 at 
the state university of new york at purchase 25 miles north of new 
york city 
we tried to create an alternative method of development to 
broadway martin j bell producing director of new musicals said 
thursday if the times policy stands i would recommend to a 
writer or a director that they do a show right on broadway instead 
of coming here what they did was invade the work process here 
a review by rich usually can make or break a show on broadway 
new musicals had hoped to keep the new york times from reviewing the 
show which is undergoing changes and rewrites during its twomonth 
run in purchase 
a contingent from new musicals including bell met earlier in 
may with warren hoge assistant managing editor of the times and 
with marvin siegel its cultural editor in an effort to persuade 
the paper not to review spider woman but they were not 
successful 
reviewing the arts is one of the reader services provided by 
the new york times said hoge this is a show involving some 
very prominent and interesting people in the american musical 
theater it is presented to the public as a commercial enterprise 
charging a competitive price and its playing in our town 
we have covered the project new musicals a number of times 
and we are covering the show any news organization is wary of 
deliberately not covering something hoge added 
richs review largely negative finds irony in what he describes 
as the overly elaborate broadwaystyle staging 
if anything the tragedy of spider woman is that new 
musicals which describes itself as a new broadway in its 
promitional lterature has not allowed the work to develop slowly in 
a laboratory staging as nonprofit offbroadway companies have 
helped develop adventurous musicals like a chorus line or sunday 
in the park with george rich wrote instead spider woman 
arrives already burdened with the full and in this case crushing 
weight of broadway extravagance 
other new york critics were informed of the times decision to 
review the show and several decided to review the show before 
richs notice came out 
clive barnes theater critic of the new york post said the 
times review policy made it impossible for him to ignore the 
musical he panned the show in thursdays newspaper but was even 
more scathing about the times policy for the show 
a local occurrence has been transformed into a national 
event wrote barnes who used to be theater critic for the times 
he said the times decision was inimical to the health of the 
broadway theater 
a daily news critic will review the show friday and other 
critics including those of variety and the associated press will 
review it in the near future 
interest in kiss of the spider woman has been high since the 
project was announced in january the musical involves some of 
broadways biggest talents 
the show is directed by harold prince director of the phantom 
of the opera and has a book by playwright terrence mcnally the 
score was written by john kander and fred ebb the team behind 
cabaret and zorba 
bell vowed that new musicals which has a firstyear budget of 
about 10 million would continue its season of four shows spider 
woman will be followed by the secret garden based on the 
classic childrens novel by frances hodgson burnett it runs oct 23 
through dec 23 
if i cant change the times policy in the future i have to 
rethink the whole operation bell added it makes us a very 
different kind of place im worried it will scare some important 
artists away

it rained nine days after an indian 
water ceremony and three valleys municipal water district officials 
coping with a fouryear drought are impressed 
im a pragmatic person said three valleys municipal water 
district executive paul stiglich whose agency paid for the 
ceremony the indians came they danced it rained well probably 
send them a thank you note 
tony romero the 67yearold patriarch of the chumash reservation 
in santa ynez said it wasnt exactly a rain dance it was a water 
ceremony he said an act of reverence for one of the earths 
natural resources 
three valleys provides water for about 500000 residents of the 
eastern san gabriel valley 30 miles east of downtown los angeles 
the district paid romero and his family 1000 to perform at an 
annual water awareness luncheon on may 18 nine days later a 
surprise oneinch deluge soaked the region not enough to stop the 
drought but a nice surprise officials said 
the whole idea was really for them just to share the reverence 
they have for water and other natural resources but im not going 
to say it didnt help said district general manager richard 
hansen 
romero said he doesnt have any power to make it rain but he 
notes if you pray hard enough your voice might just be heard 
everything we did was sincere and from the heart romero said 
after the memorial day weekend storm if they think it helped 
then dont spoil it for them

an unmanned module containing facilities to produce 
highquality semicondutors in zero gravity was launched to 
rendezvous with the mir space station soviet media reported 
the kristall space module is to link up june 6 with the mir 
where cosmonauts anatoly solovyov and alexander balandin have been 
working for nearly four months according to soviet tv and the tass 
news agency 
the launch thursday from the baikonur space center in soviet 
central asia was delayed several times in recent days because of

no college no problem if youd like to 
collect a sheepskin from the university of hard knocks where phi 
beta kappa keys are scorned and graduates include jesse helms and w 
clement stone 
we absolutely will not take a college graduate says founder 
jim comstock were very firm on that point 
comstock 79 decided to take an old adage one step further in 
1947 since then he has awarded nearly 2000 degrees he has no 
campus and holds no classes but graduates from as far away as 
canada will gather saturday night for an annual commencement 
ceremony 
applicants must be successful in a particular field donate 100 
to their prospective alma mater and buy a subscription to the 
hillbilly which offers a mix of news poetry and a satirical column 
written by comstock 
comstock editor of the weekly west virginia hillbilly newspaper 
has befriended presidents politicians and other celebrities through 
his university called uhk by its alumni 
hard knocks graduates include us sens wendell ford dky and 
jesse helms rnc former us sen barry goldwater charles o 
finley former owner of the oakland as tulsa bank millionaire lee 
braxton ventriloquist jimmy nelson arnaud de borchgrave editor of 
the washington times and chicago insurance magnate w clement stone 
theres a lot of people in the public eye who wont admit they 
didnt go to college comstock said they have to be very 
successful to admit they didnt go to college 
comstock said this years graduating class of 40 will receive 
their degrees printed in the school colors black and blue at 
aldersonbroaddus college in philippi 
comstock who lives in richwood about 45 miles east of 
charleston said he began granting degrees on a whim to bolster the 
sagging ego of his partner in the hillbilly 
my former partner bronson mcclung was kind of down one day 
because he didnt have a college degree and i did said comstock 
a marshall university graduate he said we aint paired 
correctly 
comstock found some fancy paper had university of hard 
knocks stamped across the top scribbled in some latin and 
presented the diploma to mcclung 
mcclung later left the newspaper and opened a successful bank 
i graduated with honors mcclung said the idea was 
fabulous 
hard knock graduates are a proud breed 
ive got a doctorate from uhk said john hughes president 
of the archibald candy corp which makes fannie may candy i 
suppose its because im a double dropout i dropped out of high 
school got my high school equivalent degree then dropped out of 
college 
nelson an assistant vice president for a cape coral fla bank 
and a member of the uhk class of 1984 keeps his diploma on a wall 
in his office 
im very proud of it said nelson who captured a national 
television audience in the early 1950s as the voice behind his 
ventriloquists dummies danny oday and farfel a philosophical dog 
with floppy ears 
i work with college graduates all around me said nelson who 
started in show business after high school most people think its 
a joke but it isnt its kind of tongueincheek but its nice 
to have something on the wall that means something

a black college student who complained she was the 
victim of a campaign of racial harassment likely staged the 
incidents herself the prosecutor said thursday 
however emory university freshman sabrina collins wont be 
prosecuted for the allegedly false accusations which were widely 
reported at a time when racial tension seemed to be on the rise on 
us college campuses 
authorities hinted from early on they were suspicious the 
scrawled racist invective in ms collins dormitory room was a hoax 
even though the harassment was said to have caused her to collapse 
unable to speak on april 10 but neither university officials 
police nor prosecutors publicly stated those suspicions 
on thursday dekalb county solicitor ralph bowden released a 
letter to the georgia bureau of investigation saying he wouldnt 
press charges against ms collins the letter suggests but doesnt 
state that he has concluded she staged the harassment 
there certainly is some direct evidence and a great deal of 
circumstantial evidence that would cause one to believe that 
sabrina was the only person involved in these matters bowden told 
the new york times that is certainly the conclusion of the 
investigating agencies and i have no quarrel with that based on a 
reading of their reports 
bowdens office prosecutes misdemeanors a letter similar to his 
was released thursday by dekalb county district attorney bob wilson 
who handles misdemeanors 
there is substantial evidence which contradicts ms collins 
allegations wilsons letter says 
ms collins attorney james howard disputed those who blame the 
incidents on her 
it is apparent that the person who inflicted this pain and 
suffering upon her is not only free to do it again but has succeeded 
in evading the investigation howard said in a statement issued 
thursday 
state rep tyrone brooks of atlanta who has been an advisor to 
emory students in the wake of the collins incident urged 
authorities to keep the investigation open and prosecute even if 
ms collins is found to be the culprit 
what they want to do is blame the victim place a cloud over 
the victim publicly in the media and then walk away brooks said 
the investigation should not be left just hanging in the air 
whomever is responsible for these acts of vandalism needs to be 
apprehended and prosecuted no matter who it is 
the times quoting unidentified officials familiar with an 
unreleased report by the state bureau of investigation said it 
noted her accounts of harassment apparently coincided with a 
university investigation of suspicions she cheated in a chemistry 
class 
in declining to prosecute bowden said it appeared ms collins 
suffered from serious emotional problems he suggested counseling 
and treatment 
ms collins was hospitalized after she collapsed and became mute 
april 10 her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and found 
the words die nigger die scribbled in nail polish on the floor 
some students held silent protests and group meetings saying 
racism is a timehonored tradition at emory where 7 percent of the 
9500 students are black 
ms collins earlier had reported incidents in which pictures were 
broken bleach was poured on some of her clothes stuffed animals 
were mutilated and the phrase nigger hang was found written on 
the wall in her closet 
emory police first said they couldnt understand how the 
incidents continued after they installed an alarm in ms collins 
room they later theorized that someone had entered the room only 
once concealing some of the vandalism so it would be discovered

the phones ring simultaneously like a choir ridgeway said 
scrambling to orchestrate twin cities festivities for soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs historic visit 
ridgeway is the lead us coordinator for the gorbachev visit 
hes had just two weeks since sundays visit was announced making 
his job like taking a 500pound watermelon and squeezing it into a 
twopound box 
its thursday now and ridgeway paces the floor of his suite in 
the radisson plaza hotel his sanctuary talking on a portable 
telephone his white shirt is rumpled he wears tennis shoes he 
needs a shave 
twenty hours a day ridgeway is planning every detail for the 
visit down to ordering beer for the soviet entourage 
its a job he lobbied for 
for an advance person to advance gorbachev is like an artist 
working with michelangelo ridgeway said twenty years from now 
youll get to say i was involved with the gorbachev trip 
ridgeway 41 has handled logistics for other major events the 
minnesota twins victory parade in 1987 a super bowl halftime show 
two years ago this years national right to life rally in 
washington dc president carters visits to minnesota and korea 
and hubert h humphreys funeral 
but gorbachevs visit is the most complicated event ridgeway has 
tackled he snatches three or four hours of sleep in his hotel room 
and conducts an interview while eating a sandwich 
honestly in the last two weeks i saw my kids for 2 hours for 
lunch which was interrupted by phone calls and people and by two tv 
things ridgeway said 
my wife reminded me of the old saying my family has total 
recall they see me once and never forgot me 
those who have worked with ridgeway cite his energy and 
efficiency

minneapolis and the cathedral of st paul for a possible ecumenical 
service to pray for peace and friendship

certainly its a tight timeline he said but you know 
no guts no glory

worldwide public fears of aids and harsh government 
controls have created a separate epidemic of discrimination 
forcing many aids sufferers into hiding and hampering efforts to 
control the disease a report says 
the reports author martin foreman said voluntary measures that 
respect the rights of people most at risk are the best way of 
containing the deadly disease 
the 320page report the third epidemic was written by the 
panos institute and the norwegian red cross it was released 
thursday 
foreman heads a unit at the panos institute an international 
research and policy studies institute with offices in london the 
organization has collected information on aids particularly in 
developing countries since 1986 
the report noted that iraq requires all foreigners staying longer 
than five days to take blood tests while cyprus only tests african 
students and cabaret artists and other countries just check wouldbe 
immigrants 
the report cited dozens of cases of discrimination against people 
who have aids or hiv the human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
it 
in almost every country people testing positive for hiv have 
been sacked from their jobs disowned by their families rejected by 
friends refused treatment by doctors and turned down by schools and 
colleges the report said 
foreman said the hostility was the third epidemic after the 
hiv infection and the later appearance of aids in the early 1980s 
it is a social infection the denial blame and 
stigmatization which the fear of aids brings out in individuals and 
societies foreman told a news conference 
he said that controls such as compulsory blood tests on 
prostitutes or soldiers and immigration curbs have not only failed 
to contain the virus but have almost certainly had the opposite 
effect 
if people who are hivpositive are subject to a series of legal 
measures in addition to societys hostility those at risk will 
steer clear of any situation in which they might be identified as 
carrying the virus said foreman 
the report said the most effective method of containing the virus 
was to win the confidence of those most affected by the disease 
in addition to fear the aids stigma often masks racism or 
prejudices against the highrisk groups homosexual men drug 
abusers and prostitutes said foreman 
aids is a deadly affliction in which a virus attacks the bodys 
immune system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers it is spread mainly by sexual contact 
between homosexual men the use of contaminated needles among drug 
abusers and transfusion of tainted blood 
the report said students from africa reported to be the worlds 
worsthit region used to be regularly abused with racist remarks in 
moscow or beijing now they might hear the russian or chinese 
words for aids it said 
at least 24 countries now require certificates from some or all 
foreign visitors mainly students and others seeking to stay more 
than six months that they do not carry the aids virus the report 
said 
the us government relaxed its immigration restrictions in april 
to try to defuse protests including a boycott of an international 
conference on aids in san francisco this summer 
the us immigration and naturalization service said foreigners 
can get 10day visas to attend business professional or scientific 
conferences without revealing whether they carry the virus 
however the report said that for ethical and practical reasons 
no other countries were likely to follow cubas lead in establishing 
a compulsory isolation program 
cuba screened all its 104 million citizens in 1986 and detained 
the hundredth of a percent who proved positive at a sanatorium on 
the outskirts of havana 
other countries with compulsory screening of highrisk groups 
include south korea which screens prostitutes south africa has a 
law providing for the screening of all immigrants but it is in 
practice applied only to black mine workers the report said

george bush took it with grace but mikhail 
gorbachev did it again he upstaged the president just as he had 
grabbed the spotlight from ronald reagan 
you know im jealous about air time bush laughed its 
terrible 
while bush kept a low profile for most of the day thursday 
gorbachev was out shaking hands on the sidewalk holding impromptu 
news conferences and having lunch and discourse with the likes of 
jesse jackson jane fonda gregory peck and other prominent 
americans 
bush who remained out of the limelight after his public greeting 
of gorbachev for their first meeting of the day finally emerged 
from his office for a brief rose garden news conference after the 
soviet leader had stolen most of the television coverage 
the president observed it was the end of a very interesting 
day 
and how is his chemistry with gorbachev 
well i dont know the us president said thats a good 
question 
i feel very comfortable with him i feel very free to bring up 
positions that i know he doesnt agree with and that hasnt always 
been the case there have been times when people banged their shoes 
when they didnt agree thats not the mood or the tone of this 
meeting 
the current soviet leaders antics dont match nikita 
khrushchevs pugnacious shoebanging at the united nations three 
decades ago but gorbachev has proved to be as volatile and 
unpredictable 
gorbachev stole the spotlight from reagan during their december 
1987 summit when he stopped his motorcade and jumped out to shake 
hands with bystanders that also caught then vicepresident bush a 
passenger in gorbachevs limousine by surprise 
the soviet leader did the same thing thursday hopping from his 
car and plunging into a crowd of several hundred people about a 
block from the white house 
gorbachev also spoke to reporters on the driveway outside the 
white house once on his way to see bush for their afternoon 
meeting and then again at considerable length on his way out 
the soviet leader dislosed the fact that he and bush had dealt in 
depth with the issue of german unity and had assigned secretary of 
state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze to continue to press the search for common ground 
we understand the position of each other gorbachev said of 
his second meeting of the day with bush i hope that we understand 
each others concerns better as well 
the tactic clearly caught the white house press office and most 
reporters following the summit off guard the white house had 
moved its entire press operation to the gymnasium of george 
washington university six blocks from the white house 
gorbachevs comments came hours before white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater and his soviet counterpart arkady 
maslennikov were to hold a joint briefing and read a statement on 
the bushgorbachev talks concerning germany 
at that briefing fitzwater noted that gorbachev outside the 
white house and bush in the rose garden had pretty well covered the 
subject and maslennikov joked we can dispense with the briefing 
everything was said 
although the president has held 50 news conferences so far more 
in 16 months in office than reagan held in eight years and is 
known for keeping a frenetic schedule both in the white house and 
about town he has been laying low this week 
he made no public appearances on tuesday and wednesday and on 
thursday nothing was on bushs public schedule during the almost 
four hours between the end of his first meeting with gorbachev and 
the beginning of his second 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said that bush used some of 
the time to meet with advisers to discuss the first summit session 
hes also got a country to run popadiuk said 
but finally bush ambled out into the rose garden to a hastily 
assembled group of reporters to get equal time 
had he noticed a change in the soviet leader since their first 
summit at malta last december hes six months older bush said 
but he added theres a certain strength and confidence that 
was there in malta and certainly is still there now and you can 
feel that 
and the president added he thinks he and gorbachev take each 
other seriously i can talk very frankly with him when he talks 
i listen and when i talk he listens were not shouting at each 
other

a naive young man is transformed into a 
corrupt calculating bureaucrat in a recent soviet film called the 
villain ivan minasbekov jokes that he knows him 
i understand everything about this mafia blackmarket 
person says minasbekov a violinist who emigrated here in 1982 
to be with his only daughter one is my neighbor in baku thats 
my city where i was born 
the villain is typical of the films being shown during the 
superpower summit this week at a soviet film festival together 
they amount to a celluloid catharsis 
virtually every film is a grim look at some aspect of the soviet 
unions cruel history or current troubles occasionally the gloom is 
disguised as farce but the themes are the same siberian prisons 
stalinist oppression heroic resistance bureaucratic hypocrisy and 
the guilt of torturers 
emigres scholars and plain old film buffs have been filling the 
64seat mary pickford theater at the library of congress since the 
soviet festival began last friday 
and what they are seeing was made possible by the kremlin itself 
through the soviet embassy the embassy suggested the festival as an 
adjunct to the bushgorbachev summit and offered a large choice of 
films all of them brutally critical of the soviet union 
they didnt seem concerned about that at all said patrick 
loughney the theater curator who selected the films there was no 
attempt to talk us into one film or another my feeling is they 
just want the world to see their films theres not so much worry 
about the content 
most of the eight festival films are from 1989 and only one was 
made before 1987 loughney describes them as depictions of the 
russian soul in torment all are so scathing that the filmmakers 
could only be doing this with official encouragement he said 
on a brilliantly sunny thursday afternoon there were few empty 
seats as the projectionist cranked up a threehour drama called 
from the life of fyodor kuzkin the story of a peasants 
struggle against stalins forced collectivization drive of 1929 it 
featured flashbacks dream sequences and a stark style reminiscent 
of swedish director ingmar bergman 
when wednesdays scheduled film failed to show the soviet 
embassy obliged by quickly sending a substitute this was the 
villain a film made in azerbaijan 
it was so bleak in terms of how it showed soviet society that i 
was totally dumbfounded that the embassy would put this forth 
said tom van der voort a consultant on federal budget matters and a 
selfdescribed inveterate moviegoer 
one film the fountain was described in festival literature 
as a satirical portrait of everyday soviet life including black 
market schemes marital feuds in tight quarters and hypocritical 
bureaucrats masquerading as reformers it got laughs loughney 
said but one emigre told him later that he didnt find it funny 
it was too true 
another offering our armored train tells the story of a 
retired gulag official forced to confront his past actions it ends 
with his suicide still another recounts a boys escape from a 
detention camp to search for his father who has been unjustly 
imprisoned in siberia 
minasbekov and his wife nina a language teacher have attended 
several of the screenings and say they are somewhat surprised by 
what they are seeing for example they said it would have been 
impossible to see a movie like the villain in the soviet union 
while they lived there 
many things are changed ivan said for us its very hard 
to imagine added his wife but unlike some of her compatriots 
nina minasbekov said the films do not depress her we knew about 
it all before she said we could see

afghans koreans and other protesters trying to 
get messages through to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arent 
making much headway and so far have been outnumbered by tourists 
officeworkers and police at their assembly site across from the 
white house 
for thursdays opening summit session between gorbachev and 
president bush the demonstrators in lafayette park filled only a 
tiny portion of the cityblocksized greenery including onlookers 
and a number of homeless people who normally inhabit the park the 
crowd peaked at no more than 400 
police reported no violent incidents or arrests 
during gorbachevs two trips to the white house during the day 
officers kept the protesters behind snow fences at least 100 yards 
from the fenced perimeter of the mansions grounds 
at the end of the day no more than 60 demonstrators remained in 
the park although two of them blared their protestations into 
electronic speakers most stood quietly and politely holding 
handlettered signs and answering questions from reporters 
ive been handing out leaflets and talking to the press said 
james amshoff a new york city salesman and a member of the new 
testament church which believes only jesus christ not world 
leaders can bring peace we also took a break to pray 
evening rush hour traffic inched along pennsylvania avenue 
between the park and the white house during the afternoon session 
between the two presidents 
back in the park michail makarenko sported a gas mask while 
contending that any help or support the us government gives 
gorbachev is hurting the soviet people makarenko said he was a 
political prisoner for 11 years in the soviet union 
its not gorbachev who is giving something the 59yearold 
makarenko said through a translator gregory burnside it is the 
people who are resisting who are tearing it from his throat 
a halfdozen members of the committee for peace disarmament and 
reunification of korea urged an end to cold war tensions there 
the message is that in this recent atmosphere of easing 
international tensions korea still remains an island of cold war 
said spokeswoman chung hong the two leaders have a special 
responsibility because the division and the militarization of korea 
is a byproduct of the ussoviet relations forged after world war 
ii 
seventyfive cuban exiles seeking freedom for their homeland were 
redirected from lafayette park to the ellipse on the other side of 
the white house where they had their permit to demonstrate said 
maj carl holmberg of the us park police 
six buddhists who favor total disarmament pounded japanese 
buddhist prayer drums and chanted a prayer for world peace as they 
burned incense and sat crosslegged on the ground facing a small 
statue of buddha 
were offering our prayer in support of bush and gorbachev 
said jerry talandis of amherst mass a 26yearold social worker 
we dont want them to stop until they have total nuclear 
disarmament 
earlier in the day the moscow rock group gaza played for the 
second consecutive day to call attention to the devastation of aids 
and gathering the largest crowd

relations between east and west a respected defense journal 
reported 
janes defense weekly reported the decision in its june 2 
edition released thursday it said the decision was made by 
alliance defense ministers during a meeting last week in brussels 
canada and turkey had vied for the base for five years at 
considerable cost and effort janes said 
the decision was taken in the light of recent shifts in east 
europe changes in nato requirements and the high cost of 
establishing the base the journal quoted an unidentified diplomat 
as saying 
the center would have trained fighter pilots from 11 nato air 
forces to fly up to 40000 lowlevel practice runs each year the 
journal said 
janes quoted officials in brussels as saying the demise of the 
project meant north atlantic treaty organization forces would be 
left to make their own arrangements for training in lowlevel flying

children under 18 are fined 25 if caught 
smoking cigarettes in woodridge ill one of the few places where 
laws against smoking by minors are enforced 
it is well documented that these laws are seldom enforced 
us surgeon general dr antonia novello said thursday noting that 
44 states have statutes forbidding tobacco sales to minors 
more than 3000 teenagers become regular smokers each day 
she said if current smoking rates were to continue in the united 
states then about 5 million of the children now living in this 
country would die of smokingrelated disease 
those statistics so concerned woodridge police officer bruce 
talbot that he wrote a city ordinance against smoking by youths he 
said the illinois statute was too weak to be effective 
talbot said the city law forbidding anyone under 18 from 
purchasing or possessing tobacco is enforced like the seat belt law 
if we catch them doing something else wrong and also find them 
with cigarettes we write a ticket for tobacco possession he 
said you write just a few of those and word spreads among the 
kids 
talbot was one of the speakers at a conference called by novello 
to gather information to bolster the bush administrations campaign 
against smoking by youths 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan recently 
released a proposal for legislation that could be adopted by states 
to set up or strengthen laws against teenage smoking 
another speaker at the conference john joyce of the maine 
grocers association said he favored fining the minor or the clerk 
who sells tobacco to a minor but he is opposed to licensing store 
owners who sell cigarettes 
that would just be another way for the state to raise money to 
use for some unrelated purpose said joyce maine already 
collects 40 million from tobacco taxes why not use that for 
enforcement 
he said that if the clerk or minor knew they could be fined for 
dealing in cigarettes they would be deterred 
licensing and fines were among the suggestions in sullivans 
model legislation also included are provisions for posting signs 
publicizing the law in places were cigarettes are sold setting 19 
as the legal age for using tobacco and banning cigarette vending 
machines 
tom mcmann a spokesman for the vending machine industry said 
only 35 percent of the cigarettes sold in the united states in 1988 
came from vending machine and the numbers are decreasing 
a ban would only hasten an industry already in decline he 
said 
he said he favored placing some of the burden on youths by making 
possession illegal 
a sign on a machine that says its illegal to sell to minors 
doesnt bother them he said 
novello accused the tobacco industry of spending 33 billion 
annually to advertise and promote their products in ways that appeal 
to children and adolescents 
a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute interviewed later said 
cigarette companies do not want children as their customers 
for decades we have taken aggressive actions to keep cigarettes 
out of the hands of kids brennan dawson said she said 
advertising is aimed not at creating new smokers but at selling 
tobacco products to people who already smoke 
what causes teens to smoke is peer pressure and the influence 
of elders in a childs life said dawson those are the issues 
that need to be addressed 
the tobacco spokeswoman said smoking among teenagers is down 
about 20 percent of all high school students now smoke compared 
with 30 percent in the 1970s she said 
but smoking among young women is up said the surgeon general 
she said they now smoke at a greater rate than young men 
according to the annual survey of drug use by high school seniors 
sponsored by the national institute on drug abuse 
lung cancer has already overtaken breast cancer as the number 
one cause of cancer death among women novello said if we fail 
to reduce smoking among girls the epidemic of lung cancer among 
women will continue to grow well into the next century

the soviets werent dressed in black tie raisa 
gorbachev didnt eat her meat and her husband still didnt seem to 
be on a firstname basis with president bush 
but none of that dampened the conviviality at thursday nights 
white house dinner in honor of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and his wife it was the social event of the year 
i think we were all happy declared academy awardwinning 
actress jessica tandy who was seated at a table with president bush 
and mrs gorbachev 
another guest evangelist billy graham pronounced the evening 
terrific and one of the great evenings of my life he said 
people were in an optimistic mood about the progress of the summit 
american mezzosoprano frederica von stade entertained the 130 
guests in the east room after dinner with several opera numbers and 
such american classics as summertime and songs from the musical 
showboat 
gorbachev leaped up to shake her hand after the performance and 
his wife kissed the singer on both cheeks 
barbara and i knew that president and mrs gorbachev loved 
music bush said following the performance we could think of no 
finer art than opera to transcend the differences and bring out the 
things we have in common 
one thing mrs gorbachev didnt have in common with many of the 
guests was an appreciation for the roasted filet of beef mascotte 
with green peppercorn sauce that was served at dinner she left hers 
on the plate but did eat the maine lobster observers said 
no one seemed to know if the soviet first lady normally doesnt 
eat red meat or simply wasnt that hungry 
as is customary for soviet dignitaries the gorbachevs showed up 
dressed more informally than the tuxedoclad and bejeweled americans 
at the blacktie dinner 
he wore a dark business suit and she wore a tealength 
threepiece dress with a black green and pink floral design 
traditional soviet thinking holds that formal attire is elitist 
bush and the other american men wore tuxedos mrs bush was 
attired in a new sapphire blue gown by her favorite designer arnold 
scaasi 
after the entertainment the gorbachevs did not stay for the 
dancing in the white house grand foyer instead they were escorted 
by the bushes to their waiting limousine and drove back to the 
soviet embassy for the night 
bush then twirled the first lady around the floor to shall we 
dance before secretary of state james a baker iii cornered him 
for an extended and animated discussion in the middle of the dance 
floor 
in their formal toasts during dinner bush and gorbachev 
addressed one another as mr president rather than by first 
names a style which bush prefers with other heads of state 
mr president bush told his counterpart it is said that 
your country is the land of possibilities you have demonstrated the 
truth of that statement and weve seen this past year that ours is 
a world of possibilities that ours is a time of historic change a 
time when men and nations can transform history 
the soviet president said his country no longer sees the united 
states as an enemy he also paid tribute to national difference 
ideological stereotypes are fading away he said we have 
come to understand each others motives as we are changing and 
coming closer to each other we have not ceased to be different but 
it turns out that that is not so bad quite the opposite it is 
useful for diversity is a vital force of development 
he made a favorable impression guests said 
everybody wanted to see what he would say and how he would say 
it said treasury secretary nick brady his speech was well 
received and so was the presidents 
bushs daughterinlaw sharon bush of denver gave mrs 
gorbachev a good review as well calling her very warm and nice 
among other guests in addition to administration officials and 
members of congress were actress tandys husband hume cronyn and 
morgan freeman her costar in the academy award best picture 
driving miss daisy

president mikhail s gorbachev may not have the 
means to carry out a treaty he is expected to sign to destroy soviet 
stocks of chemical weapons 
western officials say that the kremlin last year closed its only 
facility able to carry out the task and has disclosed no plans to 
build another 
there has been no public announcement and the soviets have made 
no communication to the united states on their plans to destroy the 
weapons said a western official involved in the negotiations 
we still have no idea how they plan to do it the official 
said speaking on condition he not be further identified 
top us and soviet leaders have been silent about this curious 
aspect of the chemical weapons pact 
spokesmen at the soviet ministries of defense and foreign affairs 
declined to discuss how they will fulfill the prospective treaty 
which has been touted by us and soviet officials as a highlight of 
the washington summit 
the pact concluded when the us and soviet foreign ministers 
met in moscow in may requires the superpowers to destroy 80 percent 
of their chemical weapons immediately they would reduce their 
stocks to 2 percent of existing levels in the next eight years and 
destroy the rest two years later if all other countries capable of 
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban officials said 
the united states has an estimated 30000 tons and the soviets 
50000 tons of the weapons according to government sources and 
independent experts 
the us army tested a destruction facility on johnston atoll in 
the pacific ocean this spring and is building similar plants in six 
states 
the soviets built a destruction plant in chapayevsk 550 miles 
southwest of moscow but last summer it fell victim to the growing 
environmental movement 
residents of chapayevsk a center of the soviet chemical 
industry complained the plant would add to already high levels of 
pollution in their city and it was never used 
unable to calm the residents fears soviet officials closed the 
facility and asked the supreme soviet legislature to find a safe 
site to build a new one so far none of the lawmakers has 
volunteered a district for the new plant 
after the chapayevsk facility was closed sheila buckley the top 
pentagon chemical arms negotiator said in a speech that we do not 
believe that they are able right now to destroy the amount they 
claim to have which is 50000 tons there is no indication the 
situation has changed us analysts say 
us rep larry hopkins rky visited the chapayevsk site last 
summer and suggested to secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet defense minister dmitry t yazov that the united states share 
technology with the soviets to destroy the weapons 
the soviets are more inclined to go that route than the 
americans but have not made any concrete requests the western 
official said 
a soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri a gremitskykh 
declined to disclose his governments plans for destroying the 
chemicals 
now there will be negotiations on this issue between the 
presidents and experts and ministers and we hope there will be a 
written agreement and then then we will give you an answer about 
how we will be destroying these agreed upon quantities of chemical 
weapons gremitskykh said 
five officials in the press office of the soviet ministry of 
defense declined to discuss soviet plans to destroy chemical 
weapons they referred a reporter to a ministry of foreign affairs 
official who asked for a letter requesting an interview on the 
subject 
baker after meeting in moscow with gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze was euphoric on announcing the 
makings of the deal may 19 
we have reached agreement on a precedentsetting accord 
baker told reporters we believe that this agreement is very 
significant particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a 
global ban on horrific weapons that we already know from bitter 
experience actually get used 
the soviet plan for the chapayevsk plant had been to destroy two 
chemicals also found in the us arsenal the nerve agents sarin and 
vx by mixing them with caustic agents and burning the residue 
according to soviet press reports 
the us army used similar means to destroy mustard agents in 
197475 but discarded the method because it left toxic waste the 
head of the american program gen walter l busbee said in an 
interview earlier this year 
the sites in the united states where the government will destroy 
its chemical weapons are in maryland kentucky alabama utah 
indiana oregon arkansas and utah the technology tested at 
johnston atoll to be used at other sites burns the chemicals at 
2700 degrees and filters the exhaust

one in five minority college students are the 
victims of racial attacks and former president reagans policies 
are at least partly to blame says a group that tracks such 
incidents 
reagan spokesman mark weinberg said however that cheap 
political fingerpointing wont bring a solution to the problem 
as many as 1 million college students are victims each year of 
attacks that range from verbal slurs to physical assaults officials 
of the national institute against prejudice and violence said 
thursday 
if we had an incidence of disease at 20 percent the surgeon 
general would have declared a public health crisis howard j 
ehrlich research director for the fiveyearold group said at a 
news conference 
representatives of the group said attacks on homosexual students 
appear to be even more frequent 
ehrlich said most college students came of political age 
during the reagan presidency when civil rights were being devalued 
in this society 
the report campus ethnoviolence and the policy options said 
minority students at predominantly white campuses suffer almost 
constant pressures because of their ethnic backgrounds 
for most students there are times when the classroom 
atmosphere can be stressful for the minority students stress and 
discomfort may be an everyday occurrence the report said 
ehrlich said figures show that between 800000 and 1 million 
students are victimized each year a quarter of those he said have 
been harassed on more than one occasion 
former democratic sen birch bayh of indiana chairman of the 
institutes board of directors said reagan did nothing during his 
eight years in the white house to set a proper tone for racial 
tolerance in the country 
there was absolutely no leadership during the reagan 
administration to show this nation how it could be better bayh 
said at the news conference the president is supposed to stand up 
and say we dont tolerate this in the united states of america 
bayh said what reagan did do on civil rights was negative 
such as the former presidents push to dismantle the us civil 
rights commission and his opposition to the extension of the voting 
rights act of 1964 
bayh said president bush already has taken positive steps to deal 
with the problem such as inviting various groups to the signing 
ceremony for the hate crimes reporting act but bushs term is too 
new to assess his record on civil rights bayh added 
while bush has spoken against racial insensitivity wed like 
to see more than words bayh said 
weinberg reached by telephone in los angeles discounted bayhs 
claims saying to ronald reagan there is no greater sin than 
prejudice 
belief in the quality of all men and women has been at the very 
core of his soul throughout his life those who think otherwise are 
ignorant weinberg said 
the spokesman said reagan is very troubled by incidents of 
racial bigotry on college campuses and elsewhere and believes the 
solution will be found not by cheap political fingerpointing but 
through dialogue and sincere efforts to increase understanding

soviets are being bombarded with pictures of 
adoring westerners greeting mikhail s gorbachev a painful reminder 
of the contrast between their presidents success abroad and his 
failure to improve life at home 
images of gorbachev and his stylishly dressed wife in the land of 
plenty are flooding newspapers and television screens back home in 
the land of empty shelves 
the trip contrasts his enormous popularity abroad where he wins 
praise for loosening up his society and helping end the cold war to 
his sagging popularity here 
soviets are disappointed that after five years of rule gorbachev 
hasnt improved their housing and food there is an impression crime 
and pollution are getting worse 
some soviet politicians are urging gorbachev to get his own house 
in order before cutting trade and arms deals with the west 
what happens depends not on negotiations in washington but what 
happens here legislator yuri boldyrev said in an interview 
thursday 
the gorbachevs have been all over soviet television live special 
broadcasts of his welcoming ceremony speech at the white house 
regular newscasts devoted entirely to his trip reports on his wife 
raisa visiting a museum in canada 
the president has been criticized for living the high life during 
previous visits abroad such as his trip to italy and malta last 
december to meet with pope john paul ii and president bush 
soviet tv correspondent alexander tikhomirov described his 
countrymens irritation when they saw gorbachev in the rome sun with 
snowwhite sultans in guards helmets 
imagine our people sitting before their television sets and 
drinking tea plain because they have run out of ration coupons for 
sugar again experiencing for a day all the unsettled state and 
poverty of our lives tikhomirov said in an interview published 
last week in the weekly magazine ogonyok 
the contrast could not be sharper the land of sleek cars and 
brightly clothed people and the harsh soviet reality of bare store 
shelves rationing of sugar and other items and impending major 
price hikes 
gorbachev left for the united states and canada a few days after 
the government announced a plan to try to improve the countrys 
economy by switching from a centrally controlled system to a partial 
market system described by soviet officials as a regulated 
market 
the plan has come under fire from shoppers and politicians alike 
for sharply raising food prices without introducing full market 
reforms people showed the government how they felt by buying out 
the stores before the price hike 
by going abroad gorbachev escapes some of the heat over the 
economic reform plan he also takes a breather from other domestic 
headaches that seem to defy his control the rise to power of his 
political nemesis boris n yeltsin who on tuesday was elected 
president of the russian republic the independence campaigns of the 
baltic republics and ethnic violence in armenia 
he can focus on one area in which he has firm control proven 
success and enjoys consensus among soviets foreign policy issues 
such as arms control the search for peace in regional conflicts 
and expansion of trade with the west 
seeing their leader with bush and canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney also reminds soviets that their country has earned a 
respected place in the community of nations thanks largely to 
gorbachev 
but it also risks giving his people another painful look at how 
far their country lags behind the west in the basics 
most soviets may never have the chance to sample the good life in 
the west because of restrictions on foreign travel and now they are 
seeing it on television 
conservatives have implied that gorbachev sometimes puts personal 
ambition above the needs of his country 
last december after his return from italy and a summit with bush 
on malta a conservative communist party official reportedly scolded 
gorbachev at a closeddoor central committee meeting is it a 
proper thing to go bowing to the capitalists to go asking for a 
blessing from the pope 
perhaps to make sure the conservatives dont try to make a power 
play during his absence gorbachev took what one western analyst 
called an unprecedented move and left behind in moscow his closest 
politburo ally alexander yakovlev 
the analyst dmitri simes said that despite the foreign policy 
emphasis at the summit gorbachevs domestic problems cannot be far 
from his mind 
even while in washington his thoughts are going to be in 
moscow said simes a scholar at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace 
reminders of his domestic woes were evident in ottawa where 
protesters outside the soviet embassy chanted stop killing 
armenians another group carried signs reading no tanks in 
lithuania 
hundreds of other protesters tried to press their messages on him 
in washington 
staterun tv has let soviets know gorbachev has been unable to 
escape his domestic woes on wednesday at least twice it broadcast 
for several minutes his response to reporters questions in ottawa 
about yeltsins election

defense secretary dick cheney is satisfied air 
force officials didnt try to mislead him when he wasnt told for 
months that a f117a stealth fighter missed its original target 
during the panama invasion his spokesman says 
the glitch in communications left the pentagon chief praising the 
futuristic aircrafts pinpoint accuracy in the wake of the 
panama invasion but ignorant of the planes exact movements 
cheney demanded an explanation from the air force following 
reports that one of the two planes that dropped 2000pound bombs in 
a raid had actually hit a hillside some distance from the intended 
target 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday that cheney has 
received a report on the matter from air force inspector general lt 
gen bradley hosmer 
after getting the results of bradleys investigation cheney is 
satisfied there was no intent to withhold information or mislead 
him williams said 
he finds the air force explanation credible and he considers 
the matter closed the spokesman added the air force is 
recommending changes to fix the problem 
cheney didnt receive a full report about the f117as 
performance during the dec 20 operation until april 3 
during operation just cause in panama the pilots of two 
f117as were told to each drop a 2000pound bomb no closer than 50 
meters away from two separate panamanian defense forces barracks 
buildings with the intent of stunning and disorienting the 
panamanian forces 
but due to a lastminute misunderstanding between the pilots one 
f117a pilot dropped his bomb near one of the barracks while the 
other dropped his bomb on a hillside several hundred yards away 
after this became known through news reports in april cheney 
told top air force officials he wanted an explanation for why he was 
not told one of the bombs hit a hillside 
the confusion was found to have taken place between those in the 
air forces chain of command charged with administration of the 
aircraft and those in the services upper chain of command williams 
said 
air force officials responsible for the administration of the 
aircraft reported that both jets had accomplished their mission 
which was to stun and disorient the panamanian troops 
even though the misunderstanding between the pilots resulted in 
one of the bombs hitting a hillside the bomb nevertheless hit where 
the pilot had aimed it therefore the officials in charge of the 
plane judged its mission was fulfilled because the panamanians were 
stunned by the loud noise created by the explosion williams said 
this was reported up the operational chain of command which left 
cheney and air force leaders with the impression that both planes 
hit the bullseye 
asked if he could say exactly where the breakdown of 
communication occurred williams said he was not privy to that 
information 
the air force asked to comment on williams remarks said no 
statement was immediately available

secretary jack kemp is encouraging reforms at 
the department of housing and urban development but losses and 
waste in housing programs continue because of longstanding 
management woes the agencys inspector general says 
inspector general paul a adams said thursday many of huds 
internal accounting and oversight systems remain troubled 15 months 
after a report by adams sparked exhaustive reviews of reaganera 
mismanagement and favoritism at hud 
kemp who inherited the mess has cooperated with hud auditors 
who have uncovered mismanagement and waste and he has pushed 
numerous reform ideas of his own adams said 
i find this refreshing adams report said 
but in his semiannual report to congress adams said the legacy 
of longstanding mismanagement is that virtually all of the 
departments major programs are plagued by questionable spending and 
are difficult to monitor because of poor internal accounting and 
management controls 
for example he said originations of hudbacked loans are still 
susceptible to fraud and mismanagement because of ineffective 
departmental policies and systems our audits and investigations 
indicate that individuals and companies across the nation continue 
to improperly originate loans for personal gain 
in the last six months adams said five lenders have been 
referred to a hud panel for sanctions because of improper loan 
activity 
major problems also remain in huds section 8 assistance program 
because of management problems he said 
hud does not have longrange plans for the section 8 program 
adams wrote as a result it can neither plan or budget 
effectively for its programs systems and procedures for future 
years 
some of the reforms enacted by kemp and congress are not taking 
hold because of slow and inefficient implementation at some hud 
field offices adams said 
he also recommended using hud staff instead of outside 
contractors for many of the evaluations and testing of hud 
management controls initiated by kemp 
adams asked congress to expand the staff of his office saying 
his staff spends much of its time working with us attorneys the 
fbi and other law enforcement agencies conducting investigations 
based on his offices audit and investigative work 
since an adams report on a hud rehabilitation program issued in 
april 1989 detailed poor management and political favoritism at the 
department hud has been the subject of intense media and 
congressional scrutiny a special prosecutor is investigating former 
hud secretary samuel r pierce jr and several former top pierce 
deputies 
as of march 31 adams said his office had 1751 investigative 
cases in the pipeline during the six months covered by the report 
october 1989 through march 1990 adams said his office referred 238 
cases to law enforcement authorities for possible prosecution

researchers have taken a step they think could 
help them better understand aids using a cloned virus to infect 
monkeys with an aidslike disease 
this is the first time a laboratorydeveloped virus has been used 
to cause an aidstype infection the researchers reported in a paper 
published today in the journal science 
the importance of this is that we can now make very precise 
changes in the virus and try and predict what will happen 
explained harry kestler of harvard universitys new england regional 
primate research center 
because all copies of a cloned virus are identical scientists 
can compare the results of an infection with the original virus with 
infections from a virus in which they have made specific changes 
and since the virus used in this experiment is a close relative 
of the one that causes aids in people the affect on the monkeys may 
help doctors better understand the human disease the researchers 
say 
teams at harvard and the university of california at davis used a 
cloned simian immunodeficiency virus the closest known relative of 
the human aids virus to infect the monkeys 
while the mixture of viruses found in infected animals has been 
used to induce the disease in the past this is the first time it 
has been done with a cloned version kestler explained 
in cloning a virus scientists make an exact copy of it this 
allows them to understand the exact characteristics of the virus 
they are working with and to make specific changes in the virus for 
experiments kestler said 
many of the monkeys infected with the cloned virus developed a 
fastacting form of aids according to the report 
the fastacting disease occurs in monkeys that fail to develop an 
antibody response to the infection and these die in about six 
months kestler explained 
other monkeys do develop an antibody response and seem to live 
longer he said the researchers assume that those animals will 
eventually develop a more lingering form of aids kestler said but 
they must wait to see what happens 
this is sort of a progress report on an ongoing study that is 
going to take a couple of years to complete he observed 
the monkeys that become ill develop all the hallmarks of 
aids said kestler such as weight loss and a variety of 
opportunistic infections when their immune system weakens 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the incurable condition is believed to be caused by an unusual 
virus now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which is 
spread through contact with blood or semen from infected people 
the chief victims of aids have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers 
some people have become infected through blood transfusions 
although blood supplies are more closely screened now health 
officials estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 
percent of cases and that between 1 million and 15 million 
americans have been exposed to the virus 
as of april 30 1990 aids had been diagnosed in 132510 
americans of whom 61 percent or 80799 have died since june 1 
1981 according to the federal centers for disease control no one 
is known to have recovered from aids 
the world health organization said that as of april 30 1990 
there have been 254078 cases reported from 151 countries the 
global programme on aids an agency of the world health 
organization estimates that the actual number of aids cases in the 
world is more than 500000 and that there will be at least 1 million 
new cases worldwide by 1993

here are quotations from the summit meeting 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
id just say at the end of a very interesting day that the 
talks have gone reasonably well 
over the next four days were not going to solve all the 
worlds problems but we can and will take significant steps 
toward a new relationship 
the agreements weve reached cannot cause us to lose sight of 
some of the differences that remain lithuania is one such issue 
the success of this summit depends not on the agreements we 
will sign but on our efforts to lay the groundwork for overcoming 
decades of division and discord to build a world of peace in 
freedom 
whatever deep differences divided us in the past the 
united states and the american people approach every issue with a 
sincere belief that our two nations can find common ground indeed 
because of our unique positions in the world we must find common 
ground

it is not here that the german question will be resolved 
i cannot say yet how we are going to conclude this meeting 
what the results will be that would be premature but based on 
the talks thursday he said it was possible to expect major 
results from this meeting 
the walls which for years separated the peoples are 
collapsing 
the trenches of the cold war are disappearing the fog of 
prejudice mistrust and animosity is vanishing this generation 
of people on earth may witness the advent of an irreversible period 
of peace in the history of civilization

intricacies of a market but we are innocent so to say as far 
as a market is concerned we have to start from scratch

archibald roosevelt jr a grandson of 
president theodore roosevelt and a retired cia officer died 
thursday of congestive heart failure at his home he was 72 
roosevelt served as cia station chief in istanbul madrid and 
london before retiring from the agency in 1974 he then became vice 
president of the chase manhattan bank based in washington 
he was active in diplomatic circles during the reagan 
administration when his wife selwa showker roosevelt was chief of 
protocol at the state department 
roosevelt was born to high social position in boston graduating 
from harvard college in 1940 in the same class as president kennedy 
he won a rhodes scholarship to oxford university but he was unable 
to take it because of world war ii 
an army intelligence officer in the war he joined the central 
intelligence group the immediate predecessor of the cia in 1947 
and served for 27 years always under diplomatic cover 
some have written that he had a hand in various coups of the 
early 1950s notably the overthrows of king farouk in egypt and 
nationalist iranian prime minister mohammed mossadegh 
but roosevelt was the soul of discretion in his 1988 memoirs 
for lust of knowing memoirs of an intelligence officer 
in it he did not even list his duty stations but he did tip 
off an interviewer to check his whos who entry to figure them out 
roosevelt confessed a fascination with the middle east and 
languages learning about 20 including uzbek 
the intelligence officer must not only know whose side he is 
on but have a deep conviction that he is on the right side he 
should not imitate the cynical protagonists of john lecarres 
novels essentially craftsmen who find their side no less amoral 
than the other roosevelt once wrote 
besides his wife he is survived by a son by a first marriage 
that ended in divorce and two grandchildren

a federal appeals court issued a stay 
late thursday just 90 minutes before the scheduled execution of a 
condemned killer who had wanted no further appeals 
thomas baal 26 had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal 
injection at 1205 am pdt friday for stabbing a bus driver to 
death in las vegas 
the 9th circuit court of appeals panel ruled 21 that the 
execution should be stayed until noon saturday to get more 
information from us district judge howard mckibben who earlier 
ruled against a stay justice alex kozinski dissented 
baals parents had petitioned mckibben for the stay citing their 
sons longterm mental problems and possible brain damage as his 
parents listened baal told the court i just want to go die and 
be free thats all 
justice harry pregerson questioned whether baals competency 
hearing had properly focused on whether he could make a rational 
decision to give up his appeal rights if he was suffering from a 
brain disorder disease or defect 
were doing everything here on the run said pregerson 
baal had told mckibben he didnt want anybody to appeal on his 
behalf including his parents edwin and doris baal traveled from 
mesa colo to see their son before his execution 
asked if he had any other requests baal said bring me a 
hooker the judge said he couldnt grant that and asked if he had 
any others baal replied just my last meal and get the ball 
rolling man 
mckibben ruled that on the basis of baals comments its clear 
he does not want to stop the execution the court finds that he is 
competent to make that decision 
the hearing was held to review an 11thhour petition filed by 
assistant us defender pat flanagan on behalf of baals parents 
flanagan sought to intervene on whats known as a next friend 
basis a tactic often rejected by courts but the us supreme 
court in an april 24 decision rejecting an arkansas death row 
inmates next friend status for another condemned convict in 
that state spelled out conditions that could allow such petitions 
they include mental incapacity or other disability that prevents 
a condemned person from pursuing an appeal 
baal a former mental patient smashed a television set in his 
cell tuesday he was described as quiet thursday 
prison spokesman glen wharton said baal was spending much of his 
time making phone calls 
baal was sentenced to die for stabbing bus driver frances maves 
to death in 1988 as she resisted his robbery attempt 
his execution would be nevadas fifth and the 129th nationally 
since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume 
use of the death penalty 
nevadas last executions were in june 1989 in the same week 
confessed murderers sean flanagan and william bud thompson were 
given lethal injections after both said they wanted no further 
appeals

the 1990 atlantic hurricane season 
begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the east and 
gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new 
era of destructive storms 
the hurricane season runs until nov 30 and was ushered in by a 
tropical depression last week in the caribbean that brought heavy 
rain to cuba and south florida but did not intensify into a 
hurricane 
many coastal communities with swelling populations are 
illprepared to handle a hurricane emergency said robert sheets 
director of the national hurricane center 
a recent national oceanic and atmospheric administration report 
predicts the number of people in seaside counties from maine to 
texas will grow 60 percent counting from 1960 until 2010 some 
states such as florida and texas will experience near 200 percent 
growth during the period the report said 
what were looking at is the possibility of greater destruction 
and greater loss of life sheets said thursday we cant stop 
the hurricanes the only thing we can do is work on better 
preparedness and emergency planning 
the aftermath from hurricane gilbert in 1988 and hugo last year 
taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and 
protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from maine to 
texas sheets said 
if the longterm trends are any indication of whats to come 
we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes said sheets 
gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage from 
the lesser antilles to mexico hugo killed 28 people in the eastern 
caribbean and 29 more in south carolina and caused a record 10 
billion in damage 
sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are 
based on studies of past decades atmospheric lowpressure waves and 
increased rainfall trends in west africa near the breeding waters 
for most hurricanes 
hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditions 
began in the early 1960s in africas sahel region he said 
between 1940 and 1969 the united states was hit by 22 hurricanes 
with minimum winds of 110 mph from 1970 to 1989 there were only 
eight such storms including hugo sheets said 
i hope we dont catch up this year with the decade of the 
40s he said 
there are five categories of hurricanes ranging from category 1 
which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph to category 5 
with top winds greater then 155 mph 
both gilbert and hugo reached category 5 according to 
meteorologist barry fatchwell of the national hurricane center 
sheets praised most south carolina officials response to hugo 
but said some leaders didnt have their proverbial act together 
and lives may have been saved 
also he said hugo showed inadequacies in the emergency broadcast 
system and some communities used emergency shelters illsuited to 
withstand a powerful hurricane 
in the caribbean officials have worked to improve communications 
systems after links were cut by gilbert

the united states has a flotilla of warships 
off the coast of liberia in case it needs to use military force to 
evacuate thousands of americans who might become trapped by an armed 
rebellion there 
the six warships carrying more than 2000 marines were ordered to 
remain on station in international waters off the liberian coast 
the pentagon said thursday 
the number of americans in liberia has been declining several 
weeks ago the state department said 10000 people including 
american citizens and others holding claim to us protection were 
in the country that figure later was pared back to around 6000 
and the department now estimates because some have left already 
that 1100 people could be eligible for evacuation 
more than 1000 people have been killed in a rebellion against 
the rule of liberian president samuel doe during the last five 
months 
the state department on thursday advised all us citizens to 
leave the african country immediately 
the us flotilla includes a destroyer an amphibious assault 
ship a tank landing ship and other support vessels carrying 
ammunition and combat supplies said cmdr david thomas a spokesman 
for the defense department 
also aboard are 179 marine officers and 2102 enlisted men 
thomas said 
rebel troops moved to within 25 miles of the liberian capital 
monrovia on thursday and there was concern that fighting in the 
city could raise the death toll dramatically 
the state department in a travel advisory warned that 
conditions in the country were deteriorating 
all nonessential us personnel and all dependents were ordered 
to depart americans in the country needing assistance were advised 
to contact the us embassy in monrovia 
the us ships are under orders to be prepared to evacuate 
american citizens in the event that they would no longer be able to 
leave the country by commercial means thomas said 
the probability of using military force to evacuate americans is 
low and the ships are being stationed off the liberian coast as a 
precaution thomas said 
the ships in the us force are the uss sipan an amphibious 
assault ship the uss ponce an amphibious transport dock ship the 
uss sumter a tank landing ship the uss concord a combat stores 
ship the uss suribachi an ammunition ship and the uss peterson a

agreement the statement said others besides jones were parties to 
the case but the statement did not mention them and the naacp 
office did not answer a telephone call seeking clarification

regional telephone giant nynex corp has been 
indicted for allegedly violating the 1982 court order that broke up 
the old bell system 
the new york citybased telephone giant was indicted thursday on 
one count of criminal contempt of court for allegedly providing 
information services to customers in violation of the 1982 consent 
decree 
nynex denied any wrongdoing 
the indictment is likely to provide ammunition to those opposing 
efforts in congress to lift some of the restrictions the 1982 decree 
imposed on the regional bell companies 
the landmark 1982 ruling by us district judge harold h greene 
prohibited the seven regional bell holding companies from engaging 
in certain types of business including processing computerized data 
the indictment obtained by the justice departments antitrust 
division accused nynex through its nashville tenn subsidiary 
telco research corp of providing data processing and information 
retrieval services over telephone lines from april 1986 to february 
1987 
the indictment did not cite possible penalties 
telco provided a computer and software to the longdistance 
company mci communications corp to help make mcis network more 
efficient nynex spokesman bob obrien said he said justice alleged 
that nynex did not provide enough of the computer to mci 
justice said nynex violated terms of the 1982 consent decree 
known as the modification of final judgment that prohibit nynex and 
the other regional bell companies from providing information 
services 
the consent decree was set up to divide different types of 
communication services between american telephone amp telegraph co 
and the spinoff companies 
our position is that there was no violation of the mfj

thousands of california highways and 
bridges probably wouldnt withstand a major earthquake because of 
outdated engineering standards according to a longawaited state 
report 
the report thursday by the governorappointed board of inquiry 
also concluded that officials should have known portions of the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge and interstate 880 would collapse in 
the oct 17 loma prieta earthquake they didnt because the state 
couldnt pay for an updated engineering study due to budget 
constraints the panel said 
more aggressive efforts are needed if the disastrous potential 
of future earthquakes is to be minimized and the public safety 
adequately protected said board chairman george housner a 
professor of engineering emeritus for the california institute of 
technology 
engineering standards used to build i880 and the bay bridge in 
the 1930s and 1950s and other structures were adequate for 
engineering knowledge at that time but seismic standards were very 
low compared to those in use today the report said 
the oct 17 earthquake measured 71 on the richter scale caused 
an estimated 7 billion in damages and killed 67 people including 
42 in the freeway collapse 
crews took one month to repair a 50foot stretch of the upper 
deck of the bay bridge that crashed to the lower deck the cypress 
viaduct remains closed 
the panel said the doubledeck cypress structure collapsed 
because it was built on soft soil and its upright support columns 
and connecting joints werent strong enough to hold up the upper 
deck the shaking literally pulled the structure apart the report 
said 
gov george deukmejian who attended the oakland meeting where 
the 272page report was released said the report will help because 
it tells state officials what we should do and how to go about 
it 
deukmejian said he hoped voters tuesday would approve proposition 
111 which would increase the gasoline tax by 9 cents some of the 
extra funds should be used to retrofit the states highways and 
bridges in line with report recommendations he said 
the loma prieta earthquake should be considered a clear and 
powerful warning to the people of california housner said we 
have made progress during the last two decades in reducing 
earthquake risks but much more could have been done and awaits 
doing

when genevieve mclaughlin told her boss at 
independence blue cross she wanted to skip the traditional 
retirement lunch so the money could be spent on charity she got a 
typical corporate response 
the company set up a committee 
blue cross usually throws a retirement lunch at a fancy hotel for 
employees of a decade or more complete with flowers photographs 
and a 100 gift certificate the guest of honor can invite up to 35 
coworkers and a handful of managers attend 
the nonprofit health insurance company with about 2 million 
subscribers in the philadelphia area picks up the 1200 tab up to 
20 times a year but mrs mclaughlin 64 wasnt interested in 
sitting through a bunch of speeches by executives she hardly knows 
you ride the elevator with these people and they dont have the 
faintest idea who you are she said 
mrs mclaughlin suggested to her boss that instead of spending 
the money on a lunch she didnt want the company split it between 
her favorite charities st johns hospice and her grandsons 
little league team 
they gave me a memo saying theyd set up a committee to 
consider whether or not the rules could be changed she said 
mrs mclaughlins retirement as a medicaid claims adjuster 
officially starts today after nearly 19 years with the company she 
doesnt know when the committee decision will be announced 
meanwhile blue cross gave her a choice have the lunch or wait 
for the committee decision 
they said it might be five years from now and who knows if im 
even going to be around tomorrow mrs mclaughlin said but i 
dont care i want that money to go to that hospice and that little 
league team 
after all its not like im saying just give me the money so 
i can go down to the shore 
blue cross spokesman dick mendenhall said the decision has been 
put on hold he didnt know of any other employees who made similar 
requests 
mrs mclaughlin said she sympathizes with the company in one 
respect 
i understand part of their problem theyre worried that some 
day some one retiring will want to donate the money to the ku klux 
klan or a group like that she said well why dont they just 
specify that you cant donate the money to something destructive 
bob cantlin a company vice president bristled at the suggestion 
blue cross could be a little quicker about making a decision 
i think quite frankly some companies would just say this is 
the policy and we wont consider changing he said 
mrs mclaughlin said she feels bad about the controversy but she 
isnt backing down 
if a big outfit like blue cross would change their policy like 
this maybe other companies would follow suit and thered be a 
little less hunger in the world she said

the interior department may advocate 
the captive breeding of spotted owls to save the threatened species 
while allowing the cutting of oldgrowth forests where the owls 
live an official said 
president bush has told the interior secretary that weve got 
to save the owl and weve got to save jobs said jim hughes 
deputy assistant interior secretary for lands and minerals our 
mission is to make them compatible 
hughes who accompanied interior secretary manuel lujan on a 
visit to idaho that ended thursday said the department was not 
committed to the captivebreeding idea 
its something were looking at he said 
bill burnham director of the peregrine fund and the world center 
for birds of prey which lujan visited wednesday said he would be 
glad to cooperate in an experiment to see if spotted owls will breed 
in captivity 
typically owls are easier to breed than falcons burnham 
said 
but he was careful to note that the issue of logging uncut 
forests is likely to remain even if captive breeding could save owls 
the peregrine fund is interested in the conservation of the owl 
as a way to preserve the species he said whether to cut or not 
cut the oldgrowth forests is another issue 
the us fish and wildlife service is expected to decide in late 
june whether to list the spotted owl as an endangered species if it 
is listed the timber industry says hundreds of loggers millworkers 
and others could lose their jobs because timber cuts would be 
sharply curtailed 
an estimated 3000 to 5000 spotted owls remain in the oldgrowth 
forests of the pacific northwest 
burnham said he expects both environmentalists and timber workers 
to be skeptical of captive breeding 
the problem with the owl is not the owl he said the main 
issue is overcutting of oldgrowth forests the environmental 
community is probably not interested in the captive breeding of owls 
because then they lose their argument for saving the forests 
and the timber industry wont be interested either because 
then that would mean theyre admitting that logging has hurt the 
owls 
joe hinson executive director of the coeur dalenebased 
intermountain forest industries association agreed with burnhams 
assessment 
the environmental groups have made it clear the owl is just a 
surrogate to the eliminating of harvest of oldgrowth stands of 
timber in the pacific northwest he said

said lab results should indicate in a few days whether cancer had 
spread to other parts of his body moodys weight dropped to 130 
pounds following surgery she said

an anonymous letter from a person claiming 
to be the lords avenger has complicated the investigation of 
two pipe bomb explosions that damaged a lumber mill and injured two 
environmentalists 
the letter writer claimed to have set both pipe bombs 
it could be serious it could be a prank fbi special agent 
barry mawn told a news conference thursday anybody could have sent 
the letter mawn said but the writer had a very good knowledge of 
explosives 
the new evidence has unsettled earth first the antilogging 
group that says members darryl cherney and judi bari were the 
targets of one of the bombs police allege they were carrying the 
device in their car when it blew up on them may 24 in oakland 
sure maybe theres a religious wacko out there whos 
interested in killing environmental activists earth first 
cofounder mike rosells said thursday but its also possible this 
is a smoke screen for an organized conspiracy to murder 
environmental activists 
the fbi was concentrating on trying to find out if the explosion 
that injured bari and cherney was linked to a blast that caused 
minor damage at the louisianapacific mill in cloverdale on may 9 
the oakland police department said it would continue to 
concentrate its investigation on trying to prove cherney 33 of 
piercy and bari 40 of redwood were transporting the pipe bomb 
when it went off inside baris car 
theyre still the two prime suspects oakland police sgt 
robert chenault said thursday 
alameda county prosecutors however on tuesday postponed filing 
charges against the pair saying they want to review the evidence 
the two have strongly denied they were carrying the bomb saying 
they were the victims of an attack possibly by someone who had been 
sending the earth first activists death threats before planned 
summerlong antilogging demonstrations called redwood summer 
cherney was released this week on 100000 bail after oakland 
police arrested him for investigation of transporting explosives and 
carrying a boobytrap bari remains hospitalized under police guard 
recovering from a broken pelvis and other injuries she also is 
being held on 100000 bail 
the letter writer warned he should be taken seriously 
doubt me not for i will tell you the design and materials such 
as only i will know he wrote in an excerpt released thursday by 
the press democrat of santa rosa which received the letter 
the author claims to have been driven by religious zeal and anger 
at baris opposition to antiabortion protesters and to timber 
cutting 
the letter included specific details about the construction and 
placement of the bomb that injured cherney and bari and had accurate 
and neverdisclosed information about the cloverdale bomb according 
to larry sheets a bomb expert with the sonoma county sheriffs 
department 
mawn said remnants of both pipe bombs would be sent to the fbi 
laboratory in washington dc by friday for detailed analysis 
the analysis could take weeks or months the fbi doesnt 
anticipate making arrests in the case until after the analysis is 
completed mawn said

laws in 44 states prohibit sales of cigarettes to 
children but they bought about 1 billion packs last year and 
federal health inspectors know of citations against only 32 vendors 
very few states have laws that are effective in preventing 
access to tobacco by minors health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan said thursday effective enforcement is the key to 
successful efforts 
a week ago sullivan called for bans on cigarette machines 
licensing of tobacco retailers and a minimum age of 19 for tobacco 
purchases 
an estimated 1 billion packs of cigarettes are sold to children 
in this country each year said a report in the journal of the 
american medical association earlier this year 
the national centers for disease control noted in its weekly 
report thursday that 44 states and the district of columbia have 
laws restricting minors access to tobacco thirtysix states 
require cigarette buyers to be 18 three states set the age at 19 
four set it at 17 and one state and the district of columbia set it 
at 16 
kentucky louisiana missouri montana new mexico and wyoming 
have no minimum age for sale of cigarettes kentucky will restrict 
sales to minors under 16 beginning july 13 
only five states alaska connecticut florida new york and 
vermont could provide sullivans inspector general with data on 
citations for tobacco sales to minors said the cdcs office on 
smoking and health and only three states reported any sales 
violations at all in 1989 florida with 16 alaska with eight and 
new york with eight 
its clear these laws are not enforced said dr tom novotny 
of the office on smoking and health 
studies have indicated that 3 percent to 16 percent of underage 
smokers get their cigarettes out of machines novotny said while 
the majority of sales to kids occur over the counter 
just six states alaska idaho indiana maine minnesota and 
utah prohibit cigarette machines in areas accessible to children 
or ban such machines altogether the cdc said 
novotny said dual strategies are needed to keep cigarettes out of 
childrens hands awareness by vendors and others in the community 
and commitment from law enforcement officials to enforce cigarette 
laws 
sullivan has proposed model legislation for states to control 
tobacco sales to minors such laws would be a potentially 
effective public health strategy to prevent tobacco use by 
teenagers said the atlantabased cdc an agency of hhs 
but sullivans proposal has been criticized as too weak by the 
coalition on smoking or health and by us sen edward kennedy 
dmass sponsor of a 110 millionayear antismoking measure

a senior minister says talks between 
the government and tamil rebels have been progressing and there have 
been few incidents of violence in areas where rebel attacks were 
once common 
the halt in killings in the north and east is a major 
breakthrough deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said 
thursday 
he said some fighters with the tamil tigers also known as the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam have carried out several raids 
but rebel leaders appeared to support talks with the government 
the tiger rebels have been fighting the sri lankan government and 
also fought an indian peacekeeping force the rebels have accused 
the islands sinhalese majority which controls the government and 
the military of discrimination but accepted negotiations in june 
1989 india withdrew its troops in march 1990 
tamils who are mostly hindu make up 18 percent of the islands 
16 million people 
talks have been held regularly in colombo the islands capital 
and in jaffna the northern stronghold of the tigers since last 
june 
government communiques and independent reports have claimed that 
since the truce began tiger rebels have abducted and assaulted 
policemen and soldiers shot wild elephants and illegally felled 
timber 
the governments view despite these provocative acts is that 
the talks are moving satisfactorily wijeratne said we do not 
want another war in which we will kill our own people 
he said the tiger hierarchy has repeatedly expressed confidence 
in president ranasinghe premadasa 
since the tigers took up arms in 1983 more than 16000 people 
have died in the fighting

mats thursday in the streets of rioja and moyobamba the two largest 
towns in the affected area about 400 miles north of lima 
the quake destroyed between 30 and 40 percent of the buildings in 
the area the civil defense office in lima said 
civil defense officials in the earthquake zone said at least 137 
people died in tuesdays earthquake which measured 63 on the 
richter scale

killed the differing figures could not immediately be reconciled 
perus geophysical institute in lima said at least 70 aftershocks 
had struck since tuesday night including one thursday morning that 
registered 46 on the richter scale 
all the tremors were centered around moyobamba a farming 
community of 50000 that produces corn rice coffee and sugar cane

the threat of rush hour traffic over the 
golden gate bridge apparently proved too much for organizers of 
mikhail gorbachevs san francisco tour 
tentative plans were scrapped thursday for a gorbachev motorcade 
over the landmark span to marin county 
the soviet leader and his wife raisa will instead view the 
bridge from a parking lot on the san francisco side robert

the gorbachevs a tour monday of gardens near the bridges toll plaza 
we want to show them the most beautiful part of the bridge and 
show them the view that millions of visitors have admired he said 
stockwell also is to present the gorbachevs with several bridge 
mementos including a section of the original suspension cable a 
copy of chief engineer joseph strausss original report on how and 
why the bridge was built and a pair of sweat shirts

a federal judge permanently banned racial 
discrimination in the citys public schools in his final order in a 
16yearold desegregation case 
the order thursday from us district judge w arthur garrity jr 
barred creating promoting or maintaining racial segregation in 
any school or other facility in the boston school system 
in a 1974 ruling on a lawsuit brought by black parents garrity 
found the citys public schools were segregated he ordered them 
desegregated and the resultant busing of students touched off years 
of turmoil 
garrity monitored the citys compliance with his order until 
1987 when a federal appeals court ruled that the schools were 
desegregated and gave control over student assignment back to the 
school committee 
garrity continued to monitor school administration and 
operations however he said thursdays order would be his last 
perhaps the most controversial part of the fourpage ruling was a 
decree that teacher layoffs must follow courtordered racial 
guidelines rather than be based on seniority alone 
that order which means teachers and administrators must include 
25 percent blacks and 10 percent other minorities is to remain 
until seniority would be a racially neutral standard he said 
achieving a fully desegregated faculty and staff will be an 
important milestone on the long road to affording equal educational 
opportunity to all students in bostons public schools garrity 
wrote 
more than 200 teachers are expected to be laid off nearly 800 
have received layoff warnings before the next school year because 
of budget limitations 
the boston teachers unions contract calls for layoffs strictly 
on the basis of seniority union president edward doherty has said 
the union would appeal any ruling that continued minority quotas 
which he said would mean many white teachers with 20 or more years 
of experience would lose their jobs 
but lawyers on both sides of the desegregation case praised 
garritys final judgment 
the order is consistent with affirmative action policies the 
school committee has in place and clarifies some issues that need 
clarification concerning layoffs said henry dinger a lawyer for 
the school committee 
robert pressman a lawyer for black plaintiffs said the ruling 
shows that garrity studied the papers carefully and manifests his 
continuing steadfastness in protecting the rights of the plaintiff 
class

president bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev headed today toward a new round of summit talks shadowed 
by disputes over germany and lithuania but assured of yielding 
agreement on longsought curbs on strategic nuclear weapons and 
poison gas 
before he met with bush at the white house gorbachev summoned 
leading members of congress to the soviet embassy for an exchange 
that was expected to focus on trade arms control and gorbachevs 
economic squeeze on the breakaway baltic republic of lithuania 
bush and gorbachev were upbeat after their initial talks 
wednesday even though they concluded they would be unable to 
resolve the issue of german unification before gorbachev leaves 
sunday they left the german question for their foreign affairs 
experts to tackle later 
however both us and soviet officials today saw encouraging 
signs in the summit exchanges over a united germany and its future 
military role 
now we are moving closer to each other said soviet foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov interviewed on abctvs good 
morning america 
although the german issue wont be settled at the summit 
gerasimov said we understand better the arguments and that is 
a very good sign for the summit 
both gerasimov and chief us arms negotiator richard burt 
interviewed on the same program said european security arrangements 
must be overhauled as a result of dramatic changes in eastwest 
relations 
burt said the united states is taking a new look at security 
and institutions in europe including a concept of remodeling nato 
for a new era he said it was important for the soviets to 
understand that us moves are not designed to undermine soviet 
security 
gorbachev displayed his trademark spontaneity wednesday when he 
halted his limousine one block east of the white house during a 
brief evening ride to the soviet embassy wading into a crowd of 
pedestrians on the sidewalk he exulted i feel really at home 
here 
bush offered a light moment at the end of the day toasting 
gorbachev at a glittering white house state dinner maine lobster 
was on the menu he said expectations were at a fever pitch for the 
events of day two when barbara and raisa go to wellesley 
college he deadpanned the first ladies were traveling there for 
commencement ceremonies 
the white house said the two men would sign a treaty late today 
ending production of chemical weapons and sharply trimming poison 
gas stockpiles 
an agreement also was ready for their signatures outlining 
agreement on major points of a treaty to scale back longrange 
nuclear weapons accompanying it was a pledge to pursue deeper 
reductions after the first treaty is completed 
the treaty nearly a decade in negotiations will eventually 
reduce stockpiles of long range nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines by 30 to 35 percent from the us viewpoint the key 
provision will halve the number of soviet ss18 missiles capable of 
reaching the united states 
the pact on chemical weapons would halt production of poison gas 
and reduce each countrys stockpiles to 5000 tons the united 
states currently has about 25000 tons and the soviet union twice 
that amount 
bush called the pacts proof that differences can be resolved 
even while others remain 
one of the major differences centered on lithuania where 
gorbachev has applied economic pressure to quell an independence 
drive 
bush prodded gorbachev on the subject in his welcoming remarks 
outside the white house and said lithuania and the related topic of 
expanded trade relations might come up in summit talks 
at the state department other agreements were ready for signing 
by secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze covering air travel oceanography and maritime 
issues 
and despite the continuing impasse over germany the two sides 
were reportedly making some progress in arms control talks 
continuing at the state department and laying plans for future 
negotiations 
gorbachev told reporters that while the issue of german 
unification would not be resolved at the summit baker and 
shevardnadze would discuss the issue next week at an international 
conference in copenhagen and again in late june in berlin as hopes 
for a german accord faded so did chances for agreement on a 
reduction in troops and conventional arms in europe 
even so soviet spokesman arkady maslennikov said he looked for 
two more gorbachevbush meetings this year one to ratify agreements 
on a new europe and the second late in 1990 to sign the nuclear arms 
control treaty 
bush and gorbachev said their wideranging discussions on 
wednesday included detailed discussions of germany gorbachev and 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said new ideas had been 
exchanged but another us official said that wasnt the case 
the bottom line is both presidents restated their wellknown 
positions the official said 
the partial economic blockade the soviets have imposed on 
lithuania has deterred bush from approving a new trade agreement 
with moscow details of which were completed last week bush also 
has ruled out a trade pact until the soviets enact liberal 
emigration legislation

the government has declared a 30day state of 
emergency in the capital and nearby port of callao in advance of the 
june 10 presidential runoff election 
the runoff pits novelist mario vargas llosa against alberto 
fujimori an agricultural engineer whose parents emigrated from 
japan 
a similar state of emergency which gives the military broad 
powers to fight leftist guerrillas was in effect during the first 
round balloting on april 8 
the decree announced thursday places the two cities under 
military control and allows authorities to restrict freedom of 
movement detain people without filing charges and search residences 
without warrants 
in lima the capita and home to a third of perus 22 million 
people the state of emergency will be administered by the national 
police 
a state of emergency remains in effect for eight departments and 
one province where government troops are battling maoist shining 
path guerrillas the areas are located in perus central and 
southern highlands and northern jungle region 
in the southern highlands police said on thursday that shining 
path guerrillas killed eight people in three towns near the city of 
huancavelica 145 miles southeast of lima 
a column of 15 rebels entered the town of pueblo libre on 
wednesday night and abducted three former village officials from 
their homes police said the officials were later shot to death in 
a field near the town 
at the same time another guerrilla band shot to death the town 
manager and two other officials in the village of tansire police 
said 
in another wednesday night raid the rebels fatally stabbed two 
peasants near the town of condorsurco and stole 20 head of cattle 
police said 
the government says that more than 18500 people have died in 
violence since the shining path guerrillas launched their insurgency 
in 1980 
the government first imposed a state of emergency in december 
1982 in ayacucho birthplace of the rebel movement 
since then the measure has been steadily extended to other areas 
as the rebel violence has expanded

aids experts were hopeful that a new 
experimental drug will slow the progress of the deadly disease and 
prove less toxic and cheaper than the antiviral drugs azt and ddi 
the us food and drug administration has made hoffmanla roches 
drug ddc available to aids patients in a compassionate use 
program designed to test the safety of the drug the 
pharmaceutical company and the fda announced thursday 
the most exciting thing about ddc is that it is looking more 
and more to be the drug that ddi was supposed to be said dr jay 
lalezari codirector to the hiv clinical research center at mount 
zion hospital in san francisco 
we dont know the efficacy but it looks like it is 
welltolerated he said 
new yorkbased bristol myers has been distributing the 
experimental drug ddi free in a similar compassionate use program to 
about 8000 patients who are not responding to azt treatment or 
cannot tolerate azt 
the side effects of ddi include nausea diarrhea and depression 
but ddc which stands for dideoxycytidine has shown few side 
effects lalezari said 
azt is the only aids drug approved by the fda ddc because it is 
still classified as experimental is available only in clinical 
trials the compassionate use program announced thursday expands 
those trials 
though it does not cure aids azt prolongs the lives of some 
people infected by the virus others have stopped taking the drug 
because of side effects such as anemia and depletion of bone marrow 
there are two ongoing clinical trials in which researchers are 
comparing the effectiveness of ddc and azt patients do not know 
which of the two drugs they are receiving 
hoffmanla roche will begin a study june 25 with 50 patients who 
cannot tolerate ddi or azt the study will assess the toxicity and 
effectiveness of ddc 
if little toxicity is found the program will be expanded to 200 
patients after four weeks and opened to unlimited enrollment after 
four months 
this approach is a compromise in a bitter controversy between 
some people with aids and researchers who fear participants in 
clinical trials will drop out if the drugs are available elsewhere 
aids activists have staged street protests to demand that all 
promising drugs be made available to any desperately ill patients 
willing to risk untested remedies 
jim eigo a member of the aids research advisory council said 
the combination of ddc and azt seems to be more effective than 
either drug alone 
in addition the combination is less harmful because their 
toxicities do not overlap eigo said 
ddcs low manufacturing cost could make the drug much less 
expensive than azt which can cost up to 8000 for a years 
treatment said john james of the aids treatment newsletter 
james said it costs about five cents to make a days dose of ddc 
the final price of the drug if approved would be much higher 
however because it would include the costs of clinical trials 
research and development marketing and a profit 
its simply too early to know what the price would be said

eritrean rebels claim they killed 7000 
government troops in the latest battle in their offensive to capture 
asmara the besieged capital of ethiopias northernmost province 
also today the official ethiopian news agency reported that a 
military court had sentenced 18 army officers stationed in eritrea 
to prison terms ranging from two to seven years for their 
involvement in a failed may 1989 coup attempt aimed at overthrowing 
president mengistu haile mariam 
the news agency said the military court ordered the release of 
three other officers linked to the coup attempt because they had 
served sufficient terms in pretrial custody 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said in a clandestine 
broadcast thursday that its fighters had also wounded about 4000 
government troops and captured 1100 in winning their second victory 
in a week of heavy fighting southeast of asmara 
the broadcast monitored in nairobi said the fighting was on the 
segeneyti front 30 miles from asmara the offensive is continuing 
to push forward with vigor the rebel broadcast said 
on tuesday the eritreans said they had completely routed 
government troops during another battle on the same front 
it was not possible to verify independently the rebel claims but 
a broadcast on statecontrolled radio in the ethiopian capital 
addis ababa implied there were heavy casualties on the government 
side 
the joint offensive by the eplf and the weyane tigreans on 
the segeneyti front is being repulsed by our revolutionary army with 
great martyrdom the government broadcast said thursday 
the tigre peoples liberation front another smaller rebel group 
is fighting a 15yearold insurgency to oust the nations president 
and establish a hardline marxist government 
the tigreans control their home province of tigre eritreas 
southern neighbor the eritreans and tigreans often coordinate their 
offensives 
the ethiopian news agency said the officers sentenced to prison 
for the coup attempt ranged in rank from lieutenant to colonel 
although troops loyal to president mengistu quickly crushed the 
rebellion in addis ababa may 16 1989 the mutineers in eritrea held 
out for three days 
the officers sentences were considered light compared to the 
death penalties imposed on 12 generals including the commander of 
all ground forces and the air force chief of staff who were 
convicted of treason for their role in the coup attempt 
the executions announced may 21 have led to nearly two weeks of 
sporadic student demonstrations at the university of addis ababa 
the trial of another 35 senior officers is continuing while an 
additional 130 officers are yet to be tried 
the eritreans are fighting a 29yearold war for the independence 
of eritrea a former italian colony annexed by ethiopia in 1962 
they launched their current offensive feb 8 and captured the red 
sea port of massawa three days later cutting off all but air access 
to asmara

a teenage boy was installed today as 
kashmirs top moslem clergyman to succeed his assassinated father 
and kashmiris used the occasion to renew a call for independence 
amid recitals of koranic verses 16yearold umar farooq took his 
place as the mirwaiz maulvi or chief preacher of kashmir during a 
special service in the jama masjid kashmirs largest mosque 
about 100000 moslems thronged the mosque and an equal number 
crowded the streets around the building to mark the installation 
that coincided with the moslem sabbath 
ghulam pandey head priest of a local mosque wrapped a turban 
around farooqs head formalizing his appointment as the mirwaiz 
other priests showered the new preacher with rose petals 
the boy wearing a loose shirt and trousers and a brocaded silk 
gown then climbed a black marble dais and read from the koran the 
islamic holy book for 30 minutes as the congregation listened in 
rapt attention 
after farooqs sermon the moslems shouted in urdu join hand 
to hand give the mujahedeen a sturdy stand and what do we 
want we want independence the militants are commonly called 
mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
outside the mosque militants burned indian flags and copies of 
the autobiography of former indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru 
a kashmiri hindu 
several moslems inside and outside the mosque began weeping as 
farooq read the koran 
we used to listen to his father read the koran every friday 
today he is no more said an old man who refused to identify 
himself 
umars father mirwaiz maulvi farooq was killed by three 
unidentified gunmen in his srinagar home on may 21 a few hours 
later security forces opened fire on a crowd carrying farooqs body 
in defiance of a curfew killing 58 people and wounding 300 
the toll was the highest in one day in security force action 
since they launched a crackdown on kashmiri separatists jan 20 
at least 486 people have been killed since then most were 
militants or supporters of the campaign for the independence of 
jammukashmir indias only moslemmajority state from the 
predominantly hindu india 
kashmir a former princely state was divided along a 
stilldisputed forntier between india and pakistan after british 
colonial india became independent in 1947 and was partitioned along 
religious lines 
the border dispute has also led to a harsh war of words between 
india and pakistan and has raised fears of a fourth war between the 
two countries 
two of the previous wars were over kashmir and both were won by 
india pakistan also lost the third war when india helped 
bangladesh become independent from pakistan 
about 64 percent of the 6 million people in indiangoverned 
jammukashmir state are moslems nationwide moslems account for 12 
percent of indias 880 million people while hindus comprise 82 
percent

the united states vetoed a security council 
resolution calling for a factfinding mission on abuses against 
palestinians in israelioccupied lands drawing sharp criticism from 
arab states 
in jerusalem palestinian leaders in the israelioccupied lands 
said today they were cutting off contacts with us officials 
because of the veto 
arab nations said the 141 vote thursday in favor of the 
resolution demonstrated that the united states and israel are 
isolated on middle east issues 
the observer of the palestine liberation organization zuhdi 
labib terzi called it a sad day in the security council when 
one member blocks the council from responding to its responsibility 
to report on an alarming situation 
after the council meeting clovis maksoud observer of the 
22nation arab league vowed to raise the issue again in the 
council despite the risk of another us veto 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the resolution was 
more likely to add to the problems rather than help resolve the 
peace process in the region 
this resolution does not focus on the real need to move the 
peace process forward pickering said rather it could too 
easily become a vehicle which could be misused to generate more 
needless controversy he told the 15member council 
the united states favors an envoy dispatched by the un 
secretarygeneral to investigate violence in the territories 
israel however opposes any factfinding mission and israeli 
officials said they will not permit un officials or security 
council members to enter its territory 
the united states frequently has voted in favor of its israeli 
ally and has used its security council veto power to shield israel 
from harsh criticism in the council 
during the council meeting israeli ambassador johanan bein said 
the plo had fanned violence in the territories and was murdering its 
own dissidents 
more than 700 palestinians have been killed by israeli gunfire

vladimir ustimenko a soviet official manning 
the soviet office at the press center was just as frustrated as the 
reporters he was trying to help 
ustimenko had heard but couldnt confirm that raisa gorbachev 
would be accepting a painting as a gift sometime thursday but he 
didnt know where the event was to take place and he couldnt get 
through to the soviet embassy 
busy he told a reporter who muttered that the press 
operation was useless 
ustimenko kept his humor though the problem he said was that 
he was used to using a cellular telephone 
for the record mrs gorbachev never paid a noontime visit to 
accept paintings but she did attend a library of congress reception 
where she was given framed items

anton kumankov lives in moscow but he had to 
come to the capital childrens museum here to meet raisa gorbachev 
childrens portraits by kumankov a book illustrator are on 
display until june 17 at the handson museum housed in a former 
school building near capitol hill he was visiting the united states 
when he got the call from a museum official that mrs gorbachev 
would be stopping by 
while awaiting her arrival thursday kumankov milled about his 
exhibit two rooms of portraits of solemn bigeyed children most 
drawn in pencil on paper 
his favorite portrait is called natasha and her dog pif 
this is a very nicelooking girl but she thinks she is not 
beautiful and she suffers very much this dog very much resembles 
its owner kumankov said 
since he drew natasha he said her parents never called 
again why 
because the picture was published all over the soviet union and 
some journalists wrote a letter saying dear natasha dont worry 
one day youll be beautiful and you will not resemble your dog 
anymore 
kumankov looks the part of the artist with longish red hair 
glasses and big bow ties he says he likes because 19th century 
painters wore them almost totally deaf he also wears two hearing 
aids 
he is not expecting his life to change because of his unexpected 
encounter with raisa gorbachev 
im interested in doing more art he said and thats 
exactly what i have been doing for the past 10 years

in a racquetball court the food service is in a weight room and 
the briefing room is in a basketball arena complete with cement 
bleachers and ceiling pipes 
the international press center for this years contingent of 
summit journalists is a little different than the pampering and 
plush service of 1987 
the jw marriott went all out that year the press had its own 
marble ballroom with crystal chandeliers the hotel provided free 
coffee and sodas plus press releases on how much coffee and sodas 
journalists had consumed 
it was beautiful reminisced victor karasin an aide in the 
soviet press office we even had the glasnost cafe on the ground 
floor 
the smith center at george washington university does have the 
summit minimart for those needing aspirin or souvenirs but its not 
the same the food service a carryout in a cinderblock workout 
room serves exotic dishes such as styrofoam plates of egg salad and 
cardboard boxes of cereal 
reporters can be seen tripping on the floor of the briefing 
center which has been covered with large tapedtogether pieces of 
carpet in varying shades of gray punctuated by inexplicable 
subterranean bumps and slightly raised wooden platforms 
the many tv cameras in the room however are focused on an

the government introduced 
legislation today that would repeal the separate amenities act a 
pillar of apartheid that has allowed racial segregation of all 
public amenities for nearly 40 years 
the legislation which would take effect oct 15 will be 
submitted to parliament on monday where it is expected pass by 
midjune the south african press associated reported 
since 1953 the separate amenities act has authorized provincial 
governments municipalities and privately owned entertainment 
establishments to reserve facilities for whites if the law is 
repealed public bathrooms libraries and transporation as well as 
privately owned restaurants and nightclubs could no longer be 
segregated 
many public amenities already have been integrated in 
johannesburg but dated laws remain on the books 
the effort to repeal the separate amenities act was the latest 
move by president fw de klerk to end apartheid he has said he 
intends to give south africas black majority the vote by 1994 but 
he has stopped short of endorsing black majority rule 
the largest white opposition party the conservative party is 
the only parliamentary group expected to oppose repealing the 
separate amenities act but the party does not have enough votes to 
block it 
hernus kriel minister of provincial affairs and planning said 
the legislation would not take effect until october to give those 
affected time to prepare for the changes 
kriel said that if the act is repealed no south african 
individual or institution would enjoy legal protection for 
discrimination on the basis of race in any facility generally open 
to the public 
apartheid the system of racial separation and white minority 
domination was encoded into law by the national party when it came 
to power in 1948 
other pillars of the system that remain are laws that reserve 
most of the countrys land for white ownership and put power in the 
hands of the white minority by denying a national vote to blacks 
since taking office in september de klerk has legalized dozens 
of outlawed black political organizations freed scores of political 
prisoners legalized a few small multiracial neighborhoods 
suspended the death penalty ended segregation of beaches and 
ordered the end of segregated hospitals 
still de klerk opposes oneperson onevote majority rule and 
suggests a system where cultural social and ethnic groups could be 
sure to have representation in the government 
the conservative party and white extremist organizations have 
denounced de klerks actions as treason to the white afrikaners who 
control the government some have said they are willing to defend 
their rights under apartheid with force if necessary 
opening government and entertainment facilities to whites would 
partly depend on government employees many of whom support the 
conservative party or generally oppose the rapid changes taking 
place 
two weeks ago health minister rina venter announced that 
segregation of all hospitals had ended 
however this week the administrator of the countrys 44 white 
hospitals gave his interpretation of that order he said hospitals 
designated for whites would continue to give preference in admission 
to white patients because they are residents of the area where the 
hospitals are located 
although segregation at governmentrun resorts and recreation 
areas officially ended months ago blacks indians and people of 
mixed race continue to be turned away some local administrators of 
the resorts say they have not yet received the official government 
orders telling them to admit people who are not white

us officials are asking japan to help pick up the 
tab for an 8 billion superconducting supercollider that could 
answer basic questions about th nature of matter and the origin of 
the universe 
deputy secretary of energy henson moore who is heading a 
visiting us delegation told reporters he would present a letter 
from president bush to prime minister toshiki kaifu inviting japan 
to become a partner in the supercollider project to be built in 
texas 
we have asked japan to be the first country to participate 
because of their technical expertise and also because they have 
the capability of being a partner moore said 
the size and the expense of building this project is such that 
no one country can do it alone he added and we believe that 
for it to be a scientific success it must be an international 
project 
moore did not specify the amount the us government wants japan 
to contribute the kyodo news service reported that the united 
states wants japan to allocate 1 billion for the project 
backers say the racetrackshaped supercollider which would 
encircle waxahachie texas with a 54mile tunnel would be the 
worlds most powerful particle accelerator and its largest 
scientific instrument 
the department of energy says the supercolliders 12000 
superconducting magnets will produce a magnetic field 150000 times 
as strong as earths and send streams of protons smashing against 
each other at nearly the speed of light to break them into subatomic 
particles 
scientists then would study the tiny pieces of matter produced in 
hopes of finding previously unobservable particlesthat would provide 
clues to how the universe began 
scientists say such intensely powerful collisions will 
approximate the big bang explosion that some believe created the 
universe 
the cost of the project has grown from an initial 44 billion to 
about 8 billion 
earlier this month the us house of representatives authorized 
5 billion in spending over several years on the supercollider and 
texas agreed to provide about 1 billion to get the project 
the government hopes that the remaining 2 billion will come 
largely from foreign sources department of energy officials said 
some us congressmen have demanded japan bear a large portion of 
the cost because of its trade imbalance with the united states but 
others have warned that foreign involvement would result in a giving 
away us technology 
moore said the united states wanted japan as a partner because of 
its ability to contribute both scientifically and financially to the 
project 
moore said japan also has shown an understanding of the need to 
spend more on basic research 
japan spends less of its gross national product than the united 
states on basic scientific research but more on applied research 
it frequently has taken the discoveries of basic research conducted 
elsewhere and developed them into new consumer products 
participation in research projects at the superconducting 
supercollider would be open to any nation regardless of whether it 
helps fund it as is true with most such particle accelerators 
moore said 
department of energy officials said up to half the accelerators 
magnets could be provided by japan which already has developed a 
prototype of a magnetically levitated train that uses 
superconducting magnets 
each cylindrical magnet will be 45feetlong and weigh 132 tons 
the department says 
after a week in japan the us delegation is to visit south 
korea to seek its participation in the project the only country 
that has already officially agreed to participate is india which 
pledged 50 million 
the worlds most powerful collider is a 17mile ring near geneva 
that was completed last year 
the us delegation here made the funding request at meetings 
with education minister kosuke hori tomoji oshima director general 
of the science and technology agency and ichiji ishii deputy 
foreign minister

a rembrandt painting of a remorseful st peter 
failed to sell because the highest bid at auction was lower than the 
minimum price set by the seller christies auction house said 
the bidding on st peter repentant stopped thursday at 95 
million said dana micucci a spokeswoman for christies 
the 1631 painting had been estimated to be worth at least 10 
million micucci said sellers usually set a reserve price a little 
bit below the low estimate 
st peter repentant was the first rembrandt painting put on 
the auction block since the artists portrait of a girl wearing a 
goldtrimmed cloak fetched 1038 million in 1986 
the st peter painting a 23by18inch oil on oak panel was put 
up for auction by an anonymous private american collector 
i was quite surprised it didnt sell said ian kennedy 
director of old master collections at christies i didnt think 
it would be that easy but i thought we would manage to do it 
kennedy said the pictures present owner bought it about two 
years ago from a belgian family doris athineos a christies 
spokeswoman said the auction house did not know how much the 
present owner had paid for it 
old master paintings typically do not fetch the premium prices 
paid at auction for impressionist and modern paintings kennedy said 
the old masters are rather dark people like brightcolored 
pictures kennedy explained its also the subject matter old 
masters are more religious and serious people prefer subject matter 
that is less demanding 
the record price for an old master painting is 352 million 
paid by the getty museum in malibu calif last year for a portrait 
of duke cosimo i de medici by pontormo 
contemporary impressionist and modern sales in may posted record 
prices for works of masterpiece quality 
van goghs portrait of dr gachet sold for 825 million the 
highest price ever paid for a painting at auction two days later 
renoirs depiction of an openair dance hall fetched 781 million 
both paintings were bought by a japanese businessman

the cocacola co has scrapped its magican 
promotion because of complaints of prizes that failed to pop out of 
cans and leaks of foultasting chlorinated water 
the atlantabased soft drink company had planned to distribute 
750000 of the special cans throughout the summer but spokesman 
randy donaldson confirmed thuursday the shipments had been halted 
after about 200000 were shipped 
the randomly distributed cans looked like regular cans of 
cocacola classic but contained a mechanism that ejected either cash 
or prize certificates the bottom end of the can was filled with 
chlorinated water to make it feel like the real thing 
but some consumers reported that the prize mechanism jammed 
keeping it from ejecting and in some cases the chlorinated water 
which tastes bad but is harmless leaked 
though coke received only about 70 complaints about defective 
cans donaldson said there is the impression we dont like among 
our consumers that there is a problem with the promotion 
we are winding it down early donaldson said 
the cancellation came one week after cocacola ran fullpage 
advertisements in newspapers across the nation acknowledging the 
problems and explaining how the prize cans work 
donaldson said television ads are telling consumers that only a 
few prize cans are left on the market and that they will be going 
going gone by midjune 
jesse meyers publisher of the soft drink industry trade 
publication beverage digest said cocacola had little choice but to 
end the promotion in view of the publicity 
once again perception is greater than reality meyers said 
i think it is the right move because the soft drink industry 
has a golden bond with the consumer he said and whatever the 
reality may be the perception has to be that the quality has to be 
better than the norm of any other food product 
other aspects of the magic summer promotion which began may 
7 are to continue donaldson said

boris n yeltsin the president of the russian 
federation promised his lithuanian counterpart today he will foster 
close ties between his huge republic and the secessionist baltic 
region lithuanian sources said 
yeltsins offer represents a slap in the face for soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who ordered an economic blockade 
against lithuania in an effort to force it to back off its march 
independence declaration 
if russia were to resume supplying lithuania with gas oil and 
other raw materials it would mean the virtual end of the kremlins 
sanctions without gorbachevs consent 
but yeltsin has not explicitly said he intends to provide such 
goods to lithuania morever it is not clear whether his republic 
could gain practical authority to do so even if it adopts an 
autonomy plan championed by yeltsin 
yeltsin who was elected president of the russian republic 
tuesday met with lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis for a 
very friendly talk with full mutual understanding said natasha 
boganova secretary of the lithuanian representation in moscow 
where the two met 
yeltsin is prepared as soon as russia gets its sovereignty to 
cooperate fully with the baltic republics and lithuania first of 
all she said 
lithuania struggling to circumvent the blockade has been 
seeking direct ties with newly elected radical leaders in various 
parts of the country 
on thursday the legislature of the republic of moldavia 
recognized lithuanias independence the official tass news agency 
reported making it the first soviet republic outside the baltics to 
do so 
the move represented another challenge to gorbachevs efforts to 
isolate lithuania from the rest of the soviet union 
gorbachev has demanded lithuania suspend its declaration of 
independence before the blockade can be lifted and talks begun 
lithuanian lawmakers have offered compromise measures but they 
refuse to suspend the declaration 
landsbergis plans to meet with delegates from moscow and 
leningrad where radicals have taken over the city administrations 
and delegates from other parts of russia the lithuanian 
parliaments information service said 
yeltsin has said he expects the russian parliament to declare the 
russian federations sovereignty within the first 100 days of his 
term 
the russian federation is the soviet unions largest republic 
with twothirds of its territory and just over half its population 
sovereignty would mean republic authorities would have the final 
say over which soviet laws are valid on russian territory and 
greater independence in general from the national government 
but even if a russianbaltic accord is worked out it might not 
be soon enough for the lithuanians who are racing to establish 
alternate sources of supply before their fuel runs out altogether 
about 46000 people have been laid off and eight factories closed 
because of the blockade lithuanian radio has reported many 
residents of vilnius the lithuanian capital have been without hot 
water for weeks 
lithuanian radio reported that poland will begin supplying the 
republic with cooking oil and sugar at steeper prices than soviet 
suppliers commanded 
in neighboring latvia which declared may 4 it had begun its move 
toward independence rationing of several food staples began today 
tass said 
the kremlin has not extended its economic sanctions to latvia 
but residents fearing a blockade began panicbuying after the may 4 
declaration 
yeltsin said repeatedly during his election campaign that he 
would seek direct ties with lithuania latvia and estonia which is 
also seeking independence todays meeting was his first reported 
concrete move to begin establishing those ties 
tass said thursday that deputies of the moldavian supreme soviet 
meeting in the capital kishinev favored the establishment of 
direct diplomatic economic political and cultural relations with 
lithuania 
the legislature also proposed to exchange permanent missions 
with the lithuanian parliament or supreme council tass said 
the report did not give vote totals on the measure 
so far only latvia and estonia have formally acted to cooperate 
on such levels with lithuania on may 12 the three baltic republics 
revived a 1934 political alliance pledging mutual cooperation

the space shuttle columbias 
astronomy mission is off until at least the week after next while 
nasa continues to search for a hydrogen leak in the shuttles rear 
engine compartment 
it doesnt look like were going to launch next week nasa 
spokesman bruce buckingham said today its reasonable to assume 
with the work we have yet to do and the fact that we havent 
isolated the exact location of the leak yet 
if workers cannot find the leak or it cannot be repaired on the 
launch pad columbia will have to be rolled back to a hangar for a 
complete inspection that would mean a delay of about a month for 
the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely to 
scientific research 
i hope we dont have to roll back but i can tell you we will 
roll back if we have to if the problem is that serious nasa 
administrator richard truly said thursday 
workers found a tiny leak in the rear engine compartment 
thursday but judged it too small to have been the source of the 
hydrogen leak that delayed wednesday mornings launch buckingham 
said 
after the launch was scrubbed officials had said it would take 
at least a week that is until next wednesday to find and repair 
the leak and prepare for another launch now with continuing 
problems finding the leak the launch is off at least until the week 
after that bukingham said 
the search continued until late thursday afternoon then was 
halted so columbias onboard fuel tanks could be drained officials 
today further increased pressure on the shuttles external tank 
which was drained of fuel and filled with nonflammable helium to 
find the main leak 
engineers are now fairly certain the leak is in or near a 17inch 
valve in a pipe that carries fuel from the shuttles external tank 
to its main engines buckingham said traces of helium were found 
early today in a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect 
the shuttle and its external tank he said 
if the leak is in that cavity it would be an extremely 
difficult area to repair at the pad buckingham said but 
nothing at this point has been ruled out 
if the leak is not pinpointed today helium may be circulated 
through the shuttles entire fuel system saturday buckingham said 
the next step would be to use supercold liquid hydrogen in an 
attempt to duplicate the conditions under which the leak was 
detected six hours before launch while liquid hydrogen and oxygen 
were being loaded 
preparations were under way for the liquid hydrogen test which 
is scheduled for the middle of next week buckingham said 
columbias astronomy mission with a 150 million observatory 
called astro already had been delayed two weeks for repairs to the 
shuttles cooling system

president samuel doe hemmed in by an 
advancing rebel army announced today he will not run for 
reelection and he asked the united states and other nations to 
help end his nations civil war 
us military officials said 2100 marines aboard four ships of 
the us navys 6th fleet stood off the liberian coast to protect 
property and lives of americans and other foreign nationals and if 
necessary to evacuate people 
the rebels from the national patriotic front of liberia are 
seeking does ouster they accuse his administration of corruption 
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses 
more than 1000 people have been killed in six months of 
fighting most of them civilians slain by government troops 
rebel leader charles taylor said in an interview with the british 
broadcasting corp on thursday that his fighters would not stop 
until they had taken monrovia the capital and formed their own 
government 
rebel troops already control the countrys main port of buchanan 
95 miles east of the capital and were advancing on two fronts 
within 35 miles of monrovia thousands of people have fled the city 
at a news conference today doe said i wish to announce here 
today my firm decision not to stand for the 1991 general elections 
accordingly i hereby appeal to our traditional friends the 
united states government and other friendly counties to bring to an 
end this 6monthold libyanbacked incursion in order to pave the 
way for a peaceful free and fair election in 1991 he said 
the news conference also was attended by legislators who for 
months have tried to persuade doe to not seek another term 
its too little too late said one diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity six months ago this might have helped 
us embassy officials said about 2000 us citizens including 
scores of missionaries and many people of liberian origin remain in 
the country thousands of expatriates fled last month 
late thursday the us state department issued a travel advisory 
warning that conditions in liberia were deteriorating and ordering 
all nonessential us personnel to leave immediately 
cmdr david thomas a spokesman for the defense department said 
a us flotilla was off the liberian coast under orders to be 
prepared to evacuate american citizens in the event that they would 
no longer be able to leave the country by commercial means 
rebel ambushes this week on the road between buchanan and the 
main international airport 35 miles from monrovia have prompted 
many airlines to cancel flights 
thomas said the flotilla includes a destroyer an amphibious 
assault ship a tank landing ship and other support vessels carrying 
ammunition and combat supplies aboard the ships were 179 marine 
officers and 2102 enlisted men thomas said 
doe told reporters the us 6th fleet set sail with the 
approval of the government of liberia 
he appeared relaxed at the news conference and impervious to the 
threat from the advancing rebels remember that tough times dont 
last only tough people do said doe who celebrated his 40th 
birthday and 10 years in power this year 
he sidestepped questions about unruly soldiers who have killed 
more than a dozen people in the capital in tribal reprisals against 
people of the gio and mano tribes many of the rebels belong to 
those tribes and does soldiers also are accused of killing 
hundreds of gio and mano civilians in the countryside 
i am in full control of the army he said 
un officials were evacuated on thursday a day after government 
soldiers allegedly attacked the un compound where 1000 refugees 
from tribes that support the rebels had gathered to seek protection 
and safe conduct out of the country 
un spokesman francois giuliani said about eight masked soldiers 
killed a guard and abducted about 30 people the bodies of three 
abducted men and a youth were found later dumped outside the capital 
doe denied responsibility and said he would punish those 
responsible 
un officials moved all the refugees to a nearby lutheran church 
compound where they remained today 
doe said his government was discussing with the united nations 
and the carter center in atlanta set up by former president jimmy 
carter initiatives to actively intervene in the restoration of 
peace in liberia and to help us start the process leading to the 
election 
doe said he decided not to run for the presidency after the 
national legislature this week turned down his request to hold early 
elections and set up an interim government 
legislators said they wanted doe to resign 
doe said he had survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be 
happy to leave the burden of leading a country the political 
harassment to somebody else 
he seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist 
descendants of american slaves who discriminated against native 
liberians liberia a country of 2 million was founded in 1847 
the current rebellion began dec 24 with an invasion of 200 
rebels from the ivory coast what started as a minor rebellion 
escalated into a war because government attacks against civilians 
won the rebels thousands of recruits 
the west african nation has great strategic importance for the 
united states it is the base for all diplomatic messages to and 
from us missions in africa there is a huge voice of america 
transmission station a few miles from monrovia and the country also 
has a powerful omega marine transmitter responsible for guiding all 
us shipping in the atlantic ocean

prospects for middle east peacemaking 
israelis across a wide political spectrum were angered by the 
attack and said it eroded plo chairman yasser arafats credibility 
as a peacemaker arafat said thursday the plo was not responsible 
for the raid 
even though the army foiled the attack killing four guerrillas 
and capturing 12 it was viewed as a chillingly narrow escape for 
israeli civilians tens of thousands of israelis had gone to the 
coast to swim and picnic on the jewish holiday of shavuot 
during a callin show on army radio a series of israelis vented 
their feelings one woman said the soldiers should have killed the 
guerrillas instead of capturing them why dont we just cut them 
down for gods sake why do i need these murderous terrorists in the 
state of israel where we have to guard over them 
asher susser a middle east expert at tel aviv university said 
the attack reflected a basic fallacy in the plos strategy aiming 
its policy toward the united states and western countries instead of 
trying to make israelis more receptive to arafats peace proposals 
its a radical example of what has been a universal failing in 
the plo leadership he said that is the need to make a serious 
effort to see israeli society as the target of their policy instead 
of trying to bring the rest of world opinion crashing down on 
israel 
the palestine liberation front a plo faction headed by mohammed 
abbas also known as abul abbas claimed responsibility for the 
attack in a statement issued in baghdad the front said today that 
its targets were only military 
a prominent palestinian figure in jerusalem faisal husseini 
questioned whether the targets were civilian or military but 
conceded the impact would ultimately be a step backward a 
negative one 
the involvement of a plo faction strengthened the hand of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir who immediately called on washington to 
abandon the dialogue it began with the plo on dec 15 1988 
the bush administration has unsuccessfully sought to involve 
israel in talks with a ploapproved delegation of palestinians as a 
first step toward peace shamir objected to any role for the plo 
even an indirect one 
foreign minister moshe arens said on israel television i 
assume that we wont hear any more from the american administration 
about how the plo is not a terror organization or that yasser arafat 
has abandoned terror 
he made his comments before arafat said in baghdad on thursday 
that the plo was not involved in the attempted attack 
the white house on thursday condemned the foiled attack as a 
cowardly attempt to target innocent people 
but when asked if the united states was reviewing its dialogue 
with the plo in light of the failed attack white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater replied no not at this point 
the united states opened its dialogue with the plo after arafat 
renounced terrorism in december 1988 
security sources said israel sent transcripts of interrogations 
and other supporting evidence to washington to prove the intent of 
the guerrillas and plo involvement 
israeli officials initially claimed abbas who masterminded the 
1985 hijacking of the cruise liner achille lauro had met arafat in 
tunisia five days before the attack 
however in an interview published today by the yediot ahronot 
daily israels top military intelligence chief said arafat probably 
did not know beforehand about the seaborne raid 
we dont have information pointing to the fact that he knew 
ahead of time maj gen amnon shahak was quoted as saying 
the extent to which arafat renounced terrorism is a subject of 
debate in his speech to the united nations in geneva in 1988 he 
recognized israel and condemned terrorism in all its forms 
at the same time however he endorsed the 1985 cairo 
declaration which left open the possibility of hitting military 
targets in israeliheld territory 
despite the qualification a report released by shamirs 
antiterror adviser yigal carmon said that the us ambassador 
assured israel that no american administration can sustain the 
dialogue if terrorism continues by the plo or any of its factions 
the message from the american ambassador at that time thomas 
pickering also said the plo was required to publicly disassociate 
yourselves from terrorism by any palestinian group operating 
anywhere 
to date israeli officials claim plo groups have been involved in 
16 of the attempted 21 acts of terror carried out by palestinian 
groups in israel since arafat renounced terrorism one was a recent 
attempt by arafats fatah faction to plant a car bomb on jerusalems 
jaffa road a major shopping street they said 
yossi olmert head of the government press office said the 
attempted raid wednesday was part of an overall increase in 
arabisraeli tensions that has developed in recent weeks 
there is an amosphere of war talk and war mongering if you 
start talking about war you create a climate where there is more 
tension than before he said

plo chief yasser arafat has denied israeli 
allegations that the plo was involved in an attempted guerrilla 
attack on israels crowded coastline but he did not condemn the act 
arafat also said israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs policies 
toward the palestinians were the main cause of tension in the area 
i have always warned that israeli violence against my people 
will lead to a situation of instability and will lead to 
reactions arafat said thursday 
in washington the white house rebuffed israels plea to end all 
contacts with the palestine liberation organization in the wake of 
the attack 
but white house press secretary marlin fitzwater condemned the 
action and said we are deeply concerned about the responsibility 
for this attack and we are looking into it 
other officials speaking on condition of anonymity stressed 
that no decision had been made on whether to keep talking with the 
plo 
the palestine liberation front a plo faction claimed 
responsibility for the attempted raid wednesday israeli forces 
foiled the raid as the guerrillas headed for the israeli coast in 
speedboats the beaches near tel aviv were filled with israelis 
celebrating the jewish holiday shavuot 
the plf is headed by mohammed abbas also known as abul abbas he 
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille 
lauro 
asked whether he would expel abbas from the elected plo executive 
committee arafat said he was elected in a democratic way by the 
palestine national council and only the council has a say on that 
arafat chairman of the plo and recognized by arab countries as 
president of a state of palestine said we are a democratic 
organization and decisions should be taken democratically 
israeli officials have urged the united states to suspend its 
17month dialogue with the plo they say the raid proved arafat had 
violated his 1988 pledge to renounce terrorism that pledge led the 
united states to open a dialogue with the plo 
israeli officials claim abbas met arafat in tunisia five days 
before the attempted raid 
however in an interview published today by the yediot ahronot 
daily israels top military intelligence chief said arafat probably 
did not know beforehand about the seaborne raid 
we dont have information pointing to the fact that he knew 
ahead of time maj gen amnon shahak was quoted as saying 
asked whether he condemned the raid arafat told reporters we 
in the plo are not responsible for the operation and we have no 
connection with it 
asked again if he could give a flat statement condemning the 
raid arafat responded what i declared was clear and obvious 
queried another time he said when i say that we have no 
connection with this raid i mean the plo forces 
arafat said the raid could be used by israel as a pretext to 
attack arab countries in retaliation even though no israeli 
casualties were reported wednesday four palestinian guerrillas were 
killed and 12 were captured 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said wednesday 
that if the plo were behind the attack the united states would 
view this as a very serious matter 
the extent to which arafat renounced violence is a subject of 
debate in his speech to the united nations in geneva in 1988 he 
recognized israel and condemned terrorism in all its forms 
at the same time however he endorsed the 1985 cairo

mikhail gorbachev is pouring on the charm 
disarming critics and admirers with his candor and telling average 
americans on the street he feels really at home with them 
despite ussoviet differences 
all people he said in one sidewalk exchange thursday want 
a better tomorrow and the rest is not too important 
whether teasing henry kissinger at an embassy lunch parrying 
with reporters at the white house or spontaneously departing his 
motorcade to shake hands with tourists and federal workers 
gorbachev went about town surprising and delighting his audiences 
as if summitry were an afterthought he kept president bush 
waiting at the white house late this morning while he answered 
questions from congressional leaders who accepted his invitation for 
breakfast at the soviet embassy 
the lawmakers have tried to hold up a ussoviet trade agreement 
until gorbachev ends a partial economic embargo against lithuania 
gorbachev defended his refusal to let the baltic republic secede 
without a popular referendum 
the soviet president also explained in great detail his decision 
to make people in his homeland embrace a market economy by tripling 
the price of bread one commodity in plentiful supply 
the televised giveandtake showed gorbachev willing to engage 
american legislators in a forum he has not afforded those in his own 
country 
he made light of his differences with bush saying both men were 
open to discussion of the issues on which they couldnt agree 
we have a good mutual understanding with the president even if 
sometimes we draw different conclusions he told reporters who had 
staked out the white house driveway we both have a willingness to 
listen and so our dialogue is very substantive 
we want to further our relationship the soviet president 
said 
bush too was impressed by the man he was meeting as a summit 
partner for the second time 
i feel very comfortable with him the american president said 
at the end of the first day of their formal talks i feel very 
free to bring up positions that i know he doesnt agree with 
im very pleased with that mood of his wanting to understand 
the us position bush added hes not trying to hide anything 
nor is he trying to wring his hands over challenges to his 
leadership 
gorbachev faces daunting problems at home with some republics 
trying to secede others torn by ethnic strife and panicky 
consumers stripping store shelves in a stark demonstration of the 
lack of confidence in his economic reform plan but if he has been 
weakened by the onslaught or the rise of maverick boris n yeltsin 
as a political rival bush said it didnt show 
theres a certain strength and confidence that was there in 
malta in december and is there now gorbachevs counterpart 
said i dont feel a weakened nature or anything of that nature i 
feel a man who is determined to do his job 
i believe that it shows that we have not been able for so long 
to realize our potential gorbachev told a luncheon he gave for an 
eclectic group of american intellectuals entertainers politicians 
and public figures we are a huge nation speaking 120 languages 
that means representing 120 nationalities but that is not all 
well figure out how to proceed in our country he said we 
havent yet done that but the main thing has been done we have 
come to the conclusion that we cannot proceed as we have been doing 
all along 
he didnt pretend to have all the answers and even admitted 
mistakes had been made but he told his guests at the soviet 
embassy well have to travel down this road because we have no 
other choice and the only thing to decide is how rapid our progress 
should be 
like never before we want to be understood right now he 
said 
former secretary of state kissinger whom gorbachev described as 
my old man who always contests things was just one of several 
leading americans the soviet leader picked out at the luncheon for 
praise or gentle teasing 
kissinger later called him serene 
having warmed up on a sympathetic audience gorbachev invited 
some tougher customers to join him on friday for a suerpower 
breakfast 
under fire in congress for his embargo of lithuania following 
that republics march 11 declaration of independence gorbachev 
asked at least ten leading members of the house and senate from both 
parties to discuss their concerns with him personally

a county commissioner still faces prosecution for 
whitewashing alcohol and tobacco billboards in a churchgroup 
protest despite a grand jurys refusal to indict him the district 
attorney says 
dallas county district attorney john vance said he can prosecute 
county commissioner john wiley price on misdemeanor criminal 
mischief charges grand jurors thursday declined to issue felony 
charges carrying a maximum 10year prison term 
price who is black was the only person arrested in a march 18 
protest involving at least a dozen people whitewashing billboards in 
a predominantly black neighborhood 
the protest was part of a movement against the targeting of 
alcohol and tobacco products at black hispanic female bluecollar 
and innercity consumers 
after his arrest price defended his actions on television 
newscasts in light of that vance said failing to prosecute would 
send the wrong message 
he is representative of dallas racist to the core price 
countered if he wants to waste taxpayer money and turn this into 
a national trial then so be it 
but vance said race had nothing to do with it 
the misdemeanor charge carries a maximum oneyear jail term and 
would not affect prices ability to hold office 
price said the grand jurys decision not to indict was a 
significant victory for opponents of the tobacco and alcohol 
industries 
i am ecstatic over the ruling he said the issue is larger 
than me and its larger than dallas 
billboard company representatives were not happy 
we hope it doesnt send a message out that the way to beat the 
drum for a particular cause is to break the law said george 
reynolds president of the outdoor advertising association of dallas 
grand jury foreman otto fridia declined to comment on the panels 
decision

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev chided 
congressional leaders today for linking favored trade status for his 
country to moscows handling of the lithuanian drive for 
independence 
at a meeting with a dozen democrats and republicans from capitol 
hill gorbachev accused the united states of having a double 
standard on intervening in the affairs of other countries he 
pointed to the us invasion of panama last december 
we have embarked on democratization gorbachev said we are 
changing when we hear there is a debate in congress about our 
affairs this is resented in our society 
he called lithuanias bid for independence which us lawmakers 
have said must be resolved before trade concessions can be granted 
to the soviet union a matter of sovereignty and national 
dignity for his country 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine defended the 
panama invasion saying it was different from gorbachevs crackdown 
in the baltic because the people in panama favored the us action 
but mitchell did not disagree when gorbachev noted that president 
bush has been inconsistent by granting unconditional 
mostfavorednation status to china which a year ago brutally 
crushed a democracy movement 
gorbachev said opening trade channels would be an important 
political plus for him as he seeks to restructure the soviet economy 
to a more western model he added we cannot wait for congress and 
the congressional leadership to mature congress is a problem right 
now 
but he said he would not beg for concessions and that a sound 
stable soviet union is in americas interests 
we hear voices here in america saying maybe the soviet 
union is so weak that we can defeat him with just one step thats 
not serious gorbachev said in televised opening remarks at the 
meeting at the soviet embassy with congressional leaders 
im not going to ask for anything to beg for anything even 
when i for example raise important matters such as trade and its 
important for us now to expand trade because we are moving toward a 
market economy and its important for us to have the americans 
participating in that process 
but certainly we are not asking for a free ride we will be 
asking for normal credits and of course we will be paying and 
paying the interest for us it would humiliating if we were to ask 
to beg for something from you 
this is a genuine revolution gorbachev told the lawmakers 
who sat around a long greenfeltcovered table please dont be 
frightened because you can frighten us too if you get 
frightened 
we have to turn around our brains as it were he said 
this is a most difficult turnaround to make here too we hope we 
will find a mutual understanding and you will be able to find 
certain ways of supporting us so that we could interact 
does the united states want a soviet union which is weak 
torn by complexes and problems and turmoil or do you want a dynamic 
soviet state that is open to the outside world a realistically 
minded person can give only one answer gorbachev said 
among those at the meeting was house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo who stirred a political controversy earlier this 
year when he said it was time for the united states to consider 
offering direct economic aid to help ensure the success of gorbachev 
and his reforms 
of course the president of the united states has the dominant 
role in foreign policy gephardt said in advance of the meeting 
but it is also important for mr gorbachev to hear from members 
of congress we will be asked to approve trade and arms control 
agreements and we most closely represent the views of the people 
who elect us 
for mitchell the topranking lawmaker invited for the session at 
the soviet embassy it was chapter 2 in a lively dialogue initiated 
with gorbachev during a visit to moscow in april 
a day after that meeting gorbachev implemented his economic 
squeeze against breakaway lithuania a move mitchell condemned as a 
breach of the soviet presidents promise to seek a political 
solution with all the baltic states 
mitchell has been a strong proponent of mostfavorednation 
trading status for the soviet union but following gorbachevs 
economic crackdown on lithuania he helped push through a senate 
resolution approved 7324 on may 1 which called on bush to 
withhold a new ussoviet trade agreement until the sanctions are 
lifted and the kremlin begins negotiations to recognize lithuanias 
independence 
those standards are important to all americans who value 
freedom and selfdetermination mitchell said 
a trade agreement was proving to be one of the summits difficult 
issues soviet spokesman arkady maslennikov on thursday called us 
reticence to conclude it quite unnatural and said it was in 
nobodys interest not to have an agreement

nothings official yet but word that 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev might visit their farm sunday 
maybe even sit at their picnic table has the brand family in 
turmoil 
im kind of overwhelmed said greg brand 31 who operates 
the farm with his parents richard and cecilia and his 27yearold 
brother john 
there was too little notice for the brands to do a lot of 
preparation about enough time to get the barn cleaned and the lawn 
mowed 
if possible theyd like to paint the picnic table thats where 
the brands hope to sit and talk with gorbachev and his wife raisa 
telling them about their family and the farm the talk would shift 
to the kitchen table in the event of rain 
ill clean the house if i have time said mrs brand who 
learned of the possible visit on wednesday 
we think of ours as a typical american farm and want to convey 
what american farm life is like she said we want to welcome 
them here this is our opportunity to promote some little bit of 
international understanding 
a farm stop had been suggested for gorbachevs visit but later 
ruled out because he expected to spend only six hours in minnesota 
the prospect resurfaced wednesday however and state agriculture 
officials came up with the brand farm in part because its just 45 
minutes from downtown minneapolis and near the minneapolisst paul 
international airport 
mrs brand said she had been told the soviet president probably 
would arrive at the farm about 630 pm sunday after his meeting 
with business and agricultural leaders in downtown minneapolis how 
long hell stay isnt clear but it wont be long 
richard and cecilia brands have 75 dairy cows and raise alfalfa 
corn and soybeans on the 240acre farm theyve held for 32 years 
its a picturesque farm with a large white barn two white 
machine sheds and a twostory white house with black shutters where 
the elder brands live 
the brands arent strangers to the job of entertaining foreign 
visitors and think that may be one reason they were chosen as 
potential hosts to the gorbachevs 
we do have a lot of foreign people who come here weve had 
several chinese and japanese and quite a few european groups mrs 
brand said the farms easy access from the twin cities could help 
explain why state officials frequently steer visitors her way 
despite the farms proximity to the city the black and white 
holsteins sunning themselves in a large meadow surrounded by 
electric fence present the perfect photo opportunity for a quick 
shot of rural america 
the gorbachevs however would be the first famous visitors 
all the activity wasnt having much effect on mrs brands 
4yearold granddaughter allison who was more interested in 
playing with the gray kitten that wandered up than with preparations 
for the gorbachev visit 
she just knows that the russians are coming said her mother 
brenda brand

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev moving 
to break a summit stalemate over germanys future has proposed that 
the military role of a united germany be decided by a new council 
of all europe with direct us and soviet participation us 
sources said today 
gorbachev made the proposal to president bush at their opening 
summit session on thursday the sources said and the two leaders 
assigned their top diplomatic aides to pursue the concept next week 
in copenhagen denmark and again in berlin two weeks later 
we are prepared to work with it it is not something we would 
reject out of hand said one us official familiar with the terms 
of the soviet proposal who spoke only on condition he not be 
identified 
as he began his second day of summit talks with bush the soviet 
leader was asked if assigning the german issue to a european council 
would allay his concerns about a revival of german militarism 
the president and i are discussing precisely these matters and 
i must say that this is a very substantive discussion a discussion 
in which we are engaged in a spirit of great responsibility and 
cooperation gorbachev replied 
gorbachevs plan calls for annual meetings of the leaders of the 
35 western neutral and eastern states that make up the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe there would be more frequent 
meetings of their foreign ministers a permanent secretariat or 
administrative staff and creation of military and civilian 
conflict management centers 
bush and gorbachev in effect agreed to disagree for the 
duration of their fourday summit on the military face of a united 
germany and are directing highranking aides to meld their 
concerns 
us analysts saw gorbachevs proposal as stemming from his 
concerns over the unraveling of the sovietled warsaw pact and a 
desire to be included more prominently in european consultations 
they are afraid that the process of german unification is 
increasing their isolation one us official said 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze earlier had 
suggested placing a united germany in both nato and the warsaw pact 
but the us reaction was cool 
now secretary of state james a baker iii and shevardnadze will 
explore the proposal for a new european council when they attend a 
human rights conference in copenhagen next tuesday and then at a 
meeting in berlin tentativety set for june 22 
they the soviets want one game in which they are an equal 
player said the us official it is not something we are 
opposed to in principle it is an extension of ideas we are prepared 
to work with 
the european security conference consists of 34 nations and the 
vatican which signed the 1975 helsinki agreement intended to east 
eastwest tensions in europe and promote human rights 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said bush was speaking to west german chancellor helmut kohl by 
telephone today to assure him that the us position on the future 
of a united germany is unchanged as a result of the summit talk 
the white house announced that bush had invited kohl to a white 
house dinner next friday a spokesman said the dinner was arranged 
before the summit and was not based on developments over the german 
issue 
the official said bush would seek to assure kohl today and at the 
dinner next week that the united states supports the position taken 
by kohl who wants a unified germany to be part of nato 
meanwhile bush and gorbachev were set to sign a declaration of 
basic agreement today to cut their longrange nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines to pledge quick consideration of even deeper 
cuts and to announce an end to chemical weapons production 
bush and gorbachev exchanged what the soviet leader called new 
approaches on thursday and marlin fitzwater the white house 
spokesman said optimistically the ideas presented amount to a 
way to meld the concerns of the united states and the soviet union 
later after a state dinner at the white house national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said the questions over germany had produced 
a lively discussion at the afternoon meeting between the two

a judge today ordered the state government 
to pay counties 40 a day for each convicted felon they house in 
their jails because of overcrowding at the state prison 
state district judge joseph hart said the state must either take 
the prisoners or reimburse the 12 counties who challenged the 
states practice 
the 12 counties said they are holding some 6000 felons who have 
been sentenced to state prisons but the texas prison system is so 
overcrowded that there hasnt been room for the felons inside the 
state institutions 
rossanna salazar press secretary to gov bill clements didnt 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the ruling 
the governor in the past has said he opposed paying the counties 
ron dusek spokesman for attorney general jim mattox said the 
state planned to appeal harts ruling to the austinbased 3rd court 
of appeals 
todays ruling affects only those counties that sued the state 
officials said but it could set a precedent for others to follow 
said ann clarke snell the lawyer who represented 11 of the counties 
certainly it seems to me this ruling would be very important to 
any county that wanted to go to court and seek similar relief she 
said 
the counties that challenged the state were nueces bexar 
collin dallas el paso galveston hidalgo hunt lubbock tarrant 
travis and victoria 
statewide there are an estimated 12000 convicts awaiting 
transfer from all county jails to the texas department of 
corrections 
a federal judge has placed a ceiling on the state prison 
population several county sheriffs have complained that the backlog 
of state prisoners is crowding their jails 
hart in a letter to lawyers in the case that was originated by 
nueces county said payment to the counties should begin seven days 
after an inmate is sentenced to state prison 
the judge also told lawyers for the counties to calculate how 
much the 12 counties already are owed for prisoners theyve been 
holding in the past

the plo faction that launched this weeks 
raid along israels coast vowed today to keep attacking the jewish 
state but it claimed its targets were all military 
the statement was issued by the palestine liberation front in 
baghdad where it is believed to have its main headquarters the 
group is headed by mohammad abbas who is also known by his nom de 
guerre abulabbas 
he is a member of the palestinian liberation organization 
executive committee who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the 
italian cruise ship achille lauro one american was killed on the 
ship 
the palestine liberation front claimed responsibility for the 
seaborne guerrilla raid on the israeli coast on wednesday 
in todays statement the faction said our valiant naval 
forces translated the determination of our palestinian people to 
liberate their national land and escalate armed struggle 
yasser arafat chief of the plo umbrella group denied 
responsibility for the raid but did not condemn it 
that angered the united states which opened contacts with the 
plo after arafat renounced terrorism and recongized israels right 
to exist 
plo officials have said arafats declaration renouncing terrorism 
did not include attacks on military targets in israel 
during wednesdays seaborne assault four members of the 
palestine liberation front were killed in a gunbattle with soldiers 
and 12 were captured according to israeli authorities no israelis 
were injured through one craft with raiders landed on a beach near 
a crowded club 
but in its statement today from baghdad the palestine liberation 
front claimed that only two syrians and 12 palestinians took part in 
the raid 
the plo serves as an umbrella organization for several guerrilla 
factions that sometimes fight among themselves and launch 
independent attacks on israeli targets the largest group is 
arafats mainstream fatah 
israeli leaders charged that the raid wednesday proved that 
arafat violated his december 1988 pledge to renounce terrorism 
but plo officials insisted that the arafat pledge was only to 
halt attacks on israeli targets abroad and civilians inside israel 
the pledge did not include military targets they said 
the fronts statement today said its guerrillas did not try to 
approach any civilian target inside israel during the coastal raid 
they said its fighters had instructions to hit military sites only 
the group said its attack was directed at military sites in an area 
50 miles wide extending from herzliyya north of tel aviv to ashqelon 
south of tel aviv 
as for civilian targets the naval operation proved that our 
combatants avoided approaching them or having any contact with 
them the statement said 
however israel claimed maps carried by the guerrillas showed 
their targets were civilian beach hotels crowded with guests on a 
religious holiday

a 72yearold error in the naming of 
flutter road will go unfixed 
the allen county commissioners declined to change the name from 
flutter to fletter even though 75 people who live along the road 
signed a petition favoring flutter 
leonard and harold fletter argued that a clerical error on a 1918 
petition to the commissioners caused the mile road in st joseph 
township to be called flutter instead of fletter it was supposed to 
have been named after their ancestor samuel c fletter who owned a 
farm there and donated adjacent land for a school 
but residents said they dont want to be troubled with having to 
change stationery and legal documents the commissioners went along 
with them at their tuesday night meeting 
resident orlyn myer used alliteration to get his point across in 
a letter to the commissioners 
after finding the flap about flutter from the fletter families 
from fort wayne and florida i felt like flipping wrote the 
father of a flutter road family 
he concluded if by chance mr fletter can find the funds to 
fetch a secretary for me and finance the stamps to fix upon the 
envelopes to change all of his personal records i might 
reconsider the decision otherwise after nearly 72 years why not 
leave well enough alone

after the killings military personnel at clark and the other 
five american installations in this country were barred from leaving 
the bases except on essential business on may 25 us officials 
announced that troops were allowed offpost between 7 am and 7 
pm but they were told to stay within a half mile of the gates 
rand said that local liberty has now been suspended until 
further notice 
the new measures apply to the 20300 troops us civilian 
employees and dependents at clark he said 
clark air base one of the largest american garrisons abroad is 
located 50 miles north of manila in a stronghold of the communist

inquirer quoted police sources as saying a 50yearold unidentified 
professional killer arrived in the country from the united states 
last month and was to have attempted the assassination of mrs

cambodian guerrillas have launched 
major attacks and seized areas of several provinces in recent days 
as cambodias warring factions prepare to meet next week to discuss 
a ceasefire 
guerrilla leaders and diplomats say the khmer rouge have made the 
most substantial gains but the prohanoi government of prime 
minister hun sen has also been active on the battlefields 
leaders of the threeparty guerrilla coalition which includes 
the communist khmer rouge are to meet with hun sen in tokyo on 
monday and are expected to announce a ceasefire in the 11yearold 
war 
sources say the khmer rouge launched a series of coordinated 
attacks in kompong speu siem riep kompong thom and battambang 
provinces in recent days the provinces are in northwestern 
northern and central cambodia 
the khmer rouge captured the district seat of roluos in siem riep 
province earlier this week and have established frontline positions 
only 36 miles from the provincial capital according to senior 
resistance and thai intelligence officials 
there has been heavy fighting recently and the khmer rouge 
seem to be coming out on top said a senior thai intelligence 
official 
fighting in kompong speu province has forced government offices 
to suspend foreign relief projects there according to western 
relief workers returning to thailand from phnom penh the cambodian 
capital 
guerrilla and diplomatic sources say the khmer rouge now control 
large sections of the province and maintain truck supply routes all 
the way to the thai border kompong speu city is 24 miles southwest 
of phnom penh 
diplomats say increased fighting is expected this month as the 
rainy season terrain favors guerrilla advances in the past the 
warring sides have also stepped up fighting before peace 
negotiations to gain leverage 
the thai intelligence official said it made sense for the khmer 
rouge to make a military move before the tokyo talks 
thai intelligence sources and diplomats say the khmer rouge are 
against a ceasefire agreement until there is an international 
verification of the pullout of vietnamese forces from cambodia 
vietnam claimed it pulled the last of its soldiers from cambodia 
in september but the guerrillas claim some remain 
the khmer rouge are joined in a resistance coalition with 
followers of prince norodom sihanouk cambodias former head of 
state and the khmer peoples national liberation front 
the khmer rouge were in power in cambodia in 19751978 they were 
ousted after vietnam invaded in late 1978 and set up a prohanoi 
government 
the tokyo meeting is expected to include announcement of a 
ceasefire reconvening of a paris peace conference that ended in 
failure last year and the formation of a supreme national council 
the council would include all four warring factions and be charged 
with monitoring a ceasefire 
but guerrilla officials say there are no provisions for enforcing 
or monitoring a ceasefire and they are pessimistic it can be 
effectively implemented on the battlefield 
so far they cant even agree on seating arrangements in 
tokyo said a thai official involved in the preparations hun 
sen wants to sit across from sihanouk but the khmer rouge and the 
kpnlf wont accept this

new yorks new lunchtime order make it a ham on 
rye and hold the streptococci 
so advises city council president andrew stein who said thursday 
that all but two of a dozen takeout lunches he had tested at a 
private laboratory were contaminated with illegal levels of bacteria 
stein whose aides collected each sample at a different 
restaurant blamed a lack of inspections by the health department 
the possible result deli belly the nausea cramps and diarrhea 
caused by eating tainted food 
toxic tortillas lethal lunchmeat 
baloney health commissioner woodrow myers jr responded he 
called it categorically untrue for stein to suggest that the 
public was endangered by lax enforcement 
while the restaurant inspection staff remains smaller than 
desired myers said it is being increased and all complaints are 
followed up he noted that the city has not experienced an increase 
in food poisoning reports 
myers also said he had serious questions about the scientific 
value of steins study among other problems he suggested that 
steins aides themselves could have contaminated the food and he 
said the laboratory tests were simply for bacteria in general 
rather than for those bacteria that cause illness 
stein the citys chief ombudsman also recently reported finding 
bug parts in imported packaged foods he had tested federal 
inspection officials said the particles hed found didnt really 
threaten anyone 
thursday stein described his restaurant sampling as random 
saying his aides simply picked up lunches at manhattan eateries that 
appeared to them to be representative he declined to identify the 
establishments saying that would be unfair but sent their names to 
the health department 
i believe that there are hundreds probably thousands of 
establishments that have the same problem he said if you dont 
have enforcement and you dont have inspections then youre going 
to have problems 
stein noted that the health department fired many of its 
inspectors in a bribery scandal three years ago and regular 
inspections have yet to resume 
common sense will tell you that if the establishments know that 
theyre not ever getting inspected on any regular basis then 
theyre going to be more lax than if they are getting inspected 
he said the city has a duty here to do some regular inspections 
myers at his own news conference said the city has 15 food 
inspectors working now and 43 in training who will be available 
sept 1 he said his department was checking the restaurants that 
stein named but noted that four of them are markets that fall under 
state not city jurisdiction 
the health department is not lax when it comes to food 
safety he said while we question mr steins laboratory 
results and refute his conclusions we are nonetheless 
investigating the food establishments in question

construction spending fell 07 percent in april 
for the second consecutive month the government said in a report 
that analysts said signalled a weakening building industry 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4324 billion in april the revised 07 percent 
march decline was improved from the 14 percent drop first reported 
last month 
the decreases in march and april spending followed gains of 32 
percent in february and 24 percent in january and resulted in the 
loss of 159000 construction jobs 
we had strong construction employment in the first quarter when 
we had great weather david f seiders chief economist for the 
national association of home builders said but if you look at 
the next two months thats really quite a decline 
the construction spending report combined with the employment 
numbers are two more signals of a pretty sluggish economy seiders 
said 
two other reports portend further weakening the government 
overall job figures released friday showed the unemployment rate 
fell to 53 percent in may as weak job growth continued the labor 
department reported 20000 more construction jobs were lost in the 
month 
and on wednesday the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill inc 
reported that contracts for new construction declined 6 percent in 
april a fouryear low 
analysts attribute the construction slump to high interest rates 
and tighter restrictions on lending 
residential building edged down 03 percent to an annual rate of 
2027 billion after rising 2 percent in march even better than the 
18 percent increase first reported last month 
singlefamily building dropped 22 percent to an annual rate of 
120 billion after a 12 percent increase in march apartment 
construction on the other hand rose 6 percent to 21 billion it 
had dropped 43 percent in march 
with mortgage rates in the doubledigits and sales of new homes 
declining residential construction is destined to keep going 
down seiders said adding that the jump in multifamily building 
was an aberration 
the multifamily sector has been really weak and sliding for 
some time and will resume its downward path next month he 
predicted 
nonresidential construction such as office and industrial 
buildings edged up 06 percent to 1042 billion after rising 24 
percent in march 
the volatile government sector fell for the second straight 
month down 35 percent to 876 billion highways and streets 
spending paced the drop with a 82 percent decline 
government construction spending had fallen 49 percent in march 
after gaining 52 percent in february 
overall construction spending in april was 5 percent above that 
of the same month in 1989 when it totaled 4119 billion

the white minority government 
introduced legislation friday to remove one of the pillars of 
apartheid racial segregation of public amenities such as parks 
libraries and bathrooms 
the separate amenities act passed in 1953 has granted 
provincial governments municipalities and privately owned 
entertainment establishments the right to reserve facilities for 
whites 
a bill that would repeal the act was published friday and is 
expected to be passed in midjune the south african press 
association reported it was the latest move by the government of 
president fw de klerk to dismantle apartheid 
the conservative party the largest white opposition party is 
the only parliamentary group expected to oppose the bill but the 
party does not have enough votes to block it 
hernus kriel minister of provincial affairs and planning said 
the bill would not take effect until oct 15 to give those affected 
time to prepare 
the bill would remove local governments authority to racially 
segregate public facilities such as libraries toilets parks and 
buses it also would remove the legal protection of individuals who 
want to reserve restaurants hotels resorts and other public 
facilities for whites 
in most major cities such as johannesburg and cape town public 
amenities have been desegregated in recent months but in hundreds 
of smaller cities towns and villages there are either no public 
facilities for blacks in the city centers or there are inferior 
separate amenities 
the separate amenities act is considered one of the pillars of 
apartheid the system of racial separation and white domination 
encoded in law by the national party when it came to power in 1948 
other pillars are the population registration act which 
classifies every south african by race the group areas act which 
establishes racially segregated neighborhoods the land act which 
reserves most of the country for white ownership and the voting 
laws which place political power in the hands of the white minority 
by denying a national vote to the black majority 
de klerk has said he intends to end apartheid and give blacks an 
equal vote with whites by 1994 under a system he hopes to negotiate 
with black leaders 
however de klerk opposes oneperson onevote majority rule and 
instead suggests a system where cultural social and ethnic groups 
would be assured representation in the government 
since taking office last year de klerk has legalized dozens of 
outlawed black political organizations freed scores of political 
prisoners and ordered hospitals integrated 
the conservative party and white extremist organizations have 
denounced de klerks actions as treason to the white afrikaners who 
control the government some have said they will protect apartheid 
by force if necessary 
the complications of changing 42 years of practice are reflected 
in the amount of time it will take to repeal the separate amenities 
act if the national legislature votes to do so hundreds of local 
ordinances may have to be repealed to comply with the national law 
and conservativecontrolled municipalities can be expected to resist 
any changes 
upholding the new law will also depend on government employees 
many of whom support the conservative party or generally oppose the 
rapid changes taking place in south africa 
two weeks ago health minister rina venter announced that 
segregation of all hospitals had ended however this week the 
administrator of the countrys 44 white hospitals said whites would 
still be given preference of admission because the hospitals were 
meant to serve the local community 
although segregation at governmentowned resorts and recreation 
areas was officially ended months ago blacks indians and people of 
mixedrace continue to be turned away in recent cases resort 
administrators who are government employees say they havent 
received direct orders to admit people who are not white

residents and witnesses said three funnel 
clouds didnt quite touch down but still caused 55 million worth 
of damage while the weather service says one tornado did scour the 
surface 
no injuries were reported but about 80 percent of the city was 
blacked out and phone service was spotty until this morning 
there was one that hit spearman itself and there were multiple 
tornadoes in the vicinity of spearman for several hours last 
night said steven cooper of the national weather service office 
in amarillo there were about three different storm systems two 
dropped tornadoes 
the funnel clouds were too numerous to count he said 
state trooper wayne beighle of amarillo said 10 twisters were 
spotted in the area thursday night 
we were up there until 100 am and there were still 
tornadoes dancing around they were all over the place beighle 
said none touched the ground they were hovering just above the 
ground but that was enough to do the damage 
ten mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed beighle 
said 
some of the mobile homes were smoothed off to the ground 
said mayor burl buchanan 
the mayor estimated that 5 percent of the town of 3500 had 
property damage he said early warning gave people time to take 
shelter and prevented injuries 
it could have been a lot worse he said 
a church was demolished and a barbecue restaurant was seriously 
damaged 
the storm blew the porch off and blew it back on top of the 
building it just flipped it up and laid it up on top of the roof 
buchanan said 
many homes had damaged windows and roofs and some power lines 
were reported down buchanan said tree limbs and one mobile home 
needed to be cleared from streets to make them passable

boris n yeltsin promised lithuanias president 
friday that he would foster close ties between the huge russian 
republic he now heads and the secessionist baltic region lithuanian 
sources said 
yeltsins offer openly defied soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who ordered a partial economic blockade against lithuania 
in an effort to force it to back off its march independence 
declaration 
yeltsin who was elected president of the russian federation on 
tuesday met with lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis for a 
very friendly talk with full mutual understanding said natasha 
boganova secretary of the lithuanian representation in moscow 
yeltsin is prepared as soon as russia gets its sovereignty to 
cooperate fully with the baltic republics and lithuania first of 
all she said 
lithuania struggling to circumvent the kremlin blockade has 
been seeking direct ties with newly elected radical leaders in 
various parts of the country 
on thursday the legislature of the republic of moldavia 
recognized lithuanias independence the official tass news agency 
reported it was the first soviet republic outside the baltics to do 
so 
gorbachev has said lithuania must suspend its declaration of 
independence before he will lift the economic blockade and begin 
talks with lithuanian leaders lithuanian lawmakers have offered 
compromise measures but balked at suspending the declaration 
yeltsin has said he expects the russian parliament to declare the 
russian federations sovereignty within the first 100 days of his 
term the russian federation is the soviet unions largest republic 
with twothirds of its territory and just over half its population 
sovereignty would mean republic authorities would have final say 
over which soviet laws are valid on russian territory and greater 
independence in general from the national government including on 
economic issues 
if russia were to resume supplying lithuania with natural gas 
oil and other raw materials it would mean the virtual end of the 
kremlins sanctions without gorbachevs consent 
but even if such an accord could be worked out it might not be 
soon enough for the lithuanians who are pressing to find alternate 
sources of gas and oil before they run out entirely 
about 46000 people have been laid off and eight factories closed 
because of the blockade lithuanian radio has reported many 
residents of vilnius the lithuanian capital have been without hot 
water for weeks 
lithuanian radio reported that poland will begin supplying the 
republic with cooking oil and sugar at steeper prices than soviet 
suppliers commanded 
in neighboring latvia which declared may 4 that it had begun its 
move toward independence rationing of several food staples began 
friday tass said 
the kremlin has not extended its economic sanctions to latvia 
but residents fearing a blockade began panicbuying after the may 4 
declaration 
yeltsin said repeatedly during his election campaign that he 
would seek direct ties with lithuania latvia and estonia which is 
also seeking independence fridays meeting was his first reported 
concrete move to begin establishing those ties 
all three baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 
estonian president arnold ruutel speaking at a stockholm news 
conference said yeltsins election is important to the political 
life in the whole of the soviet union and is certain to influence 
the situation in the baltic region 
despite his defiance of gorbachevs economic sanctions yeltsin 
told reporters friday he still hoped to meet with the soviet leader 
soon to resolve their differences tass reported 
we have got to meet and discuss important questions tass 
quoted yeltsin as saying during a break in the russian congress i 
am prepared to go a good part of the distance toward gorbachev 
throwing aside everything personal that has piled up recently i 
hope that he too will cover part of the road 
yeltsin noted that he had not met personally with gorbachev for 
more than a year 
gorbachev brought yeltsin to head the moscow communist party 
committee but the two men clashed in late 1987 over the pace of 
reforms and have attacked each others positions publicly ever 
since they also appear to bear personal grudges against each other 
gorbachev actively opposed yeltsins election to the russian 
presidency 
there have been no reports that gorbachev has sent yeltsin 
congratulations on his election

barbara bush in a commencement speech 
clouded by controversy over womens roles in modern american life 
exhorted wellesley college graduates today to put friends and family 
first in their lives whatever careers they pursue 
she was joined at the womens college graduation by raisa 
gorbachev who delivered her own words of advice to the 575 
graduates and nearly 5000 other guests gathered inside a white tent 
on this sylvan campus 
even as the first ladies arrived some of the seniors who 
protested the choice of president bushs homemaker wife as their 
commencement speaker fired off a new letter urging mrs bush to 
take a definitive and vocal stand on abortion rights and other 
issues 
copies were placed on each of the chairs inside the tent 
mrs bush sounded the same themes she usually discusses at 
commencements but acknowledged with a joke the controversy over her 
appearance 
i know your first choice for today was alice walker known for 
the color purple she said instead you got me known for the 
color of my hair said the woman george bush affectionately calls 
the silver fox 
mrs gorbachev dressed in a gray suit rather than the 
traditional gown worn by commencement speakers told the graduates 
that women have our special mission 
always even in the most cruel and troubled times women have 
had the mission of peacemaking humanism mercy and kindness she 
said and if people in the world today are more confident of a 
peaceful future we have to give a great deal of credit for that to 
women 
the lone note of discord came during the playing of the soviet 
national anthem when a handful of protesters held up a banner that 
read free the baltics 
mrs bush urged the women to cherish your human connections 
your relationships with friends and family 
you will never regret not having passed one more test not 
winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal you will 
regret time not spent with a husband a friend a child or a 
parent she said 
closing with a device she has used before mrs bush said 
somewhere out in this audence may even be someone who will one day 
follow in my footsteps and preside over the white house as the 
presidents spouse i wish him well 
the controversy ends here but our conversation is only 
beginning she said 
prior to the speech peggy b reid and susana r cardenas had 
their new broadside waiting on each of the chairs cardenas was one 
of the main organizers of the petition drive in april protesting 
the choice of mrs bush as commencement speaker 
we ask you barbara bush as a concerned mother and as a symbol 
of service to others to take a definitive and vocal stand on the 
following critical issues that shape the lives of women in the 
united states they said 
the issues include the deterioration of womens reproductive 
rights passage of a family and medical leave act that president 
bush has threatened to veto and affordable day care 
some 150 students signed a petition in april questioning whether 
the presidents homemaker wife was a suitable model of female 
accomplishment 
mrs bush a college dropout tendered her invitation to raisa 
gorbachev a philosophy phd and former university lecturer 
before the wellesley students mounted their protest 
mrs bush who turns 65 on june 12 dropped out of smith college 
in 1944 in her sophomore year to marry her teenage sweetheart 
george bush then a torpedobomber pilot for the navy 
before returning to washington in midafternoon the first ladies 
were expected to take a driving tour of downtown boston with a stop 
at the boston public gardens and a meeting with about 30 students 
from the mathers school the oldest public school

following are excerpts from barbara 
bushs speech friday at wellesley college 
im really thrilled to be here today and very excited as i know 
all of you must be that mrs gorbachev could join us these are 
exciting times theyre exciting in washington and i had really 
looked forward to coming to wellesley i thought it was going to be 
fun i never dreamt it would be this much fun 
more than 10 years ago when i was invited here to talk about our 
experiences in the peoples republic of china i was struck by both 
the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place 
wellesley is not just a place but an idea an experiment in 
excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated but is embraced 
the essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech about 
tolerance given last year by a student body president of one of your 
sister colleges 
as that very wise young woman said diversity like anything 
worth having requires effort effort to learn about and respect 
difference to be compassionate with one another to cherish our own 
identity and to accept unconditionally the same in others you 
should all be very proud that this is the wellesley spirit 
now i know your first choice today was alice walker known for 
the color purple instead you got me known for the color of my 
hair 
alice walkers book has a special resonance here for four years 
the class of 90 has worn the color purple 
today you meet to say goodbye to all of that to begin a new 
and a very personal journey to search for your own true colors in 
the world that awaits you beyond the shores of lake waban no one 
can say what your true colors will be but this i do know you have 
a firstclass education from a firstclass school and so you need 
not probably cannot live a paintbynumbers life 
decisions are not irrevocable choices do come back and as you 
set off from wellesley i hope many of you will consider making 
three very special choices the first is to believe in something 
larger than yourself to get involved in some of the big ideas of 
our time 
i chose literacy because i honestly believed that if morepeople 
could read write and comprehend we would be that much closer to 
solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our 
society 
and early on i made another choice which i hope you will make 
as well whether you are talking about education career or 
service you are talking about life and life really must have joy 
its supposed to be fun one of the reasons i made the most 
important decision of my life to marry george bush is because he 
made me laugh its true sometimes we laugh through our tears but 
that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds find the 
joy in life because as ferris bueller said on his day off life 
moves pretty fast and if you dont stop and look around once in a 
while you are going to miss it 
the third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human 
connections your relationships with family and friends for several 
years youve had impressed upon you the importance to your career of 
dedication and hard work and of course thats true but as 
important as your obligations as a doctor a lawyer a business 
leader will be you are a human being first and those human 
connections with spouses with children with friends are the most 
important investment you will ever make 
at the end of your life you will never regret not having passed 
one more test winning one more verdict or not closing one more 
deal you will regret time not spent with a husband a child a 
friend or a parent 
we are in a transitional period right now fascinating and 
exhilarating times learning to adjust to changes and the choices we 
men and women are facing 
now maybe we should adjust faster and maybe we should adjust 
slower but whatever the era whatever the times one thing will 
never change fathers and mothers if you have children they must 
come first you must read to your children and you must hug your 
children and you must love your children your success as a family 
our success as a society depends not on what happens in the white 
house but on what happens inside your house 
for over 50 years it was said that the winner of wellesleys 
annual hoop race would be the first to get married now they say the 
winner will be the first to become a ceo i want to offer a new 
legend the winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her 
dream not societys dreams her own personal dream 
who knows somewhere out there in this audience may even be 
someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the 
white house as the presidents spouse and i wish him well 
well the controversy ends here but our conversation is only 
beginning and a worthwhile conversation it has been so as you 
leave wellesley today take with you deep thanks for the courtesy 
and the honor you have shared with mrs gorbachev and with me 
thank you god bless you and may your future be worthy of your 
dreams

here are excerpts from the speech of 
raisa gorbachev at the commencement friday of wellesley college 
im pleased to be with you on this momentous and exciting day 
when you are leaving your college and entering a new life i 
congratulate you on this important occasion im grateful to mrs 
barbara bush and to the college administration for this chance of 
coming to wellesley during our stay in america 
i thank college officials professors and all of you for your 
kind words and warm feelings 
i distinctly remember a similar summer day in moscow the years 
of my studies at moscow university where we were then full of plans 
and hopes just like you are today 
being young is a marvelous time a time of actions and 
expectations of being confident of ones abilities and sure that 
everything is still ahead i wish that all your dreams of the future 
come true the president of the soviet union asked me to convey to 
you his warm regards he also wishes you happy roads in your life 
we know that people in america show great interest in what is 
happening in the soviet union the land of perestroika this word 
nowadays sounds the same in all languages of the world 
we associate with perestroika the future of our country whose 
millions of people speak over 120 languages 
perestroika was conceived and is being implemented for the sake 
of the people their dignity and equality its goal is to make 
humane ideals and values a reality 
this vast and difficult task is a tough challenge but we are 
confident that perestroika will succeed the guarantee of that is 
the patriotism and talent of our people their tanacity their 
strength and their desire to overcome obstacles on the way on the 
road they chose in renewing our country we want to make it open to 
the world the soviet people know the value of this we wish to have 
good relations with the americans and other peoples 
first all of us builders and sons of our own countries and 
peoples are different the soviet union and the united states have 
different histories traditions and cultures 
that however is not the reason for mutual estrangement and 
suspicion people on both sides realize more and more clearly 
there are values that bring us closer such values are love for 
ones own native country love for ones relatives children we 
believe in what is good and the ability to combat wars violence 
hunger and catastrophes and other threats to mankind these values 
are now more important than anything else 
hamlets question to be or not to be today confronts not 
only as individuals or nations but the entire humanity so what 
will our society be like not only the leaders of states but the 
world community as a whole share this responsibility 
we women have our special mission always even in the most cruel 
and troubled times women have had the mission of peacemaking 
humanism mercy and kindness and if people in the world today are 
more confident of a peaceful future we have to give a great deal of 
credit for that to women who are active in advocating friendship 
cooperation and mutual understanding among nations 
you are entering a complex and multifaceted world your 
generation will soon assume the responsibility for everything that 
takes place on our planet may good luck and happiness be with you 
i wish you many good accomplishments thank you

new hampshire and maine are on a crash 
course for a us supreme court battle over what king george ii 
really meant when he drew their mutual boundary the outcome could 
affect thousands of jobs 
rep bob smith rnh scheduled a news conference monday to 
discuss a threeyear research project involving the library of 
congress that was triggered by an irate worker at the portsmouth 
naval shipyard 
smith is expected to announce that king georges 1737 ruling has 
been misinterpreted and that the shipyard on an island in the 
piscataqua river and listed in kittery maine is and always has 
been new hampshire property 
maine officials disagree 
i dont think there is any doubt that the shipyard hasnt been 
moved since maine became a state in 1820 maine attorney general 
james tierney said thursday he criticized smith who is running for 
us senate for leading the investigation 
the border skirmish provokes strong emotions because it affects 
people in their wallets 
maine collects about 3 million in income taxes annually from 
about 4300 new hampshire residents working at the shipyard if the 
shipyard were in new hampshire theyd pay no income tax the state 
is one of two that have no general sales tax or general income tax 
victor bourre a shipyard worker and new hampshire resident 
started exploring the question in 1987 because he was tired of 
paying maine income tax 
everybody has always said the shipyard is in new hampshire so 
i set out to prove it said bourre 42 the more i dug into it 
the more i realized its in new hampshire and i had the proof its 
clear cut 
according to bourre the territory now known as maine originally 
included all land beyond north and east of the piscataqua river 
the kings 1737 ruling settled a border dispute between new 
hampshire and massachusetts then both british colonies that ruling 
moved the boundary between new hampshire and maine then part of 
massachusetts to the middle of the river he said 
the recognized line today is in the channel between the shipyard 
and portsmouth nh but bourre said documents some from the 1600s 
show that in 1737 the river was considered to flow between kittery 
and five islands that were filled in to become seavey island on 
which the shipyard was built in 1800 
the kings middle of the river thus was between kittery and the 
shipyard putting the shipyard in new hampshire he said 
thats the true boundary between maine and new hampshire 
bourre said ive got the documents and thats what they 
considered the river back then 
bourre sent his information to smith who relayed it to the 
library of congress bourre said a library of congress investigation 
upheld his assertion and smith sent the ensuing report to gov judd 
gregg 
gregg asked his attorney generals office to investigate earlier 
this year though no lawsuit has been filed new hampshire appears 
headed in that direction to claim the shipyard 
im sure there will be amicable discussions with maine which 
will prove fruitless after which i expect well move to file before 
the supreme court new hampshire attorney general john arnold told 
the wall street journal recently arnold did not return telephone 
calls from the associated press and assistant attorney general dana 
bisbee refused to comment 
its not the first trip to the supreme court for the two states 
maine and new hampshire also went to the nations high court in 
1976 when the court ruled in maines favor in an offshore boundary 
dispute between lobster fishermen 
bourre said the shipyard dispute is complex and the relevant 
information is not easily obtained 
no one knew any different its too complicated he said 
when you hear all the facts youll know why they never figured it 
out 
in fact theres even been a new hampshire ruling in favor of 
maine in 1969 new hampshires thenattorney general george 
pappagianis ruled that maine was the shipyards rightful owner he 
also based his decision on king george iis 253yearold ruling

for some performers at the spoleto 
festival usa success depends literally on a wing and a prayer 
for the first time in the 14year history of the arts festival an 
opera by richard wagner opera is being presented parsifal will 
be the festivals largest operatic production ever a total of 269 
people are involved including performers orchestra choir and 
production staff 
and three pigeons 
the opera directed by festival founder and artistic director 
gian carlo menotti tells the story of parsifal and his quest for 
the holy grail 
parsifal is the last opera written by wagner and was directed 
by menotti in 1987 during spoletos companion festival the festival 
of two worlds in spoleto italy 
the role of parsifal is being reprised by william pell who 
performed it at the italian festival ruthild engertely who also 
appeared in italy will again perform the role of kundry both are 
members of the deutsche berlin opera 
in one scene a pigeon flies to parsifal as a sign from god the 
opera calls for a dove to land on parsifals shoulder but that wont 
exactly happen at spoleto 
instead fancy pigeons are being used theyre white like doves 
but larger so they show up better on the stage also since trainer 
sherri kaiserman and the three pigeons only arrived thursday and the 
operas first show is saturday there wont be time to train them to 
fly to the actors shoulder 
were just getting it to fly to him and if it gets near him 
its a big plus said ms kaiserman a trainer with the dawn 
animal agency in new york city who has worked with animals for a 
decade 
its less common for a pigeon to land on somebodys shoulder 
she said they are more secure on a fixed object 
the pigeons have been living in gaillard municipal auditorium 
where the opera will be performed since they arrived so they can 
become familiar with the surroundings ms kaiserman said 
what you have to do is spend a lot of time with them and 
reinforcing things she said 
some birds work to noise cues and some to visual cues and the 
trainer must decide which bird works best in which situation she 
said 
the less intelligent the animal is the harder it is to work 
with said kaiserman who has also worked with dolphins you 
have only their instincts to work with its not as simple as a dog 
when you give it some food and tell it to come 
what works for one bird may not work for another she added 
the production also will be staged monday the auditorium newly 
reopened was badly damaged during hurricane hugo on sept 21 
hurricane leaving 29 dead and 59 billion damage in south carolina

the justice department said friday it wont 
appeal the sentence of a suspended cornell university graduate 
student placed on probation for paralyzing a nationwide computer 
network 
the justice department which had sought a prison term for robert 
t morris jr decided last month not to appeal the lighter sentence 
imposed may 4 by a federal judge in syracuse ny 
the decision was made after a recommendation by assistant 
attorney general edward sg dennis jr head of the criminal 
division officials said 
morris 23 convicted of unleashing a computer virus in 1988 that 
immobilized 6000 computers linked to a government network was 
placed on three years probation fined 10000 and ordered to 
perform 400 hours of community service 
the son of a government computer scientist morris was the first 
person convicted under the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act he was 
found guilty in january of breaking and entering the internet 
computer network by designing and unleashing a computer virus 
under procedures that took effect in 1987 both the prosecution 
and defense may appeal the judges sentence justice officials felt 
prosecutors made their point by obtaining the felony conviction 
said spokesman doug tillett 
in terms of deterrent value our point was made by the fact we 
brought the case tillett said it was up to the discretion of 
the judge to mete out a proper sentence 
justice officials regarded morris as a bright kid who shouldnt 
have done what he did tillett said the case was seen as an 
important test of the computer fraud law 
the defense argued that the government was overreacting in 
trying to brand morris a criminal 
morris lawyers said their client didnt benefit from the 
computer virus noting that others convicted of such crimes had 
stolen money 
morris testified that the computer virus which he admitted 
designing to invade internet was an experiment that got out of 
control 
prosecutors contended that morris carefully plotted an assault on 
the nationwide network of government military and university 
computers that was disabled in november 1988 by the virus that 
originated from morris computer at cornell 
defense lawyer thomas guidoboni said he was pleased about the 
governments decision not to appeal 
morris suspended from cornells graduate program in computer 
science must apply for readmission if he wants to return guidoboni 
said

despite broken diplomatic ties the 
government would agree to talks with britain if they focus on the 
salman rushdie novel that has raised an uproar in the moslem world 
an iranian official said thursday 
hussein musavian directorgeneral of the foreign ministry also 
said iran would continue its efforts for release of all hostages in 
lebanon 
his stand was at odds with statements in recent weeks by iranian 
hardliners including former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi they have said iran should not help win release of 
foreign hostages in lebanon until washington makes a gesture of good 
will 
such a gesture would be to thank iran for its help in winning the 
release of two american hostages in april 
in his comments thursday musavian said the indianborn rushdies 
book the satanic verses was the greatest obstacle in 
tehranlondon relations 
britain and iran severed ties in february 1989 after the late 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on moslems 
worldwide to kill rushdie for allegedly blaspheming islam in the 
novel 
if direct talks were proposed to discuss rushdies blasphemous 
book and to exchange views about the difficulties in the way of 
resuming relations we would not reject such a proposal he said 
he said britain would have to make it clear that it respects 
islam and moslems and condemns insults to islam such as those 
contained in rushdies book 
musavian said if britain revised its blasphemy law it would be 
a great step toward resumption of ties 
british moslems angered by rushdies book have demanded that the 
law which only applies to insults to christianity be changed to 
include islam 
hussein musawi leader of the shiite moslem fundamentalist islam 
amal in lebanon called last month for rushdies deportation from 
britain he said if britain expelled the author it would help gain 
release of british hostages in lebonon 
british officials said they would not deport rushdie 
musavian said he refused direct talks in dublin ireland with a 
british official last month because it was not clear what was on 
the agenda a british foreign office spokesman had said it was 
londons understanding that the iranians wanted a meeting 
asked whether iran would boost its current efforts to gain 
release of four britons missing in lebanon if diplomatic ties were 
restored musavian replied i cannot deny this 
the 16 western hostages in lebanon including six americans are 
believed held by proiranian moslem factions the longestheld is 
terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
musavian also said irans efforts will continue for release of 
all the hostages without any preconditions and for humanitarian 
reasons 
he said these efforts are unrelated to nationality bilateral 
relations negotiations or deals 
but he condemned the united states saying it had refused to make 
a goodwill gesture to iran and the kidnappers since the two american 
educators were released 
he said washington should help release hundreds of lebanese and 
palestinian moslems imprisoned in israel and in south lebanon 
if the united states and the west show good will and gain the 
release of most of the palestinian and lebanese moslems i have no 
doubt this will result in the release of all the hostages he said 
president bush has said he will make no deals to free the 
us hostages

how do you thank a man who worked 60 years in 
the fire department give him his own fire box of course 
the village no longer uses the old castiron fire boxes and is 
selling 50 of them for 45 each one box was also given to dick 
tenney who spent 60 years with the walden fire department 
tenney said he didnt want one but others feel differently 
buying all but about a dozen so far 
i dont know what the heck they want them for tenney said 
maybe theyd make good anchors 
tenney said the alarm box system served walden well for more than 
100 years residents would pull the alarm and then direct the fire 
company to the exact location of the blaze when firefighters arrived 
but the alarm box system has deteriorated in recent years to the 
point where it was uneconomical to keep them in service said 
village manager patricia dwyer 
the fire department now depends on phone calls and automatic 
alarms

following is the text of barbara bushs 
speech friday at the commencement of wellesley college 
president keohane mrs gorbachev trustees faculty parents 
and i should say julie porter class president and certainly my 
new best friend christine bicknell and of course the class of 
1990 
im really thrilled to be here today and very excited as i know 
all of you must be that mrs gorbachev could join us 
these are exciting times theyre exciting in washington and i 
had really looked forward to coming to wellesley i thought it was 
going to be fun i never dreamt it would be this much fun so thank 
you for that 
more than 10 years ago when i was invited here to talk about our 
experiences in the peoples republic of china i was struck by both 
the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place 
wellesley you see is not just a place but an idea an experiment 
in excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated but is 
embraced the essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech 
about tolerance given last year by a student body president of one 
of your sister colleges 
she related the story by robert fulghum about a young pastor 
finding himself in charge of some very energetic children hits upon 
a game called giants wizards and dwarfs you have to decide 
now the pastor instructed the children which you are a 
giant a wizard or a dwarf at that a small girl tugging at his 
pants leg asks but where do the mermaids stand and the pastor 
tells her there are no mermaids and she says oh yes there are i 
am a mermaid 
now this little girl knew what she was and she was not about to 
give up on either her identity or the game she intended to take her 
place wherever mermaids fit into the scheme of things where do the 
mermaids stand all of those who are different those who do not 
fit the boxes and the pigeonholes answer that question wrote 
fulghum and you can build a school a nation or a whole world 
as that very wise young woman said diversity like anything 
worth having requires effort effort to learn about and respect 
difference to be compassionate with one another to cherish our own 
identity and to accept unconditionally the same in others 
you should all be very proud that this is the wellesley spirit 
now i know your first choice today was alice walker guess how i 
know known for the color purple instead you got me known for 
the color of my hair 
alice walkers book has a special resonance here at wellesley 
each class is known by a special color for four years the class of 
90 has worn the color purple 
today you meet on severance green to say goodbye to all of that 
to begin a new and a very personal journey to search for your own 
true colors in the world that awaits you beyond the shores of lake 
waban no one can say what your true colors will be but this i do 
know you have a firstclass education from a firstclass school 
and so you need not probably cannot live a paintbynumbers life 
decisions are not irrevocable choices do come back and as you 
set off from wellesley i hope many of you will consider making 
three very special choices the first is to believe in something 
larger than yourself to get involved in some of the big ideas of 
our time 
i chose literacy because i honestly believed that if more people 
could read write and comprehend we would be that much closer to 
solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our 
society 
and early on i made another choice which i hope you will make 
as well whether you are talking about education career or 
service you are talking about life and life really must have joy 
its supposed to be fun one of the reasons i made the most 
important decision of my life to marry george bush is because he 
made me laugh its true sometimes we laugh through our tears but 
that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds find the 
joy in life because as ferris bueller said on his day off life 
moves pretty fast and if you dont stop and look around once in a 
while you are going to miss it 
i am not going to tell george you clapped more for ferris than 
you clapped for george 
the third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human 
connections your relationships with family and friends for several 
years youve had impressed upon you the importance to your career of 
dedication and hard work and of course thats true but as 
important as your obligations as a doctor a lawyer a business 
leader will be you are a human being first and those human 
connections with spouses with children with friends are the most 
important investment you will ever make 
at the end of your life you will never regret not having passed 
one more test winning one more verdict or not closing one more 
deal you will regret time not spent with a husband a child a 
friend or a parent 
we are in a transitional period right now fascinating and 
exhilarating times learning to adjust to changes and the choices we 
men and women are facing as an example i remember what a 
friend said on hearing her husband complain to his buddies that he 
had to babysit quickly setting him straight my friend told her 
husband that when its your own kids its not called babysitting 
now maybe we should adjust faster and maybe we should adjust 
slower but whatever the era whatever the times one thing will 
never change fathers and mothers if you have children they must 
come first you must read to your children and you must hug your 
children and you must love your children your success as a family 
our success as a society depends not on what happens in the white 
house but on what happens inside your house 
for over 50 years it was said that the winner of wellesleys 
annual hoop race would be the first to get married now they say the 
winner will be the first to become a ceo both of those stereotypes 
show too little tolerance for those who want to know where the 
mermaids stand 
so i want to offer a new legend the winner of the hoop race 
will be the first to realize her dream not societys dreams her 
own personal dream 
who knows somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who 
will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the white house 
as the presidents spouse and i wish him well 
well the controversy ends here but our conversation is only 
beginning and a worthwhile conversation it has been so as you 
leave wellesley today take with you deep thanks for the courtesy 
and the honor you have shared with mrs gorbachev and with me 
thank you god bless you and may your future be worthy of your 
dreams

charles taylor the useducated rebel 
leader whose army bore down on the capital this week is a former 
bureaucrat who speaks enthusiastically about capitalism but not 
democracy 
taylor denies government allegations he embezzled 1 million 
while he ran the general services administration liberias 
purchasing agency he is wanted in the united states for escaping 
custody pending extradition to liberia 
taylor 42 spent the 1970s working as a mechanic at a plastics 
factory in boston before graduating with an economics degree from 
bentley college in waltham mass 
during those years taylor says he headed an organization of 
35000 liberian exiles in the united states he said they were 
working to overthrow the rule of his country by the descendants of 
freed american slaves who founded the nation in 1847 
taylor returned to liberia after samuel doe took power in a 1979 
military coup giving the indigenous population control of the west 
african country for the first time in its history 
doe named taylor head of the general services administration 
taylor fled to the united states in 1983 to escape charges of 
embezzlement 
he was arrested in the united states but escaped before he could 
be extradited 
i skipped from jail to escape does lies taylor has said he 
said all charges would be dropped if he toppled does government 
taylors revolt began dec 24 1989 when he crossed the ivory 
coast border into liberia with a small band of men they accused doe 
of corruption mismanagement and human rights abuses 
taylor based his men in nimba county an area traditionally 
hostile to doe 
does forces responded with savage attacks on tribal groups that 
supported taylor international agencies say hundreds were killed 
and the atrocities appeared to have increased support for taylor 
taylor has made good use of the news media making frequent 
telephone calls to the british broadcasting corp and other news 
organizations 
last month he gave a news conference for foreign journalists in 
tapeta in the heart of rebelheld territory about 100 miles 
northeast of monrovia the capital 
the bearded rebel said he wanted to assure the united states 
liberias main foreign aid donor that he was committed to good 
relations 
the united states has permanent interests in liberia and not 
permanent friends he said i would hope that we would have a 
real good marriage and a real honeymoon 
but his declarations on democracy have provided little cheer to 
the opposition parties that had been contesting does power taylor 
said he wouldnt share power with opposition parties 
dont think we are going to turn the government over to someone 
to screw up he said 
he said his plans do not include elections for at least three 
years and perhaps five years 
as a civilian however taylor insists he is different from doe 
who made his career in the military he said he was leading a 
grassroots civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator but 
harbored no dictatorial ambitions himself 
it is so easy to make a dictator in liberia and i am not going 
to permit myself to be one he has promised 
 
taylor describes himself as a churchgoing christian and 
pledges to restore traditional christian values 
before liberians were interested in school in church he 
said nobody thinks of going to church anymore everybody talks of 
ritualistic killings 
the vast majority of the countrys 25 million people practice 
traditional african beliefs black magic or juju is widely 
practiced 
taylor wears two woven amulets around his neck his guerrillas 
say the amulets are magic charms that protect the wearer from 
bullets

stations around the world ranged from 65 to 75 putting it in the 
range of major to extremely powerful

seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a 
move to break a summit stalemate has proposed the creation of a new 
council of all europe to play a decisive role in shaping the 
military future of germany us sources said friday 
the united states and the soviet union would participate in the 
deliberations along with other members of the nato and warsaw pact 
alliances as well as neutral countries 
gorbachev raised the idea with president bush at their opening 
summit session thursday the sources said and the two leaders 
assigned their top diplomatic aides to pursue the concept next week 
in copenhagen denmark and again in berlin later this month 
we are prepared to work with it it is not something we would 
reject out of hand said a us official familiar with the 
details he spoke only on condition he not be identified 
at the start of his second day of summit talks with bush 
gorbachev was asked if soviet concern about a revival of german 
militarism would be allayed by assigning the issue to the european 
security conference under which the new council would function 
the president and i are discussing precisely these matters and 
i must say that this is a very substantive discussion a discussion 
in which we are engaged in a spirit of great responsibility and 
cooperation gorbachev replied 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said without elaboration 
that some different formulations of the problem were discussed 
at the summit 
he said the bush administration was interested in strengthening 
both nato and the european security conference and also taking a 
look at their functions 
however fitzwater said that was not focused on in any detail 
at yesterdays meeting 
the soviet spokesman arkady a maslennikov said moscow wants to 
create a kind of permanent structure which will create stability 
and cooperation in europe perhaps by combining existing 
organizations or possibly setting 
the soviet plan calls for annual meetings of the leaders of the 
35 western neutral and eastern states that make up the conference 
there would be more frequent meetings of their foreign ministers a 
permanent secretariat or administrative staff and military and 
civilian conflict management centers would be set up 
bush and gorbachev have concluded they cannot solve the german 
question before the windup of their summit on sunday consequently 
they assigned highranking aides to explore avenues of settlement 
gorbachevs proposal stems from his concerns over the unraveling 
of the sovietled warsaw pact and a desire to be included more 
directly in european consultations especially on germany 
they are afraid that the process of german unification is 
increasing their isolation a us official said 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze earlier had 
suggested placing a united germany in both nato and the warsaw pact 
but the us reaction was cool 
now secretary of state james a baker iii and shevardnadze will 
explore the proposal for a new european council and possibly other 
approaches when they attend a human rights conference in copenhagen 
next tuesday and then a meeting on germany in berlin tentatively set 
for june 22 
they the soviets want one game in which they are an equal 
player the us official said it is not something we are 
opposed to in principle it is an extension of ideas we are prepared 
to work with 
the european security conference consists of 34 nations and the 
vatican which signed the 1975 helsinki agreement to ease eastwest 
tensions in europe and promote human rights 
an administration official said bush was telephoning west german 
chancellor helmut kohl to assure him that the summit had not altered 
the us position on the future of a united germany 
the white house announced that bush had invited kohl to a white 
house dinner next friday a spokesman said the dinner was arranged 
before the summit and was not based on developments over the german 
issue 
bush and kohl insist on full membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization for the new germany to be formed by the 
unification of east and west germany 
in bonn meanwhile west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher who has been the point man for the western allies in 
seeking accommodation with moscow urged the superpowers to lay the 
foundation for a new europe 
genscher who will meet with baker in copenhagen next tuesday 
said germany should reduce its military forces to help ease soviet 
jitters over a united germany

a murderer whose execution was delayed 
even though he wants to die could be put to death saturday night 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals issued a stay thursday 
night for thomas baal hours before he was to be executed 
the stay expires at noon saturday and baals death warrant is 
good through the weekend said warden pete demosthenes the 
execution by lethal injection was reset for saturday night 
baal 26 was sentenced to die for killing a bus driver during a 
1988 robbery in las vegas he was housed in a lastnight cell next 
to the death chamber at the nevada state prison and spent his time 
friday talking on the telephone the warden said 
demosthenes said baal had calmed down following an outburst when 
he was advised of the temporary stay issued by the 9th circuit 
the stay came on a request from baals parents who contend that 
longterm mental problems and possible brain damage prevent their 
son from making a rational decision about his appeals 
when baal heard about the stay he threatened to escape and 
commit more crimes if he was sent to a mental institution according 
to state prison director ron angelone 
angelone said baal was irate at his attorney public defender pat 
flanagan who won the delay 
he got real upset and he called his public defender and told 
him he didnt want anyone to get involved that he had no right to 
get involved in it angelone said 
the appeals court in a 21 decision said the delay was needed 
to get more information from us district judge howard mckibben 
who earlier thursday denied a stay for baal 
justice harry pregerson who wrote the decision questioned 
whether baal had received a proper competency hearing to determine 
if he was capable of making a rational decision to give up his 
appeal justice alex koznski dissented 
mckibben ruled baal was competent after he told the judge in a 
hearing conducted by telephone i just want to go die and be free 
thats all 
baals execution would be nevadas fifth and the 129th nationally 
since the us supreme court in 1976 cleared the way for states to 
resume use of the death penalty 
nevadas last executions were in june 1989 in the same week 
confessed murderers sean flanagan and william bud thompson were 
given lethal injections after both said they wanted no further 
appeals

toby really wasnt qualified to be a 
certified realestate appraiser but the cats owner shouldnt be 
punished for getting him a license a federal judge ruled friday 
us district judge ernest c torres dismissed a lawsuit by the 
national association of real estate appraisers claiming that tobys 
owner roy c schaeffer made the organization look foolish by 
admitting a cat as an appraiser 
torres said the association did not prove its contention that it 
was defrauded and defamed when toby listed on his appraiser 
certification and in court documents as tobias f for feline 
schaeffer was admitted 
there was no question that schaeffer had submitted a false 
although incomplete application in the cats name torres said but 
it was true that the cat had been granted a professional 
designation which was all that schaeffer claimed 
theres no evidence that anyone understood or reasonably could 
have understood that mr schaeffer said that plaintiffs 
knowingly admitted cats torres said the plaintiff has failed 
to prove that the statements in question were false and hence the 
claim for defamation is dismissed 
although there were muffled giggles throughout two days of 
testimony both sides said the issues were significant 
the association and its owner robert g johnson claimed 
schaeffer made the organization the laughingstock of the industry 
when he publicized his cats membership 
schaeffer claimed the integrity of his industry was at stake he 
said he submitted his cats name for membership in the national 
association of real estate appraisers to prove his contention that 
it did not have high professional standards 
he successfully used the incident to press congress to approve a 
national registration and licensing system for appraisers 
the associations attorney michael dady had asked torres to 
rule against schaeffer on the grounds that any national organization 
could be duped into admitting unqualified people 
if we had to verify everything in this country the whole 
system would shut down dady argued in court thursday 
torres said friday that argument had no weight the judge said 
seemingly elementary steps such as asking rhode island members 
of the association about tobias f schaeffer or requiring a 
completed appraisal from him could have avoided the incident

soviet president mikhail gorbachev said friday 
israeli officials are using jewish emigres from the soviet union to 
stymie peace efforts in the middle east 
we are really in a difficult situation now as a result of 
certain actions of the israeli government gorbachev told 
congressional leaders at a soviet embassy meeting friday morning 
the situation there is very difficult now and has been 
exacerbated recently 
he said the soviet union wanted to work with the united states to 
find a solution for middle east peace and noted the soviet step 
toward easing restrictions on the jewish emigration 
people are leaving and they settle them on the occupied 
territories and provoke clashes he said they are provoking a 
problem between us and the arabs the arab presidents are 
remonstrating with us 
this is something that i think the israelis are doing on 
purpose in order to make a solution very difficult he added 
gorbachev also said reaching a solution to middle east peace must 
be reached internationally following arab proposals rejected by 
israel that talks be held under the aegis of the soviet union 
united states and other major powers 
if we begin with internationalizing that process we will be 
able to restore diplomatic relations with israel gorbachev said 
we are ready to be with you the guarantors of independence and 
security of the state of israel of all middle eastern states 
including israel 
he urged the united states to work with palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat 
he is the person with whom you can work for a settlement 
gorbachev said he has the kind of attitude that makes that 
possible and if you are able to work with him to apply some 
influence i think that he may evolve even further

about 50 jewish refuseniks rallied in downtown 
moscow on friday evening urging that their plight to emigrate not 
be forgotten as soviet and us leaders met in washington 
the halfhour demonstration on a puddlefilled square in front of 
the lenin library was timed to coincide with one in washington it 
occurred with little harassment from soviet authorities 
two vans filled with police were parked nearby several 
plainclothes police who made little attempt to hide their 
walkietalkies milled in the crowd but only one uniformed officer 
walked up to the demonstrators and asked them to disperse the 
officer walked away when protesters showed that they had applied to 
the authorities to hold the rally 
they held up posters and unfurled banners that said refuseniks 
are the hostages of perestroika and shame on antisemitism 
our demonstration is synchronized with a demonstration in 
washington we insist that our human rights are violated said 
mike shapiro he said he has been denied an emigration visa even 
though he stopped his secret work for the soviet government more 
than 12 years ago 
stephen cohen of palm beach fla a member of the board of 
directors of the union of councils for soviet jews said there are 
400 to 500 families of jews who have been refused permission to 
emigrate because soviet officials say they have knowledge of state 
secrets 
in november the supreme soviet legislature gave preliminary 
approval to a bill that allows emigration for virtually anyone who 
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
it sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be kept 
from emigrating because of access to secrets 
but jewish activists claim that the bill is vaguely worded and 
might still be used to restrict emigration 
the bill has not yet come up for a final vote the united states 
is withholding action on loosening trade sanctions on the soviet 
union until the immigration law is passed 
leonid stonov one longtime refusenik who was told in recent 
weeks that he will be allowed to emigrate in august said 
antisemitism is on the rise and that he sees a difficult future for 
jews in the soviet union 
all the jewish culture jewish tradition jewish life 
everything was ruined here during the stalin era and brezhnev era 
there is no basement no foundation for establishing here a real 
jewish life he said 
mark m kotlyar a refusenik from kiev was asked how he felt 
when he saw president mikhail s gorbachev cheered on the streets of 
washington this week he smiled and said it was a difficult question 
to answer 
on the one hand its important that people be friendly that 
they meet our leaders that they give them a warm reception 
kotlyar said but on the other hand i think that they are too 
rapturous about gorbachev he is not that good he is not 
pamela braun cohen national president of the union of councils 
for soviet jews acknowledged that gorbachev has brought change to 
the soviet union 
the fact that we are here holding this demonstration today and 
the fact that the people who have held the demonstration were not 
taken away you cant dismiss it she said 
but she said the american public needs to be more tempered in 
its approach to gorbachev and that might better serve the human 
rights movement here in this country and better serve the united 
states in their relationship with the soviets

palestinian guerrillas who launched a seaborne 
attack on israel this week planned to attack the us embassy in tel 
aviv as well as hotels and stores a top israeli official said today 
maps carried by the guerrillas indicated killings would be 
carried out in the densely populated tel aviv beachfront hotel 
district where the embassy is located said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
locations circled on the maps indicated a large tel aviv 
department store as another potential target he said 
four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured in wednesdays raid 
which was masterminded by mohammed abbas the leader of a plo 
faction 
during the debriefing of the guerrillas it was 
established that one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel 
district was the us embassy the source said 
wherever they can they try to accomplish a spectacular mass 
killing the us embassy was a good target that would make 
headlines he said 
the comment was the first indication the guerrillas had planned 
to attack the us embassy 
earlier today israels military intelligence chief was quoted as 
saying plo chief yasser arafat probably did not know beforehand 
about the raid 
the comment by maj gen amnon shahak contradicted foreign 
ministry officials who claimed arafat met last week with abbas and 
almost certainly knew of the planned strike abbas leads the 
palestine liberation front the plo faction that claimed 
responsibility for wednesdays foiled attack 
israel claims libya helped mount the strike which was aimed at 
crowded israeli beaches and shahaks comments in an interview with 
the yediot ahronot daily provided the most detailed account yet of 
that alleged involvement 
but a libyan official today denied libyan involvement in the 
raid gadallah azouz eltalhi libyas foreign minister said 
some news media claimed that a libyan ship carried the speedboats 
that tried to go to shore libya has no connection at all with the 
operation eltalhi said during a visit to egypt 
shahak also said israel knew with complete certainty that the 
plo has planned attacks on soviet jewish immigrants to israel in 
every possible location and at every opportunity 
the statement was the first public comment by security officials 
about threats against soviet immigrants israeli newspapers have 
quoted officials as saying israel stepped up security because of 
expected guerrilla attacks on soviet jews 
shahak said arafat probably didnt know about abbas plans to 
attack israel we dont have information pointing to the fact that 
he knew ahead of time shahak said 
arafat said thursday the plo was not involved in the raid 
prime minister yitzhak shamir called on washington to abandon the 
dialogue it began with the plo in december 1988 after arafat 
renounced terrorism 
arafat avoided condemning the raid outright and said he could 
not expel abbas from the elected plo executive committee for the 
attempted raid he was elected in a democratic way by the 
palestine national council and only the council has a say on that 
abbas faction said today in a statement issued by its office in 
baghdad iraq that it would continue its attacks 
us ambassador to israel william brown said today that arafats 
response was unacceptable 
he has attempted to absolve the plo from responsibility 
rest assured that were going to continue to look at that very very 
seriously brown said during a tour of the northern israeli town 
of migdal haemek 
israel radio which carried the remarks said brown did not say 
whether the united states would end its dialogue with the plo 
shahak said the guerrillas involved in the seaborne raid trained 
in a camp set aside for them by libyan authorities on the 
mediterranean coast 
the investigation shows beyond doubt that libyan military 
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation shahak said 
in the newspaper interview 
earlier reports have said the guerrillas boarded a libyan 
merchant ship in libyas port of benghazi that also transported 
speedboats to carry out the attack 
libyans helped to move the terrorists to the ship the ship 
itself had a libyan crew and aboard was a libyan military 
officer shahak said 
the intelligence chief also said some of the guerrillas had been 
in libya for more than two years and that training for the attack 
began several months ago 
israeli officials have refused to comment on speculation that 
israel would retaliate against libya 
former military intelligence chief yoshua saguy called for such a 
military strike libya needs to know that like we reached them in 
the past we will reach them again saguy told army radio 
saguy a member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc also suggested that israel was reponsible for the april 
16 1988 assassination of plo military commander khalil wazir in 
tunis the slaying was widely attributed to israeli commandos but 
israel has denied any involvement

while mikhail gorbachev was talking to george 
bush in the white house friday some of the landlords the american 
people inspected their property 
they gawked at the portraits and the dinnerware treading the 
floors that lincoln trod later on the street they said they liked 
this man gorbachev and wished him well 
i think hes wonderful a great man he has a wonderful 
personality said tour bus driver john lauro his bare arm still 
carrying the girlie tattoo acquired as a submarine seaman during the 
vietnam war the hard part will be changing the minds of the old 
guard in both countries 
i would want him to know that he has a lot of support among the 
american people said kristin garner of richmond va whose 
mother ann brought her here for the day sort of a college 
graduation gift 
what would kristin say to gorbachev if she had the chance 
zdrastvyuitye tovarish gorbachev she beamed proud of her 
years study of russian at the university of north carolina 
hello comrade gorbachev 
mrs garner wanted to see the impressionists at the national 
gallery of art kristin insisted they first stand outside the white 
house on the chance that gorby would come by the gamble paid off 
the whole screaming motorcade streaked through the white house gates 
while they waited 
comments from these random tourists cameras strung around their 
necks some wearing the official tourist uniform of tshirts and 
shorts put meat on the bones of the latest opinion samplings 
last week pollsters peter hart and robert teeter reported that 
59 percent of americans view gorbachev positively 
none among these tourists on the white house sidewalk had 
anything negative to say although a caveat came from 52yearold 
schoolteacher edward schneider who brought 38 student government 
representatives from district 10 the bronx ny to washington 
hes running into the same problems nixon had loved outside 
the country more than inside schneider said gorbachevs a 
smart politician but im not sure hes calling the shots i think 
the army told him do something about the economy before we do 
the afghanistan war was his vietnam schneider said he 
didnt let eastern europe go because he loves democracy he let them 
go because he couldnt afford to keep them i think he was shocked 
by the complete rejection of communism in east europe that came as 
a surprise 
robert and arlene schroeder of mequon wis were delighted to 
share washington with gorbachev even though mrs schroeder feared 
the white house would be closed to tourists just as it had been on 
two previous visits one during world war ii and one while harry 
truman was having the place renovated 
schroeder a salesman said he figured the cold war is pretty 
much over 
sooner or later i assumed something had to happen good or 
bad he said 
hes done more for the russian people than anyone in my 
lifetime said mike erixon of denver colo who runs a company 
that makes batteries for the aerospace industry 
the end of the cold war could be bad for the battery business 
acknowledged erixson but im all for world peace 
louis mattingly 14 was one of the 43 eighth graders from 
bardstown ky who rode 11 hours through the night on john lauros 
tour bus louis wore a fluorescent red cap that hed acquired at a 
souvenir stand outside the roy rogers fastfood restaurant 
i think of gorbachev as a person who is trying to make peace 
between two countries and doing a good job of it he said 
chimed in lauro i like to talk to people on my bus these kids 
think gorbachev is an allright guy and is trying to bring peace to 
the world

barbara bush on friday easily won over 
most of the class of 1990 of wellesley college with charm and a 
spirited speech that put to rest much of the controversy about her 
selection as commencement speaker 
mrs bushs address in which she urged graduates of the elite 
womens school to follow their dreams and be true to themselves was 
wildly applauded 
the 575 seniors arriving for the speech were greeted by letters 
placed on their chairs urging mrs bush to be a stronger proponent 
of womens issues 
mrs bush who appeared with soviet first lady raisa gorbachev 
received her loudest cheers as she closed by saying 
somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one 
day follow in my footsteps and preside over the white house as the 
presidents spouse i wish him well 
one senior had painted on her mortar board barbara bush for 
president 1992 one wore a picture of president and mrs bush 
with the first lady dressed in a suit and power tie the president 
wearing a dress 
the conflict over mrs bush stemmed from a petition signed last 
month by 150 of wellesleys 2200 students the petition complained 
that her selection as speaker ran counter to the schools philosophy 
that women should be honored for their own career achievements 
i thought it was lovely and i was one who signed the 
petition said betsy pollard 21 a graduating senior from pepper 
pike ohio i was very moved by it i thought she was great she 
knew all about us and all about our class and i appreciated it 
deana smythe 21 a senior from medina ny said she did not 
sign the petition and was in favor of mrs bush as commencement 
speaker 
i thought it was wonderful smythe said i especially liked 
the spirit of the two of them up there together 
the seniors who drew up the letters that were placed on the seats 
said they would give a copy to mrs bush the students also made 
available purple armbands the class color to be worn by students 
sympathetic with the letter which asked mrs bush to support such 
womens issues as day care family leave and reproductive rights 
but the letter also said that in honoring barbara bush as our 
commencement speaker we celebrate all the unknown women who have 
dedicated their lives to the service of others the purple armbands 
you see today are in honor of these very women 
when college president nan keohane cited that section in her 
remarks loud applause erupted mrs gorbachev and mrs bush smiled 
broadly and clasped hands 
the original petition coauthored by seniors peggy reid 21 and 
susana cardenas 21 gained national attention cardenas said 
students never wanted publicity about the controversy and did not 
want to be discourteous to mrs bush 
but the issue divided the students as did the letter 
before the ceremony jennifer swihart 21 of mclean va said 
i probably wont wear the armband i didnt sign the petition i 
think shes a cool lady and that telling women what they can do is 
a form of reverse oppression but i think this has been good to open 
up dialogue 
but susan brandzel 21 of seattle said were wearing the 
armbands as a tribute to the kind of work she has done but we hope 
it encourages her to speak out on issues and we hope it encourages 
her to use the power she has to work more for womens issues 
many students teachers and alumnae alarmed by the presence of a 
large media podium inside the enormous tent complained of a circus 
atmosphere but the mood was largely a happy one at the 112th 
wellesley commencement set up for 5500 guests the largest 
graduation gathering ever 
mrs gorbachevs speech focused on perestroika which she said 
had helped pave the way for easing tensions around the world 
we know that people in america showed great interest in what is 
happening in the soviet union the land of perestroika this word 
now sounds the same in all languages of the world she said

some unpleasant memories confronted 
germany as this weeks summit talks turned to german unification 
among them the rise of fascism and european suffering at the hands 
of germans twice this century 
but the germans have played a big role in recalling the memories 
convinced that is the best way to show the soviet union and the rest 
of the world they do not want a replay of the past 
the main german question under discussion by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and president bush is the military status of a 
united germany 
the united states and west germany have insisted the state belong 
to nato but gorbachev has proposed letting the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe settle a united germanys 
military future 
west germany initially responded cautiously a government 
official in bonn pointed out foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
has already called for strengthening of the council however no 
west german leaders have suggested the council should decide what 
military alliance west germany should belong 
fridays frankfurter rundschau newspaper said the summits 
success hinges on the german question 
it noted that the 1987 summit between gorbachev and former 
president reagan was a success by virtue of an agreement to begin 
scrapping intermediaterange nuclear weapons but it said in a 
commentary that the german military issue far outweighed any other 
considerations at the current summit 
when mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan got together the 
luster of the disarmament treaty cast a gleam on the meeting but 
not much of a show can be made of that disarmament in view of the 
question of german unity and german alliance membership said the 
newspaper 
the soviets have said a big reason they oppose a united germany 
in nato is the deepseated memory of the nazi third reich and the 
carnage world war ii brought to the soviet union 
but west germans have tried to use the past to reassure the 
soviets and to state germans right to make their own decisions 
shortly before the summit kohl pointedly reminded moscow that 
pushing germany into isolation has a historic precedent 
there must be no second versailles kohl said referring to 
the 1919 treaty that humiliated germany and has been linked to the 
rise of fascism 
whenever germany chose out of overbearing blindness or 
criminal hubris to pursue a separate path or when former enemies 
forced it into isolation following its defeat the immediate 
consequence for europe was conflict instability and uncertainty 
kohl said 
west german leaders believe that anchoring a united germany to 
nato is actually the best means of protecting the soviet unions 
security interests 
a germany that is not bound into an alliance in a clear and 
effective way must also appear to the soviet union as a greater 
danger for stable development in europe said uwe ronneburger 
chairman of the defense committee in west germanys parliament the 
bundestag 
burkhard dobiey a highlevel official for the west german 
intergerman relations ministry said he believed the soviets are 
truly worried about german military might 
but the reality is germany is a state that has renounced every 
use of violence or threat of violence he said in a radio 
interview thursday night it represents no threat to other 
nations also not to the soviet union 
i think the real problem for the soviet leadership is that for 
decades nato has been portrayed in moscow as the archenemy the 
problem is how one changes this picture 
genscher has suggested broader financial ties between the soviets 
and the west coupled with drastic disarmament and the eventual 
development of new security institutions as ways to help preserve 
european stability 
he said friday that the alliance debate concerns creating 
conditions in europe that make nato membership attractive also for 
the soviet union 
this means the fundamental change in europe will transform a 
confrontational relationship to one of cooperation he said on 
deutschlandfunk radio

five former agriculture secretaries and more

trade ties with the soviet union so far resisted by the bush 
administration 
there is a large potential for further development of this 
market to the mutual benefit of the united states and the soviet 
union said the statement 
it came as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was visiting the 
united states and followed a meeting at which gorbachev urged 
cooperation from members of congress who have resisted granting 
moscow better trade ties 
the statement called for granting the soviets mostfavorednation 
status which would give them the same preferential tariffs given 
the united states other top trading partners 
the soviet union was the second largest singlenation importer of 
us farm products last year buying a record 36 billion 
president bush said recently it was too early to grant 
mostfavorednation status to the soviets although he recently 
renewed that standing for the chinese despite protests over last 
years bloody crackdown in tiananmen square 
trade negotiations are currently under way between the united 
states and the soviets 
an important part of that agreement would be 
mostfavorednation status for the soviets giving the soviets the 
same access to our market as enjoyed by most of our trading 
partners the statement said 
the signers included former agriculture secretaries john r 
block orville l freeman earl l butz bob bergland and richard e 
lyng 
the statement was issued by national agricultural advisory 
committee of the citizens network for foreign affairs whose 
directors include former top government officials as well as 
business and labor leaders 
while mfn will not solve the soviet unions economic problems 
it would help to build a relationship that all sides can count on 
for the long term and be a basis for bringing the soviet union more 
fully into the world trading system the statement said 
it did say that to strengthen trade and investment ties between 
our two countries the soviet union must continue to expand 
individual freedom including the right of selfdetermination and 
emigration and reach a peaceful and equitable resolution of the 
baltic situation 
other signers ranged from the american farm bureau federation to 
the national farmers union to cargill inc the agricultural 
exportimport giant they included producer groups specializing in 
meat oats soybeans wheat corn pork and rice

stomach ailment that had her coughing blood in court and her 
attorney said the former philippines first lady was too ill to 
resume her trial on schedule

subpoena to compel journalist diane sawyer to testify about a 1986 
interview with mrs marcos 
officials at new york hospitalcornell medical center said mrs 
marcos could be out of the hospital by sunday but lawyer john tigue 
said there was no way she could be ready for a scheduled tuesday 
court session 
mrs marcos was visited at the hospital friday by her lawyer 
gerry spence her two sisters and her son ferdinand jr said 
family spokesman roger peyuan she rested well overnight and was 
feeling better peyuan said 
mrs marcos condition is much improved and she is 
stabilized the hospital said in a statement 
mrs marcos was admitted to the hospital thursday after she 
collapsed and coughed up blood during her federal racketeering trial 
doctors diagnosed her illness as erosive gastritis an 
inflammation of the stomach caused by excessive acid they said the 
ailment could have been caused by stress but did not appear related 
to a high blood pressure condition for which she has been treated 
during the trial that began march 20 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of having helped her husband the 
late president ferdinand marcos steal 220 million from their 
nations treasury using the money for their own purposes

documents to show that he not the marcoses owned the properties 
before the marcoses assets were frozen by a us court order 
the government had sought to testimony from ms sawyer to verify 
the authenticity of an interview she conducted of mrs marcos on 
cbstvs 60 minutes 
but us district judge john f keenan ruled that the publics 
interest in a vigorous aggressive and independent media 
outweighed the necessity of the testimony to the prosecutions case 
the judge made his decision in a written opinion although he 
told lawyers about his intention thursday 
in the interview mrs marcos said her signature on a swiss bank 
record found in the presidential palace in manila was a forgery 
prosecutors sought to show that mrs marcos was lying because 
handwriting on the document which was presented as evidence at the 
trial had been positively identified as hers they also said the 
interview would counter defense arguments that mrs marcos had no 
involvement in financial dealings

plo leader yasser arafat on friday denounced 
the united states for its veto of a un resolution urging the 
deployment of united nations observers to the israelioccupied 
territories 
i only ask why the united states keeps protecting and covering 
the crimes israel is committing against the palestinian people 
arafat told a news conference why does the united states champion 
human rights everywhere but stop doing that when palestinian human 
rights are concerned 
the united states on thursday vetoed a un security council 
resolution that called for a factfinding mission to visit the west 
bank and gaza strip of the 15 voting members only the united 
states opposed the measure as a permanent security council member 
it has veto power over resolutions 
its veto came a day after israel foiled an attack on its 
coastline by palestinian guerrillas four guerrillas were killed and 
12 captured no israelis were harmed 
a plo faction the palestine liberation front claimed 
responsibility and said the action was in part to retaliate for the 
murder last week of seven palestinian laborers by an israeli 
civilian arafat has said neither he nor the plo was involved in 
wednesdays incident 
a highranking israeli official said friday in jerusalem that the 
guerrillas intended targets included the us embassy in tel aviv 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
information was based on maps seized from the palestinians 
arafat met friday with ambassadors of the soviet union china 
italy france and ireland and urged their governments to reopen un 
discussion of the renewed upsurge of violence in the occupied 
territories 
he also urged them to press for deployment of a un observer 
group to the territories despite the us veto and to ensure 
protection of palestinians in the occupied territories 
arafat also said he instructed the plo ambassador in tunis to 
meet with us ambassador robert pelletreau to protest the us veto 
palestinian leaders in israel declared a boycott on contacts with 
american diplomats to protest the us veto they accused the united 
states of total bias toward israel 
palestinian contacts with american consulate officials have been 
held periodically for the past two years mainly to discuss the 
political situation 
what the united states did yesterday in the security council 
was a shock a slap at all those people who believe in peace in this 
area said faisal husseini a proplo activist in jerusalem 
another palestinian leader salah khalaf said the plo will 
shed no tears if the united states breaks off dialogue with the 
group because of the attempted raid 
in condemning the abortive raid the state department left open 
the possibility the incident could affect us dialogue with the 
plo that dialogue began after arafat in 1988 denounced terrorism 
we will not break off the dialogue but if the united states 
does we wont be upset because we stand to lose nothing said 
khalaf second in command to arafat in the plos mainstream fatah 
organization 
he was quoted by the londonbased newsletter mideast mirror a 
copy of the published interview was telefaxed to the associated 
press in bahrain 
he repeated arafats claim that the plo was not involved in the 
raid 
we are against the killing of innocent people of all 
nationalities but we cannot be expected to be the only ones who 
stand against such killings khalaf said 
when our people are slaughtered like sheep let no one ask us 
to be angels to rise above our wounds and say why did such an 
operation take place 
he was referring to the deaths of palestinians during the 
2yearold uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
at least 714 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians during the uprising an additional 217 palestinians have 
been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israel

west germany and luxembourg joined france on friday 
in banning british beef imports because of mad cow disease but 
the european community offered to buy british meat to support that 
nations troubled cattle industry 
france which normally purchases more than half of exported 
british beef imposed a ban wednesday it said some meat might be 
tainted by bovine spongiform encephalopathy an incurable and fatal 
nervous disorder 
the disease identified in britain in 1986 is blamed for killing 
13648 cows there 
west germany had already barred imports of british beef still on 
the bone but followed france by extending the ban to canned beef 
friday 
luxembourg later announced a ban on british beef imports said an 
ec commission spokesman in brussels 
west germanys agriculture ministry said in bonn that it feared 
british beef normally destined for france might be rerouted to west 
germany a ban was necessary to protect consumers from 
infection the ministry said 
but british officials accused france and germany of seeking to 
protect their domestic beef industries and exaggerating their 
concern for public health 
the bans are totally unjustified unwarranted and contrary to 
ec law said britains ministry of agriculture spokesman 
the president of britains national farmers union sir simon 
gourlay called for a retaliatory ban of beef imports from all eec 
countries to bring the community to its senses 
we cannot allow the situation to drag on through cynical 
delaying tactics by some other governments he said 
european community officials denounced frances ban thursday as 
illegal and demanded it be revoked 
in brussels belgium ec headquarters said friday the community 
would buy 20600 tons of british beef to help prop up falling meat 
prices 
the british meat and livestock commission said bans and fears 
arising from mad cow disease were costing their industry about 
850000 a day beef sales reportedly have fallen by about 30 
percent in britain 
a team of french veterinarians sent to britain to assess mad 
cow disease returned friday to submit its report frances 
agriculture ministry said no decision on the duration of the ban 
would be made until after a meeting of the european communitys 
veterinary committee 
however british agriculture officials said the committee meeting 
had been postponed indefinitely 
the cause of mad cow disease is unknown because the symptoms 
are similar to scrapie a sheep disease it is assumed the disease 
was transmitted through cattle feeds they use sheep offal as a 
protein supplement

lech walesa himself a nobel laureate 
suggested on friday that the 1990 nobel peace prize go to the people 
of lithuania latvia and estonia for their peaceful drive toward 
independence from the soviet union 
his proposal came in a letter to the norwegian nobel committee 
pap news agency said 
walesa won the award in 1983 for his role in creating the 
independent solidarity trade union three years earlier 
lithuania latvia and estonia are the countries that march on 
the road to independence all alone with the passive attitude of 
the world they manifest in a very bold way their attachment to the 
ideas of freedom and selfdetermination of nations ideas embodied 
in the constitutions of all democratic nations walesa wrote 
the three baltic republics have declared their determination to 
peacefully regain the independence lost when they were forcibly 
incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 
walesa and the polish government and legislature have expressed 
support for the right of the baltic republics to selfdetermination 
but poland has not officially recognized their new democratically 
elected governments

salvadoran coffee workers rep james scheuer dny said friday

it looks like another dry season in southern 
california except for those who work at los angeles countys 
estimated 1500 car washes 
up to 18 million cars a month routinely flow through car washes 
operators expect more cars this year as residents are being asked to 
cut water consumption by 10 percent because of the fourth straight 
year of drought in the region 
even in a drought people will still wash their cars said 
gary wimmer who operates a dozen southern california car washes 
people like clean cars 
especially people like pat sukove of north hollywood 
i bring it in every week sometimes twice a week i cant 
afford not to take care of it i waited a long time for this car 
its my pride and joy she said 
car washes are also benefitting from the mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation 
thats because cars keep getting doused with a sticky mixture of 
malathion pesticide and corn syrup bait that is sprayed from 
helicopters in an effort to eradicate the pest spraying already has 
driven business up at car washes by an estimated 20 percent to 40 
percent as drivers wash their cars after each spraying car wash 
operators report 
and car washes have received a boost from metropolitan water 
district officials who through their literature are encouraging car 
owners to go to a car wash rather than wash cars on their own 
thats because mechanical car washes use just a fraction of the 
water used by the average motorist with a hose and bucket in the 
driveway as little as 15 gallons per car as opposed to 50 gallons 
used by homeowners

after tackling the 50th anniversary of the 
golden gate bridge a public relations company has taken on the 
enormous task of coordinating press coverage of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs visit for free 
other local companies donated eight extra phone lines and four 
extra facsimile machines to help the pbn cos staff field requests 
from more than 1000 media organizations who want credentials for 
more than 3000 journalists 
its hopping pbn founder peter necarsulmer said friday 
unlike the 1987 golden gate bridge celebration which took more 
than a year to plan and earned pbn 600000 necarsulmer said he 
learned of the gorbachev visit less than two weeks ago 
he hopes the event will bring the company exposure and more than 
compensate for the long free hours if pbn were paid for this job 
he said the fee would run very very well into the six figures 
the work was going far better than i think anyone couldve 
anticipated he said noting that the federal government city 
officials the white house news media and security forces were 
cooperating well 
veteran journalists said the real test of pbns 24member staff 
will be monday when gorbachevs schedule includes coffee with 
former president ronald reagan a quick trip to stanford university 
a formal luncheon with business leaders in san francisco and a 
possible meeting with south korean president roh taewoo 
they seem to be doing okay said san francisco examiner 
deputy metro editor don thornton there seems to be so many 
changes and fixes its been a nightmare for us 
theyve got an impossible job said thornton so far 
theyre meeting the challenge well know monday 
theyve got a lot more to lose than gain 
about 20 people from rival public relations agencies volunteered 
their time to help plan gorbachevs visit 
its amazing said pbn account assistant amy pew people 
just really wanted to work on this 
sleep has been hard to come by 
i got some last night i think i got two hours said 
necarsulmer but im feeling good i have enough adrenaline to get 
me through to tuesday morning which is why i more than anyone 
else hope the gorbachevs make their plane monday night 
not everyone will get press credentials small pools of reporters 
and photographers will be allowed to cover events leaving others to 
watch on closedcircuit television 
you wont believe how many photographers will claim they work 
for life magazine said necarsulmer

president bush and mikhail s gorbachev hit 
lastminute snags on a landmark nuclear weapons agreement friday as 
the soviet leader pressed fervently for us concessions on trade 
nevertheless they were ready to sign an agreement slashing chemical 
weapon stockpiles 
the unexpected impediments to the arms agreement marred an 
outwardly friendly summit and spokesmen said they were hopeful the 
problems could be worked out secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze were called in to 
troubleshoot 
the second day of superpower summitry appeared marked by tough 
bargaining by gorbachev missing from a white house list of 
agreements to be signed were the arms accord a grainsale agreement 
sought by american farmers and the trade treaty that gorbachev wants 
senate republican leader bob dole who met with gorbachev said 
the soviet leader desperately wants some give on the trade side 
however he said congress was equally insistent that lithuania must 
win freedom from moscow before making economic concessions 
i think he feels that if he doesnt get it hes going home 
emptyhanded dole said gorbachev besieged by mounting economic 
problems said a gesture on trade would be useful for him at home 
both sides expressed confidence that the outlines of an agreement 
for the firstever reductions in longrange nuclear weapons would be 
signed before the summit ends on sunday 
bush and gorbachev themselves hinted at difficulties after their 
morning talks but their relaxed demeanor gave no indication of 
major stumbling blocks 
we always have complications but we measure it not by the glass 
as halfempty or the glass is half full bush said at his side 
gorbachev said they had made a lot of progress 
despite problems with a strategic weapons pact the leaders were 
ready to sign the separate accord imposing a halt in production of 
chemical weapons and requiring the two nations to cut their poison 
gas stockpiles to 5000 tons each 
bush and gorbachev also were unable to make progress on cutting 
troops and nonnuclear weapons in europe they issued a statement 
declaring early conclusion of an agreement was essential to 
the future stability and security of the continent 
bush had initially hoped to extract a commitment from gorbachev 
at this weeks summit on conventional arms cutbacks but differences 
between the two sides remained 
on a related front sources said gorbachev trying to break a 
stalemate had proposed creation of a new council of all europe 
to play a decisive role in shaping the military future of germany 
the united states and the soviet union would participate in the 
deliberations along with other members of the nato and warsaw pact 
alliances as well as neutral countries 
a us official said we are prepared to work with it it is 
not something we would reject out of hand the idea will be 
considered by top diplomatic aides in copenhagen and berlin later 
this month 
the second day of summitry was punctuated by gorbachev scolding 
congressional leaders for stalling trade benefits for moscow 
we are not asking for a free ride gorbachev said he said it 
would be humilitating to beg for concessions 
a trade treaty would be a politically important symbol for 
gorbachev burdened by deepening economic woes us officials said 
the soviets were holding hostage an agreement to buy american grain 
a boost to us farmers as a bargaining chip for the trade deal 
gorbachev said a gesture from the united states on trade would be 
especially politically useful for him at home the united states 
wants the soviets to ease pressure on breakaway lithuania and 
guarantee protection for jewish emigration 
by itself a trade agreement has little value however it is 
part of a package leading to mostfavorednation trade status which 
would drastically reduce us tariffs on soviet goods 
the superpower summit was spiced with colorful sideshows barbara 
bush and raisa gorbachev were cheered at wellesley college 
commencement exercises and gorbachev once again stopped his 
entourage to work the noonhour crowds on a brilliant sunny day 
both women spoke of traditional values at wellesley mrs bush 
whose selection as a graduation speaker had irritated some students 
counseled them to put family and friends first in their lives mrs 
gorbachev said women have a special mission of peacemaking 
humanism mercy and kindness 
gorbachev began the day by confronting some of his toughest 
critics in washington congressional leaders unhappy over moscows 
coercion of lithuania the baltic republic struggling for 
independence televised live across america it was a freewheeling 
exchange over trade german unity lithuania and soviet economic 
reforms 
gorbachev took the offensive he said bush was too rigid about 
insisting that a unified germany be a member of nato and rejected 
any suggestion that he was politically weak thats not serious 
he said 
this is a genuine revolution gorbachev told the lawmakers 
some of whom have expressed doubts that he will survive please 
dont be frightened because you can frighten us too if you get 
frightened 
extolling his economic reforms gorbachev said increased trade 
with the west would be an important step toward a free market system 
in the soviet union 
however gorbachev lectured im not going to ask for anything 
to beg for anything certainly we are not asking for a free 
ride we will be asking for normal credits and of course we will be 
paying and paying the interest for us it would humiliating if we 
were to ask to beg for something from you 
when congressmen pressed him on lithuania gorbachev pointed out 
that china had received mostfavorednation status despite the 
bloody crackdown in tiananmen square a year ago maybe we should 
introduce martial rule in the baltics he said sarcastically 
the agreement on strategic weapons the deadliest arms in the 
superpowers arsenals has been under negotiation for eight years 
it would be the first to reduce longrange nuclear arms previous 
agreements set overall limits but still allowed more weapons to be 
made 
even after both sides initial a treaty outline the superpowers 
will face months of tedious negotiations over details to satisfy 
lawyers in each country 
overall both sides would agree to destroy about a third of their 
longrange nuclear weapons over seven years 
the chemical weapons pact would require the united states to 
destroy about 20000 tons of its stockpile and mandate a 45000 ton 
reduction by the soviet union the united states also would be 
required to stop producing poison gas the soviet union already has 
stopped 
along with the arms agreements there also were accords expanding 
air travel between the united states and soviet union increasing 
student exchanges and making it easier for commercial ships to 
deliver goods to ports in one anothers country 
there was an agreement for closer cooperation on atomic energy 
and another to open reciprocal cultural and information centers in 
washington and moscow

federal health officials said friday they 
support a drug prevention program that focuses on changing the way 
communities view drug use legal and illegal rather than merely 
telling youngsters to say no 
this program is unique because it utilizes all components in 
the community schools parents the media and community groups 
which contribute to changing the social norms for drug use and 
providing a healthy drugfree environment for all people said 
charles r schuster director of the national institute on drug 
abuse 
schusters agency helped pay for an evaluation of the midwestern 
drug abuse prevention research project a justcompleted fiveyear 
study in kansas city and indianapolis by researchers from the 
university of southern california 
researchers began tracking 5500 teenagers when they were in the 
sixth and seventh grades in 50 kansas city schools and studied a 
similar group at 57 schools in indiana 
among the major findings 
36 percent of the students who participated in the program now 
high school juniors and seniors said they drank alcohol in the last 
month while 501 percent of those not in the program admitted the 
same behavior 
241 percent of the participating students smoked cigarettes in 
the last month compared with 32 percent of those who didnt receive 
the programs prevention messages 
142 percent of the program students smoked marijuana in the 
past month compared with 202 percent of those in a control group 
a preliminary analysis of eight of the study schools found that 
16 percent of the program students used cocaine in the last month 
compared with 37 percent of those not in the program 
schuster said if the same percentage difference on cocaine use 
were applied nationally it would mean 500000 fewer teenagers were 
using cocaine 
mary ann pentz one of the university of california researchers 
said reducing alcohol use among teenagers was the most challenging 
because its more widely accepted in society than tobacco or illegal 
drugs 
probably how to resist drugs is not as simple as just saying 
no she said 
another researcher c anderson johnson said a key to reducing 
harmful drug use is to engineer a shift in the perception of 
social sanctions especially among peers in other words how 
will your friends respond 
he said teenagers often dont have a clear idea of the degree to 
which their peers respond to drug use and that one of the many 
facets of the program tried in kansas city and indianapolis was to 
use classroom exercises to bring about a consensus of how drug use 
is viewed

an artist friday offered to change the title of 
his sculpture hunky steelworker and the festival displaying it 
agreed quieting criticism by steelworkers and ethnic groups 
offended by the name 
the 12foottall statue is the most prominently displayed 
sculpture in the three rivers arts festival which opened downtown 
friday 
croatians and other eastern europeans in western pennsylvanias 
steel towns consider the term hunky a slur 
its not the art its just the word hunky said john p 
plesh secretarytreasurer of the croatian fraternal union the 
statue is nice 
the stocky fiberglass statue erected last month at point state 
park wears a dour expression and a rustcolored hat and stands in 
front of a large fountain it is to be on display until the festival 
ends june 17 
the citys controller noticed the title while jogging and held a 
news conference next to the statue last week to decry the use of 
what he considers an ethnic insult 
the artist luis jimenez of hondo nm said friday he had hired 
a fiberglass company to scour the word hunky from the base of 
the statue 
the term originated in the late 1800s to describe people of 
hungarian descent but its use was expanded quickly as an insult 
toward anyone whose ancestors came from central europe said sarah 
thomason a professor of linguistics at the university of pittsburgh 
many eastern europeans emigrated to pittsburgh around the turn of 
the century to work in the citys dozens of steel mills 
ms thomason said the term is similar in origin as honky 
which some blacks have used to describe whites 
jimenez said no offense was intended 
i was trying to pay homage to the men who worked at the steel 
mills jimenez said millhunk was a term i had come across in 
my research at the library 
six organizations who protested the title issued a statement 
thanking jimenez for changing the title 
we thank luis jimenez for his sensitive handling of this 
situation said mediator ann begler reading a statement from the 
groups by offering to cover the word hunky he has made his 
sculpture a real tribute to steelworkers of all backgrounds in this 
region 
jimenez said the decision wasnt difficult after realizing the 
magnitude of the flap 
there is a portion of the community who was upset and there are 
some wounds there jimenez said titles of sculptures are meant 
only as a guide to the work not as the work itself he said 
when the artist was making his original statements we 
supported him and when he wanted to change that we allowed him to 
do that said jeanne pearlman executive director of the festival 
fraternal groups representing croatians poles blacks and other 
minorities said the matter benefited the community by prompting them 
to work together the pennsylvania heritage affairs commission and 
the united steelworkers union also signed the statement 
the artist was the most amenable about the whole thing mr 
jimenez made the issue easy for resolution said steelworkers 
spokesman gary hubbard 
jimenez said he was disappointed with the response to his work 
i wanted to raise certain issues about the contributions 
steelworkers have made i hoped it would be viewed with a sense of 
pride jimenez said

soviet president mikhail gorbachev received 
five humanitarian awards from varied us groups friday and said the 
recognition is a great incentive to me in what im doing 
it is said that facetoface sometimes you cannot see the face 
and that the big things are seen from a distance gorbachev said 
during one of the lowkey presentations in an ornate room at the 
soviet embassy we value highly that you have seen something from 
a distance 
speaker after speaker addressing dignitaries and celebrities 
packed sardinestyle in the small gilded and paneled room said 
gorbachev has proved that one person can change the course of 
history 
as he sat impassive in a brocade chair they called him creative 
courageous and visionary they said he had shattered the cold 
war brought freedom to eastern europe and inspired epic 
reforms in his own country 
your name will be forever identified with the worlds leaders 
who have fearlessly sought peace justice and a better life for all 
of the peoples of the earth said william j vanden heuvel 
president of the franklin and eleanor roosevelt institute 
gorbachev who spoke in a low subdued voice without notes after 
receiving each award said he felt very emotional i understand my 
role and my mission in my land and with my people he said and 
nothing will let me deviate from that course to which i am 
committed 
the issue of lithuanian secession did not come up during the 
ceremonies and officials of the groups making the awards said 
gorbachevs response to that crisis has not shaken their faith in 
him 
hans janitschek of friends world college which gave him a peace 
prize said one or two board members wondered what would happen if 
gorbachev were to move into lithuania with troops 
i assured them he would not do that janitschek said this 
is exactly why he is being honored he is not using violence if 
we had assumed that he could do this our whole concept of proposing 
him for the award would have been wrong 
as for the economic embargo against lithuania he said we 
dont regard that as violence as regrettable as it is 
vanden heuvel a former deputy ambassador to the united nations 
said lithuania will ultimately benefit from gorbachevs policies 
just as did the countries of eastern europe 
we believe that president gorbachev is for the independence of 
lithuania he said its a matter of time and procedure 
these are the awards gorbachev received 
the albert einstein peace prize a 50000 award which once went 
to the late human rights champion andrei sakharov there was no 
immediate word on what gorbachev would do with the money it was 
presented by former arms negotiator paul warnke who joked that 
never in my wildest dreams did he think he would ever have a 
chance to give a check to the leader of the soviet union 
the franklin delano roosevelt freedom medal for promotion of 
fdrs four freedoms freedom of speech and expression freedom 
of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear vanden heuvel 
and author norman cousins presented the medal 
the martin luther king jr nonviolent peace prize for 1991 from 
the king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta coretta 
scott king presented a 1000 check and a medallion bearing kings 
words and likeness 
the man of history award from the appeal of conscience 
foundation a group of religious and business leaders the award was 
a steuben glass crystal presented by rabbi arthur schneier after he 
pronounced a blessing on gorbachev 
the martin luther king jr international peace award from 
friends world college a small quaker school in new york the award 
a silver sculpture of a dove encircling the globe once went to

sinhalese extremists have been killed the government blamed many of 
the deaths on progovernment vigilante groups

president rafael angel calderon 
announced an austerity plan that will slash government expenses and 
raise rates for public services to help bring down the deficit 
in a nationwide radio and television broadcast late wednesday 
calderon said the government deficit has rise to more than 320 
million this year more than 6 percent of the gross domestic product 
of this central american country of 29 million residents 
this massive deficit forces us to take necessary although 
hard measures to avoid the painful tax of inflation he said 
the government austerity policy will reduce spending by 70 
million this year he said forcing an increase in the price of 
fuel electricity water and telephone services 
to help reduce the impact of some of the price hikes a food 
assistance plan and other aid programs will be increased he said 
since taking office may 8 calderon has made reducing the deficit 
a main priority in 1989 under president oscar arias the deficit 
was about 220 million or 4 percent of the gross domestic product 
inflation was 99 percent in 1989 according to the government 
private economists say it could reach 20 percent for this year 
calderon has claimed the 1989 inflation rate released by the 
government was kept artificially low because it was an election year

south koreans are applauding the first 
meeting between a south korean and a soviet leader as a milestone 
that will spur dramatic new dialogue with communist north korea 
presidents roh taewoo and mikhail s gorbachev are to meet in 
san francisco next monday after gorbachev ends summit talks with 
president bush 
seoul and moscow have no diplomatic relations the meeting was in 
the works for at least two months and has the blessing of the us 
government news reports said 
roh said the talks will be aimed at helping end hostility on the 
korean peninsula bitterly divided since 1945 into communist north 
and capitalist south koreans hope eased tensions will lead to 
unification 
the border between the two koreas is sealed and more than 1 
million troops are deployed behind barbed wire on either side 
washington and moscow have exerted pressure on their respective 
allies in seoul and north koreas capital of pyongyang to pursue 
dialogue little progress has been made 
since there is no way opened for me to go to pyongyang i have 
to go there by way of moscow said roh 
in seoul the stock market shot up on news of the rohgorbachev 
meeting a soviet trade show was flooded with koreans as intent on 
buying vodka as inspecting technology political leaders and 
editorials hailed the meeting as an extraordinary moment in korean 
history 
north korea released a statement monitored in tokyo suggesting 
it may end its boycott of dialogue with south korea it said the 
only way of solving the question of national unification in a 
peaceful way is to develop dialogue 
rohs popularity which plunged in recent months due to labor 
unrest and economic worries overnight appeared to rise 
i believe the meeting will bring an epochal change in 
relations between south and north korea said kim daejung head 
of the leading opposition party for peace and democracy i welcome 
it as a sign of great progress 
kim youngsam the leader of the governing democratic justice 
party who met gorbachev in moscow last march predicted a major 
breakthrough will be made in relations between the two countries 
kim also said the soviet union was expected to exercise 
influence upon the north to adopt an opendoor or reformist policy 
the projected summit will mark a historic milestone in the 
development of the koreansoviet relationship that was never dreamed 
of only a few months ago the korea times said 
the dissident united national movement for democracy said that 
isolating north korea could delay unification and urged roh to 
discuss total withdrawal of nuclear arms and foreign troops from the 
peninsula 
radicals and dissidents demand withdrawal of 43000 us troops 
based in south korea saying their presence hinders dialogue on 
unification north korea demands the united states withdraw nuclear 
weapons it says are kept in south korea 
the meeting represents the culmination of south koreas 
northern policy which is aimed at fostering ties with communist 
nations able to influence north korea 
the talks come at a time when economic ties between seoul and 
moscow are rapidly increasing their twoway trade doubled to 600 
million last year 
korean news reports said former us secretary of state george 
shultz and anatoly dobrynin former soviet ambassador in washington 
and a personal adviser to gorbachev helped arrange the talks

republican leadership backed a 
black candidate for lieutenant governor friday in a raucous news 
conference disrupted by his primary election opponent a white 
supremacist 
kenneth muskie harris a black who forced ralph forbes into a 
june 12 runoff for the nomination said forbes lied this week when 
he said harris supports womens rights to have abortions 
whos lining up behind my opponent harris said while 
flanked by bob leslie gop national committeeman three republican 
politicians and two members of arkansas prolife groups the kkk 
the nazis i dont see anyone 
forbes a white supremacist and former american nazi leader who 
won 46 percent of the vote in the gop primary tuesday says he 
doesnt think blacks and whites belong in the same government 
i believe that racial separation is ultimately the right 
answer forbes said thursday 
another avowed racist who served prison time for bombing a 
black church is running for lieutenant governor as a democrat in 
georgia jb stoner has prompted debate among fellow candidates 
over whether to boycott forums he attends 
and in louisiana david duke a former ku klux klan grand wizard 
who last year was elected to the state house in an upset is seeking 
the gop nomination for us senate the house this week passed a 
bill sponsored by duke that would ban affirmative action 
when forbes appeared at the news conference friday leslie said 
the conference room at a north little rock bank was reserved for 
harris and refused to allow forbes to follow his opponent at the 
podium 
forbes then went in the hallway and stood in front of the 
elevators to answer questions he said he still speaks at nazi and 
ku klux klan gatherings 
im an american nationalist you burn the american flag and 
ill stop you thats right call me a nazi fine just spell my 
name right forbes told reporters 
youre a nazi said robert jespersen standing behind a mass 
of reporters jespersen later said he is a little rock lawyer and 
former marine who happened to be in the building 
i said im an american nationalist youre right forbes 
responded 
youre a nazi jespersen said youre a member of the 
american nazi party 
im an american nationalist youre right forbes said 
i dont think its time for the republican party to have a nazi 
run their platform jespersen said 
earlier harris insisted he supports the republican platform on 
abortion he read from the platform which says an unborn child has 
a fundamental right to life later harris said he supported 
abortion only in the cases of incest and rape 
forbes said harris made prochoice statements at a lieutenant 
governors debate that got little media attention may 10 darrell 
glascock a democratic candidate for lieutenant governor who lost 
the primary said later friday that he also heard harris give a 
prochoice statement 
but both glascock and forbes confirmed that glascock was 
considering being forbes campaign manager i like him and his 
family glascock said adding that he wasnt sure yet if he agreed 
with forbes politics thats what im looking at now 
later in the day forbes had a questionnaire delivered to the 
associated press in which harris answered in favor of abortions on 
demand harris said he couldnt remember filling out the form for 
the lakeside baptist church at hot springs he said he must have 
accidentally put an x under the yes column for a question 
about abortion on demand 
im right in line with george bush on the abortion issue he 
said 
forbes said he will protect white and black unborn children 
equally

as if testifying in his own defense president 
mikhail s gorbachev held forth for an hourandhalf friday 
answering congressional questioners on everything from the 
lithuanian embargo to the price of soviet bread 
he reasoned with them cajoled lectured confessed and just 
hours after his stunning televised performance he won from 
president bush the trade agreement he had hoped to take home from 
the summit 
it is still subject to congressional approval and the lawmakers 
suggested that wouldnt come easily as long as the soviet embargo on 
lithuania remains in effect 
the pact wouldnt have an instant impact gorbachev told the 
lawmakers he had invited to breakfast at the soviet embassy but it 
would open the way for american business people to participate in 
the soviet unions economic development 
you should do some rethinking of how to act so as not to impede 
trade he told the leaders arguing that a soviet union which is 
weak torn by complexes and problems and turmoil is more 
threatening to the united states than a dynamic soviet state that 
is open to the outside world 
he admitted that when he launched perestroika five years ago he 
thought he could fix the communist system with some tinkering such 
as adding private cooperatives and permitting farm leasing but it 
didnt work 
really we were being very naive he said in our system 
it was just impossible there was no incentive there was no 
motivation for people to work 
but to change the economic system he said he had to institute 
democracy to create pressure on the authorities to change 
that proved so effective that in some regions the entire 
ruling structures were swept aside by the political wave and the 
old system was dismantled before a new one could be put in place 
our ship has lost anchor and therefore were all a little 
sick the president said describing the present confusion and 
turmoil in his country he said that if the government doesnt move 
quickly to establish the new marketoriented economy he has 
proposed the whole society will suffer 
gorbachev laid out for his congressional audience the enormity of 
his task involving creation of new forms of ownership including 
private property once considered anathema to communists 
we need competitiveness in our economy and that is why we will 
be adopting laws on entrepreneurship on small and mediumsize 
business we do not have a system of markets we do not have systems 
of stock exchanges monetary or labor exchanges so we have to be 
developing an entire infrastucture for the market 
tripling the price of bread even before the market is in place as 
an unpopular step he conceded but he insisted that bread is so 
cheap and plentiful in the soviet union that kids play football 
with loaves of bread feed bread to cattle and its really 
outrageous 
congress has urged president bush not to sign a trade agreement 
with the soviet union until it lifts its embargo of lithuania which 
has declared its independence 
in an exhaustive account of the lithuanian crisis and his efforts 
to solve it gorbachev said the lithuanian parliament had rushed its 
own election process and staged a nighttime coup detat to 
secede from the union 
similar pressures exist in many soviet republics he said and 
lithuania cant be dealt with alone ignoring its own minority 
nationalities and territorial claims by other republics 
gorbachev described himself as taking a conciliatory stance 
willing to negotiate with the lithuanians and work out procedures 
for eventual independence but he insisted the republic must submit 
to a popular referendum and respect the rights of its ethnic 
minorities including russians and poles 
he chided congress for permitting bush to invade panama 
suggesting that move also was unconstitutional and failed to respect 
the popular will of the panamanians 
sen george j mitchell dmaine interrupted with a retort that 
there are very significant differences in the two situations and 
suggesting the lithuanian declaration like the panama invasion 
had overwhelming popular support 
all right all right he said fine fine fine let them 
do it and well agree but only through a constitutional process 
asked to explain why the soviet legislature had not yet adopted a 
law liberalizing emigration gorbachev protested that the us 
congress was getting too deeply involved in his countrys domestic 
affairs 
this is a matter of dignity this is a matter of prestige this 
is a matter of sovereignty and national dignity so please be 
careful about this he said but he went on to answer the 
question saying the emigration law has been adopted on first 
reading its provisions are in effect if you look at the 
reality of the situation its provisions are in effect the flow of 
emigres from soviet union is practically not braked you know that 
this is no longer a problem 
he suggested congress was looking for a pretext in order to put 
a brake on this process of adopting mostfavorednation treatment 
that would lower tariff barriers for soviet products sold in the 
united states 
asked how congress could help gorbachev pleaded for a 
favorable gesture on trade and he asked for extension of credit 
to finance joint ventures and the conversion to a market economy 
making it easier for us during this difficult period he 
promised to start paying back the money within seven years 
he accused the united states of applying a double standard by 
withholding mfn status from the soviet union while granting it to 
china after the crushing of the democratic movement in tiananmen 
square 
maybe we should introduce presidential rule in the baltics and 
at least fire some rounds he suggested wryly

here are some key comments friday from the 
summit between president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the world has waited long enough the cold war must end 
we always have complications but we measure it not by the 
glass is halfempty or the glass is half full 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i think what is happening now represents an event of 
momentous importance not only for our two countries but for the 
world 
we are not asking for a free ride 
in our system it was just impossible there was no incentive 
there was no motivation for people to work 
our ship has lost anchor and therefore were all a little 
sick

the united states will not give new trade benefits while the 
soviet noose continues to strangle lithuania 
</TEXT>

somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one 
day follow in my footsteps and preside over the white house as the 
presidents spouse i wish him well 
i simply feel very at home and comfortable with mrs gorbachev 
and i have enormous respect for her 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i particularly rejoice at the fact that our conversations are 
extremely open sincere and friendly and despite the fact that we 
might have differences that does not change the tone 
if people in the world today are more confident of a peaceful 
future we have to give a good deal of credit for that to women

in addition president gorbachev and i are issuing a joint 
statement recording major agreed provisions of a strategic arms 
reduction treaty as well as a joint statement in which we agree to 
future negotiations on nuclear and space arms designed to enhance 
stability and reduce the risk of war 
were also issuing a statement on the conventional armed forces 
in europe committing us to intensify the pace of the vienna 
negotiations and to reach rapid agreement on all outstanding issues 
you see we agree that a conventional armed forces treaty is an 
indispensable foundation for the future of european security 
there are many other agreements the united states is signing or 
announcing during this summit agreements that represent hard work 
and a lasting achievement not just by our governments but also for 
the peoples 
for example an agreement to establish a ussoviet park across 
the bering strait this park will preserve the unique natural 
environmental and cultural heritage of the bering sea region of 
alaska and siberia just as a bridge of land once joined our two 
continents so let a bridge of hope now reach across the water to 
join our two peoples in this spirit of peaceful cooperation 
in that same spirit president gorbachev and ill sign an 
agreement that realizes our malta objective of expanding 
undergraduate exchanges by 1000 students on both sides 
allowing more of our young people to experience firsthand each 
others culture and politics to live as friends and out of simple 
acts of friendship a profound revelation eventually arises the 
people of the world have more in common than they have in conflict 
in just a few moments secretary of state baker and foreign 
minister shevardnadze will also sign four important new agreements 
concerning maritime boundaries ocean studies civil aviation and a 
longterm grains agreement 
minister shevardnadze and transportation secretary skinner will 
sign a fifth agreement on maritime transportation and president 
gorbachev and i are also signing a commercial agreement and are 
looking forward to the passage of a soviet emigration law 
president gorbachev i am very gratified by what weve 
accomplished over the last few days and determined to build on this 
solid foundation the agreements we record today and those yet to 
come will advance the cause of peace agreements in the best 
interests of both our nations and all nations 
not long ago some believed that the weight of history condemned 
our two great countries our two great peoples to permanent 
confrontation well you and i must challenge history make new 
strides build a relationship of enduring cooperation 
we may not agree on everything and indeed we dont agree on 
everything but we believe in one great truth and the world has 
waited long enough the cold war must end and so today with 
gratitude in my heart for all those on the soviet side and the 
united states side that worked so hard at all levels to bring these 
agreements to fruition i say lets renew our pledge and build a 
more peaceful world applause 
president gorbachev mr president ladies and gentlemen 
comrades first of all i would like to thank president george bush 
for presenting so well the results of our work that we have been 
doing over these days in washington so i have a problem what 
shall i talk about laughter

congressional leaders said friday they cannot 
approve soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs request for favored 
trade status even if president bush should do so until moscow 
relaxes pressure against freedomminded lithuania 
hours later bush and gorbachev signed a trade agreement that 
would be a step toward granting the soviet union mostfavorednation 
status but white house officials said the agreement would not be 
sent to congress for ratification until the soviet union enacts a 
law protecting jewish emigration the price bush has set all along 
for granting the broader tarifflowering trade status 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said after the 
signing ceremony the granting of mfn status in my mind is in 
mr gorbachevs hands he can achieve it with some rather modest 
changes in his policy toward the baltic states 
anything we do needs to come with some strings attached said 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo one of a dozen 
members of congress gorbachev invited for a 90minute meeting at the 
soviet embassy 
gorbachev used the occasion which was broadcast live on 
television to argue that freer trade between the superpowers would 
be in the interests of both countries and to chide congress for 
linking mostfavorednation trading status to resolution of the 
lithuanian situation a connection the bush administration also has 
made 
but the leaders appeared to be unmoved saying human rights 
issues could not be separated from any concession on trade we 
have a political problem too said senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan afterward 
as if to illustrate that about 1500 lithuanianamericans 
rallied on the steps of the capitol waving green yellow and red 
lithuanian flags and signs such as one that read gorbachev is a 
big bully 
the united states will not give new trade benefits while the 
soviet noose continues to strangle lithuania said sen alfonse 
damato rny who spoke to the rally but was not among those 
invited to the soviet embassy 
gephardt and the others at the meeting with gorbachev took a 
gentler line saying they recognized the soviet presidents efforts 
to resolve lithuanias status we want it done peacefully said 
gephardt we recognize that everybody cant get everything they 
want 
i dont think any of us believes that all of the issues have to 
be finally and successfully concluded before we can do anything on a 
trade negotiation he said but we do need to see some 
substantial progress 
any suggestion by bush to advance mfn status would be seriously 
considered on capitol hill gephardt added i think its 
conceivable that in this year we could deal with an mfn 
suggestion 
dole agreed that strong personal assurances from gorbachev on 
lithuanian independence and free emigration might be enough for 
congress to make some gesture in return 
members want some fairly ironclad assurances that independence 
will happen dole said adding that he got the impression that 
gorbachev desperately wants some give on the trade side 
democrats in the group also reacted favorably to a gorbachev 
remark questioning why president bush had recommended 
mostfavorednation status to china which just a year ago crushed a 
prodemocracy movement but was withholding the same treatment from 
the soviet union 
that exposed the total inconsistency of president bushs 
position said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
who has been among bushs harshest congressional critics on china 
policy 
the leaders indicated that another requirement for favored trade 
status free emigration particularly for soviet jews has largely 
been met and is no longer a serious obstacle but mitchell and 
gephardt added a new one a measure of success in establishing free 
markets 
the central requirement is reform of the economy mitchell 
said favored trading status alone will not increase us demand for 
soviet products many of which are seen as inferior he said adding 
that mfn status would be primarily of symbolic value to gorbachev 
for his part the soviet leader said he was not asking for 
charity from the united states only for normal credits which would 
be repaid and for what he called a new trade relationship that would 
benefit both countries 
this is a genuine revolution gorbachev told the lawmakers as 
they sat around a long table covered with green felt 
we have to turn around our brains as it were he said 
this is a most difficult turnaround to make here too we hope we 
will find a mutual understanding and you will be able to find 
certain ways of supporting us so that we could interact

so i think that i will do some thinking aloud in this context i 
would say that maybe this room has seen many important events and 
many agreements signed but i think that what is happening now and 
what you have listed as the results of our work together represents 
an event of momentous importance not only for our two countries but 
for the world 
president franklin d roosevelt half a century ago spoke of a 
world in which four essential freedoms will triumph freedom of 
speech freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear 
and this ideal has not yet been attained in the world and it could 
not be attained in the world of animosity and confrontation 
and therefore while liberating the world from fear we are making 
steps toward a new world and this is the important work of our two 
nations of our two peoples 
what is very important i think is that we do not just declare 
our commitment to moving toward a healthier international 
environment toward better international relations toward a 
nonviolent world 
we are taking practical steps in that direction and what you 
have just listed and what well be signing during this visit i 
think is a confirmation that both our declarations are right in that 
they seek to justify the hopes of our peoples and that were also 
taking those practical steps 
the important steps that we are taking today illustrate the 
degree of agreement between our two countries despite the fact that 
and here i quite agree with you that there are things on which 
we disagree and there are differing views that we have on certain 
questions but that area of disagreement is being narrowed in the 
course of our work together 
what we will be signing i think is the best demonstration that 
we are ready to participate at the level of our responsibility in 
building a new civilization 
there are still many difficult challenges awaiting us

pushing the button this time three warner executives have that 
honor 
partygoers will see stage 16 the nations tallest sound stage at

celebrating the fruits of their summit 
diplomacy president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
signed a sheaf of agreements friday including a conditional trade 
accord the leaders also embraced a preliminary deal to cut 
longrange nuclear arms 
the trade accord was thought to hinge in part on lithuania but 
secretary of state james a baker said the only condition was a 
loosening of soviet emigration laws thought to be imminent 
congress must approve any agreement however and baker 
acknowledged that passage could be difficult unless gorbachev starts 
a new dialogue with independenceminded lithuanian officials 
the centerpiece arms agreement banning chemical arms production 
was a foregone conclusion however significant but lasthour 
negotiating was necessary to settle differences on a framework for 
strategic arms cuts and a fiveyear grain deal 
gorbachev told the president and the leaders of his 
administration that a strategic arms reduction treaty can be signed 
before the end of this year even though it is difficult 
the two leaders also agreed to strive for an elusive agreement on 
reduction of troops tanks and other conventional weapons in europe 
bush said the statement they signed on that negotiation commits both 
sides to intensify the pace of the talks gorbachev said that 
deal too should be completed this year 
referring to american reaction to gorbachevs crackdown on 
lithuanian independence efforts gorbachev said i am pleased to 
note that the turbulent developments in recent months after malta 
have not led us astray from the goals we set together 
baker the commercial trade agreement will not go to congress 
until the the soviet emigration law is passed thus 
mostfavorednation status awaits soviet approval for more liberal 
travel abroad 
even though administration officials have said in the past that 
the crisis in lithuania had a bearing on the trade agreement white 
house spokesman roman popadiuk said there has been no direct link 
between lithuania and trade 
from twin lecterns the two presidents spoke of what they had 
done and what they hope to do i think what is happening now 
represents an event of momentous importance not only for our two 
countries but for the world gorbachev said 
he praised bush for his efforts to reach the accords and improve 
ussoviet relations i am human in the sense that im 
emotional gorbachev said in the applause that followed the two 
leaders shook hands once then did so again as aides brought on the 
chairs to seat them for the signing 
until friday noon it was thought the missiles and grain were all 
set for signatures but spokesmen indicated otherwise 
secretary of state james baker and soviet foreign minister eduard 
schevardnadze led negotiating teams that talked throughout the 
afternoon to settle differences on the intricately linked agreements 
especially trade grain and strategic arms 
here are details of the agreements signed friday evening 
a framework accord on the major elements of a strategic arms 
reduction talks or start treaty to reduce each sides arsenal of 
longrange nuclear weapons by about onethird over a 7year period 
negotiating teams were still trying to work out some details friday 
afternoon 
the push for a missiles treaty is designed to enhance stability 
and reduce the threat of war bush said 
an accord ending production of us and soviet chemical weapons 
and eliminating all but 5000 tons of their existing chemical 
stockpiles the deal is meant as a catalyst for a global agreement 
to ban production and possession of these weapons 
let this landmark agreement quickly lead to a global ban 
bush said 
a protocol spelling out anticheating measures for existing 
treaties that limit nuclear tests the verification protocol will 
permit both nations to ratify the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and 
the 1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty which limit us and 
soviet underground nuclear tests to 150 kilotons

gov bill clements said friday he would 
approve a sales tax increase as part of a 530 million deal with 
legislative leaders on school financing reform reversing his stance 
of the past three months 
at the same time a judge held a hearing at which a 
courtappointed master presented his own school finance blueprint 
the result of the state supreme courts ruling last year that the 
school funding system was unconstitutional 
clements house speaker gib lewis and lt gov bill hobby said 
they hoped their deal which includes raising the sales tax from 6 
percent to 625 percent would keep the courts from revamping the 
135 billionayear school financing system 
texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned 
school finance systems in recent years the others are kentucky new 
jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut washington west 
virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
clements lewis and hobby said they believed the legislature 
would approve the pact which followed two days of private talks 
clements said that on monday he would call the legislature into its 
fourth consecutive special session on schools since feb 27 to begin 
considering the agreement 
the republican governor who since february had pledged to veto 
any sales tax increase said the compromise represented concessions 
by him and the democratcontrolled legislature he said he agreed to 
a higher sales tax because he saw no other option 
i can truthfully say that i dont know anybody who is happy 
with this clements said maybe the judge will be it has been a 
very painful process but we did it 
in the hearing friday before state district judge scott mccown 
special master william kilgarlin recommended shifting 540 million 
in state education funds from wealthier school districts to poor 
districts that make a strong effort to raise local property taxes 
in its ruling last year the supreme court ordered more money be 
made available to poor districts 
mccown voiced profound disappointment that lawmakers and 
clements so far had failed to enact a plan if the latest 
legislative deal passes mccown still must give it his approval 
in addition to the sales tax increase the pact calls for budget 
cuts transfers of money from other programs and increases in taxes 
on cigarettes and mixed drinks and higher fees to raise a total of 
more than 630 million said mike toomey the governors chief of 
staff 
of that about 530 million is for school aid about 100 million 
would go to bail out financially strapped programs in the 
departments of health human services and mental health and mental 
retardation toomey said 
raising the sales tax would raise about 2989 million of the 
total according to clements and his aides 
about 1935 million would come from raising the 26cent per pack 
cigarette tax by 15 cents another 432 million would be raised by 
slightly increasing the levy on mixed drinks raising fees to 
replace lost drivers licenses and debt service on state bonds 
issued to help fund the superconducting supercollider project 
the rest of the money about 977 million would be trimmed from 
other parts of the state budget 
you can see we have had a very difficult time raising the 
funds we thought necessary for public education clements said 
clements vetoed a halfcent sales tax increase at the end of the 
second special session then during the third session vetoed the 
actual school reform legislation because it also required a 
halfcent sales tax boost

it is evident that to dismantle that monumental artifact of the 
cold war the accumulated arsenals of mutual destruction is not at 
all a simple or even an entirely safe thing to do the slightest 
imbalance undue haste or lack of equilibrium in this process may 
dangerously destabilize the overall international situation 
but i am sure that if we take a balanced and responsible 
approach if we take into account the concerns and positions of each 
other even when we disagree if we do all that i am sure that we 
will be able to move ahead more resolutely and more vigorously 
mr president you have just mentioned malta mr president i am 
pleased to note that the turbulent developments of recent months 
after malta have not led us astray from the goal we set together 
so i believe that we have passed the first test 
mr president let me reaffirm here something that ive been 
saying to you during our oneonone talks we have had many such 
talks during this summit and i welcome this style of negotiating 
but let me reaffirm to both our peoples that the soviet union is 
committed to the objective set at malta completing before the end 
of this year the preparation of the start treaty i believe that 
this goal is obtainable even though it is difficult 
i also can confirm what you have said that we have agreed that 
during our talks that this year we will seek to sign a treaty at the 
vienna talks and of course we believe that in that case there 
will be the csce european security summit meeting i think we 
already have good results and a good potential to work

the united states and the soviet union on 
friday reached agreement to ban heavy mobile nuclear missiles under 
the treaty they are negotiating on longrange nuclear weapons 
in addition they also agreed on an extensive verification system 
to ensure the reductions in a wide range of deadly weapons are 
carried out 
a joint statement issued at the midpoint of president bushs 
summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev called 
also for acceleration of negotiations in geneva to complete the 
start treaty by the end of the year 
at the white house bush and gorbachev approved the outlines of 
the landmark treaty friday for the firstever cuts in longrange 
nuclear missiles 
secretary of state james a baker iii said that major issues had 
been settled and completion of the treaty by the end of the year was 
likely 
agreement on a ban on heavy mobile missiles marked an expansion 
of the limitations already agreed to in eight years of ussoviet 
talks 
the verification procedure will cover 12 kinds of onsite 
inspections some of them on short notice 
the agreement would prevent the soviets from putting their heavy 
groundbased ss18 missiles on mobile launchers such as trains or 
trucks a senior us official said 
the ban would have no direct impact on current us nuclear 
forces but would prevent the united states from basing any future 
heavy intercontinental missile on mobile launchers 
the official who briefed reporters on details under rules that 
he not be identified said americas mx missile would not be 
restricted in any way under the agreement because it is not 
considered a heavy missile 
among the existing icbms in both nations arsenals only the ss18 
will be included in the banned category 
the farreaching reductions and other constraints contained in 
the treaty will be accompanied by the most thorough and innovative 
verification provisions ever negotiated the ussoviet statement 
said 
baker said both sides had made a commitment in a second round of 
negotiations to make cuts in heavy missiles and those with multiple 
warheads 
on the other hand baker said at a news conference serious 
substantive differences remain on reducing troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear weapons from europe that would not be resolved at the 
summit 
in short i think weve made workmanlike progress across the 
range of ussoviet relations he said 
baker said the negotiations that were conducted since sunday 
expanded on the nuclear weapons categories to be restricted in the 
treaty in addition to adding the limits on mobile missiles he said 
the presidents had reached an agreement on the goals and 
objectives of future negotiations to make even deeper cuts 
particularly in overall numbers of warheads 
still baker said they failed to resolve disagreements over the 
soviet backfire bomber flight tests of heavy groundbased missiles 
and safeguards against the transfer of nuclear weaponry to third 
countries

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev hoisted a 
glass of golden champagne in toast to dinner guest george bush 
friday night shortly after the pair announced a host of agreements 
including the broad outline of a pact to slash stockpiles of 
longrange nuclear missiles 
now that we have recorded the progress we have made said 
gorbachev in an ornate soviet embassy dining hall i would like to 
express the hope the ship of sovietamerican relations will continue 
to sail its course 
returning the compliment president bush extolled the progress of 
the washington summit but he also said that true peace takes more 
than just the laying down of arms it also takes the reaching out of 
hands 
so tight was security for the embassy dinner that large frames of 
bulletproof glass were positioned in front of windows facing the 
busy street outside 
for bush and his wife barbara and a host of topranking us 
government officials gorbachev and his wife raisa broke out their 
countrys best wines to compliment a menu of roast duck suckling 
pig and apple puff pastry 
the tsinandali georgian white dry 1987 and mookoozani georgian 
red dry 1987 renowned in the soviet union were joined on the menu 
by the soviets golden champagne zolotoye 
the soviet embassy dinner came a day after the bushes entertained 
the gorbachevs at a white house state dinner and it also featured 
smoked meat and consomme with dumplings and mushroom cream 
the main course was baked sevrugafish and roast suckling pig 
followed by desert of strawberry parfait fruit and apple puff 
pastry 
the embassy released the menu friday evening after tightly 
holding details in secrecy the practice was even more restrictive 
than the white house procedure of holding details of its state 
dinner until just a few hours before the guests begin arriving 
its just a tradition our leaders dont like to put out an 
official ord on the menu said vladimir ustimenko spokesman for 
the soviet delegation at the summit press center 
a few details were available from soviet press contacts the 
dinner guests would be entertained after coffee by opera singer 
zurab sotkilava and pianist mikhail pletnev 
the 80 guests would be seated in the embassys gold room at seven 
round tables seating 10 each with a head table for top dignitaries 
before dinner guests would gather in the fireplace room for drinks 
dress in contrast to the black tie formal at the white house 
state dinner for the gorbachevs on thursday was simple black 
business suits for men and normal length dresses for women 
that meant no miniskirts a soviet spokesman said 
after dessert and before coffee the soviet and us presidents 
were to deliver their formal toasts which the soviets who have a 
tendency to make lengthy remarks referred to as speeches 
when gorbachev visited in 1987 guests at the embassy dinner 
dined on russian caviar on ice crab meat glace cold suckling pig 
baked bester fish a la muscovite shashlyk of lamb and raspberry 
parfait 
a questioned still unanswered as the dinner hour arrived was who 
were the lucky 40 americans who would join gorbachev and his wife 
and some 40 soviet dinner invitees 
calls to the embassy for the list got repeated busy signals or 
recordings a communist party official who briefed reporters at the 
press center shrugged his shoulders sympathetically but replied i 
dont have a list 
but the white house managed to come up with a fairly complete 
list of the americans invited with spouses 
among the invitees was senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas who turned down an invitation to the soviet embassy dinner 
during gorbachevs 1987 visit when dole was running for the gop 
presidential nomination he went instead to meet with members of the 
state contractors association in manchester nh 
also on the list was industrialist armand hammer a favorite in 
moscow for his many years of business contacts with the soviets 
katharine graham chairman of the board of the washington post co 
duayne andreas the archerdanielsmidland co chairman and pepsico 
inc chairman donald kendall both of whom also were invited to 
wednesdays white house dinner 
others were senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois and businessman 
thomas minor 
in addition vice president dan quayle and his wife marilyn 
planned to attend as did secretary of state james a baker iii 
national security adviser brent scowcroft white house chief of 
staff john sununu treasury secretary nicholas brady gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff ambassador jack 
matlock and state department protocol chief joseph reed

rallying under their national colors 
balticamericans cheered calls on friday for president bush to deny 
favored trade status to the soviet union and bestow it instead on 
lithuania 
we call on our government to recognize the new government in 
vilnius and extend mostfavorednation status not to the ussr 
but to the government of lithuania said aflcio president lane 
kirkland 
some 1500 people many wearing national dress as they stood on 
the capitol steps and lawn applauded and chanted thank you 
thank you 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was a mile down 
pennsylvania avenue conferring with bush at the white house but he 
was much on the minds of the lithuanianamericans 
estonianamericans and latvianamericans who shouted for 
independence for their homelands 
later in the day bush and gorbachev signed an agreement that 
would bring about normal economic relations between the two 
countries us officials said a provision granting lower tariffs on 
soviet products will not go into effect until the soviet legislature 
passes a law providing free emigration 
but the treaty was signed without reference to gorbachevs 
handling of the independence movement in lithuania in recent weeks 
the administration had suggested it might refuse to sign a trade 
agreement unless gorbachev eased up on its economic blockade of the 
baltic republic 
lithuanianamericans protesting friday evening outside the soviet 
embassy said they were disappointed in bushs decision 
i think he should take a stronger stance he should listen to 
the people of the united states said aras tijunelis of chicago 
no concessions should be made until he sees the blockade is being 
lifted and oppression of lithuania is ending 
toward the end of the earlier gathering someone began burning a 
soviet flag but no arrests were made because officers were unable 
to identify anyone responsible said us capitol police spokesman 
off daniel nichols it is illegal to have an open flame on capitol 
grounds nichols said 
crowds were sparse at lafayette park and the ellipse parks just 
north and south of the white house where rallies had been scheduled 
no arrests or violent incidents were reported 
by early afternoon there were about 50 demonstrators in lafayette 
park seeking reunification of korea democracy for vietnam and an 
end to prison camps in the soviet union 
this doesnt touch americans at all michail makarenko who 
said he had been a soviet political prisoner said of the 
bushgorbachev talks its just another film bush will be able to 
use in the next elections 
gorbachev was portrayed on placards at the capitol rally as a boa 
constrictor strangling lithuanian independence as a dispatcher of 
tanks as a fallen angel with a gun at lithuanias head 
mr gorbachev return what was stolen a poster read 
referring to the forced incorporation of the baltic states into the 
soviet union in 1940 
bush makes no deals with terrorists unless theyre russian 
read another 
over the heads of the speakers and the crowd rippled hundreds of 
flags the gold green and red tricolor of lithuania the black 
white and blue of estonia the red white and red stripes of latvia 
mr gorbachev understand that its not good enough for you to 
talk about freedom and democracy when you are depriving the people 
of lithuania of food and energy and medical supplies said sen 
alfonse damato rny 
addressing gorbachev in absentia damato said you may have 
spread gorbymania around the world but you have not fooled the 
american people and there will be no mfn until lithuania is free 
the senate voted 7324 last month to oppose trade concessions for 
the kremlin until the soviet economic blockade is lifted and 
negotiations begin on lithuanian independence

the superpowers are billing their nearly 
completed arms treaty as a step toward ending the arms race but 
private experts said friday its value may be mainly symbolic 
the deal as outlined by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev carries a potent political punch its the 
first treaty to reduce the number of longrange nuclear arms 
but by the time the pact is fully implemented probably in 1998 
analysts say both the united states and the soviet union may be 
nearly asth nuclear arms as they are today unless 
additional treaties are negotiated be well stocked wifore then 
gorbachev and bush failed in a second day of summitry friday to 
settle at least three points of dispute in the proposed treaty but 
they pledged to conclude the deal by the end of the year they also 
agreed to begin negotiating a followup treaty on strategic arms 
once the pending deal is finished 
the military significance of the emerging agreement is diluted by 
decisions to discount or exclude some weapons from the 
counting rules and to leavthe natural resources defense 
council a private research group described the treaty as making a 
virtue of necessity scrapping mostly obsolete weapons while 
permitting both sides to continue building new ones 
everything is allowed just at slightly reduced numbers he 
said 
among the us weapons that are expected to be scrapped under the 
start treaty if completed in its current form and ratified by both 
countries legislatures are minuteman ii intercontinental ballistic 
missiles deployed between 1966 and 1969 and b52g longrange 
bombers built from 1958 to 1960 norris said 
however its not yet clear exactly what combination of weapons 
would be retired in order to remain within starts overall limit on 
ballistic missile warheads of 4900 
the soviets would be expected to retire several types of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles including 154 of their ss18s 
which are the centerpiece of their strategic nuclear force these 
missiles were deployed between 1975 and 1980 
the treaty is expected to allow at least some modernization of 
the remaining ss18s this provision however would be the only one 
in the treaty to put limits on individual weapons as a result both 
sides will be allowed virtually unlimited freedom to develop and 
deploy newer more accurate weapons later this decade 
frank j gaffney jr a critic of the bush administrations 
negotiating efforts on start said signing the deal without banning 
modernization of the ss18 makes a mockery of the 
administrations assertions about the value of the treaty

japan has protested soviet detention of 18 japanese 
fishermen held in one of a series of incidents involving illegal 
salmon fishing in the north pacific the foreign ministry said 
friday 
the protest appeared to be a return salvo in a fishing dispute 
involving japan the soviet union as well as north korea 
spokesman vadim p perfiliev said thursday in moscow that the 
soviet foreign ministry had protested to japan over crude 
violations of treaties that regulate harvest of the rich salmon 
fisheries off soviet asia 
shigeo takenaka a spokesman for japans foreign ministry told 
reporters friday that japan did not dispute the soviets right to 
stop and seize vessels involved in illegal fishing but he said the 
soviets overstepped their powers by confiscating six japanese 
fishing boats and not returning all the crew 
under the japanesesoviet fishing agreement takenaka said 
jurisdiction belongs to the japan side they have to hand over the 
vessels and fishermen to the japan side 
takenaka said the soviets seized six japanese boats with 52 
crewmen in the may 913 period and took them to the soviet island of 
sakhalin north of japan a trial was held each vessel was fined 
530000 to 600000 and the vessels were confiscated he said 
only 34 crew members returned to japan friday while 18 men 
remained in detention he said 
this is from our standpoint a violation of the japansoviet 
fishing cooperation agreement takenaka said he said japan was 
requesting immediate return of the fishermen and vessels 
asked if japan lodged a protest takenaka replied yes we are 
requesting and a protest is the same thing 
he said the soviets also were studying a japanese request for 
early release of 169 japanese crew found on 12 fishing boats flying 
the north korean flag the soviets seized those boats about two 
weeks ago starting an incident that raised eyebrows in japan over 
the unusual partnership between japanese and north korean fishing 
operators 
japan and communist north korea have no diplomatic relations on 
the fishing level however the lure of salmon appears to have drawn 
japanese fishing companies into leasing boats and crews to north 
korea with part of the catch making its way into japanese markets 
soviet diplomatic sources in tokyo say moscow has also protested 
to north korea which is a soviet ally but has no fishing agreement 
with the soviet union japan has an agreement to take 11000 tons of 
salmon originating in soviet rivers 
the sources who demanded anonysmity said the japanese fishermen 
detained on north koreaflag vessels would probably be released next 
week after a trial 
japanese authorities are investigating the deal involving 
japanese boats under north korean flags the fisheries agency said 
it did not give the required permission for such transfers

two masked gunmen killed one british 
soldier and wounded two at the lichfield railway station and hours 
later a british army major was shot dead on saturday in west 
germany the ministry of defense said 
it said maj michael john dillonlee of the royal artillery was 
shot in dortmund as he drove with his wife from the military base 
there to their home in the west german citys gartendstadt area 
dortmund police said one police officer was injured after shots 
were fired at police cars chasing the gunmen in a silver metallic 
painted car the gunmen escaped after the occupants fired at police 
hitting one officer in the foot police said 
dillonlee was shot several times in the head after he stopped 
his car in front of his house said the defense spokesman speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british practice he died instantly but 
his wife was not injured the spokesman said 
in lichfield authorities said the three soldiers were attacked 
while waiting on a platform for a train friday and witnesses said 
the gunfire sent commuters fleeing 
the irish republican army is waging an offensive against british 
forces on mainland britain and on the continent as part of its 
campaign to drive the british out of the province of northern 
ireland police said however that they were keeping an open mind 
about who carried out the lichfield attack 
the soldiers recruits undergoing training at lichfield army 
base had purchased tickets and were waiting for their train to 
nearby birmingham for weekend leave said malcolm bevington 
detective chief superintendent of staffordshire police 
he said two masked men appeared on the platform pulled out 
handguns and shot the soldiers then jumped onto the tracks ran 
across the line and through a builders yard opposite the station 
lichfield is 100 miles northwest of london all three victims 
were recruits to the prince of wales division 
the ministry of defense identified the slain soldier as 
19yearold pvt william robert davies of pontarddulais south wales 
it identified the wounded soldiers as robert parkin 20 and neil 
evans 19 
chief inspector tony johnson of staffordshire police said parkin 
and evans spoke to police at the hospital adding both men are 
sitting up in bed they are comfortable and as well as can be 
expected 
a british rail employee who witnessed the shooting speaking on 
condition of anonymity said i thought they were just messing 
about but suddenly there were six loud bangs two collapsed to the 
ground and the third slumped onto a bench 
he said he jumped across the tracks to try to help the soldiers 
i and a station employee tried to staunch the flow of blood 
from the chest of one of the soldiers 
i could not believe what had happened the soldiers were in 
civilian clothes but it was obvious by their short hairstyle and 
the way they carried themselves that they were military personnel 
my feelings are that these gunmen are just cowards and i do not 
suppose they would dream about tackling our lads if they had been 
armed it is just such a shame the soldiers seemed so young 
police aided by dogs and a helicopter searched the area 
scotland yard said it sent an antiterrorist squad 
taxi driver peter irmer said there is a regular movement of 
troops to the station on a friday afternoon and evening from 
whittington barracks 
the majority of soldiers go home on a friday and almost all of 
them start their weekends leave from lichfield city station 
an army spokesman said the three were in the 12th week of a 
21week training schedule

neighbor a crime that tore two families and a town apart 
no dictionary contains sufficient words to describe the 
brutality of your acts nassau county court judge marvin goodman 
said in sentencing robert golub 22 
goodman added that the violence kelly ann tinyes suffered last 
year was the most atrocious hed seen in his 17 years as a 
judge the girl was beaten strangled slashed and sexually 
mutilated

20minute statement before he was sentenced 
i did not kill kelly ann tinyes he said speaking in a soft 
quavering voice maybe the person is here today with us but as 
sure as there is a god it is not me 
his parents john and elizabeth sat on the edge of their chairs 
inside the packed courtroom straining to hear their sons words 
golub was convicted in april of murdering kelly ann wrapping her 
body in a sleeping bag and stuffing it into a closet in the basement

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev signed a new trade pact friday that would lead to 
normalized economic relations between the two countries for the 
first time in nearly a half century 
but the bush administration emphasized that the provision most 
prized by gorbachev granting lower tariffs on soviet products sold 
in the united states will not go into effect until the soviet 
legislature passes a law providing free emigration 
at a white house signing ceremony bush said that he and 
gorbachev were looking forward to the passage of a soviet 
emigration law 
at a briefing afterward secretary of state james a baker iii 
said the agreement would not be sent to congress for ratification 
until the emigration law is passed 
the emigration law has gone through a first reading in the soviet 
legislature but has yet to be brought up for final passage 
the pact was signed without reference to gorbachevs handling of 
the independence movement in lithuania in recent weeks the 
administration had raised the possibility that it would refuse to 
sign a trade agreement unless gorbachev eased up on its economic 
blockade of the baltic republic 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk told reporters 
that there has been no direct link between lithuania and trade 
however members of congress from both parties have insisted that 
there be just such a link 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine the 
granting of mfn status in my mind is in mr gorbachevs hands he 
can achieve it with some rather modest changes in his policy toward 
the baltic states 
the united states will not give new trade benefits while the 
soviet noose continues to strangle lithuania said sen alfonse 
damato rny he talked to reporters before bush and gorbachev 
signed the agreement 
lithuanianamerican demonstrators massed outside the soviet 
embassy in washington were clearly disappointed with bushs decision 
i think hes letting democracy and independence down said 
arunas martinonis of boston it really upsets me 
bush should be stronger about lithuania latvia and estonia 
said helen zimavicus carter who drove 15 hours from her chicago 
home to join the protest were really shocked he doesnt stand up 
for their rights 
in addition to the trade pact the two leaders reached agreement 
on a fiveyear grain purchase agreement us officials had said 
that the soviets were threatening to hold up signing this pact 
unless they got a trade agreement 
intense debate was taking place on the grain and trade proposals 
throughout much of the day as the soviets threatened to block the 
grain agreement advantageous to us farmers if they didnt get 
the trade pact they sought administration officials said 
however larger issues in ussoviet relations appeared to play 
more of a role in bushs decision to give gorbachev the trade pact 
than any lastminute haggling over the grain agreement the 
officials suggested speaking on condition of anonymity 
bush administration officials in the days leading up to the 
summit had been vague presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater at 
one point said the vagueness was intentional on whether the trade 
agreement would be signed 
the trade agreement sorely wanted by gorbachev was always 
bushs trump card officials suggested 
it was quite obvious that gorbachev was seeking something on 
the economic front said one official its obviously something 
that he wanted to take home 
to emphasize the importance he placed on a trade pact gorbachev 
took his lobbying campaign directly to members of congress earlier 
friday he told them that approval of a trade deal would be 
especially politically useful for him back home 
american and soviet negotiators reached agreement several weeks 
ago on the details for both a trade pact and a grain agreement in 
anticipation that both would be signed at the washington summit 
however the outcome of both deals was in doubt up until the signing 
ceremony friday 
the pact would be a step toward granting the soviet union 
mostfavorednation trade status qualifying it for the lowest 
tariffs granted to any country 
currently soviet products sold in the united states bear duties 
that are as much as 10 times higher than imports from other 
countries by one estimate the price of soviet vodka could drop by 
125 per bottle 
leading american business groups including the us chamber of 
commerce and the national association of manufacturers have also 
been lobbying for approval of the agreement warning that without 
the deal american companies will be at a disadvantage in trying to 
gain access to the vast soviet market 
the agreement would provide better copyright protection for 
american companies and cut down on the time us companies must wait 
for approval to begin commercial operations in the soviet union 
it would also clear the way for approval of governmentsubsidized 
loans and for loan guarantees from the exportimport bank and the 
overseas private investment corp 
analysts said this provision was significant because it would 
expand the number of us companies interested in setting up joint 
ventures in the soviet union a key goal of gorbachevs economic 
reforms 
gorbachev said his quest for the trade agreement did not 
represent a plea for special favors 
the grain accord would increase the minimum amount of us wheat 
feed grains soybeans and other commodities that the soviets would 
purchase from the current 9 million tons annually to 10 million tons 
the soviet union is the largest foreign market for american grain 
products and new grain pact was viewed as a top objective for us 
farm groups

defense attorneys in rape cases can no 
longer use the alleged victims clothing as evidence to justify the 
attack under a new law signed friday by gov bob martinez 
there is no excuse for rape under any circumstances and this 
law will make it clear that the victim of sexual battery should not 
be persecuted as the criminal is prosecuted the republican 
governor said this new law is a major victory for the rights of 
crime victims 
the bills sponsor democratic rep elaine gordon miami said the 
measure stemmed from the acquittal of a rape suspect last october in 
fort lauderdale jurors commented that the woman may have tempted 
the assailant by wearing skimpy clothing 
the womans attorney called the new law overkill and 
predicted it will be challenged 
the alleged victim testified that steven lord 26 abducted her 
at knifepoint from a fort lauderdale restaurant parking lot in 
november 1988 and raped her repeatedly during a trip north on 
interstate 95 she said she escaped five hours later and 120 miles 
north of where shed been abducted 
defense attorney tim day told jurors the 22yearold woman agreed 
to have sex with lord in exchange for 100 and cocaine but later 
changed her mind 
several jurors said they decided on an innocent verdict partly 
because the woman was wearing a lace miniskirt and no underwear 
the acquittal sparked outrage and protests from many womens 
groups 
the womans attorney alexander siegel said he believes enough 
rules already exist on what evidence is acceptable and that judges 
and attorneys should handle each case individually 
in my opinion the new law is unconstitutional and 
unnecessary said siegel judges are quite capable of deciding 
what can be introduced and attorneys can be more aggressive about 
trying to keep things out 
siegel believes the law will be challenged in the first rape case 
in which the alleged victims clothing could be a factor 
in december lord pleaded guilty in a georgia court to raping and 
kidnapping a decatur ga woman lord was sentenced to life in 
prison for the rape and a concurrent 20year sentence for kidnapping

when the ussoviet summit conference concludes 
sunday in washington the television network news anchors will head 
for san francisco to cover the finale of mikhail gorbachevs visit 
to the united states 
exactly what that coverage will be is anybodys guess network 
news producers said friday afternoon because soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs plans for visiting minneapolis and san francisco still 
were unsettled 
were going to be in a significant standby mode said jeff 
gralnick executive producer of abcs summit coverage 
nbc cbs and cnn will broadcast gorbachevs speech at stanford 
university scheduled for 3 pm monday during his daylong tour of 
the san francisco bay area but none of the networks plan live 
coverage of the minnesota visit 
well stay very flexible with the capacity to cover as much or 
as little as we need said john towriss a cnn producer in 
minneapolis he said cnn expects the days big news will be the 
summits aftermath in washington 
nevertheless five local stations have pooled their resources to 
cover what will be one of the years biggest stories in minneapolis 
and st paul 
kare kmsp kstp ktca and wcco will be sharing camera crews 
satellite newsgathering vehicles and editing and production 
resources said steve blum a spokesman for conus communications 
the satellite tv news service 
pool feeds will be transmitted via conus uplinks to 
satellite live and unedited to conus 140 subscribing tv stations 
worldwide 
wherever possible were using satellite newsgathering 
equipment blum said that allows for a rapid deployment of 
equipment and staff at all the potential stops on gorbachevs 
intinerary 
the satellite gear also will let the pool station a camera in 
gorbachevs motorcade a portable microwave transmitter beams the 
signal to a nearby helicopter which in turn relays the signal to 
the satellite uplink 
us and soviet security officials nixed the idea of a helicopter 
hovering over the motorcade but will allow it to fly three miles 
away from the procession thats about as far as we can work and 
about as close as theyre willing to let us get blum said 
gorbachev and his wife raisa fly to the bay area sunday 
evening they will stay with the soviet consulgenerals residence 
in san francisco 
on monday morning former president ronald reagan and his wife 
nancy will join the gorbachevs for coffee and conversation 
the soviet couple is scheduled to leave san francisco at 930

and i have enormous respect for her mrs bush told reporters as 
the pair toured boston after sharing the commencement platform 
said mrs gorbachev i particularly rejoice at the fact that 
our conversations are extremely open sincere and friendly and 
despite the fact that we might have differences that does not 
change the tone 
these were words that had not publicly passed between mrs 
gorbachev and nancy reagan mrs bushs predecessor 
at wellesleys graduation ceremonies mrs bush disarmed critics 
who had argued that she was not a suitable role model for women in 
the 90s 
i never dreamed it would be this much fun the american first 
lady said 
the crowd cheered barbara barbara barbara as mrs bush 
spoke unabashedly about her homemakers life while urging the 
graduates to pursue professional careers if that was their goal 
they were nice mrs bush said of the students friday night 
the first lady credited mrs gorbachev with the reception the two 
got calling her my secret weapon 
shes wonderful mrs bush said as she returned to the white 
house following a dinner at the soviet embassy 
asked how she and mrs gorbachev hit it off mrs bush replied 
very well 
sounding some of the themes that mrs bush hit mrs gorbachev 
a professional women herself spoke of the values that bring us 
together including love of country and children 
mrs bush who dropped out of college to marry george bush as 
world war ii raged a continent away wore a black academic robe with 
a purple cowl mrs gorbachev a philosophy phd and former 
university lecturer wore a plaid gray suit and pink blouse 
more conspicuous were the graduates who wore purple armbands 
signaling their lingering belief that mrs bushs life has 
epitomized the victory of fealty to family over feminist emergence 
mrs bush got hearty applause when she said at one point 
somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day 
follow in my footsteps and preside over the white house as the 
presidents spouse i wish him well 
but while urging the graduates to pursue professional careers if 
they so choose mrs bush warned at the end of your life you 
will never regret not having passed one more test winning one more 
verdict or not closing one more deal you will regret time not 
spent with a husband a child a friend or a parent 
speaking second mrs gorbachevs gave a serious but upbeat 
talk on the virtues of soviet perestroika and the economic reforms 
undertaken by her husband president mikhail s gorbachev

confident that perestroika will succeed she said its goal 
is to make ideals and values a reality 
then sounding some of the themes that mrs bush hit she spoke 
of the values that bring us together including love of country 
and children 
if people in the world today are more confident of a peaceful 
future we have to give a good deal of credit for that to women 
she said 
wellesleys 112th commencement would have been momentous even 
without the student petition questioning whether mrs bush was a 
suitable role model for the graduates of this elite massachusetts 
college for women 
it was the first time the two first ladies ever shared a public 
platform and wellesley president nannerl o keohane called it 
another step in the glasnost that brings a new spirit of 
cooperation between our two countries 
the two first ladies later toured boston twice emerging from 
their limousine to wade into tumultuous crowds of wellwishers in 
wellesley square and outside wellesley middle school they joined 
arms and held their hands aloft to the delight of the crowd 
after driving through cambridge and by the charles river past 
harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology they headed 
for boston public garden where children from mather school the 
oldest public elementary school in the united states gave them

a fresh protest friday for mrs bush a letter urging her to take 
a definitive and vocal stand on abortion rights and other social 
issues affecting women 
the letter said that in honoring mrs bush we celebrate all 
the unknown women who have dedicated their lives to serving 
others the armbands were purple because that was the senior class 
color this year 
the commencement was held inside a cavernous white tent that held 
5500 people during the playing of the soviet national anthem 
several adults held a banner in the main aisle that read free the 
baltic states 
graduate suki hudson of warwick ri said of the seniors 
protest these things are important to women with her position i 
think if she can take a stand womens situation would improve a 
great deal thats all we ask from her

a naive young man is transformed into a 
corrupt calculating bureaucrat in a recent soviet film called the 
villain ivan minasbekov jokes that he knows him 
i understand everything about this mafia blackmarket 
person says minasbekov a violinist who emigrated here in 1982 
to be with his only daughter one is my neighbor in baku thats 
my city where i was born 
the villain is typical of the films being shown during the 
superpower summit this week at a soviet film festival together 
they amount to a celluloid catharsis 
virtually every film is a grim look at some aspect of the soviet 
unions cruel history or current troubles occasionally the gloom is 
disguised as farce but the themes are the same siberian prisons 
stalinist oppression heroic resistance bureaucratic hypocrisy and 
the guilt of torturers

researchers have taken a step they think could 
help them better understand aids using a cloned virus to infect 
monkeys with an aidslike disease 
this is the first time a laboratorydeveloped virus has been used 
to cause an aidstype infection the researchers reported in a paper 
published today in the journal science 
the importance of this is that we can now make very precise 
changes in the virus and try and predict what will happen 
explained harry kestler of harvard universitys new england regional 
primate research center 
because all copies of a cloned virus are identical scientists 
can compare the results of an infection with the original virus with 
infections from a virus in which they have made specific changes

gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new 
era of destructive storms 
the hurricane season runs until nov 30 and was ushered in by a 
tropical depression last week in the caribbean that brought heavy 
rain to cuba and south florida but did not intensify into a 
hurricane 
many coastal communities with swelling populations are 
illprepared to handle a hurricane emergency said robert sheets 
director of the national hurricane center 
a recent national oceanic and atmospheric administration report

e desheng a 27yearold tea seller who has 
never left home is a veteran traveler of the socialist road 
sensitive to political nuances 
e lives in rural huashan township and says he has not ventured 
farther than wuhan the provincial capital 12 miles away like 
almost everyone in this tightly regimented nation however he reads 
the signs from beijing 700 miles to the north 
a member of the communist youth league he attends weekly 
meetings to study how to keep on the socialist road and take the 
lead in learning from lei feng a legendary footsoldier venerated 
for selflessly doing good deeds and loving the communist party 
emulating lei and protecting socialism from bourgeois 
liberalism are central themes of the nationwide ideological 
campaign that began after the government sent troops to crush the 
prodemocracy movement a year ago 
whatever his expressed interest in politics the young tea seller 
speaks with far more animation of his twostory home and 3yearold 
son like most chinese in the countryside he probably keeps up with 
politics only in hopes of achieving a more prosperous life 
a recent press tour of hubei province in central china organized 
by the foreign ministry revealed how difficult it is even for 
ordinary citizens to escape beijings latest political campaign 
zuo wenqing an official in huashan said political education had 
been increased on orders of the central government we 
strengthened the connection between cadres and workers and taught 
farmers to love the country lead a simple life and work harder 
he said 
ma yue executive vice president of the 80000worker second 
automobile works in shiyan western hubei said classes were begun 
after the june 1989 crackdown to study the works of deng xiaoping 
and other party leaders 
political education is quite important ma said we 
shouldnt be motivated only by money 
people in hubei are bombarded by political slogans on roadsides 
in publications and in factories 
many deal with such mundane issues as family planning or traffic 
safety others including stone carvings embedded in railroad 
embankments that read long live the communist party probably 
date from the 196676 cultural revolution 
one slogan in a small huashan collective factory reflecting the 
nowmuzzled economic reform sentiments of the mid1980s proclaimed 
time is money profit is life 
lei feng slogans have begun appearing in every factory the 
spirit of lei feng is the traditional virtue of the chinese 
people said one in a wuhan machinery plant 
another at a textile factory in xiangfan city run by the army 
read the great successes of the past 40 years would be impossible 
without the communist party leadership socialism and the government 
policy of democratic dictatorship 
during the beijing prodemocracy demonstrations last year about 
1000 students protested in xiangfan young people surrounded the 
second automobile works in shiyan and in wuhan protesters blocked 
the train and auto bridge across the yangtze river for three days 
wuhan an industrial city of 3 million has been a center of 
political activism for generations wuhan rebels helped bring down 
the qing dynasty after the turn of the century the young communist 
party operated from there in the 1920s and some of the bloodiest 
fighting of the cultural revolution occurred in wuhan 
despite the tradition most hubei residents probably are just 
going through the motions of the latest political campaign like 
their counterparts in beijing 
as in the rest of china all communist party members in hubei 
factories and offices have been told to register again the purpose 
is to weed out those tainted by prodemocracy sympathies but it 
appears few in hubei are in danger of expulsion 
huang mobin president of the wuhan iron and steel corp which 
has 120000 employees said with pride that not a single worker went 
to beijing last year to join the demonstrations 
its true that workers dislike unequal distribution of property 
and profiteering but they are more dissatisfied with the students 
and instability he said 
often the rhetoric is little more than a handy way to avoid 
prying questions 
mayor wu fayu of shiyan after a speech attributing the citys 
progress to the communist party the study of marx and mao and 
folowing the socialist road was asked how mao tsetungs thought 
guided him in his daily work 
his general thought is a crystallization of the wisdom of the 
people was the cryptic reply 
a department store manager in wuhan claimed following the 
socialist road was the key to his stores success 
he then said he was adopting new marketing systems that would 
foster competition between different sections of the store 
blaring in the background was a soundtrack of the american movie 
saturday night fever

by forces only dimly understood americans are 
said to have changed their minds about one of the most fundamental 
financial issues of mankind and now seem ready to accept higher 
taxes 
a smattering of surveys indicate as much it is considered a 
given in many financial and business analyses and even the 
president of the united states elected on a pledge of no increases 
has suggested he might reconsider 
however it was done the selling of the idea of higher taxes 
might make a study worthy of the most esteemed educational 
institutions only this much is known many people think an increase 
is the only way to cut the budget deficit 
that too might make an academic study because only a few years 
have passed since the presidents private sector survey on cost 
control headed by j peter grace recommended 424 billion in cuts 
over three years 
no more use was made of the study than is made of those 
shellacked sets of encyclopedias that reside on shelves beside the 
television set and the other pieces of furniture 
in 1985 the year after the study congress raised spending by 
945 billion and very little has been heard of the findings since 
then although grace chairman of wr grace amp co did his best to 
keep the publicity at a high pitch 
the entire thesis of that volume was the wastefulness of 
government and the growing danger that it would bankrupt the nation 
unless corrected its subtitle could very well have been cut waste 
rather than raise taxes 
now the deficit is thought to be at a crisis level by people in 
all areas of life members of congress to be sure but heads of 
corporations too and a tax increase is thought the only way to 
reduce it 
it isnt the first time congress has ignored the option of 
cutting spending rather than raising taxes and it isnt likely to be 
the last not if you can judge by the recent evidence 
with assistance from fellow scholars scott hodge federal budget 
analyst for the heritage foundation a washingtonbased conservative 
think tank came up with a list of 130 billion in cuts he says 
would cause minimal damage 
among other things he would ask congress to break its addiction 
to pork barrel spending thats a lot to ask of elected officials 
of course because their success often is seen as receiving more 
from washington than constituents send there 
but some pork barrelling hodge indicates might be of no help 
back home or anywhere else either such as 2500 to finance a study 
on the causes of rudeness lying and cheating on tennis courts an 
84000 study of why people fall in love and 107000 to study the 
japanese quails sex life 
just peanuts you say well then consider the recent aid 
package for panama and nicaragua congress cut it back to 420 
million from the 800 million requested by president bush that was 
congress price for agreeing to such aid 
it wasnt the only price to the bill members of congress tacked 
on more than that amount for domestic projects many of them their 
favorite spending programs 
among them a sum of 400000 to fill in a collapsed utility 
tunnel in salisbury nc sought by a congressman from that state 
and 990000 to repair a waterfront park in bay city mich by a 
congressman from that area 
in this way did a foreign aid package for panama and nicaragua 
hide a large domestic spending program spending is in cutting is 
out hodge says congress even ignores revelations of wasteful 
spending by its own research arms 
last november for example the general accounting office found 
more than 150 billion in program waste fraud and financial 
mismanagement and only three months ago the congressional budget 
office recommended reforms it said would yield savings of roughly 
60 billion in the first year 
if implemented

debra gilbert was in her nightgown fixing 
breakfast when an ax broke through the front door as a dozen police 
officers waving shotguns swarmed her house she heard her husband 
yell she doesnt know anything she doesnt know 
what she didnt know was that her husband of four years was 
connected to the mob she didnt know he had killed three times and 
she didnt know the shambles her life would become 
yet even after she knew she stood by him when he agreed to 
testify against organized crime buddies living a bizarre life of 
fear that included time in a threeroom police station apartment 
she watched as her husband manipulated authorities serving his 
murder sentence while living the high life complete with 
thousanddollar expense accounts and beach house vacations when 
peter gilbert died of a heart attack in june 1988 he still was in 
custody but was driving alone to go skydiving in a buick stocked 
with cocaine 
i know a lot of people out there would say boy shes the 
biggest fool who ever walked this earth mrs gilbert said in an 
interview at her brooksville fla home but how many people can 
say they loved someone enough to love them blindly 
the case of peter gilbert offers an unusual glimpse into the 
sometimes peculiar world of crime and punishment where a man so 
skilled in manipulation can take not only his wife for a ride but 
also police and prosecutors 
his escapade rocked providences police department and led gov 
edward d diprete to order a state police investigation fourteen 
officers face disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct and a 
special prosecutor was named april 30 to take the case to a grand 
jury for possible criminal indictments 
a state judge is even considering overturning a conviction that 
was based on peter gilberts testimony because of all the lies 
the fiasco as the internal investigation calls it is 
expected to cost nearly 1 million by the time all the probes are 
completed 
then the state of rhode island and especially myself will be 
able to put pieces together and not feel like there is anything 
missing anymore mrs gilbert said 
a consummate con man peter gilbert made up in charisma what he 
lacked in conscience he told debra their marriage was his first 
when it was at least his fifth standing 5 feet 5 inches with a 
scruffy beard and tattoos peter hardly seemed the ladys man debra 
knew he had children but she wasnt one to ask a lot of questions 
when they met in florida she was a high school dropout with 
three young children peter lived next door when the man she had 
married at 16 walked out 
he was my hero that came along and loved me and my children 
she said in her soft southern lilt 
she married him in 1981 in the brooksville courthouse believing 
he was james harold cassidy the charade crumbled a year later when 
he was arrested for burglarizing a church and a lumberyard police 
said he was peter gilbert a man who lived half his life as a 
criminal 
i couldnt understand why he lied to me i left him she said 
peter told her he lied only to get away from his past he said he 
stole to pay for the birth of their newborn daughter kiya he wrote 
poems from jail to win her forgiveness 
now that kiya binds our love there is no yesterday 
just tomorrow just for us our love will show the way 
a few months later peter escaped by knocking out another man in 
a holding cell who was to go before a judge on a minor charge peter 
took his place pleaded guilty to the other mans infraction and 
walked free 
he fled to rhode island against the advice of family and 
friends debra quit her waitressing job in brooksville to join him 
after a oneyear separation 
i was raising four kids and they missed him she said he 
said i was his life and after calling me all the time i believed 
him 
in rhode island she wondered why his beeper supposedly for his 
job at an auto body shop went off at all hours with strange 
messages she asked enough to learn he was involved with drugs 
but didnt pry 
i didnt want to know to be honest said debra now 30 
peters drug use became so bad he asked her to wake him by 
injecting him with cocaine she refused but stayed at his side 
telling herself he just needed help 
when police stormed her providence home in early 1985 debra 
learned about the murders all involving drug users or traffickers 
i tried to imagine him doing something like that she said 
i couldnt no matter how hard i tried 
authorities offered peter an unusual deal in exchange for his 
testimony he would serve his 10year sentence in providence police 
custody then be relocated the dream of starting over helped keep 
debra with her husband so did peters tales of threats against the 
family and prosecutors pleas he was a more believable witness with 
his wife by his side 
she sent her three older children to her mother in florida and 
she and 2yearold kiya were allowed to join peter in the police 
station 
the three lived together in a cell for a few weeks while a former 
matrons quarters was converted into a threeroom airconditioned 
apartment it had a telephone television videocassette recorder 
and queensized water bed but it was adjacent to the womens cells 
and the noise and screaming were incessant 
it was definitely our home said debra but it was like 
jail too i think i always felt like i was breathing germs 
peter passed the time watching tv sharing a beer with his 
guards fishing with the mayors chauffeur he started an 
autobiography he was allowed out and sometimes stayed away 
overnight 
debra was immobilized by fear afraid to go out she spent more 
time in jail than peter she began to fear the food might be 
poisoned and made her daughter wait while she tasted some first the 
strain finally proved too much and she moved back to florida 
i couldnt take it anymore the women screaming the officers 
my daughter was not going to be raised in that kind of 
environment she said 
two years later in 1988 she went back to peter at a rural rhode 
island safe house prosecutors provided debra said she told police 
that peter was using cocaine and packaging drugs in the cellar but 
was told to keep quiet a departmental review supports her 
allegation 
it can reasonably be inferred that gilbert supplemented his 
state income with his profits from narcotics sales the review 
said 
she stayed just seven weeks two months later peter who had a 
history of heart trouble died of a heart attack following a fight 
at a connecticut gas station according to a medical examiners 
report 
debra continues to wrestle with her husbands lies peter told 
the children he lived in the police station because he was an 
undercover officer she hasnt yet found a way to tell them the 
truth 
but she is hopeful about the future she recently remarried and 
insists this time she is less naive 
i have started a new life with a very good man she said 
its just a good feeling

the annual nbc affiliates convention normally 
held in los angeles begins in washington today 
the main reason a tuesday trip to capitol hill by affiliate 
executives to discuss cable and nbcrelated matters 
the executives of nbcs 208 affiliated stations should be happy 
considering the network last month won its fifth straight season in 
prime time but there is trouble in peacock city 
among other things 
nbcs primetime ratings last season were the lowest in its 
history down 9 percent from 198889 
today whose nielsen dive began after last years 
muchcriticized changes that led to the exit of jane pauley and the 
entrance of deborah norville has run second to abcs good morning 
america for 21 weeks 
tom brokaws nbc nightly news has been third in the news 
ratings for seven consecutive weeks 
the executives of course also will be pondering what incoming 
affiliate chairman eric bremner calls an audacious and bold move 
for next season by fox broadcasting pitting the simpsons 
against the cosby show 
i think fox has taken one hell of a gamble says bremners 
predecessor as affiliate chairman james r sefert but this is 
just the kind of challenge that makes bill cosby work all the 
harder 
although the simpsons vs the coz likely will be the talk of the 
gathering much of the executives attention will be on the news 
division 
its president michael gartner last month commenced repair 
programs for today and the nbc nightly news in sudden 
backtoback moves that more than a few tv writers saw as two steps 
back to the future 
for today he rehired former host joe garagiola wholl be 
on the show three days a week with cbs anchor faith daniels hired 
as the shows news anchor hell join cohosts norville and byrant 
gumbel on june 11 
and gartner rehired steve friedman the brash former today 
executive producer who helped that show achieve dominance gartner 
made him executive producer of nightly news 
gartner is scheduled to talk to the affiliates today about the 
changes and other plans it remains to be seen whether hell come 
under heavy fire from the station executives at wednesdays 
closeddoor final session 
i dont know if theres going to be hostility but there is 
deep concern about the state of the two programs says sefert 
president of cosmos broadcasting corp in greenville sc 
we hope to get an explanation of the rationale behind moves 
that have been made so far says bremner of king broadcasting co 
in seattle wash he doubts that the fiesty gartner will face sharp 
verbal attacks 
but yes the affiliates are very definitely concerned and 
anxious to see positive results from the changes that have been 
made he says 
the affiliates also will hear gartner discuss a proposal to make 
an nbc news service called anews a 24hour news and sportsnews 
operation one that would resemble cnn only in its roundtheclock 
schedule 
anews currently sends affiliates reports from nbc news and 
affiliate stations seven times a day starting at 11 am edt and 
ending at 230 am edt nbc says the reports are separate from 
nbcs regular newscasts and are for use in local stations newscasts 
the expanded service might include an anchor in the early morning 
hours when nbc isnt broadcasting 
the proposed new service has to be viewed as a positive turn of 
events bremner says if its done as well as nbc intends to do 
it it will be a major resource for the affiliates 
during tuesdays capitol hill trip sefert says the affiliate 
executives will meet with their congressmen to seek 
hearings on the issue of cable companies that transmit local 
broadcast signals without paying for them the nbc stations dont 
seek laws requiring payment he says but want a solution that is 
acceptable to everybody 
capitol hill support for whatever the federal communications 
commission decides on proposals to let the networks have a financial 
interest in programs they air that were brought in by outside 
producers 
the major networks currently are barred from a financial interest 
in such programs by the fccs financialsyndication rules but the 
fcc currently is reexamining the rules in light of the growth of 
cable

it might be wise to listen to all those 
complaints of a credit crunch even if many of them are coming 
merely from builders and developers 
a credit crunch anywhere in the economy can spread economic woe 
far and wide 
many business economists have tended to discredit credit crunch 
claims arguing that the national statistics fail to show one much 
of the evidence is anecdotal and any problem is restricted to 
builders 
other analysts contend however that even a slight infection in 
just one limb can spread quickly to the entire body builders 
clearly are involved in a credit crunch which they say is bound to 
hurt other businesses 
this becomes clear when you consider the ingredients the trades 
and skills the manufacturers retailers and wholesalers involved in 
building just one 1700squarefoot singlefamily home 
lumber of course some 9726 board feet of it and 55 cubic 
yards of concrete 1992 square feet of asphalt shingles for 
roofing 2500 square feet of insulation 6484 square feet of wall 
board and 90 feet of ducting 
if you find it difficult to visualize those items then consider 
these 55 gallons of paint 302 pounds of nails 12 windows three 
bathtubs three sinks 15 kitchen cabinets and of course the 
range refrigerator dishwasher 
all of those items must be assembled in a housing unit and that 
involves people such as architects draftsmen surveyors masons 
plumbers roofers painters paperhangers electricians and a dozen 
other vital trades 
most of these are local business people but the locals order 
from regional suppliers who get their materials from factories 
which are situated throughout the country and which order from raw 
material suppliers 
in all according to the national association of home builders 
which bases its estimate on us government figures the 
construction of just one house means 18 manyears of employment 
translated that could mean almost 22 months of work for one 
person or for example about three months work for seven 
thus while the credit crunch in building may not to date have 
made an impression in national statistics smart economists 
including federal reserve chairman alan greenspan are concerned 
martin perlman nahb president says the crunch already is 
destructive builders are being indiscriminately cut off from the 
credit markets production is dropping people are losing their jobs 
and businesses he says 
he cites an association survey in which 60 percent of 1142 
responding builders said changes in lending practices at thrifts and 
commercial banks have affected their plans for 1990 
these are the key findings in regard to thrifts perhaps better 
known as savings and loans associations 
about 49 percent of the respondents said savings institutions 
are reducing the amount they can borrow in the future for land 
acquisition land development or construction 
fiftytwo percent said thrifts no longer will make land 
acquisition loans 
fortysix percent said thrifts no longer will make land 
development loans 
thirty percent said thrifts no longer will make construction 
loans 
to some extent the attitude of savings and loan associations is 
more understandable than that of commercial banks because sampls are 
under greater pressure from regulators to maintain sound lending 
practices 
some restraints shown by commercial banks are selfimposed 
following big losses in speculative ventures but the builders 
survey indicates that even sound builders are facing a variety of 
credit denials 
thirty percent of respondents for example said theyve been 
asked for additional collateral on existing loans and 35 percent 
said banks now seek excessive documentation some they said are 
calling loans before maturity 
all this might not to date have shown up in national statistics 
so revered by some economists but as other economists point out 
statistics are historical records not measures of current events

while other world leaders fight to stay 
in power and some try to fend off reform the head of the worlds 6 
million tibetans has the opposite problem 
the dalai lamas people are uncomfortable with democracy and do 
not want him to retire as their political leader 
but then most other political figures arent considered living 
gods 
i am insisting on stepping down the dalai lama said in an 
interview it is of greatest urgency that democracy comes to us 
it is the most creative way for the human spirit 
in his ornate parlor overlooking the snowcapped himalayas the 
dalai lama predicted communism soon would fall in china and his 
followers would return to their homeland within 10 years 
tibetans believe their mountainous region with its unique 
culture should be an independent nation china claims tibet has 
been part of its territory since the 13th century 
to prepare for their return the dalai lama said tibetans must 
embrace democracy and shed the idea that he is a god 
it is proving difficult there is strong conservative opposition 
to the dalai lamas plans to democratize his governmentinexile and 
few if any tibetans seem willing to abandon the belief that his 
holiness is divine 
that belief has made tibetans lazy said the 54yearold 
buddhist leader who won the 1989 nobel peace prize they think i 
will do everything for them 
tibetans circle his residence pausing to clasp their hands in 
prayer elderly women limping with age climb steep grades to gaze 
at his compound whispering 10000 years to his holiness 
tibetan buddhist tradition holds that the first dalai lama born 
in 1391 was a reincarnation of chenresi the buddhist god of mercy 
subsequent dalai lamas are revered as reincarnations of their 
predecessors 
the current dalai lama the 14th was chosen in 1936 after a 
series of visions indicated the leader would be found in a house 
with turquoise tiles in eastern tibet 
when he first told tibetans of his wish to give up his political 
position the dalai lama said many people were shocked and they 
told me i should not say this kind of thing 
but i continuously spoke out he said with a playful grin 
he remains a reluctant politician a man of the spirit not of 
law or intrigue clothed in maroon and saffron robes and wearing his 
everpresent tinted glasses the dalai lama chuckled cracked jokes 
and reached out to squeeze the hand of a reporter as he made a point 
i am just a tibetan monk he said running his fingers over 
wooden prayer beads i would rather go to an isolated monastery 
and pray now i have no time for prayer i am always busy busy with 
the affairs of this world

a new exhibit in budapest recalls the 
shadow of stalinism that covered half of europe for more than 40 
years 
it is called stalin rakosi and is the first in eastern 
europe to depict the daytoday life of the 1950s 
hungarys stalin was matyas rakosi who was installed by the 
soviet dictator and ruled unchallenged stalin died in 1953 byt 
rakosis reign lasted until the 1956 uprising against stalinism 
which was crushed by soviet tanks 
the exhibit constructed like a labyrinth is in a castle on a 
hill above the danube river it includes newspaper headlines 
photographs uniforms of feared men soiled clothing of the beaten 
and belongings of the executed 
emil horn who conceived it said he wanted to juxtapose the 
truth and the rakosi regimes representation of itself 
those days were very sad he said in an interview now 
there is a great irony 
a giant reprint of a cartoon from the period depicts mice 
marching behind a placard of a grinning cat next to it are equally 
large photos of hungarians marching behind portraits of rakosi and 
stalin 
the exhibit focuses on the rakosi era but repeatedly draws 
comparisons with the soviet union showing nearly identical 
uniforms medals and even constitutions 
a castbronze head of rakosi adorns a threetier podium 
recalling the cakes each village factory and school sent him on his 
60th birthday 
the podium is piled high with presents handstitched banners 
painted vases and flasks depicting the glories of communism there 
is sheet music of hymns to the leader 
up a few steps in a mausoleumlike chamber are even more 
elaborate gifts to stalin 
the exhibit also notes differences between stalinism in the 
soviet union and hungary 
here it lasted only seven to eight years horn said due 
to the liberal trends in hungary czechoslovakia and the whole 
region it would have taken much longer to completely suppress the 
people than in russia 
horn is a former communist who believed firmly in marxism when 
the soviets liberated hungary about what came later he said we 
are ashamed of ourselves 
his exhibit contains my personal selfcriticism as well horn 
said for me it is a kind of absolution i didnt hurt anyone 
but still it is absurd that i and so many people were so stupid 
why was i so ignorant millions of people in eastern europe 
are asking themselves that question 
in his new years address president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia said all czechoslovaks shared responsibility for 
communist rule and cautioned against simply blaming leaders for the 
excesses 
an exhibit about czechoslovakias history since 1918 opened in 
prague last month it is part of a general effort in what once was 
the soviet bloc to express the truth of history and strip away 
stalinist falsehoods 
budapests rakosi exhibit shows how the communists rigged the 
1947 elections then chronicles the dissolution of other parties 
collectivization of land and experiments in economic 
selfsufficiency that even included a shortlived attempt to grow 
cotton 
the second part of the exhibit has the atmosphere of an 
interrogation chamber courtroom and prison camp 
documents listing charges against prominent victims of the rakosi 
regime are displayed along with photographs and personal belongings 
they include cardinal jozsef mindszenty and former interior minister 
laszlo rajk who was hanged as a titoist 
in a depiction of the notorious labor camp at recsk where many 
people died are huge prints of photos taken secretly by an inmate 
who now lives in the west 
a small cabinet displays such banned materials as carlo collodis 
pinocchio disney cartoons and the jungle book by rudyard 
kipling 
looming over the exit is a border guard tower bearing two 
figures 18000 the number of people allowed to travel outside the 
country in 1951 and 10 million the number in 1989 
across from the tower are statues of rakosi and stalin toppled 
as they were after protesters pulled them down at beginning of the 
uprising oct 23 1956 stalins fist is in the dirt 
one visitor wrote in the guest book thank god we havent seen 
this in our lives another wrote below unfortunately we have 
still another echoed horn im ashamed that the hungarian 
people were willing to accept all this for decades

as unexpected as the stock markets latest 
upsurge to record highs may have been it certainly didnt seem to 
catch corporate insiders by surprise 
before the market began to take off five weeks ago top managers 
directors and major shareholders of corporations had been stepping 
up buying of their stocks for months to levels seldom seen over the 
past two decades 
by so doing they put some fresh luster on their reputation as a 
force to be reckoned with in the search for the right stock to buy 
at the right time 
since the waning months of 1989 according to tallies by various 
investment advisory services insiders have been consistently buying 
more shares of their companies stocks than they have sold in 
openmarket transactions 
to regular followers of the insiders activities that 
represented an even stronger endorsement of the market outlook than 
it might appear at first glance 
insiders often obtain stock through private means such as 
employee purchase plans and the exercise of options they receive as 
part of their pay 
thus in their openmarket activity analysts say they typically 
can be expected to be sellers about twothirds of the time and 
buyers in the remaining onethird or so of transactions 
because theyre often compensated with company stock about 
twice as many insiders normally sell than buy said stephen leeb 
in the newsletter personal finance 
but for the last few months buyers have actually outnumbered 
sellers every time this has happened in the past stocks across the 
board have rallied 
in calculating his insider indicator norman fosback editor 
of the advisory publication the insiders puts the normal buying 
line at 35 percent of the total transactions 
for a fiveweek period through midmay the indicator stood at a 
very bullish 60 percent 
the insiders are again telling the market that higher stock 
price levels are ahead fosback said the only way to describe 
their current activity is a buying panic 
the rationale for tracking the activities of insiders is 
straightforward enough fosback calls them americas most 
knowledgeable investors 
or as leeb observes what really drives stocks in the long run 
is whats happening on americas factory floors 
who are the best witnesses corporate insiders officers and 
directors who have firsthand knowledge of their firms strengths and 
weaknesses 
the closeup view does not always lead to unerring insight 
insiders had it right in 1980 and 1983 when they grew cautious just 
ahead of periods of flat or declining stock prices 
they gave no such warning however in 1987 leading up to the 
crash on black monday oct 19 of that year 
as if to make up for that omission they stampeded in with buy 
orders after the crash betting correctly that the market would 
rebound through the 2 years since then they have remained 
consistently if a little less spectacularly bullish 
when stocks tumbled early this year it appeared as though a bear 
market might have set in catching corporate insiders unaware but 
now says fosback the latest upside price burst has once again 
vindicated the insiders

only now 45 years after world war ii ended in 
europe are many jewish survivors coming to grips with the trauma 
they suffered at the hands of nazi germany 
a recent survey found that 302404 of the nearly 1 million 
holocaust survivors who fled to israel from europe were still alive 
most are 65 to 80 an age at which experts say they will be taking 
stock of their lives 
the natural process of aging takes people back to deal with 
their pasts to make an account with their souls said ilana 
nahmias director of amcha which provides psychological counseling 
for survivors 
many seek a sympathetic ear for their nightmares paranoia 
loneliness 
scores have turned to amcha which has about 35 volunteer workers 
at its offices in jerusalem and ramat gan a suburb of tel aviv 
many of the volunteers are children of survivors 
amcha a nonprofit organization was the first recipient of 
reparations from east germany in the form of a 36 million grant 
in april its name means people or your people in hebrew 
and was a password holocaust survivors in europe used to identify 
each other 
its cases include 
a 60yearold man who spent the war years hiding from the nazis 
with the help of farmers and never shared his experiences with his 
family the home atmosphere became tense and his children had 
trouble fitting into the outside world 
a 72yearold survivor not given to dwelling on the past who 
began thinking constantly of his life in a concentration camp he 
was overwhelmed by a need to talk but did not want to burden his 
wife with his private terrors because she too had lived through 
the holocaust 
a man in his 70s who could not sleep because of a secret he 
could not tell his daughter that he had had a first wife and son 
who were killed by the nazis while he stood helpless 
counseling helped the first two and their families but the third 
man left the program after one session and refused the centers 
proposal to arrange for his daughter to join him in a meeting with 
counselors 
nahmias said there were several cases of survivors who had not 
told relatives and close friends about first families either 
because it was too painful or because they felt shame for not 
preventing the deaths 
we dont say we can cure pain she said we have no recipe 
but many feel they are going to explode that they have to tell 
about their experience now or it will be lost if they feel a little 
better its a lot 
some prefer talking to a tape recorder she said and the center 
has 200 hours of recorded testimonies 
the survivor can come and talk about what he wants said 
nahmias a former colonel in the army womens corps we dont try 
to find out if its true or matches historical events its enough 
if thats how he remembers something or how he wants to be 
remembered 
several cases involve survivors who were children during the 
holocaust about 50000 child victims live in israel to protect 
their privacy nahmias did not reveal the names of any of the 
survivors 
the amcha director related the case of a 55yearold woman who 
when her daughter left home to get married was suddenly faced again 
with the fear of separation she felt as a child while on the run 
from the nazis she had been passed from family to family 17 times 
nahmias said many child survivors were reluctant to speak of 
their experiences because they felt the suffering of those in the 
death camps was so much greater 
i didnt want to talk as a child i was ashamed of it said 
yossi peled who survived by hiding with a christian family in 
belgium and now is a major general in israels army 
eli and shoshana heyman a germanborn couple who survived work 
camps and auschwitz and now work as amcha volunteers said holocaust 
victims have difficulty speaking of it because nonsurvivors cannot 
relate to their experience 
sometimes you see it in their eyes they want to understand 
but they cant said shoshana heyman who is in charge of amchas 
archives its impossible when you want to explain it sounds so 
horrid that you cant explain 
she said they did not tell the terrible things even to their 
children but were able to talk with other survivors 
eli heyman a retired communal farmer who counsels lonely and 
troubled holocaust victims said he was haunted by the fact that 
survivors had such difficulty finding happiness 
what bothers me is that people who went through the holocaust 
in the end do not get by so well he said one has money but he 
does not get by he is not at one with himself he is divided you 
are not happy and that is the problem 
it is a not a remedy for a doctor to ask someone what hurts 
although he provides counseling heyman said i know it is not 
possible to find a solution

when bob crostic bought his first pair of 
stonewashed jeans recently he discovered a small chunk of pumice in 
one of the pockets 
there was more than a bit of irony in the find 
crostic a staffer with the us forest service oversees an 
openpit pumice mine in the santa fe national forest that is at the 
center of a noisy dispute about the use of public lands 
because some of the pumice is used to stonewash or acidwash 
fabric critics contend the forest is being sacrificed for fashion 
and fashion vs forest has become their rallying cry 
the las conchas pumice mine looks like a moonscape the dazzling 
white of the pumice piles offset only by a couple of heaps of 
burned blackened tree stumps 
great stuff to mine crostic told recent visitors as he 
grabbed a handful of the lightweight volcanic rock and sifted it 
through his fingers 
last spring as work began to prepare the mine site in northern 
new mexicos scenic jemez mountains about 20 members of the 
environmental group earth first converged to protest the operation 
three were arrested when they locked themselves to earthmoving 
equipment 
at issue is a 19thcentury federal law that allows private 
citizens to mine and appropriate public lands at negligible cost 
the law enacted to encourage mineral development says that 
anyone who finds a valuable mineral deposit on public lands may 
stake a claim and mine it or patent the claim and purchase the land 
while coal oil gas sand stone and other minerals have been 
removed from its provisions the general mining law of 1872 still 
covers metals such as gold lead copper and zinc as well as pumice 
copar pumice co which had staked claims in the area received 
approval last summer from the forest service to stripmine 33 acres 
in the national forest about 15 miles west of los alamos copar then 
must restore the site once mining is finished by recontouring it and 
planting grass and trees 
environmentalists went to court contending the mines impact had 
not been adequately assessed but mining continues while the case is 
pending 
in september copar owner richard cook applied for a patent or 
outright ownership of 1700 acres surrounding the mine 
under the 1872 law if the tract is determined to contain 
valuable pumice cook can buy the land for 250 an acre once he 
owns the property no state or federal reclamation laws would 
require him to restore the site after mining 
its essentially a major ripoff of public land under an archaic 
law said henry oat of santa fe who heads the east fork 
preservation coalition 
the operating mine is barely a fourth of a mile from the east 
fork of the jemez river a pristine trout stream that has been 
approved by congress for inclusion in the national wild and scenic 
rivers system 
nearly 180 acres of the land cook seeks fall within the 
quartermile corridor on either side of the river that would be 
protected by the federal designation which awaits president bushs 
approval 
the legislation prohibits cook from patenting the 180 acres along 
the river but he cannot be prevented from mining it because he has 
valid claims he has said though that he would not mine it because 
that would spoil the view from the river 
we dont intend to destroy the landscape or the area in any 
way he said from his office in espanola 
cook also said he has no plans for the 1700 acres other than to 
mine it but his opponents fear he would develop condominiums or 
other commercial ventures in the forest 
environmentalists also are worried that the beautiful jemez area 
a popular tourist destination will turn into a pumicemining center 
the copar pumice is the remnant of a volcanic explosion 150000 
years ago and is considered valuable because of its largesized 
chunks its purity and its proximity to the highway 
pumice goes into products ranging from building materials to 
toothpaste 
its use as an industrial abrasive including stonewashing 
garments to give them an aged appearance is a small but growing 
segment of the market said donna smith a mineral economist who 
lives near the mine 
copar however is not a major pumice supplier to the garment 
industry cook said about 10 percent of the mines pumice goes for 
stonewashing far less than was anticipated when the mine opened 
the garment industry just isnt taking all the large chunks 
now cook said 
most of copars pumice is used for construction he said 
industry spokesmen say much of the pumice used by major garment 
manufacturers is imported 
levi strauss amp co for example buys its pumice from turkey for 
its products that are stone or acidwashed and has cut back about 
60 percent on the amount of pumice it uses supplementing the stone 
with chemicals said company spokesman david samson in san francisco 
although only a fraction of copars product ends up in the 
industrial machines in which denim is stonewashed opponents of the 
mine have urged a boycott of stonewashed clothes 
the east fork preservation coalition and other environmental 
groups also are pushing a proposal to have 115000 acres including 
the mine site designated as a national recreation area which they 
say would stop the patent process and offer greater protection for 
the forest 
there are efforts too to reform the 118yearold mining law 
including two bills that have been introduced in congress to revamp 
it 
the copar mine is one of a series of disputes arising from the 
law and an example of why it should be changed said philip hocker 
president of the mineral policy center in washington dc 
the law says that anybody who finds a valuable mineral deposit 
in the public domain has a right to mine it no matter what the 
environmental consequences and with no payment to the public he 
said thats whats wrong with it

hordes of high school and college graduates are 
making the rounds of job interviews and those facetoface meetings 
can be crucial to landing employment 
a goodlooking resume and thorough job application are a good 
start but those efforts lead to the interview the makeorbreak 
moment in getting the job 
think of the man standing on a subway platform in new york 
holding a violin case he asks a conductor how do you get to 
carnegie hall 
the conductor answers practice practice practice 
thats the case in job interviews too 
consider beforehand what may be asked practice questions and 
answers with a friend and dont get discouraged if it takes several 
tries to land a job each interview is good practice for the next 
one 
time is important in business so the first thing to remember is 
to be on time for the interview start out early and arrive a little 
early if possible and dont bring anyone along for moral support 
appearance is also important say experts at the labor 
department the job interview is not a good time to express 
individuality or eccentricity in dress or grooming 
the clothing worn to an interview depends to some extent on the 
job being applied for but in all cases should be clean neat and 
conservative 
men labor department officials say should wear suits or shirts 
and slacks dresses are best for women 
think in advance about how to answer some of the most likely 
questions such as why you want to work for that particular company 
what your interests and goals are and how you can help the company 
this requires learning something about the company beforehand 
either from library reading or by talking to people who work there 
in answering questions pause to compose an answer that is 
concise and to the point this requires careful listening to make 
sure you understand the questions and be sure to let the 
interviewer finish the question dont interrupt 
if you dont understand a question ask the interviewer what he 
or she means then answer honestly 
sometimes people will ask why you left a former job tell the 
truth but do not say negative things about former employers such 
remarks may be interpreted as unwillingness on your part to 
cooperate 
two of the hardest questions to deal with are the openended 
ones such as tell me about yourself and what can i do for 
you 
the idea is to get you talking and the best answer is to narrow 
down the focus to the reasons why you are a good candidate for the 
job in question 
dont just ramble on about yourself describing longterm goals 
or saying such things as id like to utilize my education or i 
like to work with people 
better is something more specific such as ive always had an 
interest in wholesale sales in the electronic industry and i have 
studied marketing which should help me in this job 
there are some questions employers are not supposed to ask unless 
they pertain to the job such as marital status family planning and 
childcare arrangements some will ask anyway and its probably 
best to go ahead and answer 
the focus in a first interview should be on the company and what 
you can do for it not on pay and fringe benefits information on 
those things should be available from the personnel department at 
any rate reserve the discussion of pay until a job offer is made 
at the end of the interview ask what the next step will be 
whether you should contact the company again or provide more 
information if the company will call you and when a final decision 
is likely to be made 
try to end on a positive note repeating your interest in the job 
after the interview send a note to the interviewer thanking him 
or her for the time and providing any added information that may 
have been requested

after the tony what 
that is the happy question facing the seattle repertory theater 
which is being presented the top award for a regional stage company 
on sunday night in new york 
from the 27yearold theater that first produced im not 
rappaport the heidi chronicles eastern standard and 
largely new york the answer seems to be to try to do more of 
the same and keep getting better 
major breakthroughs construction of a new playhouse in 1983 
production of awardwinning new plays and formation of a resident 
acting company came well before the theater awards were announced 
on may 7 
i think we could have won at any time in the last five years 
and it would have been appropriate said artistic director daniel 
sullivan 
a lot of people said that it was only a matter of time other 
people said it was late in coming said managing director benjamin 
moore it came as a surprise to me 
the rep reached tony caliber 10 years ago said peter donnelly 
moores predecessor as top administrator of the rep and now director 
of corporate council for the arts a fundraising group 
the tony i think is kind of an achievement award as opposed 
to a best of kind of thing donnelly said 
i think that its certainly a nice imprimatur to have 
sullivan agreed our goals have been pretty high for the last few 
years and i dont think thats going to change because of the 
tony 
in the past 11 years the rep has developed more than 35 new 
plays several of which moved on to productions in new york and 
london 
sullivan also has returned to acting after a 25year hiatus in 
addition to originating herb gardners rappaport and wendy 
wassersteins heidi which won tonys in 1987 and 1989 
respectively 
heidi also won a pulitzer prize and the drama desk and new 
york drama critics awards sullivan was nominated for a tony for 
best director 
the premiere of lyle kesslers robbers last fall at the rep 
provided his latest role mr feathers a seemingly mysterious 
american indian who hires an aimless innocent young man into 
private eye work to stop employee theft at a cannery 
in a tragic surreal and hilarious emotional roller coaster of a 
plot feathers turns out to be white and cynical and the young man 
realizes he has betrayed his new lover and closest friend 
i read plays as an actor sullivan said i try to find 
truth that i think an actor would find 
a top goal for the rep now is to boost the number of actors in 
the company from the current dozen to about 20 moore said we 
also want to begin commissioning new work not just soliciting new 
scripts 
as a third goal he said that within the next three to five years 
he would like to see construction of a 275seat house to complement 
the 856seat main stage in the bagley wright theater at the seattle 
center 
with attendance at 90 percent of capacity or better for the past 
decade all three goals require more money than ticket sales can 
provide and thats where the tony is most valuable sullivan and 
moore said 
for starters the award carries a 25000 grant from american 
express 
ive been telling everyone we like the recognition but most 
of all we like the money especially in these days of creeping 
censorship from the federal government through restrictions on the 
national endowment for the arts sullivan said we like to get 
money without strings attached 
the recognition also makes them more appealing to funding 
sources said moore managing director at the much larger american 
conservatory theater in san francisco for 15 years before moving to 
the rep in 1985 
this is recognition that these theaters cannot achieve within 
their own communities he said its only when people hear from 
professionals outside their own communities that suddenly their 
stock goes up 
the awards named for early 20thcentury actress producer and 
director antoinette perry have been awarded since 1947 the 
regional award dates from 1976 
rather than starting as the vision of an artist as is true with 
most performing arts groups the rep was organized by local theater 
fans after century 21 the 1962 worlds fair 
an initial attempt to form an actors company quickly collapsed

successful and acclaimed women in television 
i really quarrel with the assumption that good programming is 
bad business rees said in an interview people are turning away 
from the networks not because its bad business theyre turning 
away because its bad programming 
at marian rees associates inc an independent production 
company rees has formed an alliance with hallmark hall of fame

for television and has nine movies in various stages of development

outright exploitation and she was glad the show fared poorly in 
the ratings

status and a refined ride come standard with the 1990 jaguar 
vanden plas sedan so does a sense of accomplishment 
the vanden plas is after all the top of jaguars standard 
production line for the united states and if the cars 48000 
price tag doesnt show that youve arrived the jaguars sleek body 
lines and soothing quiet interior will 
this is indeed a car thats meant as a reward 
thats why so many buyers are wellheeled chief executives and 
business owners jaguar spokesman mike cook said buyers are 
typically in their mid to upper 40s and are highly educated nearly 
half are women and average annual income of vanden plas purchasers 
is more than 200000 
the car comes with a host of standard features including 
sunroof a leather interior that uses no less than seven animal 
hides and polished burl walnut on the dashboard doors and the 
front seatbacks 
the vanden plas comes with fuzzy synthetic mats over the regular 
floor mats for added softness and comfort a premium sound system 
automatic leveling suspension and a 271page owners manual 
jaguar has increased its fuelinjected sixcylinder engine from 
36 liters to 4 boosting output by 12 percent to 223 horsepower 
the result is 060 mph acceleration in less than 9 seconds 
the gearshift features a sport setting that allows the driver to 
change the transmissions shift points for added pickup but even 
that wont do terrible damage to fuel economy during the test 
drive i averaged close to 20 miles per gallon in mixed cityhighway 
driving using the sport and regular settings intermittently 
front seats were comfortable for me with electronic adjustments 
and lumbar support for individual setting but a friend who has 
thicker hips and legs found the driver seat a bit confining his 
right leg bumped against the parking brake lever situated to the 
left of the center console next to the driver seat 
rear legroom was admirable even with the front seats pushed all 
the way back but the middle passenger must sit on a rather stiff 
seat area it has a storage bin underneath the seat leather and 
headroom isnt the greatest either the back seat is much better 
suited for only two passengers 
the trunk was low with 127 cubic feet of usable space once the 
big spare tire was in there fit and finish as expected was 
excellent inside and out 
jaguar has seen its us car sales fall off since 1986 when 
sales hit 24464 they fell to 22919 in 1987 as the company lost 
production during its changeover to a newmodel xj6 cook said he 
attributed the continued sales slide to 20727 in 1988 and 18967 
in 1989 to a soft luxury market in the united states 
the company hopes to push unit sales beyond 20000 again this 
year competitors in the luxury sedan class include the lexus ls400 
which starts at 35000 the infiniti q45 at 38000 bmw 735i 
nearly 50000 and the mercedesbenz 300 series which starts at 
just under 40000 
consumer reports magazine ranks 198488 jaguar xj6 models as 
much worse than average in owner complaints of trouble cook 
acknowledged that early 1988 models had some problems but said 
corrections have been made

john a mulheren jr kept his firms stock 
holdings in unocal corp off of profit and loss statements because 
the shares really belonged to ivan boesky a former partner of 
mulheren said in federal court 
the testimony thursday by edward mccarthy once a partner in 
jamie securities co appeared to directly link mulheren to what the 
governmnent charges was an illegal trading scheme to help boesky 
cheat on taxes and skirt federal laws 
also boeskys former chief trader told a federal judge he 
regularly takes a drug used to control anxiety or tension the 
trader a government witness made the admission at the request of 
defense lawyers who claimed the drug could affect memory 
testifying under immunity from prosecution mccarthy said 
mulheren in 1985 asked him to separate trading in unocal from the 
firms profit and loss statements because the holdings belonged to 
boesky 
he also said the firm temporarily held four large securities 
positions for boesky in 1985 because boesky needed money to comply 
with federal net capital laws 
the governments charges against mulheren include manipulating a 
stock price and parking securities to help boesky 
the government claims mulheren bought 10 million in unocal 
shares from boesky in mid1985 with an agreement to sell back the 
stock at a later date the parking arrangement allegedly was 
designed to help boesky create the appearance of losses for tax 
purposes 
in addition mulheren is accused of holding large options 
positions in four companies to help boesky temporarily raise money 
to meet federal laws governing the amount of capital a securities 
firm must hold 
the trial has attracted widespread attention because it marked 
the first time boesky has testified publicly since he settled 
insider trading charges 3 years ago 
boesky was once wall streets bestknown speculator and his 
cooperation with investigators has led to numerous prosecutions he 
took the stand last week to implicate mulheren a former friend and 
associate 
mccarthy 39 of freehold nj said mulheren in the late summer 
or early fall of 1985 asked him whether jamie had the buying power 
to purchase the options because boesky had problems with his 
capital 
mccarthy said mulheren later told him and another partner that 
boesky wanted his money back from trading profits jamie made in 
the deal previous testimony by michael davidoff boeskys former 
chief trader placed the amount at around 2 million 
mccarthy said that when he suggested writing boesky a check 
mulheren laughed and then devised a scheme under which boeskys 
seemala corp would inflate brokerage fee bills to pay back the 
money 
mulheren 40 is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy securities 
and mail fraud and recordkeeping violations 
also thursday davidoff said in a closeddoor hearing before us 
district judge miriam goldman cederbaum that he has taken a drug for 
four or five years to control high blood pressure and nervousness 
defense lawyers said they wanted to find out whether davidoff was 
on medication because it may have affected his recollection of 
events mulheren attorney thomas puccio said a doctor told him the 
drug ativan could affect memory and that the issue would be 
raised monday before cederbaum 
the government sought to prevent disclosure apparently out of 
fear it could tarnish davidoffs testimony 
according to the physicians desk reference ativan is a brand 
name for the drug lorazepam it is taken for the management of 
anxiety disorders or for the shortterm relief of the symptoms of 
anxiety or anxiousness associated with depressive symptoms the 
text says 
davidoff previously testified about the alleged unocal and 
options parking transactions he has pleaded guilty to one felony 
count agreed to cooperate with the government and is awaiting 
sentencing

an impasse between the united states and its 
european trading partners over cutting farm subsidies threatens to 
block a fouryear effort to liberalize the global trading system 
government officials said 
the warnings came at the end of a twoday meeting of trade and 
finance officials from two dozen industrialized nations 
officials had hoped the meeting would generate fresh momentum in 
the trade talks but instead they ended on a discordant note as the 
european community refused to accept us demands to sharply curtail 
its farm supports and export subsidies 
the trading blocs argument is simply not a tenable longterm 
position said gareth evans australias foreign affairs minister 
they will be putting at risk not just agriculture but the whole 
round of trade negotiations if they stick to a position as tight 
as that he said 
ministers of the organization for economic cooperation and 
development ended their talks thursday by saying they agreed to 
take urgent steps to reform agricultural policy as regards support 
and protection so as to permit greater liberalization of trade 
but in an unusual move their closing statement acknowledged 
differences on how an approach to these objectives should be 
expressed at this stage 
it was better to express these differences of views publicly 
than to try to paper them over said oecd secretarygeneral 
jeanclaude paye 
some 100 nations have been attempting to forge a new agreement to 
reduce trade barriers in 15 areas including agriculture textiles 
and services the talks began in uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled 
to end in december 
us trade representative carla hills had wanted this weeks oecd 
meeting to give a push to the trade talks but the talks appeared to 
do little more than show how far apart the two sides are 
at the heart of the fight is an american demand that the 
12nation ec do much more to rein in government spending on farm 
subsidies in particular by moving to eliminate costly export 
subsidies 
but ray macsharry the trading blocs top farm official said 
that is politically impossible and will not happen 
he contended that getting rid of the program would translate into 
higher farm prices in europe and cost the jobs of millions of 
farmers 
the subsidies allows expensive european farm products to compete 
with lower prices on the world market 
the united states complains the subsidies have enabled the 
community to increase its share of the world market and has 
responded by setting up its own export subsidy program 
american officials also pressed the community to open its markets 
wider to foreign farm products and reduce farm payments that 
encourage overproduction of crops 
the community rebuffed the pressure it called instead for an 
attempt to lower farm payments by first measuring a countrys trade 
performance in agriculture 
the ministers did promise to to make every effort to overcome 
the differences by a july 23 bargaining session in geneva by 
then the united states wants preliminary agreements or negotiating 
texts in all 15 areas under discussion 
the uruguay round of trade talks is being held under the auspices 
of the general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and agreement 
for promoting freer trade

if an employee buyout can solve an airlines woes 
striking greyhound drivers think the same strategy could rescue the 
only nationwide bus company from the brink of bankruptcy 
a financial advisor hired by the drivers has asked to meet with 
greyhound lines inc to discuss a possible employee buyout 
the advisor brian freeman isnt new to the idea he is advising 
ual corp employees on their effort to complete a proposed 454 
billion buyout of the parent of united airlines 
in a letter dated may 29 to greyhound management and creditors 
freeman said he believed 100 percent employee ownership of all 
transportation operating and related assets together with a 
significant creditor restructuring is the best solution to the 
companys troubles 
freeman said thursday a price for a greyhound buyout had not been 
determined and no financing had been arranged although he said 
money should be available 
he said the union also is willing to discuss other alternatives 
within the shortterm i intend to make a specific proposal 
and begin to press aggressively toward a resolution freeman wrote 
on behalf of the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
please advise me immediately whether you wish to explore mutual 
problem solving otherwise i will proceed on my own freeman 
wrote i intend to place my client in a position so that either 
cooperatively or independently it can make a specific proposal and 
press forward within the next several weeks 
greyhounds initial response wasnt positive 
we are surprised the group that has brought about the companys 
current financial crisis through an unprecedented wave of violence 
now proposes to profit from its own criminal activity by buying the 
company said executive vice president p anthony lannie 
greyhound has reported more than two dozen incidents of violence 
since its drivers went on strike on march 2 
the company has been operating reduced schedules since the strike 
began using newly hired drivers and about 500 union members who 
crossed picket lines 
although the company claims the strike is irrelevant because 
it has enough drivers to operate the strike has drained its cash 
and left it in danger of having to file for bankruptcy protection 
greyhound already has missed more than 14 million in interest 
and lease payments since the end of april and faces an additional 
25 million payment on friday 
unless those payments are met soon creditors could force the 
company into involuntary bankruptcy although greyhound likely would 
file for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws before that happened 
the companys debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout three 
years ago led by chairman fred g currey that took the company 
private 
currey and other investors paid 270 million for the bus 
operations of greyhound corp since renamed greyhound dial corp a 
few months they paid an additional 80 million for dallasbased 
trailways lines inc then the nations largest operator of 
trailways buses 
greyhound has proposed to repurchase most of its 225 million in 
junk bond debt at a steep discount to enable the company to avoid 
bankruptcy 
the repurchase is tied to greyhound obtaining as much as 150 
million in new financing however a task some analysts doubt can be 
accomplished in light of greyhounds labor troubles and the state of 
the financial markets 
further clouding greyhounds future is a finding by the national 
labor relations board that the company engaged in unfair labor 
practices by implementing its contract proposal immediately after 
the strike began 
an administrative law judge will hear arguments in the case in 
milwaukee on sept 17 beginning a process that could take years to 
end and result in the bus company being forced to pay about 10 
million a month in back wages 
greyhound says it is confident it will win once the case gets in 
court

ual corp stock soared after former chrysler vice 
chairman gerald greenwald was chosen to head an employee buyout of 
united airlines parent but analysts suggested that his appointment 
alone wont seal the deal 
while he has a good record on financial matters the airline 
industry is unique robert joedicke an airline specialist for 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york said thursday 
joedicke said bankers who must finance the deal will want to see 
a chief operating officer with a strong knowledge of the airline 
business 
the key requirement it that there is someone there that 
understands how to run an airline he said 
greenwald acknowledged as much at a news conference in highland 
park mich he said one of his first tasks would be to seek someone 
from the airline industry as second in command 
bankers are familar with greenwald himself he played major roles 
in securing federal government loans that saved chrysler from 
bankruptcy in 1979 and in negotiating the purchase of american 
motors corp in 1987 
on thursday the price of ual stock surged 475 on the new york 
stock exchange to 15562 
still that was well below the 201 offer made by the united 
employees acquisition corp which indicates that some investors 
remain skeptical that the deal will come off joedicke said 
other analysts said caution prevails given the employees failure 
to raise financing for a 300ashare buyout offer last october 
that triggered a massive 190point freefall in the dow jones 
industrial average 
greenwald vice chairman of chrysler since november 1988 will 
become chief executive officer of the buyout corporation an entity 
formed by the airlines three major unions 
if the acquisition attempt is successful greenwald 54 will 
become chairman and chief executive officer of chicagobased ual 
corp and united airlines he would replace ual chairman stephen 
wolf who has been targeted for ouster by the unions 
ual spokesman tony molinaro said wolf would have no comment on 
his fate 
in a statement wolf said i congratulate our union leaders for 
recruiting someone of jerry greenwalds stature as he proceeds to 
finance the transaction i will be as helpful to him as possible 
greenwald said he began seriously considering joining the ual 
buyout effort 10 days ago about five weeks after he was first 
contacted by the group 
the offer kept getting more tempting he said at one 
point i wasnt at all clear who was going to be running the 
company my mind changed from it being a problem to being an 
opportunity about 10 days ago 
the offer by the buyout group the air line pilots assocation 
the machinists union and the association of flight attendants is 
made up of 155 in cash 35 in highyield notes and 11 a share 
from uals 51 percent stake in covia the companys computer 
reservation system 
the ual board has given the buyout group until aug 9 to come up 
with the financing

chrysler corp wasted little time in tapping a 
successor to former vice chairman gerald greenwald by moving chief 
financial officer robert s miller one step closer to the chairmans 
office 
miller 48 was named vice chairman of the nations no 3 
automaker thursday afternoon less than 24 hours after greenwalds 
resignation was announced 
the latest moves in the executive suite of chryslers highland 
park headquarters come as the company is fighting to hold its 
declining market share in the face of tough domestic and overseas 
competition 
greenwald who was heir apparent to chrysler chairman lee 
iacocca quit wednesday to head up a threeunion bid to buy united 
airlines parent company for 454 billion 
in the management shuffle chrysler obliterated the office of the 
chairman an indication that iacocca may be reasserting himself in 
corporate operations 
iacoccas contract expires at the end of 1991 a year ago he 
said he was reducing his daytoday input into chryslers car and 
truck making operations but at the companys annual meeting in los 
angeles last month the colorful 65yearold iacocca hedged on 
whether he would retire next year 
ive got to think that iacocca has got to come out and stay 
beyond 91 auto analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co said 
thursday 
before the announcement of millers rise he and chrysler motors 
president robert lutz were seen as likely successors to greenwald 
miller has focused on the companys financial operations while 
lutz has concentrated on product development 
after the announcement miller consolidated his hold on 
chryslers financial operations by assuming greenwalds duties of 
overseeing chrysler financial corp chrysler technologies and the 
companys international operations 
meantime lutz took over greenwalds chores of supervising 
acustar chryslers parts subsidiary and the office of quality and 
productivity both productoriented 
miller lutz and chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell each 
will report to iacocca bidwell 62 reportedly has been working a 
light schedule lately and may take early retirement 
greenwald and miller shared much of the responsibility of helping 
put together a series of federally guaranteed loans to rescue 
chrysler from a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1970s and early 
1980s 
miller now faces more tough financial work as chrysler wrestles 
with sagging profits in a weak car and truck market 
chryslers firstquarter earnings dropped 80 percent to 71 
million from yearago levels the companys car and truck market 
share as of the end of april stood at 124 percent down nearly 2 
percentage points from a year earlier 
analysts said the drop in profits was less than they expected 
but they predicted that an interruption of production of chryslers 
highly profitable minivans this summer could put the company in the 
red for the third quarter 
also later this year chrysler is due to wind up a costcutting 
program designed to trim 15 billion from annual expenses and 
negotiate a new contract with the united auto workers 
all are formidable chores for an automaker executive 
greenwald said his first task will be to put together financing 
to pay for the unions united buyout bid by aug 9 
although greenwald said the main reason he decided to quit was to 
take on the united challenge analysts and others have wondered if 
he was getting tired of waiting for iacocca to retire 
i think he recognizes that lee is probably going to be around 
for an extended period of time said auto analyst joseph phillippi 
of shearson lehman hutton of new york even if lee were to become 
chairman only and jerry were to become ceo hes still going to have 
the old boss looking over his shoulder 
that may have bothered him a lot

t boone pickens doesnt think much of his old home 
town and has predicted a dire future for amarillo but a local 
businessman has challenged the oilman to back up his words with a 
100000 
in a letter that became public in amarillo this week pickens 
said the panhandle city is headed for a steady rapid downhill 
slide and said the population would dip below 100000 by 2000 a 
drop of nearly 40 percent 
i sure do like this town and i dont like anybody taking shots 
at it said jerry hodge who described himself as friends with 
pickens 
the city has been struggling since the mid1980s because of the 
collapse of the energy industry 
pickens left amarillo last year as both he and some top 
executives of his mesa limited partnership moved to dallas 
the departure came after years of feuding with the citys 
newspaper and officials shortly before he left voters defeated all 
candidates for the amarillo city commission perceived as being 
backed by pickens 
although pickens never gave a clear reason for leaving amarillo 
in a letter last month to a friend who was moving back to the town 
he said i know that there were better places to live than 
amarillo probably the biggest problem the town has is no 
leadership 
the city has now moved basically to a bluecollar district 
pickens said in the letter which became public this week in 
amarillo and was a hot topic on local television news

the town as a truck stop i think within 10 years the town 
will have less than 100000 people

the loser will present his money at a dinner prepared by the 
blue collar workers of amarillo or by dallas white collar

the governmentsponsored enterprises that help 
finance a fourth of the nations singlefamily homes are vulnerable 
to an economic downturn according to a bush administration study 
three trends during the 1980s have so far insulated fannie mae 
and freddie mac from a slowdown in the economy said the 480page 
study released thursday 
these are rapid inflation of housing prices an ample supply of 
firsttime home buyers from the baby boom generation and fast growth 
in the packaging of mortgages into securities 
however all three trends are ending the study said noting that 
for fannie mae the biggest credit risk is a regional or national 
economic slowdown 
fannie mae the federal national mortgage association and 
freddie mac the federal home loan mortgage corp are 
congressionally chartered but privately owned enterprises together 
they help finance one of every four singlefamily home sales by 
purchasing mortgages holding some and repackaging most into 
securities for resale to investors 
because they were created by congress and dominate so much of the 
housing market the agencies are perceived as having the 
governments implicit guarantee against default 
last years savings and loan bailout bill passed by congress 
ordered the treasury department to evaluate the risks posed to 
taxpayers from a default by fannie mae freddie mac and seven other 
similar governmentsponsored enterprises that back loans to 
homebuyers students and farmers 
the treasury forwarded its recommendations for improving federal 
oversight of the enterprises to congress two weeks ago but 
thursdays report provided the first look at the bush 
administrations evaluation of individual organizations 
none of the governmentsponsored enterprises are in imminent 
danger but obviously some are stronger and some are weaker 
treasury undersecretary robert glauber said 
fannie mae and freddie mac account for about threequarters of 
the enterprises 863 billion in debt outstanding at the end of last 
year 
in general freddie mac received the more favorable evaluation 
the report said fannie mae needed a bigger cushion of capital from 
its shareholders to insulate taxpayers from risk 
nevertheless the report said it had concerns in the long run 
with freddie mac because its capital standard does not discourage 
risktaking 
it said fannie mae was more vulnerable to swings in interest 
rates and that a change of 4 or 5 percentage points could wipe out 
fannie maes net worth if it were forced to mark its holdings to 
market value 
fannie mae holds more mortgages in its investment portfolio than 
freddie mac it finances its holdings with borrowed money so its 
costs rise if interest rates go up higher rates also tend to deter 
homebuyers and dampen house prices 
both enterprises maintain they are wellpositioned to withstand 
an economic downturn but the treasury criticized the stress 
tests the two devised it said the tests intended to show how the 
enterprises would fare during a recession depend too heavily on 
statistical assumptions that may not prove true 
the treasury also noted that fannie mae has concentrated slightly 
more than half of its activity in just five states california new 
york florida new jersey and texas 
david jeffers fannie mae vice president said his organization 
has already launched a program to bolster its capital but he 
rejected the notion that it needed to change its operations 
radically he said fannie mae was welldiversified geographically 
we have demonstrated our ability to manage our business in a 
prudent and profitable way we dont see any need to change the 
course were on he said 
freddie mac president leland brendsel said in a statement our 
capital base will remain strong in the long run 
the other enterprises included in the study are the federal home 
loan bank system farm credit banks banks for cooperatives farm 
credit system financial assistance corp federal agricultural 
mortgage association farmer mac student loan marketing 
association sallie mae and college construction loan insurance 
association connie lee 
in its previous suggestions for reform the treasury department 
called for raising more private capital to back the enterprises 
requiring the enterprises to obtain a triplea rating from private 
creditrating agencies and designating a separate federal office to 
monitor the safety and soundness of the enterprises

usda officials say recent tests show consumers 
run little health risk from drug chemical and pesticide residues in 
meat and poultry 
the residue rates are the lowest theyve been in years 
richard l carnevale assistant deputy administrator of usdas food 
safety and inspection service told a news briefing thursday 
at the session he released latest results of tests performed on 
cattle calves swine goats sheep chickens turkeys ducks and 
other animals 
usda officials acknowledged an increase in concern among 
consumers over residues of pesticides other farm chemicals such as 
fertilizers and drugs in the food they purchase for their tables 
such residues are found when drugs such as antibiotics and sulfa 
have been administered improperly and when the animals have eaten 
feed that was sprayed with chemicals 
carnevale said however that pesticide and chemical residues 
were not shown to exist in illegal levels in the most recent tests 
and that only a few problems were found with drug residues 
illegal levels of residues were found in only 03 percent of the 
41505 samples tested in the agencys routine monitoring last year 
he said 
the food safety and inspection service conducts three types of 
residue testing programs carnevale said the routine monitoring 
system provides us with the most meaningful residue statistics 
young veal calves were one area of concern he said he said 
producers and other custodians of the bob veal calves are being 
required to sign statements concerning the administration of drugs 
before slaughter 
tests also showed high levels of sulfa residues in cull dairy 
cows ones that are no longer producing milk and are on their way 
to slaughter carnevale said he said dairy producers were being 
notified to step up controls

the agriculture department announced it has 
quarantined 81 square miles of dade county fla following the 
discovery of 19 mediterranean fruit flies in the miami area 
our quarantine is designed to prevent the spread of medfly 
said james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service 
the action thursday followed a request last week by florida 
agriculture commissioner doyle conner to the department to 
quarantine the entire state of california for combat a medfly 
outbreak 
the department confirmed that it has no plans to expand its 
current quarantine of parts of southern california 
the fly attacks more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables 
citrus is especially vulnerable with losses of 25 percent to 50 
percent of production likely in cases of severe infestation 
we feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is 
quarantined are adequate at this point to prevent the spread of 
medflies said spokesman larry mark 
he said the decision not to expand the quarantine was made 
wednesday after the national plant board advisory council meeting 
here recommended no change for at least 30 days

an official of the international monetary fund 
is laying out stiff conditions for an effective shift from communism 
to a market economy in eastern europe 
thomas a wolf senior economist in the funds european 
department spoke thursday at a forum unrelated to the ussoviet 
summit meeting by coincidence he outlined his ideas just after 
president mikhail gorbachev at the soviet embassy a few blocks 
away made a plea to americans to let the soviets find their own way 
toward a system run on market principles 
the bush administration has opposed the soviet union joining the 
152 members of the imf and its sister organization the world bank 
present members include poland hungary and romania officials 
elsewhere in eastern europe including the soviet union have said 
they want to join too 
wolf listed five areas in which he said comprehensive reforms are 
needed in eastern europe he did not specify any country 
without action in each of these five areas a marketoriented 
reform will not be comprehensive and therefore is bound not to meet 
objectives of the reformers he said 
wolf said eastern european countries should 
eliminate much of the economic bureaucracy and let enterprises 
make their own decisions on matters such as prices wages 
employment investment output and foreign trade one way to do that 
is to make profit the main motivation for managers he said and 
another is to clearly define property rights 
initiate price reforms either by changing the governmentfixed 
prices to bring them close to the balance between supply and demand 
or by freeing prices entirely from government control or anything 
in between 
make wages depend on how much workers produce 
change the system of foreign trade including the buying and 
selling of foreign currencies 
create a new system of government influence on the economy 
since the state will no longer control enterprises directly it must 
influence them indirectly through taxes official spending and 
monetary policy as western governments now do 
its not enough to give enterprises greater autonomy or greater 
authority wolf said they need to be given incentives to use 
the authority that they are suddenly given 
but giving enterprises greater authority and greater incentive 
is still not enough he said 
they have to be given the responsibility to act through the 
market in order to raise or maximize profits and to raise wages in 
other words not to have the possibility of achieving those goals of 
higher profits and wages by negotiating special deals with the 
economic bureaucracy

chinas civil aviation administration has ordered 
36 boeing jetliners and taken options on 36 more in a deal that 
could be worth up to 4 billion boeing commercial airplane group 
said 
the order announced thursday includes five 747400 jumbo jets 
one 747200f a jumbo freighter four widebody 767s 13 midsized 
757s and 13 737300s a smaller twinjet three of the 757s were 
announced late last year 
the firm orders are worth about 2 billion boeing spokesman john 
wheeler said but the options which include nearly the same types 
of airplanes could bring the total package to 4 billion 
deliveries will start in 1992 and extend into the late 1990s 
wheeler said 
the civil aviation administration oversees the purchase of 
aircraft for chinas airlines the new jetliners will be used by air 
china guangzhou caac china southwest airlines and others boeing 
said 
attending a signing ceremony in renton wash were hu yizhou 
director general of caac zhu qizhen chinas ambassador to the 
united states and liu yuanfan president of china aviation supplies 
corp 
the order comes a week after the bush administration said it 
would renew mostfavorednation status for china a designation that 
gives the country the lowest available tariffs on exports to the 
united states 
nicholas lardy a professor of chinese studies at the university 
of washington seattle said he doubted there was any connection 
between bushs decision and the deal negotiations have been 
proceeding for a long time he noted 
the chinese government has been working to integrate itself into 
the world economy lardy said adding that this deal suggests their 
talk is more than just rhetoric 
but wheeler and others said they doubt china would have placed 
such an order without the favorable trade pact 
it stands to reason that if the status were changed it would 
obviously alter their whole approach to capital goods wheeler 
said 
dean thornton president of boeing commercial airplane group 
noted that boeing was the first us company to sell to china when 
the two countries established relations in 1972 since then china 
has purchased 101 boeing planes the company said 
a plant in xian china already manufactures tail fins for boeing 
737s 
the chinese order brings total boeing orders this year to 187 
aircraft valued at about 162 billion

lower auto and steel exports combined with higher 
imports of oil autos art and airplanes drove japans current 
account surplus down by the steepest amount in 10 years 
the surplus in the current account which measures trade in 
goods services and transfer payments fell 70 percent in april from 
a year earlier to 2 billion the surplus totaled 658 billion in 
april 1989 
it was the sharpest drop since the surplus contracted 95 percent 
in june 1979 
the current account is falling over the long term and 
eventually the surplus is going to shrink away said jan 
vandenberg an economist with merrill lynch in tokyo the vast 
majority of it is due to consumption demand in japan growing 
quite rapidly 
she said demand in japan is growing by about 4 percent a year 
compared to less than 2 percent a year in the united states 
aprils trade surplus which measures only trade in goods shrank 
50 percent to 402 billion the ministry said 
imports measured on the basis of settled contracts rose 17 
percent from yearago levels to 172 billion while exports fell 7 
percent to 212 billion the ministry said it was the seventh 
consecutive month exports have declined 
part of the decline was due to the weaker yen which reduced the 
value of japanese exports in dollar terms because of the time lag 
before lower prices result in higher export volume 
the dollar was trading at an average of 15720 yen in april 
compared to 13212 yen a year earlier a 16 percent devaluation 
finance ministry officials noted 
automobile exports in april fell 19 percent from a year earlier 
the sharpest drop in 20 years ministry officials said this was 
unusual because japanese automakers usually boost exports at the 
beginning of the new fiscal year in april after failing to fill 
export quotas for the previous year 
auto imports rose for the fifth month in a row up 72 percent in 
april last year 
steel exports dropped 23 percent in april the sixth month in a 
row that they have fallen about 20 percent from yearearlier levels 
the ministry said much of the decline was attributed to strong 
domestic demand for steel 
electric machinery exports fell 6 percent and semiconductor 
exports fell 85 percent 
meanwhile oil imports rose 22 percent along with heavy 
production by the organization of petroleum exporting countries and 
speculation that prices will rise in the future the ministry said 
aircraft imports rose 240 percent timber and wood imports rose 
42 percent and painting and art imports tripled 
invisible trade which includes transactions in insurance 
shipping tourism and other services posted a 184 billion deficit 
in april compared with a deficit of 129 billion a year earlier 
the ministry said the deficit was largely due to huge royalty 
payments by foreign affiliate firms in japan to their parent 
companies overseas 
large purchases of foreign securities by japanese investors 
produced a deficit of 53 billion in the longterm capital account 
down from a 164 billion deficit a year earlier 
an advisory council of the finance ministry said thursday that 
japans trade and current account surplus isnt a problem for the 
world economy and could help finance third world debtor nations and 
the us budget deficit 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto also said friday that the 
surplus could help finance the development of eastern europe but he 
also said japan should consider ways to reduce the surplus 
particularly with respect to the united states 
the current account report does not include breakdowns of trade 
by country or region last month the finance ministry said japans 
monthly trade surplus with the united states fell from 454 billion 
a year earlier to 245 billion

abc has come up with it own way to count 
television viewers next season for purposes of compensating 
advertisers for smallerthanpromised audiences 
in the latest network reaction to an unexplained drop in ac 
nielsen co ratings this year abc announced thursday it will factor 
previous years ratings into its formula for socalled 
makegoods the networks sell commercial time on the basis of 
expected audiences and give advertisers free air time to make 
good for lower ratings 
the abc change will not affect the ratings reported to the 
public which generally have fallen since nielsen switched to a 
people meter system that requires each participating viewer to 
punch in when watching tv 
what were trying to address is the unexplainted volatility 
that happened with the introduction of the people meters in the fall 
of 1987 abc spokesman dick connelly said 
he said thursday that the network had not heard reaction from 
advertisers but several ad agency executives were quoted in the new 
york times today as expressing anger 
betsy frank vice president of the agency saatchi amp saatchi 
called the plan confusing and insulting 
advertisers are about to begin their yearly advance purchases of 
air time which could account for 4 billion of the 9 billion to 
10 billion in total network sales predicted for next fall 
cbs which has been running third in the ratings had no comment 
on abcs action said cbs spokesman michael silver nbc spokesman 
curt block said that toprated network is trying to work out an 
arrangement of its own with advertisers that is fair to 
everbody 
last month a group representing the networks and the national 
association of broadcasters asked nielsen to study new ways of 
counting viewers 
nielsen which says it has found no flaws in its peoplemeter 
system said it would consider the request the ratings company 
earns a total of 20 million annually from the three networks 
according to a network executive who spoke on condition of anonymity

the recent plan to slowly shift the soviet union 
toward a market economy has cheered a group of us financiers who 
believe the reforms will bolster their efforts to bring a novel type 
of public finance to moscow 
the group signed an agreement with several soviet entities in 
april to finance three public projects with bonds designed to 
encourage the shift away from central planning and toward the market 
mechanism 
this project can help us find financial instruments that can 
help us solve several problems at the same time said sergei 
plekhanov deputy director of the institute of the usa and canada 
one of the soviet bodies involved in the agreement 
plekhanov said his country has massive social needs that go unmet 
because of its huge budget deficit at the same time households and 
state enterprises are sitting on tens of billions of rubles for want 
of goods to buy 
those problems were among the chief reasons behind the 
governments reform plan announced two weeks ago it laid out a 
fiveyear schedule of food price hikes banking reforms and partial 
privatizations designed to produce a socalled regulated market 
economy 
many radical soviet reformers found the plan too timid they 
criticized the government for backing away from the model created by 
poland which has attempted to move rapidly to a market economy by 
sharply devaluing the currency cutting state subsidies and freeing 
prices 
but jeffrey a sachs who initiated the financing project says 
the soviets gradual strategy is more humane than polishstyle 
shock therapy and more fitting for a country that hasnt known 
a market for 70 years sachs is unrelated to the harvard university 
professor of the same name who helped devise polands program 
rather than shrink the supply of money to match the amount of 
goods in the economy as poland is doing sachs wants to tap into 
the soviets big pool of savings to finance new projects 
using a nonprofit corporation called ecolink sachs group is 
working on plans to issue bonds in the soviet union to finance three 
projects an aids hospital an industrial project most likely a 
grainstorage facility and a prototype network of regional 
financial exchanges 
soviet citizens have a bad taste for bonds because the government 
forced purchases of bonds under stalin and later repudiated them 
also the ruble has little value because it cant be converted into 
western currencies and cant buy much at home 
ecolink argues that bonds can be made palateable however by 
having them pay interest in hard currency or in rubles that will 
guarantee the ability to buy scarce soviet resources the 
instruments could help contain inflation by absorbing excess cash 
and foster a move to allocating goods through the market rather than 
central planning agencies 
hard currency bonds would be appropriate for a grainstorage 
facility sachs suggests already the government spends large 
amounts of hard currency to import grain while perhaps 25 percent of 
soviet harvests rot for lack of storage bins and railroad grain 
cars he says therefore any investments that reduce grain losses 
should save hard currency 
thats an immediate economic benefit that can pay for itself 
says muriel siebert a financial market consultant and former new 
york state banking commissioner who is involved in ecolink 
in april the group asked us financial and legal experts to come 
forward with suggestions to turn the project ideas into reality 
sachs said dozens of investment banks and law firms have expressed 
interest 
the project backers are due to meet in moscow in july to draw up 
solid plans for the aids hospital and decide on the industrial 
project 
work on financial exchanges is just beginning siebert said 
ecolink is likely to propose that exchanges be set up to handle 
commodities that the soviets already have some experience in trading 
grain oil and gold 
talk of bond issues and soviet financial exchanges might have 
seemed farfetched just months ago plekhanov said now all these 
things are very much in line with the official policy i think that 
will speed things up

the 62 branches of western savings amp loan 
association reopen today as branches of bank of america arizona 
following the acquisition of the seized thrifts deposits and branch 
system 
western placed under federal conservatorship in june 1989 was 
put up for sale in january western had lost hundreds of millions of 
dollars during the past two years in realestate loans that soured 
western ranks just under such notorious sampl collapses as lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif and centrust bank of 
miami both expected to cost taxpayers around a record 2 billion 
each 
the acquisition of western by bank of america arizona a 
subsidiary of san franciscobased bankamerica corp was approved by 
the board of the federal resolution trust corp 
we plan to be a significant part of the arizona economy and 
want to build on our local identity said david weymouth 
president of bank of america arizona bank of america arizona is a 
community bank with the backing of a major financial institution 
before acquiring westerns branch system bankamericas presence 
in arizona consisted of two small nonbanking operations in 
phoenix bankamerica sutter mortgage corp an interim construction 
lender with 25 employees and bank of america payroll services a 
payroll processing firm with a staff of 50 
bank of america whose parent is the nations third largest 
holding company estimated its share of the phoenix areas market at 
about 12 percent 
a spokesman for the rtc the federal agency in charge of 
insolvent thrifts said bank of america paid a premium of 812 
million for westerns 34 billion in deposits the bank is 
purchasing 17 billion worth of the thrifts performing assets 
including investmentgrade securities singlefamily home loans and 
consumer loans 
the rtc said it is retaining assets with a book value of 
approximately 29 billion including troubled or nonpaying loans 
commercial and construction loans loans on land and multifamily 
residences and repossessed real estate 
according to the rtc it will pay bank of america 17 billion in 
cash beyond 11 billion in prior cash advances 
with recovery of its cash advances expected through the sale of 
assets not purchased by bank of america the rtcs ultimate cost 
will total an estimated 17 billion the agency said 
western ranks just under such notorious sampl collapses as lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif and centrust bank of 
miami each of which is expected to cost taxpayers a record 2 
billion 
the acquisition was hailed by state banking superintendent hank 
rivoir 
i am looking forward to another major player in the financial 
community rivoir said it will be a benefit to the arizona 
consumer it is good that western has been resolved 
western founded 61 years ago had 61 branches in maricopa 
county which includes phoenix and one in salt lake city the 
branches include 24 in smittys supermarkets 
after reopening under the bank of america name the branches will 
operate under their normal schedules and deposits will be insured 
by the federal deposit insurance corp the rtc said 
losers in the bidding for western included security pacific corp 
and wells fargo amp co 
the state charter was revised under lastminute legislation that 
closed a loophole in arizona interstate banking law a bill was 
rushed through the legislature and signed by gov rose mofford late 
thursday 
rivoir told lawmakers that some attorneys have interpreted the 
states 1985 interstate banking act as allowing outofstate banks 
to buy arizona institutions and operate them as branches without 
being subject to arizona regulations 
the legislation was aimed primarily at bank of america although 
it would apply to the sale of any arizona bank 
peter magnani bankamerica vice president for corporate public 
relations said his bank has had an interest in arizona for many 
years but was not in the financial position to participate when 
interstate banking was permitted as a result of the 1985 law 
besides bank of america bankamericas holdings include seafirst 
corp seattle first national bank and bank of america nevada 
formerly nevada first bank 
this acquisition provides us with an excellent vehicle for 
entering arizona and advancing toward our strategic goal of being 
the premier provider of retail and wholesale financial services in 
the western united states said richard m roseberg bankamerica 
chairman and chief executive

press lawyers expressed disappointment 
that the state supreme court abolished a sales tax exemption after 
ruling the tax was unconstitutionally levied on magazines and not on 
newspapers 
its winning the battle but losing the war said james ervin 
jr a tallahassee lawyer representing several magazines that had 
challenged the states imposition of its 6cent sales tax on 
magazines 
ervin said he was pleased the justices ruled that in the interest 
of freedom of the press there should be no differentiation between 
the two types of publications but he said he was very 
disappointed in the panels 60 opinion thursday extending the tax 
rather than the exemption 
william hyde an attorney representing the florida press 
association said an appeal to the us supreme court is likely 
its making the acquisition of knowledge more difficult hyde 
said 
we think that a tax on the press impermissibly burdens the 
first amendment said laura besvinick an attorney representing 
the miami herald 
sales of all magazines in florida have been taxed since 1987 
when the state dropped an exemption for subscriptions as part of the 
extension of the sales tax to a variety of services and the sale of 
newspapers 
the services tax was repealed a few months later at which time 
newspapers regained their exemption but subscription magazines did 
not magazines sold in stores had been taxed even before 1987 
the magazine publishers of america inc the hearst corp time 
inc golf digesttennis inc and others went to court 
the state department of revenue the press organization and the 
herald argued that the distinction between the two kinds of 
publications should be upheld but while the revenue agency argued 
the tax should be extended to both types of publications the 
newspapers argued the exemption should be extended 
a circuit court in tallahassee ruled for the magazines barring 
the state from collecting taxes the 1st district court of appeal 
passed the issue up to the states high court as a question of 
great public importance 
hyde said he was optimistic the us supreme court would agree to 
review the case because the issue is being considered in courts all 
over the country

manufacturing expanded in may for the second 
straight month with production and new orders leading the way the 
nations purchasing managers said in a survey released today 
economists said the increase showed the manufacuring sector might 
be struggling back but added that that todays unemployment report 
gave a slightly conflicting message 
the government said the unemployment rate fell 01 percentage 
point to 53 percent in may however an increase of 164000 new 
jobs included 145000 temporary census workers private economists 
had expected nongovernment industries to create at least 125000 
new jobs in may far greater than the 19000 that were added 
todays unemployment report just doesnt square with the 
purchasing managers said allen sinai an economist with boston 
co in new york 
probably the purchasing managers survey is reflecting 
strength in aerospace and still reflecting some rebound in autos 
he said adding that recoveries in automobile production apparently 
are not being matched by sales 
the national association of purchasing managements economic 
index rose to 507 percent in may up from 502 percent the month 
before a reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is 
generally expanding below 50 that it is generally declining 
the production index increased significantly from 53 percent in 
april to 563 percent in may new orders increased but at a much 
slower rate than in april 
aprils increase followed 11 straight months of declines the 
group said in a press release from its tempe ariz headquarters 
the purchasing managers report is based on a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies most of 
the figures are adjusted for seasonal factors

early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
there is little news to guide the market so prices might drift 
lower as trading progresses said victor lespinasse of dean witter 
reynolds inc 
soybeans may get a boost due to talk of increased european 
interest in soymeal 
forecasts of severe thunderstorms in much of the midwest over the 
weekend may not have much impact on soybean and corn futures 
lespinasse said adding that weather concerns have already been 
factored into the market 
wheat futures may get a boost from the purchase of 100thousand 
metric tons by china continued delays in the harvesting of the 
winter crop may also lift wheat prices

west germany joined france friday in banning british 
beef imports because of the mad cow disease that has killed 
thousands of cattle and prompted many britons to shun the meat 
however the european community offered a helping hand to 
britains cattle industry by offering to buy 20600 tons of meat 
british officials say the beef poses no threat to people who eat 
it that countrys meat and livestock commission accused the germans 
of responding to fears about a flood of cheap british beef rather 
than concern for public health 
britain made similar charges thursday about the french ban 
france which normally purchases more than half britains 
exported beef imposed its ban wednesday french officials said some 
meat might be tainted by the socalled mad cow disease or 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
the fatal nervous disorder causes a degeneration of brain tissue 
in infected cattle but british officials say there is no evidence 
the disease can be transmitted to humans 
west germany which already had barred imports of british beef 
still on the bone emulated france today by extending the ban to 
canned beef 
the agriculture ministry in bonn said it feared that british beef 
normally destined for france might be rerouted to west germany a 
total ban was necessary to protect consumers from infection the 
ministry said 
a team of french veterinarians sent to britain to assess the 
disease returned today to submit its report frances agriculture 
ministry said no decision on the duration of the ban would be made 
until after a meeting of the european communitys veterinary 
committee 
however british agriculture officials said the committee meeting 
had been postponed indefinitely 
european community officials denounced frances ban thursday as 
illegal and demanded it be revoked 
in brussels belgium ec headquarters announced today that the 
community would buy 20600 tons of british beef to help shore up 
falling meat prices 
the british meat and livestock commission said bans and fears 
arising from the disease are costing their industry about 850000 a 
day beef sales reportedly have fallen by about 30 percent in 
britain 
sir simon gourlay president of the national farmers union in 
britain called for retaliatory action f the bans persist but he 
did not elaborate 
the disease which was identified in britain in 1986 is blamed 
for killing 13648 cows there 
the cause is unknown because the symptoms are similar to 
scrapie a sheep disease it is assumed the disease was transmitted 
through cattle feeds they use sheep offal as a protein supplement

pan american world airways is knocking a few 
rubles off the cost of emigrating from the soviet union to the 
united states 
the airline announced friday it is offering a oneway ticket to 
the us for 999 a 32 percent discount from the regular fare of 
1466 
pan am said the fare is designed to help the flow of immigrants 
to the us it said their access to air travel has been restricted 
by a requirement that they fly on the soviet airline aeroflot which 
has limited seating and expensive fares 
emigres can skirt the requirement by buying the discounted 
tickets outside the soviet union and arranging through pan am to 
pick them up in the country said pan am spokeswoman elizabeth 
hlinko 
the discounted flights are available from moscow and leningrad

the dollar ended mixed against other major 
currencies in europe friday after the release of disappointing us 
employment figures signaled slower us economic growth 
gold prices fell 
the dollar declined after the us data showed unexpectedly small 
growth in us nonfarm payrolls in may us nonfarm payrolls rose 
163000 but the number was inflated by the addition of census 
workers 
the april figure was revised downward to a decline of 23000 
reversing a preliminary rise of 64000

the suit filed in us district court in san francisco claims a 
new product called game genie which is designed for play with a 
nintendo home video game system causes nintendo game characters to 
move at slower speeds or bypass obstacles originally programmed into 
the games it allows players to skip entire game levels and to add 
extra lives to a players life 
nintendo claims the product created by lewis galoob toys of 
south san francisco creates derivative works of copyrighted 
nintendo games 
us copyright law prevents third parties from creating and 
marketing derivatives of copyrighted video games without the 
express consent of the games owner howard lincoln nintendos 
senior vice president said in a press release announcing the suit 
thursday 
galoob introduced game genie on may 8 and sued nintendo on may 17 
after nintendo notified galoob of its claim of copyright 
infringement galoobs suit seeks a court declaration that game 
genie does not infringe nintendo copyrights 
nintendo filed its lawsuit after deciding to reject a proposal 
that nintendo give galoob a license to market game genie nintendo 
said 
lincoln compared game genie to speedup kits which were 
introduced for the popular arcade game pacman several years ago 
courts found such kits to be unauthorized derivative works of the 
original pacman game and enjoined their sale 
but steven m klein executive vice president and general counsel 
at galoob rejected any links to the pacman situation game genie is 
for use in private homes while the pacman speedup kits were 
designed for use in public video arcades he said in a telephone 
interview friday 
home owners can modify games selling them a product that 
allows them to do that is not illegal he said 
nintendo has conveniently ignored provisions of the copyright 
act that allows a product like this to be sold he said 
lincoln said game genie allows nintendo games to be mastered 
without any skill 
we cannot stand by while the essence of our business the 
creation of ever more challenging video games is put at risk by 
the game genie product he said 
klein did not dispute that game genie allows success with 
nintendo games without requiring skill but denied it would be 
detrimental to nintendo 
nintendo believes anything that interferes with their monopoly 
is a threat to their business he said

the 1990 annual meetings and their scuffles and 
skirmishes are largely over and all the combatants are claiming 
victory even if the vote tallies dont show it 
the clearest winners this season were shareholders particularly 
the big institutional investors no longer content with passive 
ownership in the stocks of corporate america 
it was a banner year for institutional shareholders said 
gray davis the comptroller of california and a trustee of the 
states employee pension funds the largest in the nation 
davis was a prominent voice in pressing for a greater shareholder 
role in how companies are run during this annual meeting season the 
primary forum for dialogue between management and the owners they 
must answer to 
todd lang a new york attorney who specializes in corporate 
shareholder law said this has been the season when the 
institutions which own more than a majority of the equities in the 
united states have gone active with their positions 
shareholders placed more issues on annual meeting agendas this 
season and institutions became more vocal 
the shareholders biggest triumph came early in the season 
before and during the march 29 annual meeting of lockheed corp as 
dissident investor harold simmons waged a proxy fight with 
management to gain control of the defense contractors board of 
directors 
simmons lost but management was frightened he might win so the 
company granted big concessions including a promise to put at least 
one institutional investor representative on the board 
shareholders also won votes on several proposals among them a 
call for confidential proxy voting which would enable them to vote 
free from coercive pressure like in a political election 
in many companies shareholders sought a bigger voice in 
corporate policy and governance at the k mart corp and avon 
products inc meetings for example shareholders approved 
nonbinding resolutions asking management to submit the companies 
poison pill takeover defenses to shareholder votes 
these measures which make hostile takeovers more expensive 
generally fall under the jurisdiction of directors many 
shareholders dont like pills because they can block attractive 
prices stock in a takeover fight 
there was other evidence of shareholder activism although 
management proposals generally were approved in some cases they won 
by slimmer margins than in past votes 
at the time warner inc meeting managements stock incentive 
plan was approved but onequarter of the shares a relatively 
large bloc were cast against it 
management wasnt the only group coming up short this year 
stockholders also refused to rally around corporate takeover 
strategists 
at lockheed where simmons sought to install allies on the board 
and at american general corp where suitor torchmark inc had 
similar plans shareholders voted against the insurgents 
the outcome was expected to be the same at usx corp where 
shareholders voted on investor carl icahns nonbinding proposal to 
break up the steelenergy conglomerate the tally had not been 
completed by the end of last week but icahn had already said he 
expected to lose 
lang a partner with the firm weil gotshal amp manges in new york 
said the shareholders are listening to the dissidents ideas but 
theyre probably going to vote with their pocketbooks 
harry deangelo a finance professor at the university of 
michigan agreed theres a tendency for shareholders to go with 
the incumbent group unless the dissidents have a tangible proposal 
for distributing value or raising a companys stock price he said 
that was the case at lockheed and usx where simmons and icahn 
had ideas about ways to increase the price of the companies stock 
but did not offer shareholders any guarantees 
torchmark also had little concrete value to offer the suitor had 
encountered obstacles in its attempt to buy american general and 
resorted to a proxy fight 
dissidents had some victories however the belzberg family of 
canada managed to win one seat on the board of armstrong world 
industries inc though it subsequently scrapped a takeover offer 
for the company dissident shareholders upset the entire board of 
xtra corp a trailer leasing company 
icahn and simmons said they expected to eventually come out ahead 
financially even if they fell short of votes both said they expect 
management ultimately to respond to their complaints and take steps 
to boost the value of their stock 
shareholders did suffer disappointment this season perhaps the 
biggest came in their struggle with exxon corp over the oil 
companys environmental record 
the funds of which davis is a trustee and the pension funds of 
new york city and massachusetts had sought assurances from exxon 
that it would improve safety procedures following the exxon valdez 
oil spill off alaska last year management refused to adopt any 
environmental proposal made by shareholders 
nevertheless davis said were not going away and exxon will 
have to come to terms with its environmental indifference 
davis said he expects shareholder power particularly that of 
the big institutions to increase over the next 10 years as the 
pension funds increase their stakes in us companies he predicted 
management will be forced to consult regularly with shareholders 
right now he acknowledged shareholders have more leverage in 
situations where management faces a threat such as a takeover or 
proxy fight but he looks for that to change 
lang agreed that institutional shareholders have enormous 
potential power but said their new activism poses a number of 
legal questions 
for example under securities and exchange commission 
regulations institutional investors are subject to different 
disclosure requirements according to their level of activism but if 
an institution that was previously considered passive becomes more 
activist it could find itself in violation of sec rules lang said 
shareholders face other dilemmas as they seek a bigger role 
especially as they clamor for places on boards of directors 
a member of a board is supposed to represent all the 
shareholders said john lubin a management professor at the 
wharton school of the university of pennsylvania if they go on 
the board legally and in every sense theyre not supposed to 
represent their own interests

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade as improving weather and lack 
of a trade agreement between the soviet union and the united states 
weighed on the market 
soybeans dropped sharply after the july contract slipped below 
605 a bushel triggering more selling 
one reason for the decline was a national weather service 
forecast calling for dry conditions much of next week which will 
facilitate planting of soybeans said william biedermann an analyst 
will allendale inc in chicago 
soybean plantings had been delayed by soggy fields 
corn futures were pushed lower by progress made this week in 
planting the corn crop 
biedermann noted that light export business and a lack of 
progress in trade talks during the summit meeting between president 
bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev also weighed on corn 
futures 
fairly good weather allowing for progress in the harvesting of 
the winter crop pushed wheat futures lower 
at the close wheat prices were 1 cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 329 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with july at 276 a bushel oats were a 
cent lower to a cent higher with july at 144 a bushel soybeans 
were 5 cents to 7 cents lower with july at 602 a bushel

proposal by the financially distressed company to defer certain 
interest payments until the end of 1991 while it tries to 
restructure

supported the extraordinary resolution a campeau spokesman said 
after a meeting in toronto where the canadian company is based 
spokesman richard w wertheim said the actual vote count wouldnt 
be known for several days until a final tally is completed 
campeau parent of two extensive us retailing companies now in

deferral until dec 31 1991 
the company is negotiating similar deferrals with other creditors 
management of campeau has developed a business plan designed to 
restructure the companys financial affairs it involves substantial 
real estate and other asset sales

a survey of purchasing managers indicated on 
friday an improvement in manufacturing in may but economists said 
the report was overshadowed and contradicted by government 
unemployment numbers 
gains in production and new orders led the increase the second 
in as many months for the purchasing managers index 
the rise in the index is more a sign that the manufacturing slump 
has hit bottom than a precursor of a strong recovery said james 
solloway director of economic research at argus research inc in 
new york 
it does show some stability in manufacturing coming in but 
things are still soft solloway said 
economists also said the report by the national association of 
purchasing management was probably influenced by increased 
automobile production that is not being matched by sales 
the purchasing managers index rose to 507 percent in may up 
from 502 percent the month before a reading above 50 indicates the 
manufacturing economy is generally expanding below 50 that it is 
generally declining 
it was the highest level for the purchasing managers index since 
it reached 527 percent in april 1989 
the index is giving us a rosier picture of manufacturing than 
is justified allen sinai an economist at boston co in new york 
said noting weak unemployment figures 
the government said friday the unemployment rate fell 01 
percentage point to 53 percent in may however an increase of 
164000 new jobs was almost entirely due to the addition of 
temporary census workers private economists had expected 
nongovernment industries to create at least 125000 new jobs in 
may far greater than the 19000 that were added 
according to the purchasing managers report the production 
index increased significantly to 563 percent from 53 percent in 
april the new orders index came in at 548 percent but that was a 
slower growth rate than the 555 percent figure for april 
new export orders also grew in may although the increase was not 
as much as reported the two previous months the new export orders 
index was 54 percent down from 605 percent in april and 595 
percent in march 
the production managers reported declining prices in may 
resuming a trend that began nearly a year ago the price index 
increased in april for the first time since last may to 508 it 
dropped to 485 last month 
christopher low an economist at cmampm group a new york 
investment group said the increase in orders shows the 
manufacturing sector is struggling back the inflation shows 
declines in commodities prices but what that misses is increases in 
labor costs and service industry prices 
aprils increase in the overall index followed 11 straight months 
of declines the group said in a press release from its tempe ariz 
headquarters 
the purchasing managers report is based on a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies most of 
the figures are adjusted for seasonal factors

throughout the united states based on reports from realtors 
lenders and economists

conditions are sluggish partly because of an oversupply of homes 
big layoffs on wall street and weakeness in massachusetts 
hightechdominated economy have softened demand for housing and 
brought recessionlike conditions to the area a reversal from a 
few years ago when some homes were appreciating in doubledigit 
rates many homes are falling in value as much as 1 percent per 
month in some pockets of metropolitan new york while the length of 
time needed to sell a home is rising 
home prices were off on average 3 percent to 5 percent during the 
first quarter of 1990 from a year ago in cities like hartford 
conn boston and new york the national association of realtors 
says new haven conn was especially weak with prices down 11 
percent pockets of strength include buffalo rochester and albany 
ny where prices were up between 2 percent and 12 percent another 
exception is pittsburgh where home values were reported to be 
stable and prices are considered comparably affordable 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
unlike the northeast where prices exploded in the 80s homes in 
this region appreciated more modestly lower prices and quality of 
life benefits have attracted many businesses and are supporting 
demand for housing 
examples of prices increases as of the first quarter according 
to the realtors association include akron ohio up 175 percent 
grand rapids mich 14 percent chicago 12 percent milwaukee 75

of just a year and a half ago some californians particularly from 
bigger cities like los angeles decided to cash out and move to less 
expensive areas increasing the supply of available homes 
cities like denver and phoenix continue to have serious economic 
problems due partly to volatility in the oil industry and the 
collapse of many savings and loans although some real estate 
markets are showing signs of stabilizing

international business machines corp said friday 
it has signed its biggest contract yet with the soviet union under 
which it will supply over 13000 personal computers for use in 
schools 
it is a significant step up from the level of soviet business 
weve been doing before said ibm spokesman mac jeffery 
the value of the contract was not disclosed but jeffrey said the 
soviets will pay in a convertible currency and that they received a 
discount comparable to the one ibm offers other customers for 
computers bought for educational use 
barry bosak an industry analyst at smith barney harris upham amp 
co said the contract could be worth 20 million to 30 million 
depending on the discount and the types of printers and other 
equipment included he said it probably ranks among the largest 
sales of computer equipment to the soviet union by a western company 
jeffery said ibm has been selling computers in the soviet union 
since 1975 but he declined to quantify the earlier saleswe hope 
this will lead to other things he said 
ibm and the ussr state committees for education and 
informatics said in a statement that the contract could form the 
basis for the buildup of assembly operations for personal computers 
in the ussr and that feasibility studies on such assembly 
operations have been launched 
it is something that both sides are seriously looking at 
jeffery said declining to elaborate 
bosak said the possibility of building soviet assembly plants is 
more important than the size of the contract setting up an assembly 
operation would give them ibm a working base he said 
as part of the deal with the state education committee ibm will 
provide 150 educational software packages that have been translated 
into russian in addition ibm will work with outside software 
companies to provide additional applications programs and will train 
soviet software engineers to write educational software jeffery 
said 
ibm also will train teachers to use the computers he said 
the contract is for ibms personal system2 machines featuring 
intel corps 80286 microprocessor the most sophisticated 
microprocessor allowed to be exported to the soviet union by us 
companies under current export rules jeffery said 
shipments will begin in september in time for some schools to 
begin using the machines in the 199091 school year ibm said

argentina is to resume 
negotiations next week with creditor banks over the possible 
resumption of interest payments for the first time in two years on 
its 60 billion foreign debt local newspapers reported friday 
however talks are likely to be contentious with creditor banks 
apparently seeking more than the argentine government is offering to 
pay the reports stated 
citing sources in the economy ministry the daily clarin reported 
the government is prepared to pay 70 million a month for three 
months but creditor banks want a minimum 100 million monthly for 
the rest of 1990 
the daily la nacion reported foreign bankers dont want monthly 
payments at all but rather a lump sum before negotiations resume 
the 11monthold government of president carlos menem is seeking 
debt forgiveness approval for debt capitalization and new loans 
its mission to new york will be led by the presidentdesignate of 
the central bank javier gonzalez fraga 
fraga told the financial daily el cronista comercial that foreign 
banks basically want interest payments they have received 
virtually nothing in more than two years 
negotiations with a steering committee that represents banks owed 
about 40 billion mostly us banks are likely to be difficult 
the us government in january ordered banks to more than double 
their reserves set aside to cover potentially bad loan to argentina 
cutting into bank earnings 
overdue interest may total 85 billion this year the argentine 
government conceded in a letter to the international monetary fund 
last friday 
nevertheless the imf indicated it approved of menems policy of 
budget austerity and privatizations and unblocked payment of a 17 
billion loan the loan was granted last october but suspended five 
months later when the imf said menems government had failed to meet 
targets for controlling inflation and reducing the government budget 
deficit 
in the imf letter argentina pledged to pay 500 million in 
overdue interest but acknowledged full payments would not be made 
for at least three years 
argentinas economy emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation 
is mired in recession 
menems government has implemented an economic austerity program 
that includes budget cuts the lifting of price controls and plans 
for privatization of governmentowned companies

the dutch electronics company nv philips has 
developed a conventional audio tape process that music industry 
officials say is good enough that it could put a dent in the new 
digital audio tape market 
philips quietly unveiled its new tape machine for several major 
record companies in los angeles last week but the company has 
declined to discuss the socalled digital compact cassette machine 
which is scheduled to hit the market next year 
it sounds very good its not as good as a cd compact disc 
but its so much better than standard analog cassettes said al 
mcpherson chief engineer for warner bros records 
philips held the demonstrations to drum up music industry support 
for its new product mcpherson said warner had not agreed to offer 
such support but is very very interested in the technology 
consumers could use the philips machine to record or play music 
utilizing either digital audio tapes or conventional audio tapes 
the conventional tapes are more widely available and much cheaper 
than the digital ones but the digital tapes sound quality is far 
superior 
industry officials have also said the machine could rejuvenate 
flagging audio cassette sales although the audio cassette developed 
by philips in 1963 represents more than half of all prerecorded 
music sales sales fell in 1989 in the wake of cd competition

general mills inc has settled a complaint 
from attorneys general in three states about advertising for the 
defunct benefit brand cereal the company said thursday 
minnesota attorney general hubert humphrey iii and the attorneys 
general in iowa and wisconsin alleged that an advertisement claiming 
that benefit removes cholesterol from your body were false and 
misleading 
golden valleybased general mills said thursday it agreed to pay 
each of the three states 7000 the settlement is not an admission 
of wrongdoing the company said 
the settlement was the fastest and least costly way to resolve 
differences over a single newspaper ad for a product that hasnt 
been sold for over five months the company said in a statement 
general mills said it took exception with humphreys description 
of the settlement he said that under the agreement general mills 
will not make any similar claims that its products remove 
cholesterol from the body 
although the golden valley based company removed benefit cereal 
from store shelves last winter humphrey said nothing prevented the 
company from resurrecting a similar product with the same highly 
questionable claims 
these cholesterol claims have gotten out of control said 
humphrey to imply that a single product will magically remove 
cholesterol is misleading and deceptive to consumers it takes an 
overall lowfat lowcholesterol diet to help reduce cholesterol 
we strongly disagree with his characterization of the 
settlement general mills said 
company spokeswoman kathy newton said the settlement applies only 
to a single newspaper ad printed in august of last year 
she said the interim ad featured a pacman cartoon character 
gobbling up the word cholesterol in the phrase benefit removes 
cholesterol from your body 
humphrey has urged the federal food and drug administration to 
ban health claims unless there is scientific consensus that the 
claims are true he also urged the federal agency to spell out the 
exact wording that food manufacturers must use in making any health 
claims about their products 
since benefit was removed from store shelves it has been sold as 
a food for livestock newton said the company had an inventory of 
about 50 tons of the flakes when the product was yanked from the 
consumer market 
it is being used to fatten cows and pigs on several south dakota 
farms she said 
that is not an uncommon thing whatsoever newton said if 
its an edible type product we try not to waste it

a leadership shuffle at chrysler corp leaves a 
financial whiz and a lover of fast cars waiting in the wings for 
chairman lee iacoccas retirement 
but analysts speculated friday the differing backgrounds of 
bean counter robert s miller and car guy robert lutz may 
prompt iacocca 65 to stick around past the late1991 expiration of 
his contract 
the shuffle announced thursday divided the duties of former vice 
chairman gerald greenwald between miller 48 and lutz 58 
miller got greenwalds title and most of his duties but that 
doesnt mean hes a shooin to succeed iacocca analysts said since 
miller has had little exposure to product development and lutz has 
had few dealings with financial matters they said a coordinator is 
needed 
analysts said that would be iacocca now that greenwald has 
departed to lead a union coalition seeking a 454 billion leveraged 
buyout of united airlines 
a year ago it appeared iacocca would step down as chief 
executive officer when his contract expired at the end of 1991 and 
hand over chryslers reigns to greenwald greenwald has said iacocca 
told him last year that the chairmanship is yours to lose 
auto analyst doug laughlin of bear stearns amp co in new york said 
the bad news resulting from greenwalds resignation was who is 
the longterm chairman for chrysler 
the good news is that iacocca stays around longer either to 
groom or find a successor he said 
chrysler moved swiftly in the hours after greenwalds resignation 
was announced in addition to dividing greenwalds duties between 
miller and lutz it eliminated the office of the chairman which 
iacocca and greenwald shared 
chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell 62 whos reportedly 
suffering health problems was passed over in the shuffle 
presumably leaving him out of the running for chairman the detroit 
free press quoted unidentified sources friday as saying bidwell 
plans to retire in december company spokesmen declined to discuss 
bidwells intentions or his health 
that leaves lutz and miller on deck auto analyst david healy of 
barclays bank in new york called both highly able in their chosen 
fields 
healy and other analysts said its difficult to tell whos in 
line for iacoccas job partly because chrysler has done some 
innovative things with its corporate offices 
among the scenarios analysts suggested 
an outsider could be brought in much like iacocca was in 1979 
lutz or miller could become the new chairman after some grooming 
miller and lutz could share the office 
its possible to split it up where they both would wind up with 
big titles and each guy would handle his traditional area healy 
said chrysler has had so many variations on its structure that 
nothing would surprise me 
miller joined chrysler in 1979 as assistant controller with 
greenwald he helped secure loans and federal guarantees which 
helped the automaker avoid bankruptcy in the early 1980s 
like iacocca lutz and bidwell miller worked for ford motor co 
before going to chrysler mostly in overseas financial operations 
at chrysler miller became vice president and treasurer in 1980 
and rose to become the corporations chief financial officer in 
1988 he also is credited with raising money and developing a 
financial plan that rescued the detroit symphony last year 
lutz born in zurich switzerland started his automotive career 
with general motors corp in 1963 and worked in a number of 
administrative jobs in europe he then spent three years with the 
west german automaker bmw before joining ford of europe in 1974 
he worked for ford for a dozen years before joining chrysler in 
1986 as an executive vice president lutz is known for his love of 
cars especially driving them fast 
stories about lutzs love of speed are popular in detroit one 
goes that he likes a strip of highway close to his ann arbor home 
because a wall between traffic lanes hides his lamborghini countach 
from the state police as he roars to work at chryslers highland 
park headquarters

the hiring of thousands of temporary census 
workers helped push the nations unemployment rate down slightly to 
53 percent in may the government said friday 
despite the 01 percentage point decline in the jobless rate 
analysts viewed the report as a sign of a sluggish economy because 
private sector job growth slowed to a near standstill in may 
these numbers are a real danger signal and bring into 
question whether we can muddle through without tilting toward 
recession economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co said 
the report the first comprehensive look at mays economic 
activity shows the economy is worse than sluggish it is 
moribund said richard w rahn chief economist at the us 
chamber of commerce 
stock prices on wall street rose to a new high as traders took 
weak job growth as a sign that the federal reserve might lower 
interest rates at the close the dow jones average of 30 
industrials was 290097 up 2431 from thursday 
in other economic news friday the commerce department reported 
construction spending continued to slide in april dropping 07 
percent for the second straight month as interest rates remained 
high 
the civilian jobless rate as measured by a household survey fell 
slightly in may from aprils 54 percent unemployment rate the 
labor department said the nations jobless rate has been 
fluctuating around 53 percent for more than a year 
there were 164000 new jobs created last month according to a 
separate survey of business establishments but the number was 
artificially inflated by the federal governments hiring of 145000 
temporary census workers 
revised figures for april showed jobs actually declined by 23000 
that month rather than posting a small increase as the labor 
department had earlier reported 
the job market has been bolstered only by census hiring the 
private sector has been stagnant for the past three months said 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
since february the economy has added just 264000 new jobs and 
if government jobs are excluded private payrolls actually fell by 
105000 the government said 
job creation has ground to a halt increasingly in one industry 
after another said economist allen sinai of the boston co 
analysts said the unemployment dip was also helped by the 
relatively slow expansion of the labor force in recent months 
after growing by 430000 workers in february and march the 
number of americans working or actively seeking jobs grew by just 
165000 during april and may 
the nations manufacturing sector which has been in a slump for 
months continued to falter as factory jobs fell by 35000 jobs 
bringing the total manufacturing losses to 310000 jobs since march 
1989 the electrical equipment auto and apparel industries together 
have lost 190000 jobs during that period 
construction jobs fell by 20000 in may reflecting continued 
weakness in the housing market the government said employment in 
the construction industry is only 30000 above its level of a year 
earlier compared with a 180000 gain in the prior maytomay period 
the service sector which has been carrying the economy added 
216000 jobs but that included the onceeverydecade census jobs 
health services added 47000 jobs wholesale trade contributed 
16000 and business services added another 15000 jobs 
in contrast other industries within the service sector are 
slumping retail trade has posted a 19000job loss since january 
while finance insurance and real estate has added just 28000 jobs 
over the past five months 
average hourly earnings posted a 04 percent rise in may to 
999 up from the 995 the average worker earned an hour in april 
if earnings rose at that pace every month that would mean a 5 
percent annual increase 
jones called the higher wage costs coupled with slow job growth 
the worst of both possible worlds 
its certainly going to put a squeeze on corporate profits 
he said 
the average manufacturing work week rose to 411 hours in may up 
from 407 hours in april manufacturing overtime increased to 4 
hours up from the average of 35 hours in april 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed serviced stationed in the united states the may jobless 
rate was 53 percent the same as april and also mays civilian rate

last year it was handheld video games watchable 
walkmans and interactive compact discs this year its digital 
audio tape scaleddown camcorders and movietheater sound for the 
home 
every year millions of dollars in new electronics technology 
goes on display at the consumer electronics show but what does it 
mean for someone who bought last years innovation and now faces 
bewildering new choices 
products will continue to be put out with new features and new 
bells and whistles acknowledged marvin lurie spokesman for the 
suburban lombardbased national association of retail dealers of 
america 
the only way to get it sorted out is to go to a qualified 
dealer who can explain the benefits lurie said friday he said 
his group represents about 20 percent of us consumer electronics 
retailers 
many of them will be among the estimated 55000 visitors to the 
annual show beginning saturday at mccormick place where 1400 
manufacturers will be showing tens of thousands of products for four 
days in an area equivalent to the size of 17 football fields 
we are the industry show said tom lauterback spokesman for 
the consumer electronics group of the washingtonbased electronics 
industries association sponsor of the june show in chicago and a 
similar january show in las vegas the shows are closed to the 
public 
consumer electronics a 44 billionayear industry that includes 
audio video home office and homeautomation products has slowed 
to singledigit growth but i suppose every industry would 
love to be able to say that lauterback said friday 
unlike in past years we dont have on hand a product that 
everyone is going to want but no one has said lurie 
digital audio tape might be that except that if it comes on 
the market later this year its not going to come at a massmarket 
price he said adding that dat systems are expected to retail at 
1000 to 1200 
though dat technology has existed for years it wasnt until 
wednesday that a japanese government agency announced new technology 
standards that will open that countrys market for dat players 
the players can make nearly perfect copies of prerecorded music 
but manufacturers have held off marketing them out of a fear of 
lawsuits from copyright disputes 
japans new standards are designed to limit consumers abilities 
to make new copies and congress is scheduled to hold hearings this 
month on a proposal to adopt similar standards in the united states 
political problems similarly plague highresolution television 
said don krueger senior vice president and director of research for 
sanyo securities of america the us arm of one of japans biggest 
brokerage firms 
the japanese have the standard of technology but europe and 
the us dont want to adopt the standard he said in a telephone 
interview friday 
nobody wants the japanese to dominate the highdefinition tv 
as they have other areas of the consumer electronics market he said 
meanwhile theres nothing terribly exciting out there 
he said weve kind of hit a black hole right now 
hence improvements to existing products are holding sway at this 
years show including ultracompact camcorders the size of half a 
cigarette carton marketed by panasonic and sony and a 
movietheater sound system for the home marketed by lucasfilm ltd 
in the video game arena disabled youngsters will get a shot at 
nintendo action through a voicecommand headset unveiled by konami 
inc of suburban buffalo grove 
the proliferation of consumer electronics products overall may 
sometimes seem bewildering but it is an inevitable byproduct of the 
american way of doing business said sociologist peter whalley an 
associate professor at loyola university who teachs a course on 
technology and society 
the standard marketing strategy is to maximize the number of 
products out there to fill the niches out there he said friday 
i dont think the electronics industry does it more than anyone 
else

bond prices soared friday as the market reacted 
to sharply weakerthanexpected job growth in may that pointed to an 
economic slowdown 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond jumped 1 points or 15 
per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when prices fall 
tumbled to 844 percent from 857 percent late thursday 
it was the lowest yield on the 30year bond since late march 
the government reported that the nations unemployment rate fell 
01 percentage point to 53 percent in may but that only 19000 
jobs excluding temporary census workers were created 
steven a wood an economist with bankamerica capital markets in 
san francisco said the report suggests the economy is performing 
much more weakly than expected and that will lead to lower 
inflation and an easing of monetary policy 
inflation erodes the value of fixedincome securities such as 
bonds an easing of monetary policy by the federal reserve board 
would lower interest rates which would benefit bond prices 
the fed has been concerned as have the markets that the 
economy has been growing too rapidly to allow inflationary pressures 
to recede wood said now it appears the economy is not growing 
nearly as strongly 
the labor department said the number of new jobs in may increased 
by 164000 over april but that number was artificially bolstered by 
the federal governments hiring of 145000 temporary census workers 
private economists had expected nongovernment industries to add at 
least 12500 jobs in may far above the 19000 reported 
wood said the market took off slowly after the report was issued 
rising on light volume before heavy trading began in all maturities 
in another economic report friday a survey of the nations 
purchasing managers indicated that us manufacturing expanded in 
may for the second straight month 
the national association of purchasing managements economic 
index rose to 507 percent in may from 502 percent in april a 
reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is generally

the price of la gear inc stock fell nearly 
22 percent friday after the company said it expected its earnings 
for the current quarter would be down sharply from a year ago 
la gear stock fell 850 per share to close at 3050 on the 
new york stock exchange down nearly 40 percent from its high of 
5037 on may 24 
most of fridays decline came after the sneakers and apparel 
maker said at midafternoon that it expected to report quarterly 
earnings of 50 to 60 cents per share in the marchmay quarter 
compared with 90 cents per share a year earlier the forecast 
surprised many wall street analysts 
the earnings the company indicated were considerably lower than 
we had indicated said jay j meltzer a goldman sachs analyst in 
new york 
but meltzer said the earnings report alone could not account for 
the precipitous stock fall he had no other explanation for it 
however 
dick broderick an outside publicist for the company was in a 
meeting and could not immediately be reached for comment his office 
reported 
la gears profit more than doubled last year reaching 55 
million 
the companys stock had surged last week in part because the 
salomon brothers brokerage had repeated a buy recommendation 
salomon brothers analyst heidi r steinberg said she could not 
account for fridays fall 
la gear known for trendy shoes and signing celebrity endorsers 
like michael jackson joe montana and paula abdul to 
multimilliondollar contracts was a gogo company for the past two 
years with booming sales moving it up into the no 3 spot behind 
nike inc and reebok international ltd 
many investors made big profits while others found it a stock 
they loved to hate and the share price has whipsawed said donald 
l wampach who follows emerging growth stocks for hamilton 
investments inc in chicago 
wampach noted that short sellers who bet the stock price will 
fall had frequently gotten burned on la gear shares 
he said he believes the company is undergoing a difficult change 
into an established mediumsize outfit but remains fundamentally 
strong the earnings decline is probably attributable to the 
transition from older shoe models to new michael jackson hiking and 
backtoschool lines he said 
the street sure didnt anticipate the word on the earnings

nbc joining in the abc and cbs challenge of the 
nielsen peoplemeter ratings system said friday it is 
seriously concerned about the systems value to the industry 
the ac nielsen co promptly fired back saying in a statement 
it had investigated the systems reports of decreasing levels of 
network viewing and we feel its a real decline 
the peoplemeters the industry ratings standard since the fall 
of 1987 are vieweractivated devices that record what shows are 
being watched and which members of a participating family are 
watching 
the networks contend that the peoplemeter figures undercount 
the real audience and that the system which is in 4000 homes is 
flawed 
abc on thursday fired the first round against the system saying 
it would use its own formula of ratings analysis to determine if it 
should give makegoods to advertisers of abc shows that get 
ratings lower than abc had promised 
makegoods are commercial slots given free to businesses when 
their ads air on shows with lessthanexpected ratings ads are sold 
on the basis of the networks prediction of the size and makeup of 
the audience 
nbc in a statement friday said it was troubled by what it 
called the unexplained aberrations in the nielsen people meter 
ratings and said it was taking a close look at abcs plan and 
other possibilities 
however it also said such steps are only interim solutions to 
the problem and called for networks and advertisers alike to work 
for a viable system that would eliminate concerns about accuracy 
and reliability 
cbs research vice president david poltrack who has been a strong 
critic of the peoplemeter methodology said in an interview that 
the network has not yet reviewed all the options it may have in 
the dispute 
it probably will start the review monday he said and start 
looking at the advertising industry reactions to abcs plan 
he also said he felt that the peoplemeter systems deficiences 
and instability make it an unreliable tool for television audience 
measurement 
we feel the peoplemeter system is not responsible for the 
viewing decline and its the buyers of advertising time who 
ultimately will decide the validity of each networks proposal 
said nielsen spokeswoman jo laverde 
several advertising agency executives panned the abc plan and 
came to the defense of the nielsen rarings system 
steve sternberg manager of broadcast research at the ad agency 
bozell inc said his agency feels the decline in tv audiences 
evident in the nielsen ratings are genuine rather than due to faults 
in the measurement system 
the abc plan to base audience guarantees on a threeyear average 
rather than the upcoming seasons actual results is a blatant 
attempt to lock advertisers into historical viewing levels 
favorable to abc in the face of deteriorating network viewing 
kevin burns and john hunt of the ad agency ogilvy amp mather wrote in 
a commentary on the abc plan 
they said the audience guarantees were enacted to protect 
advertisers in return for making a sizeable longterm commitment 
in effect the abc proposal would provide a gurantee for the 
network rather than the advertiser despite the current turmoil in 
the medium we dont believe it is the advertisers responsibility 
to guarantee the networks a profit they wrote 
richard kostyra media services director at the j walter 
thompson ad agency said the abc plan could move a lot of money 
into fox which has said it would give the normal guarantees on 
sales on its network 
he said it would also encourage advertisers to spend more to 
advertise on cable television syndicated shows and alternative 
media outlets such as those aimed at reaching women in doctors 
offices or beauty parlors and shoppers in the supermarket checkout 
lines 
paul schulman who heads an ad buying service that carries his 
name said the guarantees are only one of the items to be negotiated 
on buying ad time 
this isnt the key to the whole negotiations we have to see 
what kind of price increasaes they are seeking he said
