from the federal government to avoid bankruptcy but federal 
officials said tuesday that bailing out this celebrated tourist 
mecca would set a bad precedent 
presidential press spokesman carlos henrique santos told 
reporters that if president jose sarney helps rio the next day 
there will be a line of 4000 mayors knocking on the door of the 
presidential palace 
rio mayor roberto saturnino braga said last week that his city 
of 5 million people was broke and could not pay its debts or the 
salaries of 100000 municipal employees unless rio received federal 
aid 
rio is brazils secondlargest city and a major tourist 
attraction but finance minister mailson da nobrega has refused the 
citys request to issue 54 million in emergency bonds 
rio has been hurt in the last few decades by the transfer of the 
federal capital to brasilia and the flight of industry to sao 
paulo the nations largest city 
today rio owes about 150 million to brazilian creditors and 
another 150 million in foreign debts the city has projected a 
budget deficit of close to 180 million this year 
saturnino braga warned that the city may have to cut off school 
lunches and medical supplies to city hospitals unless its credit is 
extended 
the mayor a former economist who belongs to the fledgling 
brazilian socialist party also said the city was considering 
selling the nelson piquet autodrome named for its famous race car 
driver and the site of the annual brazilian formula 1 grand prix 
he predicted financial chaos unless the city received aid 
there could be a deterioration of the city chaos general 
strikes deterioration of public services and the conservation of 
the city but well do everything possible to avoid bankruptcy he 
said in an interview over the weekend with the jornal do brasil 
newspaper of rio

associated press writer 
washington ap at least 100000 of americas children are 
homeless on any given night and that doesnt include those who have 
run away from home or been kicked out by their parents the 
national academy of sciences estimated monday 
while male alcoholics and former mental patients still make up a 
large portion of the homeless the fastest growing group of people 
with no place to live are children under 18 said the academys 
institute of medicine 
the committee feels strongly that the growing phenomenon of 
homeless children is nothing short of a national disgrace that must 
be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands said 
the report 
one recommendation aimed directly at helping children federal 
support for enriched day care and head start programs should be 
expanded and coupled with outreach efforts to make homeless parents 
aware of help available for their children 
a recommendation for the homeless in general permit the use of 
food stamps at restaurants so prepared meals will be available to 
people who dont have kitchens 
a controversy has erupted over the report triggered by a 
majority of the committee formed by the institute to do the study 
which was ordered by congress 
ten of the 13 members of that panel chaired by bruce c 
vladeck the president of united hospital fund of new york in new 
york city endorsed a supplemental statement that the national 
academy of sciences refused to publish in the report 
the only mention of it appears in a footnote on page 136 of the 
242page book it says in part that the committee members 
unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the 
recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of 
homelessness especially the supply of lowincome housing income 
maintenance the availability of support services and access to 
health care for the poor and uninsured 
vladeck interviewed monday night by telephone said he supports 
the supplemental statement because the report as published which 
focuses on health and human needs of the homeless doesnt 
adequately convey our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon 
of homelessness 
he said the supplementary statement calls for three specifics 
first an expansion of federal support of lowincome housing 
to at least the 1981 budget levels from which theyve been cut 70 
percent since 
second for development of a range of communitybased 
residential treatment services for the mentally ill and substance 
abusers and 
third for increasing the minimum wage to a level that makes 
adequate housing affordable 
dr frank press president of the national academy of sciences 
blocked publication of the statement he was quoted in tuesdays 
editions of the new york times as saying he did so because the 
language was charged and polemical and emotional 
the academy has a certain credibility to maintain and must 
assure congress and the executive branch that it will stick to the 
data and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible 
press said this panel was so repelled by what they saw that they 
wanted to go beyond their charge and give their views we told them 
that was not our process if they wanted to do it they had to do 
it independently 
he said he was glad the members were issuing their statement but 
said the main report was terrific as it stands 
in the report the committee applauded changes that allow use of 
food stamps at shelters and soup kitchens but it said operators of 
those facilities need to be educated in the principles of sound 
nutrition and the special nutritional needs of the homeless 
the committee also sought to dismiss fears of city government 
officials who might conclude that increasing their efforts to help 
the homeless would only draw more homeless people to their cities 
the great majority of homeless people are longterm residents of 
the city where they live the committee said whats more it said 
what causes homeless people to move to another city is the prospect 
for work not the prospect for welfare if jobs arent available 
they tend not to stay long 
as for homeless children the report said there are no national 
studies pinning down the numbers but using even the most 
conservative estimates would mean that 
on any given night 735000 people in america have no home in 
which to sleep and must resort to streets shelters institutions 
or other makeshift quarters citing research by the alliance 
housing council a homeless advocacy group the committee concluded 
that 13 million to 2 million people will be homeless for one night 
or more in the course of a year 
most of the 735000 homeless on any given night are alone but 
at least a quarter of them are members of families and 55 percent 
of the family members are children 
thus the report concludes a minimum of 100000 children are 
homeless on any given night of the year and that figure counts 
only children in intact families and leaves out runaway 
throwaway or abandoned children 
the study did not detail how it concluded that children under 
the age of 18 usually as part of a family headed by a mother are 
the fastest growing group among the many subpopulations of the 
homeless 
all statistics on the homeless are difficult to come up with 
the report acknowledged in that connection the census bureau 
announced monday that it will make a special effort in 1990 to 
count the homeless on march 20 of that year census takers will 
visit emergency shelters from 6 pm to midnight and street 
locations where the homeless often congregate between 2 am and 4 
am 
the report said most homeless children are in families headed by 
the mother and it found that homeless mothers frequently have no 
one to call on even in severe emergencies 
it cited one massachusetts study in which 43 percent of the 
mothers could not name any one person to depend upon in a time of 
stress and almost a quarter named their minor child as their 
principal source of emotional support 
during 10 months of research the committee and its staff 
visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities boston 
chicago kansas city lexington ky los angeles milwaukee 
nashville san diego san francisco st louis and washington and 
rural areas in alabama minnesota mississippi and north dakota 
those who stay in rural areas remain hidden until some event 
causes them to lose their housing at which point they can be found 
living in for example cars abandoned buildings and woods the 
report said 
the study says the major causes of homelessness are 
a decrease in the number of housing units for lowincome people 
25 million fewer than in 1980 while the number of people who 
can only affod such units has increased because of skyrocketing 
housing costs 
a tightening of eligibility for public assistance programs as 
well as a decline in the value of such assistance 
policies of state mental hospitals general hospitals 
rehabilitation facilities and some jails and prisons that have 
fewer people admitted and free some who were previously held 
one result of these factors is that the system for providing 
temporary shelter for people who are homeless has been burdened 
beyond its capacity with people staying for months rather than 
days the report says 
the study says health problems both cause and result from 
homelessness 
alcoholism drug abuse mental illness and the fatal disease 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome often results in 
people losing jobs and homes it noted 
many diseases are complicated by homelessness and illnesses such 
as exposure hypothermia skin disorders in addition accidents 
muggings and rapes are often the result of the victim having no 
home the study says

representatives of the nicaraguan 
government and rebel leaders met for the first time in three months 
monday but broke off talks after failing to agree on a new location 
for resuming peace negotiations 
the rebel delegation rejected the governments demand that 
future talks to end the 7yearold civil war take place in the 
nicaraguan capital of managua rebel leader roberto ferrey said 
after the meeting 
the rebels proposed guatemala costa rica or the dominican 
republic as alternative sites for highlevel negotiations ferrey 
said 
mondays meeting had been called as a preliminary step to 
resuming the peace talks that collapsed june 9 the fourhour 
session was the first meeting between the leftist government and 
the usbacked rebels since talks collapsed 
a possible second day of talks on tuesday was ruled out and no 
date for another meeting was announced 
ferrey said rebels were open to considering new proposals on a 
location for the talks and the government has said it would keep 
trying to persuade the rebels to bargain in managua 
ferrey said he reiterated a rebel proposal that highlevel talks 
be held sept 2628 but not in managua the proposal was contained 
in a letter he submitted to nicaraguan deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco head of the government delegation and was made 
available to reporters 
the rebels known as contras also demanded the government 
release more than 40 opposition demonstrators arrested in july and 
guarantee freedom of expression as a precondition to further talks 
ferrey said that during previous talks in managua rebel leaders 
felt like prisoners in their own country and added our 
telephone conversations were listened to he did not elaborate 
in a separate press conference tinoco said the government was 
sticking by its position that the talks be held in managua 
a fragile march 21 ceasefire remains in effect in nicaragua 
but each side accuses the other of violating the truce 
tinoco had said before the meeting monday he expected it to 
result in a ceasefire for 30 or 60 days that could be extended 
indefinitely there was no announcement on extending the 
ceasefire 
both sides had agreed on march 23 to seek a negotiated 
settlement to the conflict the government says has claimed the 
lives of 28000 nicaraguans 
tinoco said monday that that agreement called for managua as the 
site of peace negotiations 
the agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in 
exchange for democratic reforms shortly before peace talks broke 
off in june the sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament 
and political reforms 
but the contras rejected the plan saying it did not go far 
enough they demanded freedom for political prisoners and 
democratic reforms in nicaragua before disarming 
tinoco said the sandinistas will urge that a ceasefire 
verification commission funded by 10 million from congress be put 
into operation commission members would include the 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states joao 
baena soares and nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
tinoco also reiterated the governments demand that the contras 
free 66 prisoners of war being held in honduras 
he blamed the contras for ending peace talks on june 9 the 
contras broke them off to seek military aid in the united states 
congress he said 
direct us military aid to the rebels ended feb 29 and the 
contras have few bargaining chips left nonlethal us aid to the 
contras is distributed only in honduras 
during the past four months most of the rebel forces fled back 
to base camps inside honduras to receive new supplies of uniforms 
and food 
contra sources say only 2000 fighters remain inside nicaragua 
while more than 9000 are holed up in isolated camps in eastern 
honduras 
the ceasefire pact in march caused deep divisions within the 
rebel ranks militant contras led by enrique bermudez a former 
colonel under the deposed anastasio somoza dictatorship said the 
agreement was tantamount to surrender

the crucial shatt alarab waterway must 
remain under iraqi control and cannot be used by iran as a 
negotiating tool in peace talks to end their 8yearold war iraqs 
foreign minister was quoted as saying monday 
foreign minister tariq aziz said the waterway the delta of the 
tigris and euphrates rivers and iraqs sole outlet to the sea 
should remain under iraqi control as a historical logical legal 
and a just matter according to the official iraqi news agency 
aziz speaking at a press conference said iraq rejects what he 
said was irans use of the waterway as a means to pressure iraq in 
the unmediated peace talks that started in geneva on aug 25 
the agency reported 
iraq is demanding sovereignty over the shattalarab estuary and 
that the outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt irans first 
wants to negotiate the withdrawal of both sides troops to 
internationally recognized borders the exchange of war prisoners 
and a un investigation to determine who started the war 
the talks broke off sept 13 and are scheduled to resume in new 
york in the first week of october 
aziz said that iraq is committed to peace and that iran would 
bear the consequences for its insistence on its current position 
after the press conference aziz left baghdad for riyadh and 
consultations with king fahd of saudi arabia about the negotiations 
and other issues of common interest the news agency said 
in a related development the agency reported that president 
saddam hussein met with his military field commanders monday and 
one item on the agenda was the possibility of changing the course 
of the shatt alarab 
press reports in the region have said iraq is considering the 
project to change the path of the waterway in case its talks with 
iran deadlock completely

in the countrys agricultural 
heartland old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum 
next month on gen augusto pinochets presidency 
for prosperous landowners frightening memories of farm seizures 
by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly 
into the propinochet camp 
this is the fear we have of returning to the past said 
francisco olea owner of a 100acre spread here in the countrys 
fertile central valley 
but for struggling farm workers the prospect of reprisal by 
their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing 
dissent some say resentment with pinochets authoritarian rule 
and with a handtomouth existence will find expression in the 
ballot box 
at least before there was work and the worker had the right 
to express his opinion said laborer ramon arias as he painted a 
tractor by the roadside two farmhands with him made similar 
comments but refused to give their names 
chileans will decide oct 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term 
for pinochet the rightwing army commander who seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous 
president 
if a majority vote for him he will remain as president until 
1997 but the military junta that he has headed as the governing 
body since 1973 will be disbanded if he loses open elections will 
be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990 when a new 
congress twothirds elected and onethird appointed will go into 
place 
farmowner olea and others like him have benefited from an 
exportoriented freemarket economic program carried out by 
pinochets administration foreign sales of grapes and other fruit 
much of it grown in the central valley have been booming with 
government credits and technological assistance many farm owners 
are expanding production and making solid profits 
but they have not forgotten the chaotic radical reform programs 
launched by president salvador allende a selfdeclared marxist 
elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by pinochet three years 
later 
oleas home and land were illegally seized by peasants he 
negotiated with them so he could live in his house which also had 
been taken over while they worked his land as they liked 
we lived through a savage lack of order said luis aullet 
who is partner with his brother cesar in a 70acre farm there 
was no respect for your home your land 
cesar aullet said the allende government sent experts with 
no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs 
what we fear is that kind of ignorance he said 
the landowners said that with the production boom conditions 
for farm workers were improving significantly 
manpower is becoming scarce and theres competition in 
salaries to attract workers cesar aullet said anyone who 
wants work can find it 
the aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season 
workers could not be found for less than 1000 pesos about twice 
the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about 4 
their positive vision of rural chile is shared by pinochets 
campaign strategists who predict overwhelming voter support from 
the heartland 
opposition leaders contend that the countrysides poor majority 
are suffering economically and are eager for a change but wont say 
so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government 
benefits such as pensions and housing subsidies 
the oppositions political campaign is aimed at overcoming such 
fears while recognizing them as legitimate one prominent campaign 
slogan in the countryside is say yes but vote no 
several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700 
pesos or less than 3 a day and lasted only a few months a year 
you cant live on that arias said 
jorge contreras who sells bread from the back of his small 
battered truck in the countryside around san fernando said most of 
his customers opposed pinochets continued rule 
i travel 50 kilometers 30 miles a day and i can tell you 
there are a lot more people for the no vote than the yes 
vote he said 
but he added lots of people may vote yes because theyre 
afraid he said that in one remote town on his bread route 
tinguiririca alto people are telling each other that if you vote 
no youll be arrested 
the government has said the vote will be secret and the 
opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each 
polling place to prevent intimidation

teddy roosevelt skips across the stage bullying 
subordinates and singing his joy at another war commodore george 
dewey orders the beginning of the battle of manila bay to a latin 
jazz accompaniment 
manifest destiny an evening of yankee panky opening 
wednesday in new york for a fiveshow run is the unlikeliest of 
musicals a bittersweet history of americas 1898 takeover of the 
philippines written by that nations foreign secretary raul 
manglapus 
inspired by the musical 1776 which ran on broadway from 
1969 to 1971 manglapus wrote yankee panky 14 years ago while 
on a selfimposed exile from the authoritarian rule of president 
ferdinand marcos 
he thought a musical would be a painless way to show a 
neglected part of our nations history said his son francis who 
is producing the play he really researched it the information 
that he gained for the play hes really using right now 
right now refers to manglapus protracted negotiations with 
washington over the future of us military bases in the islands 
he was appointed foreign secretary last year by president corazon 
aquino 
as a negotiator manglapus has demanded a steep increase in the 
amount of us aid in exchange for continued use of the bases the 
largest us military complex on foreign soil 
as a playwright he provides an insight into why some filipinos 
consider the military outposts an odious vestige of american rule 
in yankee panky us diplomats beguile philippine rebels 
promising them arms support and independence if they defeat the 
spanish colonialists but offering no written guarantees 
strawhatted american businessmen plot to wean filipinos from fruit 
juices to soft drinks and create new us export markets 
the garrulous roosevelt is portrayed nearly to satiric excess 
smoking cigars grinning and barking i say you cant civilize 
without the use of force 
with a score that ranges from tin pan alley to bossa nova 
yankee panky explores the broken promises the bloody 
suppression of a philippine war of independence in 18991901 and 
the battle for the philippine mind that ensued the nation finally 
gained independence in 1946 
the goal of this play is to destroy certain myths that people 
still cling to francis manglapus said during a rehearsal 
theres this myth that the united states has a special 
relationship with the philippines the united states is not 
looking out for our interests it is looking out for its 
interests 
manglapus wrote the play while on a ford foundation fellowship 
to study philippineamerican relations from 1898 to 1902 
a musical was a natural vehicle for the 69yearold manglapus 
at home on the piano xylophone and drums he had written songs to 
cheer fellow prisoners of the japanese in world war ii later he 
led a manila dixieland band the executives that jammed with 
lionel hampton and prince sihanouk of cambodia a parttime jazz 
clarinetist 
francis manglapus and director steve pudenz tried to stage 
yankee panky in 1980 but the philippines wasnt frontpage 
news then the younger manglapus said 
after marcos was toppled yankee panky became a success in 
manila and a recent crop of political plays on broadway encouraged 
manglapus and pudenz to take a plunge in new york 
its 35member cast performs traditional philippine dances and 
sings lyrics that range from superficial to spread civilization 
to improve sanitation to savage they like to play the 
democrat and never teach the little brown brat 
pudenz hopes its run at the episcopal cathedral of st john the 
divine in new york is a prelude for another presentation in 
washington 
we would love to do it in washington so that the state 
department and congress could see it and understand a little bit 
more pudenz said

the race for us senate between gop 
incumbent david karnes and democratic challenger bob kerrey has 
been disrupted by a thirdparty candidate a maverick legislator 
who was nominated at a convention held in a fastfood restaurant 
kerrey a former oneterm governor who is leading in the polls 
boycotted sunday what was to have been the second of eight campaign 
debates after organizers agreed to include state sen ernie 
chambers candidate of the leftwing new alliance party 
kerrey said monday he would engage in future debates with karnes 
only if the incumbent barred chambers and renounced the new 
alliance party which kerrey characterized as a fringe group bent 
on disrupting the political process 
the issue is whether the new alliance party deserves to be in 
our debates kerrey said i have said no i have said that a 
party of 14 members that holds its nominating convention in booth 
no 2 at dennys restaurant should not be included 
karnes called chambers a legitimate candidate who had a right to 
participate in the debates but on monday karnes said he would 
not be debating any further and blamed kerrey for the breakdown 
bob kerrey is the debatebuster in this campaign he said 
i believe kerrey has accomplished his goal of destroying the 
debate process i do not believe it will do me any good to 
continue 
the first debate certainly did karnes little good speaking at 
the state fair in lincoln on sept 5 he was booed when he said 
we need fewer farmers karnes who in one of his commercials 
picks up a bale of hay and is described as the farmersenator said 
the remark was a slip of the tongue 
karnes a lawyer for an omaha grain company was plucked from 
political obscurity in 1986 when newly elected gop gov kay orr 
chose him to succeed democratic sen edward zorinsky who died of a 
heart attack 
analysts believe karnes stands to gain from chambers candidacy 
chambers who is black is very popular in the predominantly 
lowincome democraticvoting north omaha district he has 
represented in the legislature for 18 years blacks make up about 
12 percent of omahas population and there are few blacks in the 
state outside its largest city 
chambers a barber has a long history of controversy in 
nebraska politics while most state senators wear suits on the 
floor of the legislature chambers wears a sweat shirt and blue 
jeans he once called libyan leader moammar gadhafi a great man 
and said president reagan was a ramboesque character in the last 
stages of senility 
chambers acknowledged that his candidacy could hurt kerrey but 
added it would be a mistake it would diminish me as a person 
and the significance of what im about to say im running this 
race to stop bob kerrey chambers said 
i want to stop both of them i want to win 
but stopping the democrats nationally is an avowed goal of the 
new alliance party a blackled organization that describes itself 
as multiracial leftist opposed to contra aid and nuclear weapons 
and favoring more rights for women and homosexuals 
in omaha last week new alliance presidential candidate lenora 
fulani said her campaign sought to dump dukakis

elected to remain on the senate ballot and said he would mount a 
writein legislative campaign

pope john paul iis 10day swing through 
africa has paradoxically served to reduce the stigma of any future 
visit to south africa while firmly including the vatican as a 
player in efforts to solve the regions conflicts 
an unexpected touchdown in johannesburg involvement in a 
hostage drama in lesotho and quiet diplomacy to nudge mozambique 
and south africa away from confrontation marked a trip which 
initially had only the trappings of the fourth papal pastoral visit 
to the continent 
you could say it was an act of grace commented vatican 
secretary of state agostino casaroli pondering the consequences 
after bad weather forced a landing in south africa the very 
country whose racial policies the pope excoriated at his first 
touchdown in zimbabwe 
before john pauls visit to zimbabwe botswana lesotho 
swaziland and mozambique some bishops and african leaders urged 
him to strike the nation of apartheid from any future travel but 
by the time the pope landed in rome monday night few voices 
against a future stopover had been raised 
even the rev allan boesak the protestant antiapartheid leader 
who attended a papal ecumenical papal meeting in maputo 
mozambique stopped short of discouraging a trip despite his 
charges that the pope had been too soft on the white minority 
government 
vatican prelates confirmed the pope would fly to madagascar and 
tanzania in 1989 and that he was considering a visit to rigidly 
marxist angola 
a customary vatican procedure is to include countries of the 
same region on one trip making the prospect of a south africa trip 
in the near future a distinct possibility 
after all the pope had now landed at jan smuts airport sipped 
tea with foreign minister pik botha ridden 190 miles in a 
bulletproof government sedan stopped for refreshments at an 
afrikaner gas station and visited people injured in the storming in 
lesotho of a hijacked bus during which six people were killed by 
south african commandos 
the pope who has rarely held back from sensitive subjects on 
his foreign tours continued to speak out 
he lectured the 20yearold king of swaziland and his four 
wives about polygamy 
he repeatedly nudged mozambiques marxist government 
overwhelmed by 6 million people on the edge of famine and by the 
ravages of a civil war to sit down at the negotiating table with 
rebels offering the churchs help if needed 
the latter subject was all the more delicate since president 
joaquim chissanos government until recently held on to confiscated 
church property while the mozambique resistance movement a 
shadowy group holding much of the country tried to depict itself 
to the vatican and the outside world as anticommunist and thus in 
favor of religious freedom 
john paul set his own agenda in some of the most graphic 
speeches of any papal trip exclaming yes my beloved brothers 
i have felt the heart of this country bleed i am taking home 
images of suffering the worried gaze of many children the look 
of uncertainty of so many youths the tired eyes of so many adults 
and the sad look of the aged 
becoming unusually specific he has permitted mozambican bishops 
to encourage negotiations between the government and rebels while 
backing a government program of amnesty which has already convinced 
2000 rebels to lay down their weapons 
the popes trip was like rain on scorched earth commented 
nampula bishop dom manuel vieira pinto saying it marked a turning 
point in churchstate relations 
on the government side jose luis cabaco head of the ruling 
frelimo partys foreign relations department said mozambique could 
endorse practically everything the pope had recommended 
cabaco added that the government also felt encouraged by the 
vatican in mozambiques efforts to revive a nonaggression pact and 
economic cooperation with south africa and by the popes worldwide 
appeal for aid 
according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
vatican as it has done in the case of poland and other countries 
is dangling the prospect of formal diplomatic relations with 
mozambique as an incentive for it to continue supporting the 
regional peace process and the thaw in religious freedom

a vast majority of bus and 
truck drivers heeded a nationwide transportation ban called by 
leftist rebels despite assurances from the military that traffic 
would be protected 
only a handful of mass transit buses circulated monday in this 
capital of 1 million inhabitants forcing workers to walk to their 
jobs or pay inflated fares to pickup truck and van owners 
more than 70 percent of urban bus traffic was halted and 
intercity service was even more severely curtailed an official of 
the bus owners association told the associated press 
a dispatcher at one of san salvadors two terminals said 90 
percent of the bus service between provinces was stopped 
the indefinite ban on bus and truck traffic was the fifth called 
this year by marxistled guerrillas waging a nearly 9yearold war 
against the usbacked government previous rebel bans lasted 
three days each 
the government urged citizens to ignore mondays ban saying the 
military would protect vehicles 
col mauricio vargas the army chief of operations told ysu 
radio that about 13000 soldiers were providing and protecting 
transport 
we refuse to allow a violent minority to impose its will on 
us he said 
soldiers rode shotgun aboard several stateowned buses 
circulating in the capital and some army trucks carried passengers 
to and from the city outskirts 
lorgio deleon a 48yearold father of six was stranded at the 
eastern bus terminal with no way to get to his tailors job in 
zacatecoluca 35 miles southeast of san salvador 
this hurts the poor worker more than anyone we dont work 
today we get our pay docked he said 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front said the 
ban was in response to the actions of riot troops who broke up a 
sept 13 demonstration by leftist university students 
the troops used tear gas and clubs and fired shots in the air to 
disperse nearly 3000 students at that protest about 250 
demonstrators were arrested 
all but 14 were subsequently released with the remainder 
charged with what the government called terrorist acts

a national dairy promotion program financed by 
dairy farmers should be tightened to eliminate slipshod accounting 
methods waste and unauthorized use of funds an agriculture 
department audit says 
the report by the usdas office of inspector general criticized 
the agricultural marketing service which administers the program 
for not providing adequate guidelines and controls over those 
sharing in the funds and for submitting incomplete information to 
congress 
ams annual report to congress did not include information 
relating to approximately 60 percent of the activities of the 
program the auditors said congress had not been informed as 
to the accountability of approximately 3744 million of 6197 
million of the dairy promotion program assessments for the 
threeyear period ending april 30 1987 
the inspector generals office said it was looking into at least 
one case of possible fraud however it declined to provide details 
and said only that a report on the investigation would be issued 
later 
the program was created by congress in a 1983 law that imposes a 
mandatory assessment of 15 cents for each 100 pounds of milk 
produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous states producers may 
assign up to 10 cents of the assessment to regional or state 
qualified programs or qps that have similar promotional projects 
but at least 5 cents of the assessment must be sent to the 
national dairy promotion and research board or national dairy 
board which consists of 36 dairy farmers appointed by the 
secretary of agriculture 
the board finances national promotional programs including 
television commercials to help sell more milk and other dairy 
products all subject to review by ams officials 
according to the report which has been circulating recently 
within the dairy industry and the department auditors looked into 
the use of program funds during the period of may 1985 through may 
1987 and other periods as deemed necessary 
during that period approximately 291 billion pounds of milk 
were marketed with an assessment of around 4369 million of 
which almost 1682 million was remitted to the national board and 
2687 million credited to the qps 
the audit report said 
five of the 18 qps reviewed passed 147 million of 156 
million in assessment funds collected to other qps and incurred 
approximately 235000 in administrative costs 
two other qps improperly used 106500 for activities such as 
school activity funds athletic tournaments support of veterinary 
services the national future farmers of america foundation and 
other miscellaneous accounts 
five qps with assessments funds totaling about 205 million 
had internal control weaknesses such as separation of duties 
management of promotional materials and procurement systems 
four qps incurred 24 million in administrative costs in 
excess of the 5 percent limit set by the national dairy board 
in the absence of guidelines concerning the use of the 
assessment funds the qps and an affiliated organization the 
united dairy industry association of rosemont ill had only 
their discretion to follow the report said 
auditors said they questioned the associations classification 
of about 58 million of administrative costs as program costs 
1500 in monthly per diem to the udias chairman of the board of 
directors and 85 per diem per day in excess of travelrelated 
expenses to members of the udia board 
the report recommended a general tightening up of procedures 
including accounting by the qps on how the money is spent also 
the departments agricultural marketing service should devise and 
implement guidelines that organizations must follow before 
getting any funds 
in its comments the ams agreed to some of the audit reports 
recommendation but said its authority on others was limited and 
that action by congress may be required 
if the department concludes that such additional oversight is 
desirable ams would be willing to discuss with congress the 
purpose and legislative intent of the law authorizing the dairy 
promotion program the marketing service said

when it comes to curbing the cotton boll 
weevil its a matter of timing and tillage rather than how much 
pesticide is used the agriculture department says 
a sevenyear study in the lower rio grande valley of texas led 
to a new state law last year that requires farmers to destroy 
cotton stalks by sept 15 by shredding the stalks and then 
following up with deep plowing the destructive weevils are 
deprived of winter shelter and food when they are dormant 
entomologist kenneth r summy of the departments agricultural 
research service says in a report that the rio grande study showed 
that farmers applied pesticides 15 times to 18 times a year in 1980 
and 1981 
but in 1984 following a year of moderate stalk destruction 
chemicals only had to be applied three or four times he said from 
1985 to 1987 pesticide use rose again sometimes equaling 1981 
levels because farmers didnt destroy the cotton stalks 
last year the texas legislature passed the law requiring cotton 
growers to destroy stalks annually by sept 15 in the rio grande 
zone later in other parts of the state 
to help state officials enforce stalk destruction usda 
scientists worked out a surveillance system for cotton fields by 
using infrared aerial photos to detect which fields are not plowed 
by the deadline summy said

portauprince haiti ap an upsurge in atrocities not seen 
in haiti since the terror of the 29year duvalier dynasty appears 
to have triggered an army revolt that toppled the government of lt 
gen henri namphy 
some see an opening for democratic reforms under haitis new 
leader lt gen prosper avril who announced on nationwide 
television sunday that he was assuming the presidency to save the 
country from anarchy and chaos 
but a haitian government official said privately that avril may 
be thwarted by the military high command which the official said 
is not favorable to an opening toward the civilian sector and 
wants to maintain its privileges 
before the coup avril was the armys adjutant general 
soldiers of the elite 1000man presidential guard ousted 
namphy and sent him to neighboring dominican republic early sunday 
after several hours of sporadic gunfire that apparently caused no 
casualties at least six people were reported killed however in 
what were described as reprisals against alleged tonton moucoutes 
thugs blamed for recent atrocities 
in justifying the coup sgt joseph heubreux said the 
noncommissioned officers who led it wanted to restore honor to the 
army and raise the prestige of the haitian people degraded by so 
many acts which have revolted the conscience of the haitian people 
and the world 
it was heubreux who appeared on television here to introduce 
avril as the new president of this impoverished caribbean island 
nation 
under namphy haiti experienced increased random killings and 
intimidation of groups advocating democratic reform 
in the worst recent outrage about 20 hoodlums brandishing 
machetes handguns and steel pikes burst into a roman catholic 
church during mass on sept 11 and slaughtered 13 people 
seventyseven others were wounded 
the toughs were identified as city hall workers and namphy and 
portauprince mayor franck romain were widely blamed for the 
attack 
romain is thought to be a leader of a macoutes faction he 
reportedly was arrested at the presidential palace shortly before 
the coup then taken to the dominican embassy he remained there 
monday seeking political asylum and awaiting an exit visa 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
church massacre was the apparent trigger for dissident 
noncomissioned officers who felt they were not getting proper pay 
and recognition 
avril had helped namphy overthrow the 4monthold civilian 
government of president leslie manigat in a bloodless coup on june 
19 
the diplomat said of the dissident sergeants under manigat 
they felt slighted and snubbed under namphy they did not receive 
the material signs of recognition they expected and on top of 
that the atrocity sept 11 must have affected them as 
menofthepeople 
among 19 demands the presidential guard presented to the 
military high command on sunday was a call for democracy with free 
elections 
it was uncertain whether the high command would agree to any 
democratic reforms 
avrils pledge to take part in a dialogue with opposition 
parties was generally welcomed but popular politician sylvio 
claude the christian democratic party leader remained skeptical 
according to claude avril is known as a duvalierist and all 
duvalierists are criminals 
avril has been closely identified with the duvalier regimes 
since the early 1960s when he took part in the struggle against 
antiduvalierist guerrillas francois papa doc duvalier 
destroyed the political power of the army in the 1960s with his 
private militia of thugs popularly known as tonton macoutes upon 
his death his son jeanclaude baby doc duvalier succeeded him 
in 1971 
after the fall of jeanclaude duvalier in february 1986 avril 
was briefly an adviser to the junta headed by namphy avril was 
dismissed in march 1986 after popular protest demonstrations 
against him 
larry birns director of the washingtonbased council of 
hemispheric affairs said the key to the future course of haitian 
politics lies with col jeanclaude paul commander of the feared 
700man dessalines barracks 
the military high command was said to be resisting efforts by 
the presidential guard to elevate paul to armed forces commander in 
chief 
paul has been indicated on drug trafficking charges by a federal 
court in florida white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in 
washington on monday that making paul army commander would 
certainly give us an indication of the difficulties we will have 
with this government if he is appointed 
birns said although skeptical that democracy is near in 
haiti i think it the coup is a hopeful sign namphys rule had 
degenerated into a highly eccentric and dangerous mode and 
something had to be done to get rid of him 
curiously enough in recent weeks jeanclaude paul has 
established close working relations with some democratic figures in 
haiti and soldiers from the dessalines barracks had been sent to 
guard catholic churches recently 
of course all these people jockeying for authoritarian 
power are thugs birns said its a question of relativity

solidarity leader lech walesa who was 
virtually ignored by polish newspapers and television for the past 
seven years is suddenly staging a remarkable comeback in the 
statecontrolled media 
two official publications last week ran interviews of walesa a 
newspaper printed a detailed profile of him radio polonia 
broadcast his words to its foreign audiences and most staterun 
newspapers had frontpage headlines last week such as kiszczak 
the interior minister meets walesa 
while walesa is not quite yet a media celebrity in poland his 
name is getting into print again for the first time since martial 
law was imposed in 1981 the change comes as the official press has 
begun to push the line that greater dialogue is needed to solve the 
countrys problems 
publication of the first interview thursday in the september 
issue of the monthly confrontations followed walesas agreement to 
end a wave of august strikes in return for the promise of a meeting 
with government officials that could lead to restoring his unions 
legal status 
walesa in the interview called for legalization of solidarity 
and for loosening central controls on the economy politics and 
society 
there must be solidarity he said of the union which was 
suppressed under the martiallaw crackdown of dec 13 1981 and 
outlawed the following year he added that solidarity could not 
function solely as a trade union until social and political 
pluralism also gets into the act in earnest 
asked about the recent negotiations with interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak he said it is either a big game in which you 
try to outmaneuver walesa once again or it is really the opening 
of a new chapter in polish history i hope the latter is right 
he called on poland to abandon centralized economic planning and 
embrace a system to create possibilities he added only in 
pluralism can i see a chance for progress and better living as 
responsible people we should discuss how to leave behind a model 
which has not stood the test 
adam kowalski deputy editor of confrontations said the editors 
felt satisfaction joy when they submitted the interview and 
got approval from the censorship office to publish it 
walesa spoke to the two reporters at his home on sept 1 the 
same day he ended a strike at the lenin shipyard in gdansk the two 
journalists also published a version of the interview in another 
magazine reporter 
stateowned radio polonia which beams official propaganda in 10 
languages to other countries around the world devoted six minutes 
friday of its daily halfhour broadcasts to a walesa interview a 
station spokesman said 
in the broadcast walesa said both he and the government had 
learned something during the past seven years 
you are the first polish journalists of the officially 
published press since december 13 1981 to ask me for an 
interview walesa was quoted in the opening line of the 
confrontations piece 
the sudden attention to walesa does not suit all poles after 
all for years walesa was referred to when at all only 
negatively as a private person as a former leader of a former 
union or as a tool of foreign powers 
i think that gen kiszczak should not talk to mr walesa 
because mr walesa is just the same kind of citizen as all of us 
said one man interviewed on the street by state television saturday

six out of 10 people with private nursing home 
insurance are likely to receive no benefits because of restrictions 
on their policies says a study released today by the united 
seniors health cooperative 
the study by the consumer advocacy group concludes many of the 
policies now being offered for sale are not likely to pay 
adequate benefits if and when people need them 
while there may be a role for the private insurance industry in 
filling the national need for longterm care protection this 
role should not include selling bad policies to unsuspecting 
consumers the study said 
jim firman president of the washingtonbased group and william 
weissert director of the program on aging at the university of 
north carolina conducted the study they based their findings on 
an analysis of 77 typical private longterm health care insurance 
plans offered by 21 companies 
the most common restriction found in 77 percent of the plans 
was that a person must first be hospitalized for his or her 
condition before being allowed to collect benefits for subsequent 
nursing home care 
fiftyfour percent of nursing home admissions do not come 
directly from a hospital and will not qualify for coverage under a 
plan with this restriction the report said 
the other major limitation included in 40 percent of the plans 
said people must first receive skilledlevel nursing home care 
before they can qualify for lower levels of longterm care such a 
requirement excludes 46 percent of nursing home residents the 
study said 
the effect of these exclusions is even more dramatic and 
troubling when combined with waiting periods and other 
restrictions the report said the average probability of not 
collecting benefits was 61 percent if you are admitted to a 
nursing home 
although 95 percent of the plans studied said they cover 
patients with alzheimers disease the researchers said 81 percent 
of the plans contain the two major restrictions regarding 
hospitalization and skilled care 
given the long duration and deteriorating characteristics of 
alzheimers disease it is likely that for much of the patients 
period of illness these restrictions would preclude eligibility 
for coverage they said 
the study said the most common type of nursing home coverage is 
a 50aday indemnity benefit an amount it labeled grossly 
inadequate to meet the expected costs of care 
if someone purchased such a plan now and entered a nursing home 
in 20 years the study said outofpocket costs could reach up to 
130000 if the plan had no inflation protection twothirds of the 
companies studied did not offer inflation protection 
for most people who are in a nursing home for a long period of 
time the effect of most of the plans we studied will be to delay 
but not to prevent eventual impoverishment the researchers said 
fiftysix of the plans studied offered home health care 
coverage but substantial restrictions make it unlikely that most 
persons in need of home care will collect significant benefits 
the study said 
the most common restriction is requiring a prior covered nursing 
home confinement before a policyholder can tap into home care 
benefits other plans require only prior hospitalization according 
to the report 
several lawmakers have introduced longterm care insurance 
schemes involving the federal government or joint publicprivate 
efforts congress is expected to consider the matter seriously next 
year

a special effort to count the nations 
homeless will be conducted as part of the 1990 census 
cynthia taeuber of the census bureau said monday that officials 
have decided to hold a separate count a few days before the 
regular national census in an effort to count those living on the 
streets and in shelters 
the homeless have become an increasingly visible part of 
american society but there are no concrete estimates of their 
numbers 
on march 20 1990 census takers will visit emergency shelters 
both public and private and will go to various street locations 
which have been identified as places the homeless congregate said 
taeuber 
the street search for the homeless will be conducted from 2 am 
to 4 am and shelters will be visited from 6 pm to midnight 
she said 
census officials will be working with various groups and 
agencies that serve as advocates for the homeless explained 
taeuber in order to determine in advance where to look for these 
people 
in addition the agency will encourage people with those groups 
and the homeless themselves to work as enumerators in the count 
however these workers will have to pass the same written exams and 
other criteria as all census workers 
census day for most of the nation is april 1 1990 the count of 
the homeless is being taken a few days early however because many 
shelters close at the end of march or beginning of april taeuber 
said 
she added that the census bureau will not try to define who 
constitutes a homeless person instead it will merely issue counts 
of people living on the streets and those staying in various types 
of shelters

a shave and a haircut used to cost nothing if 
you were a united states senator and were shaved and trimmed in the 
united states senate barber shop 
and when one reformminded senator tried to eliminate free 
senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago his 
shavedforfree colleagues rebelled 
the senator was the late paul douglas of illinois and his 
experience was recalled in a recent senate speech by senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas 
douglas had gone to the senate barber shop for a haircut 
after the barber had done his work said dole douglas 
began to think that his income was ample enough to pay for his own 
haircut which then cost a dollar and a quarter and not charge 
it to the taxpayer 
so douglas introduced an amendment to the annual legislative 
appropriations act to cut off funds for the barber shop unless it 
began charging senators for its services 
the counterattack was not long coming 
at a senate hearing sen carl hayden of arizona complimented 
douglas on his haircut then recalled that the haircut issue was 
one that flared from time to time 
hayden said that when he first came to the senate he became 
disturbed at newspaper articles complaining about free senatorial 
haircuts and discussed the matter with senate veteran william borah 
of idaho 
senator borah said you tell that reporter to go to the 
devil i want the same service that was received here by henry clay 
and john c calhoun 
dole picked up the story saying after a good laugh the 
senate shouted down senator douglas amendment and the free 
haircut survived 
but only for the monent 
i want to assure taxpayers that today senators pay their own 
way when they have their hair cut as senator douglas tried and 
failed to accomplish 37 years ago dole said 
while they pay more than a dollar and a quarter the senate 
barbering charges may be a bit gentler than those of most 
commercial barbershops 
the current charge for a haircut in the senate barbershop is 
450 
more elaborate cuts are 650 hair styling costs 900 
a shave costs 400

the united states and its industrial allies 
are trying to slow the development of missiles in argentina brazil 
and north korea and hope to have the cooperation of the soviet 
union in the global campaign against proliferation 
the state department confirmed on monday that the seven allies 
meeting in rome sept 89 exchanged expressions of concern about 
missile proliferation and technology transfers that might enhance 
argentinas capability 
afterward a us official told the associated press the same 
group registered concern in its deliberations about programs in 
brazil and north korea 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
secretary of state george p shultz may pursue the problem with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze during their talks 
in washington on thursday and friday 
in any event the official said assistant secretary of state h 
allen holmes will take up the issue at talks in washington next 
week with viktor p karpov senior soviet arms control negotiator 
north koreas attempt to extend the range of its scud b missile 
should demonstrate to the soviets the proliferation problem extends 
to their region the official said 
brazils attempt to develop the sonda iv missile is the other 
program the united states discussed with representatives of 
britain france west germany italy canada and japan the 
official said 
it was an attempt to keep everybody up to date in the area 
the official said they did not adopt any special program thats 
not the way it works 
meanwhile spokesman charles e redman referring to the 
mediumrange condor ii that argentina reportedly is developing with 
the help of egypt and iraq said the basic concern is that we do 
what we can to limit this kind of technology because it is the kind 
of technology that produces missiles that would be 
nuclearcapable 
he said they also would exceed the range of parameters we 
established meaning a range beyond 180 miles and a payload in 
excess of 1100 pounds 
the seven countries agreed last year that they would not export 
missiles or technology for them that went beyond these limits 
meanwhile an arab league representative voiced concern about 
israels launch monday of a test satellite into orbit and said it 
meant the arabs would have to strengthen their defenses 
clovis maksoud who represents the arab league in the united 
states said the satellite gave israel a serious strategic 
leverage since the country already had the capability to fire 
longrange missiles 
maksoud in an interview stressed steps taken jointly by israel 
and the united states to strengthen their strategic ties 
he cited us inclusion of israel in the program to develop a 
spacebased defense against ballistic missiles and israels 
record which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability 
as a result maksoud said the launching of a test satellite 
warrants enhancing arab defensive capabilities so that any 
mideast negotiations produce a peaceful outcome rather than 
ratifying israeli hegemony 
the satellite is designed for communications purposes but the 
arab league official said it could be used to monitor israels foes 
we are deeply concerned that such a communications satellite 
can be modified into a spy system and therefore further enhance 
the strategic imbalance which the americanisraeli strategic 
agreement has introduced maksoud said 
state department spokesman redman said the united states was not 
involved in any way with the israeli program 
we dont have any details of the launch beyond what was 
reported by the israelis he said 
a spokesman for the us space command in colorado cmdr dugald 
gillies said american radars and sensors picked up the israeli 
satellite shortly after launch its orbit has been calculated to 
have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155 miles he 
said 
it was launched early monday eastern daylight time and is in a 
near polar orbit gillies said 
defense officials at the pentagon said they were unsure exactly 
what the satellites payload included 
but were leaning toward more of an experimental 
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite said 
one source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
this launch is impressive because its a first but i dont 
think this particular satellite is going to offer much more ability 
to keep tabs on their neighbors the source said 
redman stressed that israeli leaders had given public assurances 
that their goal was peaceful purposes of space research and 
technological advancement 
israel is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space the 
country is generally believed to have nuclear capability

more than 1 million in federal grants have 
been earmarked for five rural health research centers that will 
provide information on a range of concerns about medical services 
the awards were announced monday by otis r bowen secretary of 
the department of health and human services at the first meeting 
of the national advisory committee on rural health the panel was 
created last june to advise congress and hhs 
bowen said the economic diversity of americas towns and 
villages must be taken into account in considering ways of 
improving rural health care services 
twentyeight percent of the rural counties in this country 
depend on manufacturing as a source of economic support a 
surprising 21 percent have become retirement settlements 13 
percent depend on farming and 8 percent rely on oil and mining 
bowen said 
jerry coopey a department of health and human services 
spokesman said that among the problems faced in trying to provide 
adequate health services in rural areas are too few medical 
personnel especially in obstetrics and gynecology the closing of 
small hospitals and the rising costs of malpractice insurance 
the research center grants were awarded to 
rural health office of the arizona area health education 
center college of medicine university of arizona tucson 
209486

president reagan welcomed senate approval of a 
freetrade agreement with canada as a prelude to a new surge of 
economic growth in both countries but the accords future is 
clouded by political conflict in ottawa 
it will benefit our people for generations to come reagan 
said monday following 839 senate approval of the agreement with 
americas top trading partner 
the agreement will create jobs and stimulate economic growth 
on both sides of the border and create the largest open market in 
the world he said 
the senate approved not only the agreement signed jan 2 by 
reagan and canadian prime minister brian mulroney but also a bill 
that would set the stage for the 10year phaseout of tariffs called 
for under the pact 
in canada final approval of the agreement remains blocked by 
political wrangling 
plans to phase out tariffs have been passed by the canadian 
house of commons but are bottled up in the senate where the 
controlling liberal party says action must await new parliamentary 
elections 
mulroney is expected to call elections within a few weeks and 
defeat for his conservative party could doom the agreement 
us officials said little about the political wrangling north 
of the border democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee which 
largely shaped the legislation said canadian political disputes 
should be left to canadians 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter told reporters 
following the senates action that it puts us one step closer to 
the culmination of a centurylong dream on both sides of the 
border 
on the roll call 43 democrats joined 40 republicans in voting 
for the measure which never had any partisan coloring while seven 
democrats and two republicans opposed it 
israel is the only country that currently has a freetrade 
agreement with the united states but the volume is small compared 
with the 131 billion in goods a year that make canada this 
countrys top trading partner 
there has been talk of freetrade agreements with japan no2 in 
volume of trade with the united states and mexico but no such 
deals are on the horizon 
senators with homestate industries that might suffer under the 
canadian agreement waged a largely symbolic rear guard fight 
against it 
some lawmakers from wheat producing states objected to a 
lingering canadian subsidy for rail transportation of grain from 
saskatchewan and alberta to the big eastern port at thunder bay 
ontario under the agreement however current subsidies for 
sending wheat to vancouver would be dropped 
transportation costs represent a substantial portion of the 
price of grain and american wheat producers have complained that 
farmers north of the border will be able to undercut them because 
of the continued subsidies 
american energy companies have complained that lowerpriced 
canadian products are likely to undercut them 
and fearing that hollywood and american publishers would 
overshadow canadas homegrown culture canadians also insisted on 
curbs affecting us cultural exports 
sen george j mitchell dmaine declared that canadas potato 
subsidies combined with curbs on us potato imports amounted to 
a dramatic double whammy that no american industry should be 
forced to endure 
bentsen urged approval of the measure although he was gone from 
the senate by the time of the vote as was gop vice presidential 
candidate dan quayle of indiana but the texan in a morning speech 
acknowledged that this agreement is not all that it could have 
been 
sen max baucus dmont said the measure clearly has 
weaknesses 
but it is progress more progress than we have seen in some 
time baucus told the senate 
voting against the measure were mitchell john melcher dmont 
william s cohen rmaine jeff bingaman dnm quentin burdick 
dnd kent conrad dnd pete domenici rnm wendell ford 
dky and carl levin dmich 
besides bentsen and quayle those not voting were sens david 
boren dokla jake garn rutah chic hecht rnev frank 
lautenberg dnj james mcclure ridaho and howard metzenbaum

marilyn quayle has done 2020 her husband 
dan the republican running for the countrys no 2 job has not 
he sometimes stumbles over his words she never does 
he can freeze when a reporter asks an unexpected question she 
is always prepared and the only frozen look is the one she icily 
bestows on an unfriendly questioner 
mrs quayle who is on her first solo national campaign swing 
this week is considered one of the stronger assets of her 
husbands campaign 
her skills said a senior campaign official have been 
recognized and she has been asked to travel independently 
hooking up with the indiana senator for joint appearances one or 
two days each week 
at 39 mrs quayle is a selfpossessed woman whose flip hairdo 
and toothy smile evoke early mary tyler moore she is a mother of 
three and a lawyer although she hasnt practiced for some years 
as a political wife shes strong willed fiercely protective 
and her husbands most trusted adviser 
on the campaign trail she can be warm and cordial quick with a 
handshake for her husbands supporters or a hug for children at a 
day care center but she also can be cold and withdrawn especially 
around reporters 
a practiced campaigner mrs quayle nevertheless is unaccustomed 
to the nancy reaganlike role she has played so far smiling 
pleasantly at her husbands side applauding at the appropriate 
points 
ive never sat listening to him give speeches and all of that 
i always had my own schedule of campaigning she said in a recent 
interview 
she handles most situations with aplomb when a precocious 
4yearold at a colorado day care center commented on mrs quayles 
slightly protruding teeth as a little buck mrs quayle smiled 
and said cheerfully not many people notice that 
she believes the press has given her husband the bad rap in 
coverage of controversies over his military service academic 
record and personal life she told barbara walters on abctvs 
2020 program that the press was after her husband because he 
was so conservative she hasnt changed that view 
i have my opinion which is reinforced by some studies that 
have been done on where the majority of the media is coming from 
its liberal she said 
she often pulls her husband away from reporters touching his 
arm or patting him on the back if he begins to respond to impromptu 
questions 
it is on such occasions when quayle talks extemporaneously 
that he tends to misspeak or otherwise garble his words but mrs 
quayle says she is not trying to protect him 
hed stand there and talk forever she said im trying to 
get him back on the plane 
he is outgoing and affable she seems more introspective often 
aloof but theirs appears to be a marriage more of similarities 
than differences 
dan quayle and marilyn tucker met in 1972 when both were 
attending night classes at indiana university law school ten weeks 
later they were married they opened a law office together in 
huntington ind quayles hometown mrs quayle worked until the 
birth of their second son 
she is her husbands closest aide at one news conference 
quayle said his wife is my best adviser my strongest supporter 
the person that i love more than anybody else in this world 
she is a very strong independentminded woman and she and i 
have a very close relationship he said 
mrs quayle says simply i have a husband who has always 
valued my opinion and used me as an aide our basic fundamental 
values are the same we have the same philosophy 
she says she thus far achieved everything she has set out to do 
for several years she has enjoyed oil painting eventually she 
says she may go back to work 
her children tucker 14 benjamin 11 and corinne 9 all 
have ideas about what they want to be she says she wants them to 
pick their goals and make them high enough that once they reach 
them or try to attain them they dont feel that theyve 
shortchanged themselves 
as for her own goals mrs quayle hasnt picked out a pet 
project or special area she would like to concentrate on as a vice 
presidents wife 
im one of those people that have learned in politics you 
dont plan anything until the election is over she said

a panel of former and present cabinetlevel 
health officials agreed that care for americas poor women and 
children is inadequate but disagreed on how to improve it 
arthur fleming who served from 195861 as secretary of health 
education and welfare the forerunner to todays department of 
health and human services said the united states needed a 
universal system of coverage to ensure adequate care 
margaret heckler hhs secretary from 198385 agreed that health 
care services for the poor needed improvement but heckler the 
current us ambassador to ireland said if it is based on the 
system in great britain we dont want that ive seen it and many 
people are now asking to go to private physicians britain has a 
nationalized health care system 
thats not what were talking about fleming countered 
great britain has got a government in power that has starved the 
system 
the comments were made monday at a meeting of the national 
commission to prevent infant mortality which is composed of hew 
and hhs secretaries from the eisenhower through the reagan 
administrations the group was asked to help find ways to make 
child health a national priority but it issued no program for 
action 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the commission created 
by congress presented the problem in graphic terms 
millions of children are forced to go without health care 
because they cant afford it or they cant find it chiles said 
noting that the us infant mortality rate in 1985 ranked 19th 
among all industrialized nations 
this simply means that a child born in singapore or hong kong 
will have a better chance of reaching its first birthday than a 
child that is born in the united states he said this means 
that nearly 40000 babies every year in our country will be in a 
cemetery rather than in a nursery 
current hhs secretary otis r bowen put the emphasis on what 
parents and local leaders can do not on federal government 
involvement 
innocent babies are being crippled by aids alcohol or drug 
abuse bowen said adding that 50 to 60 percent of all health 
costs in the united states are spent on preventable health 
problems 
he urged prospective parents to make the necessary lifestyle 
changes to ensure their childrens health and asked religious 
leaders to help the children make the proper lifestyle choices 
bowen also noted the actions business could take in providing 
proper child care and health services to working mothers as well 
as contributions to medical research 
this is a problem that people can do something about said 
david mathews hew secretary from 197577 for all our efforts to 
describe the problem we give the impression that only if you are 
professional if youre an expert can you do something about the 
problem and thats not true 
other panelists were joseph a califano jr hhs secretary 
197779 robert finch hew secretary 19691970 elliot richardson 
hew secretary 197073 and richard schweiker hhs secretary 198183 
areas of agreement among panelists included 
the health care delivery system does not match the populations 
needs 
pregnant women cannot get adequate health care 
for too many of those who need it insurance is not available 
too little is being spent on prevention of childrens health 
problems 
there is a fragmentation of services which should be offered at 
central locations 
the federal government should take some responsibility in 
setting up above standard day care facilities

the phillips collection art gallery announced 
monday it has received a 15 million donation the largest since 
its founding from japanese industrialist yasuhiro goh 
phillips officials say they believe gohs donation is the 
largest and possibly the first significant gift from a japanese 
citizen to an american museum 
i like the phillips because its comfortable a unique sort 
of museum said goh who has been visiting the gallery for about 
40 years 
goh said he decided to make the contribution after being asked 
to join the gallerys board 
national gallery director j carter brown and tom freudenheim 
the smithsonians assistant secretary for museums said such a 
large gift from a private japanese citizen was unprecedented 
and asked for gohs address and telephone number 
gohs wife is a member of the ishibashi family which founded a 
collection of french and japanese impressionist and 
postimpressionist art in tokyo about the same time that duncan 
phillips began his collection in the first quarter of this century 
but goh stressed that phillips gift comes from him not the 
ishibashi foundation or the familys bridgestone tire company 
the donation will go toward expansion of a wing of the gallery 
to be opened in may 1989 which now will be named the goh annex

the resignation of an entire cabinet for 
the first time in postwar poland raises the possibility that more 
noncommunists even opposition figures will be brought into 
government parliament deputies say 
the sejm or parliament voted 3591 with 17 abstentions monday 
to accept the resignation of prime minister zbigniew messner and 
all 19 ministers in his government which had been sharply 
criticized for its handling of the economy 
in freewheeling debate that preceded the vote one deputy 
suggested inviting opposition members into whatever governing team 
is named another urged reinstatement of the outlawed solidarity 
free trade union movement 
inflation that has reached 60 percent helped provoke a wave of 
labor unrest in the spring and a second round of strikes last month 
that ended when communist authorities agreed to talks with the 
opposition that may include the issue of legalizing solidarity 
scheduled for next month the talks are to focus on the solving 
countrys daunting economic and social problems 
the current cabinet is to remain in place until the sejm names a 
new government which it is expected to do later in the month 
we are looking for someone who is competent someone who has 
imagination and charisma said alfred miodowicz a member of the 
communist partys ruling politburo and leader of the official trade 
union federation opzz 
in poland the communist party holds ultimate power appoints 
the government and mandates policy 
krystyna jandyjendroska chairwoman of a sejm committee that 
criticized the economic performance of messners government said 
in her report to parliament that more coalition forces from 
outside the party should be brought into government including 
experts on the economy 
polish united workers communist party deputy ryszard 
lukasiewicz a warsaw journalist urged a system of socialist 
parliamentary democracy 
different social groups including the opposition must assume 
participation within the authorities he said it would mean 
significant changes in the model of the partys leadership and 
working out a model of a ruling coalition 
the comments appeared in line with statements from authorities 
in recent months that the government should broaden its base of 
support 
fifteen of the resigning governments 19 ministers are 
communists two have no party affiliation and there is one 
minister each from the communistallied peasant party and 
democratic party 
the topic of solidarity and its chairman lech walesa came up 
several times in the discussion that followed messners 
announcement of the resignations 
solidarity should regain its proper place in the trade union 
movement said ryszard bender an independent parliament member 
from lublin it was the first call in parliament for legalizing 
solidarity since the movement was suppressed with a 1981 military 
crackdown 
addressing polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski bender said 
jaruzelski and walesa the first nobel peace prize laureate in 
polish history should meet and make a joint statement concerning 
polands most vital interests 
jaruzelski smiled slightly but did not otherwise react 
in all about 30 deputies spoke with several endorsing the 
planned broadbased talks that are to include the opposition 
at least speaker suggested the government was being used as a 
whipping boy 
the situation resembles a soccer game said tomasz adamczuk 
a peasant party member the players are the political parties 
the polish trade union alliance the opposition and others he 
said the ball is the government

for five homeless years on new york citys mean 
streets chris martin said he turned dozens of 5 tricks a day with 
other men to feed his crack habit slept in a saltfilled warehouse 
and washed in a fire hydrant 
i was selling my body for drugs i was in a dead end zone 
martin said monday 
it was a scary life youre on your own nobodys there to 
guide you you dont care where you sleep he said i couldnt 
trust nobody i couldnt trust myself 
martin who left home at age 15 is one of an estimated 10000 
homeless youths in new york city according to covenant house an 
advocacy group founded 20 years to shelter and feed teenagers who 
ran away or were abandoned by their parents 
children under 18 are the fastest growing segment of the 
homeless population according to an estimate released monday by 
the national academy of sciences 
its the era of the disposable child said john keels of 
covenant house 
for them its a daytoday struggle for survival if you can 
call it that said elizabeth burnwell of covenant house they 
sell their bodies to survive they panhandle they deaden 
themselves with drugs or alcohol 
each night covenant house founded by the rev bruce ritter 
dispenses two vans to round up homeless children and offer them 
beds meals and clean clothes at a shelter 
the van found martin at a ratinfested garbagestrewn warehouse 
where the city stockpiles salt for streets in winter homeless 
youths have built a shantytown of mattresses and crates or they 
sleep in junked garbage trucks 
theyre brave kids ritter said theyre desperate to get 
back off the streets most of them wont make it 
one who made it into the shelter was kenny uledi of brooklyn 
who lived for six months on the streets with his 16yearold 
brother after they were abandoned his parents were drug addicts 
who were evicted from their home and left without a word or trace 
uledi said 
we robbed car radioes we robbed cold cuts from supermarkets 
we slept on roofs anything to get by said the 5foot8 
130pound uledi the pain evident in his blue eyes 
you wonder where your next meal is coming from its hard out 
there in the streets i want to forget it all he said 
street kids are not included in the citys count of the 
homeless as of sept 1 the city had 5135 homeless families in 
system including 10799 children according to the citys human 
resources administration they stay in a system of 39 hotels and 35 
shelters 
in some hotels prostitutes turn tricks on stairwells crack is 
sold openly beatings occur every day and a family of four may be 
crowded in a 9by12foot room 
theres nothing a kid doesnt see in here said jackie 
macklin 31 who lived for four years in one of the citys welfare 
hotels 
she sent her 11yearold twin daughters to live in philadelphia 
with their grandmother in 1987 after they saw a security guard shot 
dead in the holland hotel 
these children live under the most extreme conditions of 
adversity of any child population in the developed world theyre 
the closest thing we have to refugees in the third world said 
dr irwin redlener of new york hospital 
its total depravation they have been disconnected from a 
useful support system a civilized society tries to provide were 
going to pay a price for this redlener said 
redlener treats 200 homeless children a week from two medical 
vans that are pediatric clinics on wheels half the patients lack 
immunization and many suffer from ear infections and asthma 
redlener said 
its a way of dying on the installment plan said gretchen 
buchenholz of the association to benefit children an advocacy 
group that runs a shelter for children 
their life is so harsh they lose their childhood the magic 
that belongs to being a child its very sad to see a child lose 
that resilience were doing irreparable harm she said 
were killing a generation of very poor kids said robert 
hayes founder of new yorks coalition for the homeless its an 
abandonment of the most fragile people to the most devastating of 
environments

two rescueswimmer instructors testified 
under immunity monday backing up the story of a sailor standing 
courtmartial in the drowning of a navy recruit during a training 
exercise 
the defense rested later monday and the trial was recessed 
until thursday when closing arguments will be made by lawyers on 
both sides 
the military judge cmdr newell d krogmann planned to meet 
tuesday with lawyers to work on instructions for the panel of five 
officers hearing the case one panel member asked for an additional 
days delay because wednesday is yom kippur a jewish holiday said 
lt cmdr dennis hessler a navy spokesman 
petty officer 2nd class michael combe 28 of tempe ariz has 
denied he helped push airman recruit lee mirecki back into a 
swimming pool march 2 after mirecki panicked and climbed out 
he also testified that mirecki 19 from appleton wis 
completed a lifesaving maneuver in which he freed himself from a 
head hold applied by combe just seconds before collapsing in the 
pool at pensacola naval air station 
the navy has accused combe of forcing mireckis head under water 
and charged him with involuntary manslaughter battery and 
conspiracy to commit battery 
combe was in the pool at the time other instructors pried 
mirecki away from an equipment rack and dropped him back in the 
water testified petty officer 2nd class frankie d deaton 
deaton said he and nowretired petty officer 2nd class david 
smith who testified friday were joined by two other instructors 
whose identity he was unable to remember in pushing mirecki into 
the pool 
deaton said he didnt see what happened after mirecki was tossed 
back in the pool because he went into the lockerroom 
but petty officer 2nd class john zelenock was close by and 
supported combes contention that mirecki completed the escape and

banned gold chains designer sunglasses or other expensive status 
symbols to prevent an expensive competition students cant afford 
the principal says 
i see and hear about the youngsters being shot over gold 
chains as they walk to and from school mumford high school 
principal robin e oden said my kids students have been 
harassed recognizing that i want to make sure that it doesnt 
spill over into the school 
the dress code established this school year also bans tank tops 
jogging suits snakeskinadorned gym shoes and like finery at the 
2500student innercity school which gained fame through 
tshirts murphy wore in the film beverly hills cop 
a student who violates the code gets a written notice which is 
sent to his or her parents repeat offenses can result in a 
threeto fiveday suspension 
oden said a 14yearold student told him last year that she had 
heard a dress code was being considered and that she hoped one 
would be adopted 
she said she couldnt afford to purchase expensive things and 
felt bad when she couldnt compete with her peers the principal 
said that troubled me so i talked to other students and found 
out they felt the same way 
rivalry involving expensive clothing has sometimes turned 
violent two 17yearold boys were wounded by gunfire last year 
after one was robbed of a blue sheepskin jacket

brand of gym shoes when a 13yearold was shot in the chest after 
giving his gym shoes to five youths who demanded them 
on a recent afternoon some students were spotted near mumford 
high wearing gold or other expensive jewelry and other banned 
items they said they stashed it at school during the day then 
wore it home 
oden said a student who did the same thing was assaulted by two 
boys who robbed her of two gold chains he said he told other 
students of the incident at an assembly 
oden said he is encouraged by the students following the code 
i invite you to stand out in the hall and i dare you to find 
any gold jewelry he said weve had to deal with some 
students but we have not had any suspensions to this day about 98

despite criticism from the american medical 
association the county board voted monday to give patients at cook 
county hospital the right to refuse treatment from health care 
workers who are carriers of the aids virus 
the hospital would become the first in the country to adopt such 
a policy hospital officials said they have not yet developed a way 
to implement it however 
the county board which also serves as the hospitals board of 
directors voted 152 to adopt the policy approval was expected 
after the policy was adopted by the boards health and hospital 
committee last week 
the policy covers all hospital workers who routinely provide 
direct patient care including doctors and nurses but medical and 
hospital associations have called it misguided 
our reaction is one of dismay said dr lonnie bistow 
speaking for the ama after the committee vote last week there 
has been no case in this country of a patient contracting the aids 
virus from a healthcare worker 
acquired immune defficiency syndrome destroys the bodys 
defenses against diseases leaving a person prey to 
lifethreatening infections and certain cancers 
aids has struck more than 72000 people in this country since 
1979 and killed more than 40000 of them according to the natioal 
centers for disease control

sen dan quayle stumping across republican 
strongholds in the west is skewering michael dukakis as a 
massachusetts liberal out of sync with voters on a host of issues 
from gun control to taxes to defense 
quayle today was visiting an irrigation project at a nearby 
diversion dam then holding a rally on the steps of the state 
capital before flying on to las vegas 
he faced spirited hecklers monday at a knoxville stop before 
journeying to casper wyo and here but didnt let them interrupt 
his volley of criticism at dukakis defense posture and his record 
as governor of massachusetts 
chicken hawk signs and catcalls like those he heard in 
knoxville serve as reminders of the controversy over his getting in 
the national guard at the height of the vietnam war 
but the indiana senator now has campaigned in 30 states since 
george bush tapped him as his running mate five weeks ago nevada 
will be the 31st he will add a 32nd arizona when he flies there 
wednesday before a return visit to california 
his mission as he told 250 supporters at a rally in casper on 
monday evening is to take a hard look at dukakis record for 
competence and burst his bubble for the voters of america 
the west has a lot of big open spaces just like the dukakis 
defense record quayle told the casper crowd 
he laughed as he recalled the sight of a helmetclad dukakis 
riding in a tank last week 
in just one week his defense policy went from general 
confusion to general patton the indiana senator said 
he claimed that dukakis wants to disarm everyone except the 
police and military and said that while dukakis brags about 
being a cardcarrying member of the aclu american civil 
liberties union bush belongs to the national rifle association 
he also criticized dukakis for opposing the death penalty under 
any circumstances and said that he let killers out of jail on 
weekend junkets in massachusetts 
in knoxville and casper he charged that dukakis was driving 
citizens away from massachusetts with high taxes and spending 
higher spending per capita than any other state thats not what 
you want to rank first in he said 
he charged that dukakis did not create an economic miracle in 
massachusetts he created an economic manacle 
quayle said massachusetts ranks 40th out of 50 states in total 
employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth it actually 
lost 90000 manufacturing jobs between june 1984 and january 1988 
he said 
former tennessee sen and white house chief of staff howard 
baker who accompanied quayle to knoxville said after the 
boisterous rally he handled it well thats the real test of a 
politician the hecklers were few but they were noisy he didnt 
get angry he made his speech and cast one missile at them and 
it took the crowd was with him 
quayle conceded that massachusetts has a low unemployment rate 
but said that is because people are leaving massachusetts 
quayle said dukakis raised virtually every tax in 
massachusetts and opposed a statewide proposition that limited 
tax increases when taxes were cut quayle said the credit 
belonged to the legislature not the governor

be in critical condition officials would not confirm the report 
the government decided tuesday to place crown prince akihito 
54 the emperors eldest son in charge of all matters of state 
until the emperor recovers defense agency head kichiro tazawa said 
tazawa told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that the 
cabinet was expected to formally approve the appointment thursday 
kyodo said the government was considering whether to advise 
cabinet members to remain at their offices and not leave tokyo 
the emperors death would plunge japan into official mourning 
for which there would be no modern precedent hirohito has been on 
the throne since 1926 and older japanese who grew up when he was 
considered divine revere him greatly those born after world war ii 
tend to have less interest in the emperor who renounced his 
divinity after the war 
court physicians were summoned to the palace in central tokyo 
after the emperor vomited blood shortly before 10 pm 9 am edt 
monday and they gave him a blood transfusion for four hours 
beginning at 1230 am tuesday the imperial official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the doctors ruled out hospitalizing the aged emperor 
television and news service reports said hirohito received 17 
pints of blood during the transfusion and was fully conscious 
during the treatment 
following the transfusion the emperors temperature fell to 
about 986 degrees and his pulse was a normal 90 beats per minute 
according to the imperial official 
after two consecutive days of fever hirohitos condition grew 
worse late monday imperial officials said court phsycians found 
traces of jaundice in his blood and would perform minor surgery if 
the fever continued 
hirohito suffered a 1004 degree fever sunday 
almost one year ago on sept 22 the emperor underwent an 
intestinal operation and doctors found a hard eggsize 
enlargement of the pancreas which blocked the duodenum surgeons 
did not remove the blockage but performed a bypass around it 
in recent weeks the emperor has suffered a cold according to 
the imperial agency and news reports last week said he has lost 20 
pounds from his weight of 130 pounds before his surgery last year 
akihito heir to the chrysanthemum throne that hirohito has held 
since christmas day 1926 and crown princess michiko came to the 
palace tuesday morning nationally broadcast television reports 
showed limousines bearing members of the imperial family arriving 
at the palace to pay their respects 
prime minister noboru takeshita visited early tuesday to sign

for all the grand designs of the presidential 
nominees a large number of americans believe neither candidate 
could deliver on most of his campaign promises a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
about half the 1125 adults in the national survey saw both men 
as strong leaders with michael dukakis rated by more as 
compassionate and george bush rated by more as competent to manage 
the federal government 
but just 36 percent said bush could accomplish most of his 
stated goals in office and only 31 percent said dukakis could do 
most of what he wants nearly half said either would be stymied in 
office the rest were unsure 
seven in 10 respondents agreed nonetheless that the outcome of 
the election will have a major impact on the nations future but 
they were divided evenly 4545 on whether the election will 
affect them personally 
results of the poll conducted the week after labor day 
underscored bushs success since the republican convention at 
controlling the campaign agenda fiftytwo percent said he had 
clear positions on the issues while just 37 percent said the same 
of dukakis the results were released monday 
bush also was perceived as the better government manager 5034 
despite dukakis claim to the issue and 77 percent said bush 
understands the complex problems a president faces while only 44 
percent said that of dukakis 
bush won overwhelming endorsement as better able to maintain a 
strong defense chosen over dukakis by 67 percent 15 percent bush 
was narrowly seen as more likely to cut the federal deficit 3830 
in a measure that bodes well for an incumbent party six in 10 
said they were better off now than they were four years ago or 
eight years ago and 55 percent expected their family finances to 
improve in the next few years 
bush had mixed success in his effort to paint dukakis as more 
likely to raise taxes a plurality 45 percent said there wasnt 
likely to be any difference between the two when it comes to that 
issue 
dukakis was rated higher than bush on some personal issues 
sixtytwo percent said dukakis cares about people like them while 
50 percent said that of bush fortytwo percent said bush sometimes 
talks carelessly without considering the consequences just 30 
percent said that of dukakis 
the two were about equal in some other ratings six in 10 said 
both offer a vision of where they want to lead the country and five 
in 10 said both were strong leaders six in 10 said bush would have 
good judgment under pressure and five in 10 said that of dukakis 
bush was rated as better for the rich and dukakis as better for 
the poor but respondents were split on which would do more for the 
middle class they were nearly split on which candidate would do 
more to improve education with 39 percent choosing dukakis and 33 
percent bush 
bush led solidly among respondents who said they plan to vote 
and had definitely made a choice partly because a greater share of 
republicans said they had decided the gauge is a different one 
than in other national polls 
fiftyseven percent said they planned to vote and had made a 
definite choice they favored bush by 5639 dukakis led 4842 in 
a late juneearly july poll indicating that even opinions 
expressed as firm are movable 
the poll found a threeway split in ideology with about a third 
each calling themselves republicans democrats and independents 
other recent polls had similar results a departure from the 
longtime democratic lead in this measure 
the media generalap poll was conducted the week after labor 
day sept 614 among a random sample of adults nationwide it had 
a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points for all 
respondents four points for those who said they planned to vote 
and had chosen a candidate

aides to michael dukakis incensed by what one 
called george bushs misleading statistical hitandrun are 
organizing democratic surrogates to respond more aggressively to 
the vice presidents attacks which in recent days have focused on 
the massachusetts economy 
that strategy was evident monday when within hours of a bush 
speech the dukakis campaign called on eight business leaders to 
meet with reporters to rebut bushs characterization of the 
democratic nominee as an antibusiness governor 
dukakis advisers frustrated by what they contend has been far 
too little scrutiny of bushs attacks promised similar events in 
the future 
the latest salvos have particularly angered the dukakis camp 
because they center on the massachusetts economy the backbone of 
the dukakis candidacy 
our view is that a candidate has an obligation to tell the 
truth to the american people said kirk odonnell a senior 
dukakis adviser but george bush has played fast and loose with 
the facts last week and hes doing it again this week its what we 
call statistical hitandrun 
last week bush charged that massachusetts taxpayers had suffered 
under dukakis and that the state was 74 billion in debt a figure 
the bush campaign cited to assert that dukakis since 1983 had 
amassed more debt than all the governors from the pilgrims to ed 
king his predecessor 
the figures he cited to support the increased tax burden indeed 
showed that percapita taxes increased in massachusetts from 1983 
to 1987 but failed to factor in record growth of personal income in 
the state during that period taxes were cut in those years 
mostly over dukakis objections but the average massachusetts 
resident pays more taxes because he or she is earning more money 
and while dukakis is authorized to issue bonds totaling 74 
billion the states current bonded indebtedness is 39 million 
lower in inflationadjusted dollars than the debt dukakis inherited 
from king 
the bottom line is that in taxes across the board 
massachusetts citizens pay more than they did several years ago 
said bush spokesman mark goodin were not going to back down one 
iota 
bush continued his assault monday telling a chamber of commerce 
luncheon in pennsylvania that dukakis had an antibusiness 
scheme and that the number of business bankruptcies in 
massachusetts was up 237 percent during the first six months of 
the year while the national rate had fallen 235 percent goodin 
said the figures came from the small business administration 
dukakis aides said they had not seen those figures but again 
accused bush of misrepresentation citing figures showing business 
failures in massachusetts had declined by 28 percent since dukakis 
became governor in 1983 and that they had occurred at less than 
half the national rate during the reagan presidency 
were running against a guy who kicked off his campaign in 
disneyland said dukakis spokesman mark gearan referring to a 
labor day appearance there by bush he has goofy as his economist 
or something and is throwing out daffy statistics this is the kind 
of opponent we have and expected and we are prepared to run 
against 
gearan citing new jersey sen bill bradleys appearance on a 
weekend news program to support dukakis views on defense and 
foreign policy said leading members of the democratic party would 
be called on to rebut some bush charges while massachusetts 
business and industry leaders would address bush comments about the 
state economy 
my company has grown and prospered under the leadership of 
governor dukakis wang computer co founder an wang a dukakis 
supporter told the monday briefing he created the atmosphere 
that made it possible for us to grow 
dukakis will respond as well when he sees fit said gearan who 
with other dukakis aides encouraged increased media scrutiny of 
bushs statements 
bush has a record of being wrong odonnell said not only 
are we on notice but the press is on notice he has consistently 
misrepresented the facts and not been accurate 
goodin rejected that characterization as nonsense 
i think the big lie is that they are making massachusetts out 
to be some sort of economic miracle goodin said

the navys new trident 2 submarine 
missile has suffered a second failure in its last three test 
firings its wreckage tumbling into the atlantic ocean after it 
went astray and was deliberately blown up 
the 237 million missile blasted off a land launch pad monday 
and appeared to be accelerating smoothly across a clear sky when it 
suddenly exploded several miles above the ocean 
the navy reported that the trident 2 had developed a problem in 
the second stage about 60 seconds after liftoff and when it veered 
off course the range safety officer sent a radio signal to ignite 
explosive packages in the vehicle 
the failure was the third in 15 test firings for the missile 
being groomed as the most powerful in the navys nuclear arsenal 
but two of the last three have been destroyed by the range safety

the united nations opens its 43rd general 
assembly with enhanced prestige due to the iraniraq truce and 
afghan accords a reputation that may tarnish once debate begins 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar wryly observed that 
the world body convening today has high expectations to live up 
to 
if the united nations is treated as an angel then we must 
remember that the halo that slips 10 inches is a noose he said 
at a luncheon of the un correspondents association on monday 
the session opens with the election of the president of the 
general assembly after a behindthescenes fight that has revived 
some lingering enmity from the 1982 falkland islands war between 
britain and argentina 
foreign minister dante caputo of argentina has campaigned hard 
against barbados un ambassador dame ruth nita barrow who 
britain has backed 
diplomatic sources said the race was too close to call and 
there could be several secret ballots before one candidate wins a 
simple majority of the assemblys 159 voting member states the 
outgoing president is peter florin from east germanys foreign 
ministry 
the united nations has won progress and praise with its 
iraniraq truce afghan accord and other looming peace initiatives 
in southern africa cambodia and the western sahara but the 
general debate that begins monday may generate more heat than light 
one fight is expected over a proposed address by south korea on 
the 40th anniversary of its founding both it and communist north 
korea have nonvoting observer status and cannot speak before the 
assembly without an invitation 
the united states japan and other nations back south koreas 
speech but the soviet bloc has opposed the move and sponsored a 
resolution monday inviting north korea to deliver an address 
china has not sponsored either resolution but opposes a south 
korean speech 
on monday president reagan is to deliver his final speech to 
the world body which his administration has criticized over the 
years for bureaucracy waste and an antiwestern bias 
the soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
president francois mitterrand of france also are to address the 
assembly the session will hear 13 heads of state six prime 
ministers and numerous foreign ministers 
the assembly will again take up intransigent issues such as 
peace in the middle east and the palestinian uprising in israels 
occupied lands 
in his annual report released monday perez de cuellar painted a 
cautiously optimistic picture of the organization citing 
the unmediated afghanstan accords signed april 14 under 
which about 100000 soviet troops are leaving that nation 
a unsupervised ceasefire in the iraniraq war that began 
aug 20 
the iraniraq peace talks that opened aug 25 
a unsponsored meeting between greek and turkish cypriot 
leaders of divided cyprus 
initiatives for peace in western sahara southwest africa and 
neighboring angola and positive signs for a political settlement to 
the guerrilla war in cambodia 
perez de cuellar noted continuing problems in the middle east 
central america south africas enforcement of apartheid and the 
division of the korean peninsula 
the secretarygeneral said the united nations still faces a 
financial crisis despite a us promise to pay 144 million in 
arrears and hundreds of millions of dollars in other back dues for 
previous years and for peacekeeping funds 
the peruvian diplomat said the organization faces a cash 
shortage which threatens insolvency in the next few months and 
the virtual depletion of reserves 
he said he would ask the general assembly urgently to consider 
new ways of raising money such as voluntary contributions 
interestfree loans and changes in the scale of assessments

strong winds late monday fanned an arson fire over a containment 
line and into the northern california town of vacaville forcing 
500 people to flee but cool damp weather helped firefighters 
battle blazes in the northwest 
the sheriffs department ordered the evacuation from home in 
rural vacaville but most complied voluntarily said california 
department of forestry spokesman john ferreira 
the fire which has destroyed nine homes and charred more than 
17000 acres of brush is the larger of two major northern 
california blazes the other destroyed six homes as it roared 
across about 8000 acres of wildland brush and timber near redding 
at the fire in redding near shasta county two men clearing 
burned timber were seriously injured monday when a tree fell on 
them forestry officials said both men suffering head and back 
injuries were hospitalized in critical condition officials said 
fifteen fires still burning monday had charred 139 million 
acres in wyoming montana washington oregon idaho and 
california said arnold hartigan of the interagency fire center in 
boise idaho in all this season 69099 fires have blackened 
4140000 acres including about 2 million acres in alaska he said 
the dwindling number of civilian and military firefighters in 
yellowstone national park worked monday to deepen fire lines around 
fires that have burned 11 million acres of the 22 millionacre 
park 
officials said they can now reduce the number of firefighters in 
the park which once totaled more than 8000 about 550 soldiers 
returned to fort lewis wash on sunday after four weeks and two 
battalions were preparing to leave 
in addition officials had started releasing employees of the 
national park service us forest service and bureau of land 
management said fire information officer marv crocker 
there are no real hot fires out there he said if there 
were wed keep the agency people for their experience theres 
nothing very exciting out there today 
the miller fire that destroyed nine homes near vacaville 55 
miles northeast of san francisco was 50 percent contained monday 
but estimates that the fire would be controlled by wednesday 
morning had to be abandoned when the fire jumped a road monday and 
forced the closure of another said alleah haley a state forestry 
spokeswoman 
control of the 8000acre fern fire that destroyed six homes 
near redding in northern california was predicted for tuesday 
evening said cdf spokeswoman sharon wages 
officials said about 5500 firefighters remained in and around 
yellowstone on monday including about 4000 army soldiers and 
marines crocker said 
until the fires are out there is still some potential 
threat said park spokeswoman joan anzelmo primarily the 
crews are doing mopup on existing fire lines working back into 
the fire and creating a bigger break 
fire experts were optimistic that recent frosty days in the park 
may have spelled the end of burning conditions such as those that 
allowed blazes to race across miles in hours 
i would be surprised if the fires made any more major runs 
said fire behavior analyst bruce freet i think were into a 
cooling moist trend i wont say wet but this might be enough to 
hold it where its at right now 
crews also were being reduced at fires remaining in oregon 
washington and montana and outdoor fire restrictions were lifted 
in montana and in part of idaho officials in montana said about 
940 firefighters remained at the 35400acre red bench fire in 
glacier park and in westcentral montana just three 20member crews 
monitor the smoldering 247000acre canyon creek fire 
its all due to the fact that weve gotten a lot of rain up 
here and looking at the forecast were going to get more said 
allen gibbs spokesman for the panhandle national forest in idaho

average sat scores were virtually unchanged for 
the fourth straight year but that wont stop educators and 
interest groups from quarreling about the significance of those 
numbers 
scores on the verbal section of the scholastic aptitude test 
fell two points to an average 428 while the national average on 
the math section was unchanged at 476 according to the college 
boards annual report released monday 
both portions of the multiplechoice exam taken each year by 11 
million collegebound students are scored on a scale of 200800 
with a combined 1600 being perfect 
the combined mathverbal average of 904 marked the first decline 
in eight years and followed three years of no change at 906 
minority students however continued a decadelong pattern of 
impressive gains 
national averages on the act the predominant college entrance 
exam in 28 states mostly in the west and midwest also were little 
changed the approximately 1 million students who took the act last 
school year averaged 188 on a scale of 136 up slightly from the 
187 average the year before according to the american college 
testing program the iowa city iowabased organization that 
administers the test 
the college board painted the stability of test scores as 
good news of a sort board president donald stewart said scores are 
holding up well despite a 13 percent increase in the number of 
testtakers in the last two years alone more testtakers usually 
bring down the averages 
but to a nation thats heard much talk for five years from 
politicians and educators about how reform would transform school 
life the latest sat news was bound to be disappointing 
in a statement monday education secretary william j bennett 
blamed the school establishment for the falloff in scores no 
medals for america in this news i said in april that the absolute 
level at which our improvements are taking place is unacceptably 
low today its a bit lower and still not acceptable cmon 
team back into training 
added scott thomson executive director of the national 
association of secondary school principals we are always 
disappointed when the scores dont improve each year because 
secondary schools are more rigorous than they were five years ago 
if the impact doesnt show in the next year or two then we 
really have to go back and seriously reexamine the problems 
thomson said 
the flat sat scores may in fact be evidence of what american 
federation of teachers leader albert shanker and others have said 
recently that reform has only nipped at the margins of classroom 
life in all but a few school districts for most children nothing 
much has changed 
theres no question that graduation requirements have changed 
students are taking more math and other academic subjects than five 
years ago said thomson but has reform changed the way 
teachers instruct in class has there been a profound change in 
student learning the answer is no 
apart from the national averages the college board released 
numbers showing how blacks and other minorities compared with 
whites males with females and states with each other enough 
statistical grist for a years worth of arguments among school 
critics and advocates 
black students in the class of 88 averaged 353 on the verbal 
portion up two points and math scores rose seven points to 384 
especially heartening since the number of black testtakers rose 39 
percent in three years from 70156 in 1985 to 97483 last year 
scores by blacks have risen 51 points since 1976 as the scores 
of all testtakers gained only one point 
but the gulf between blacks and whites remains 198 points and 
recent gains have not stilled standardized test critics who accuse 
the sat of cultural and racial bias 
nonetheless higher sats by minority students provide arguments 
for those in favor of continuing and expanding head start and other 
federal education programs started in the 1960s and 1970s that the 
college board and others now credit with helping boost scores in 
the 1980s 
a more subtle issue is the persistent gap between males and 
females males scored an average 498 math and 435 verbal females 
scored 455 math 422 verbal test critics including fairtest of 
cambridge mass have charged that the sat is biased against women 
in its wording and content college board officials deny that and 
offer figures showing that females take less demanding studies 
the board said that 59 percent of female testtakers took four 
years of math compared with 68 percent of males and while 43 
percent of males had four years of natural science study only 32 
percent of females did

george bush and michael dukakis will step 
forward to take questions in their first presidential debate 
sunday but it remains unclear who will be asking those questions 
dukakis the democratic hopeful proposed monday that the four 
commercial television network news anchormen be the moderator and 
panelists sources familiar with the negotiations said 
bush the gop candidate had his own list of four possible 
peacekeepers and 10 questioners from both electronic and print 
journalism 
by late monday the question of questioners was still being 
debated by bush and dukakis aides as the sunday date for the 
faceoff at wake forest university in north carolina drew closer 
the lastminute sparring is typical of presidential campaigns 
complete with accusations that the other side is breaking their 
agreement not to talk about any of the arrangements 
the first debate is sponsored by the parties commission on 
debates the second presidential debate due oct 13 or oct 15 in 
los angeles is sponsored by the league of women voters 
this most recent volley between the campaigns erupted monday 
when dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas called bush campaign 
chairman james baker to propose the fouranchor idea for all three 
debates 
sources who spoke only on the condition they not be identified 
said brountas suggested that the anchors from cbs news abc news 
nbc news and the cable news network be the moderators and 
questioners during both presidential debates and the vice president 
debate scheduled oct 5 in omaha 
that would mean cbss dan rather nbcs tom brokaw abcs peter 
jennings and probably cnns bernard shaw would be on stage for all 
three events and contacts were made with the news organizations to 
see if they would agree one source said 
this is a television event said one dukakis aide of the 
idea we want to do what we can to make it an event that people 
will pay attention to we think that they anchors would make it a 
bigger event more people would watch it 
bush aides flatly rejected the dukakis idea of all the 
presidential debates as well as the vice presidential one 
the idea is blatantly unfair to the print media and other 
television correspondents said one bush aide 
but a dukakis aide said that their proposal was still on the 
table despite the bush campaigns stance 
the bush source said the campaign responded later monday with a 
list of four proposed moderators and 10 panelists the source would 
not name any of them saying only the list was made up of network 
anchors network correspondents and print representatives 
the bush source also accused the dukakis campaign of violating 
the agreement not to talk about such matters 
we are operating under a written agreement of understanding 
not to discuss the negotiations surrounding debate details said 
the aide obviously that has been violated and thus the source 
gave the bush campaign position on the matters 
while predebate squabbling is normal the difference this year 
is there is no third party such as the league of women voters 
as the moderator of the predebate debate 
the two political parties tried to wrest the debate sponsorship 
away from the league with the formation of the bipartisan debate 
commission but the league which has sponsored debates in the 
past three presidential campaigns kept fighting for a role 
when the two campaigns agreed to split sponsorship of the 
debates that left them to deal more directly with each other on 
these predebate matters than in the past

scores of people returned to salvage 
possessions from the santa catarina riverbed where a flash flood 
spawned by hurricane gilbert devastated their homes but most came 
up empty 
people lined the banks monday digging with their hands in the 
muck what was for decades a dry riverbed with thousands of homes 
had become a mangled landscape of twisted metal and crumbled 
concrete 
maria costa her husband and their six children had lived on 
the riverbed in a tworoom home made of concrete blocks and tin 
their clothing furniture and new school books were washed away 
we went yesterday to see it but there wasnt a thing to 
save ms costa said as she washed her 10monthold sons diapers 
in a bucket of water even the blocks were gone now where do we 
go she asked 
more than 100 people were killed in the sudden stormwhipped 
rebirth saturday of the santa catarina which became a savage 
torrent 10 feet deep and 450 feet wide as hurricane gilbert dumped 
12 inches of rain on the city 
we just got three blankets out and lost everything else 
said ramona carrizales lopez sitting outside a shelter for the 
homeless 
mrs lopez was among thousands of people who had built meager 
homes in the riverbed that cuts through this industrial city in 
northern mexicos most populated region 
the riverbed suddenly swelled with water sweeping away entire 
ramshackle communities miles of roads and a sprawling sports 
complex with miles of tennis and basketball courts soccer and 
baseball fields and jogging tracks 
four buses and other vehicles were dragged into the torrent the 
bus passengers are presumed to comprise most of the 100 people 
confirmed dead 
the nuevo leon state government said a considerable number 
of people were missing and 30000 people were lodged in shelters 
around the state 
alejandro chapa mayor of san pedrogarza garcia the suburb of 
monterrey hit hardest by the disaster said monday that his first 
priority is to find better lodgings for the 7000 homeless people 
in his community 
he said those people with homes on the riverbed that escaped 
ruin would be allowed to return there only provisionally 
were asking for a place to put them chapa said houses 
can be built pretty fast but not in a month

the armys decision to scrap 
plans for a highlevel biological warfare test lab in utah has 
drawn praise from state officials but an environmentalist says 
residents still cant rest easy 
the army announced monday it will no longer seek approval for 
the lab designed for experiments with genetically altered microbes 
or deadly microorganisms for which there are no known antidotes 
instead army officials said they will downgrade the proposed 
biosafety level 4 laboratory at dugway proving ground to a new 
53 million level3 lab where scientists can experiment with 
biological agents for which there are vaccines or cures 
the people of utah are still at more risk said jeremy 
rifkin of the foundation on economic trends in washington dc 
its easier for viruses to get out of this facility than the one 
they proposed the chance of a microorganism escaping is low but 
if one does escape it could be catastrophic 
rifkin said his organization which brought legal action forcing 
the army to conduct a more extensive environmental assessment of 
the proposed lab would seek another injunction if the army went 
ahead with its plans without a new environmental impact study 
michael owen the armys deputy assistant secretary for 
installations and logistics said the level3 lab would be used for 
tests of materials and defenses against biological attack similar 
to those conducted at dugway since the early 1950s in a lab that 
now is outdated 
the armys decision is based on an extensive evaluation of the 
requirements for biological defense owen said existing army 
bl4 facilities will be used to satisfy any future needs for 
material testing that requires a containment level higher than 
bl3 
the armys original draft environmental statement published in 
february said the higherlevel lab would be used only for level3 
experiments but it did not rule out experiments with more exotic 
and deadly agents in the future 
owen said the final environmental impact statement due next 
spring would identify the level3 lab as the preferred 
alternative for construction the draft document had listed it 
only as a possible alternative concluding a level4 lab would be 
safer 
utahs congressional delegation and republican gov norm 
bangerter praised the armys decision in march bangerter had 
vowed to block construction of a higherlevel lab including 
withholding state construction permits and later met with army 
officials to seek a compromise 
i appreciate the armys newfound willingness to compromise 
with the people of utah and negotiate with me as governor on 
matters which affect the state and its citizens bangerter said 
the governor said he would announce within days the composition 
of a civilianscientist oversight committee to monitor testing at 
the desert outpost 70 miles southwest of salt lake city 
i will insist the open process continue and the army shares 
with the people in the state information regarding what testing is 
being performed in utah bangerter said 
during a public comment period that ended aug 2 the army 
received 107 comments 103 of which opposed building the facility 
owen said the outcry over the armys initial plan was not the 
sole determining factor in the decision but he added we try 
to be good neighbors 
there was never a decision to back down or away from as 
such he said we did not have a decision prior to now 
owen said there are five higherlevel containment labs in the 
united states where the army could conduct such tests if needed 
including its own lab at fort detrick md 
on monday night 100 people attended an army hearing at tooele 
army depot on the draft environmental impact statement governing 
the pentagons biological defense research program the document 
concluded that the program does not create significant adverse 
impacts on the quality of the environment and perceived risks are 
very much exaggerated 
it also rejected the idea of a nonmilitary management of the 
testing program saying it would not mute controversies relating to 
such issues as genetic engineering highly infectious organisms or 
aerosol testing 
the united states abandoned research into offensive biological 
weapons in 1969 and later signed a treaty banning their use or 
possession the army continues to conduct research into defensive 
measures against biological warfare such as masks and vaccines

crews repairing a dam accidentally killed 
thousands of fish by reducing the flow into the oswego river and 
anglers here for the fishing season are being assaulted by the 
stench of rotting salmon and trout 
i didnt know what to think everywhere you walked there was 
dead fish said edward hill of trevose pa one of the thousands 
of fishermen who come to this lake ontario city each fall 
the fish were killed wednesday when a niagara mohawk power corp 
crew decided to do some work on a dam and reduced the flow of 
water in the river officials said that left thousands of big 
fish about 3 feet long and 2030 pounds stranded in shallow pools 
or flopping on rocks 
they the utility could not have picked a worse time to do 
this cliff creech regional fisheries manager for the state 
department of environmental conservation said monday i would 
say a substantial portion of the fall salmon run has been wiped 
out 
each fall from labor day to midoctober chinook and coho 
salmon and rainbow and brown trout swim out of lake ontario and up 
the oswego river to spawn unless theyre caught they die shortly 
after laying their eggs in the river 
creech said he believes the fish kill will be a major blow for 
the area which takes in an estimated 150 million from fishing 
each year 
for the first weekend alone from sept 1011 2500 anglers 
showed up

bowed to rebel demands to hold previous talks in nicaragua he 
accused the rebels of deliberately trying to make negotiations 
impossible in a bid to receive renewed us military aid 
the yankees are interested through the contras in trying to 
show nicaragua has an intransigent position to approve military

the international brotherhood of teamsters is 
giving its members more time to vote on their presidential 
preference putting off the unions possible endorsement of a 
candidate until midoctober 
my guess is that were not going to do any endorsement until 
our next board meeting oct 17 teamsters spokesman duke zeller 
said monday 
zeller said the 16 millionmember union has extended until 
sept 30 the deadline for the rank and file to return poll ballots 
on presidential preferences that were mailed to them three weeks 
ago 
zeller said 10000 to 12000 of the ballots have been returned 
to teamsters headquarters here but have not been tallied 
with the extended deadline he said the responses cannot be 
tabulated and analyzed before the next meeting of the unions 
18member executive board oct 1719 in orlando fla 
the teamsters were among three of the aflcios 91 affiliated 
unions that abstained last month from the labor federations 
overwhelming endorsement of democratic nominee michael dukakis 
until the death of former teamster president jackie presser in 
june union officials had expected the executive board to endorse 
dukakis 
several union officials have said the justice departments 
indictment of presser in 1986 and a civil suit in june aimed at 
taking control of the teamsters as a corrupt organization have 
soured relations with president reagan and vice president george 
bush 
the new teamster president william mccarthy of boston is known 
to dislike dukakis 
one teamster official speaking only on condition that he not be 
identified said he does not expect the executive board to make any 
endorsement this year unless the rankandfile poll shows 
overwhelming support for dukakis 
the teamsters were the only major union to endorse reagan in 
1980 and 1984 although with less enthusiasm the second time it 
made no endorsement in the 1976 race which jimmy carter won against 
president ford 
since 1952 the teamsters have endorsed four democrats and four 
republicans

a drug smuggler and a former mexican police 
official were pawns in a vendetta brought about by two countries 
that desperately wanted to avenge the death of a us drug agent 
defense attorneys say 
demand justice not politics attorney michael pancer urged 
jurors monday insisting that rene verdugo urquidez 36 had 
nothing to do with the 1985 tortureslaying of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena 
rene verdugo was offered up to you on a silver platter by the 
police in mexico pancer told the jury are you going to take 
the scapegoat they offer you 
us district judge edward rafeedie scheduled the prosecutors 
rebuttal argument today saying he would submit the case to the 
jury later in the day 
yolanda barrera chief deputy federal public defender said 
another defendant raul lopez alvarez 28 a former guadalajara 
homicide investigator is a victim of the governments desire to 
avenge the camarena killing at any cost 
she contended that the defendants videotaped discussion of the 
camarena slaying with an undercover agent was typical of his 
penchant for inventing stories to inflate his own importance 
mr lopez alvarez ended up in this trial for acting like a 
child she said he is a man caught up in the web of his own 
lies he told one lie too many 
admitting that verdugo was a marijuana smuggler pancer accused 
mexican officials of conspiring to blame verdugo for camarenas 
killing he said the us government went along with the idea 
ladies and gentlemen tell the government of mexico by your 
verdict that you will not accept a scapegoat said pancer tell 
them that you want the people who were really involved and who are 
being protected down there 
he accused us prosecutors of engaging in illusion deception 
and lies to convince jurors that verdugo participated in 
camarenas torture and murder 
the government has tried to appeal to your emotions he 
said to make you feel guilty about rendering the correct 
verdict dont let them do that 
camarena was abducted in guadalajara on feb 7 1985 his body 
and that of his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were found buried at 
a remote ranch in mexico several weeks later they were severely 
beaten and camarenas skull was crushed 
prosecutors sought to show that verdugo was a leader of a drug 
cartel run by rafael caro quintero and that he helped kill 
camarena authorities have depicted caro as the mastermind of the 
camarena killing 
the third defendant jesus felix gutierrez 38 is accused of 
helping caro escape from mexico after the killings 
key evidence against verdugo is a strand of his hair found at 
the guadalajara home where camarena is believed to have died and 
the testimony of a witness who saw verdugo at the house near the 
time of camarenas death 
nine men were indicted in los angeles in connection with the 
slaying but only three are on trial here caro 33 and three 
other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related 
charges in mexico an eighth man has died and another is a fugitive

a former chief astronaut says the emphasis on the 
space shuttle is to blame for a slowdown in americas space program 
astronaut john w young who flew on the first manned gemini 
mission in 1965 and later walked on the moon expressed 
disappointment with the space programs progress in a recent 
interview 
it is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon 
said young 57 and if you had asked me after the moon landing 
what wed be doing in 20 years id have said wed have a base on 
the moon in 20 years 
young now a safety and engineering troubleshooter for johnson 
space centers director commanded the first and ninth shuttle 
flights while serving as chief astronaut for the national 
aeronautics and space admininstration 
he said the shuttles on which nasa staked its future in the 
early 1970s have never been the inexpensive quickly refurbished 
workhorses that their supporters promised 
i never believed it could be that way young said i 
wasnt involved in selling it but i was involved in the technical 
details of helping design and build it and it was too 
complicated 
young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators 
expectations but tight budgets hurt it when nasa could not afford 
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs and he said the 
spacecrafts design can slow repairs because some areas are hard to 
reach 
he said that quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine 
florida landings never panned out nor is the shuttle an 
inexpensive way to fly 
the basic assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse each 15 
million solidfuel rocket booster may be wrong young said 
he also said the delays are affecting the supply of flightready 
astronauts fourteen astronauts who flew before the jan 28 1986 
challenger explosion decided not to wait for flights to resume the 
space center has 93 astronauts and is accepting applications 
through july 1 for a 1990 astronaut class 
i expect theres a lot of astronauts leaving because they see 
the line at the end of the tunnel young said the line theyve 
got to stand in to get a flight is so long

a lawyer for eastman kodak co customers who 
bought the companys discontinued instant cameras says only about 
200 people have balked at a plan to give them 50 to 70 in cash 
and coupons 
attorney perry m berke told cook county circuit judge thomas 
rakowski on monday that about 34 million people have been approved 
for compensation 
it demonstrates you have an overwhelming approval of the 
settlement berke said 
rakowski who presided over a hearing in the case said he would 
rule sept 26 on whether the proposed 195 million plan should be 
accepted to settle a classaction lawsuit filed by customers 
the cameras were rendered virtually useless in 1985 when a 
federal court said the company had violated several polaroid co 
patents on instant film and cameras that court ordered kodak to 
stop producing film for its line of instant cameras 
under the proposal those who bought the cameras would receive 
1950 to 52 in cash with the balance made up in coupons for the 
purchase of other kodak products said william harte one of the 
lawyers for the plaintiffs in the classaction lawsuit the amount 
would depend upon the model of camera the person owned he said 
it is clearly a generous settlement it is clearly a fair 
settlement said william campbell a lawyer representing the 
rochester nybased kodak 
critics of the plan say an insufficient amount of money is 
involved no provision exists to compensate for accessories like 
camera bags and some steps toward getting a rebate were difficult 
the proposed settlement is limited to us owners kodak made 16 
million of the instant cameras for domestic sale from 1976 to 1985 
harte said 43 million camera owners were notified of the 
settlement proposal by direct mail and 34 million have valid 
claims about 100000 more filed claims that are being reviewed by 
a courtappointed arbitrator he said 
the deadline for filing claims was sept 9 and those who have 
not filed will not be able to get refunds he added 
instant photography was invented by edwin h land founder of 
polaroid and was first marketed in 1948 it enables users to view 
a photographic print within moments of taking a picture 
polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field 
until 1976 when kodak entered the market with a competing system 
a week later polaroid sued kodak charging patent infringement 
a federal judge in boston sided with polaroid the us supreme 
court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear kodaks 
appeal in october 1986 polaroid is seeking 57 billion in damages 
from kodak

a fugitive wanted for taking hostages at a 
newspaper is back in federal authorities hands after disappearing 
three weeks ago 
eddie hatcher 30 accused of holding up to 20 hostages at the 
robesonian in lumberton on feb 1 was arrested monday as he and an 
attorney arrived on a piedmont airlines flight from newark nj 
just minutes before hatchers scheduled arraignment 
hatcher an american indian and a second man charged in the 
incident said they were protesting alleged corruption and 
discrimination against minorities by robeson county law enforcement 
officials 
the attorney ronald kuby of new york declined to discuss his 
clients whereabouts 
when hatcher was asked where he had been since his disappearance 
aug 31 he responded over the rainbow 
us marshal bill berryhill said authorities did not know where 
hatcher had been its rather academic at this point but yet 
from an investigators standpoint tying up our investigation we 
need to try to find out where hes been berryhill said 
hatcher decided to surrender after the arraignment date was 
announced last week kuby said 
airport security officers grabbed hatcher and frisked him in a 
covered passageway just outside the airplane door a security 
officer guarded the door into the terminal while officers cuffed 
hatchers hands behind his back and led him to a car waiting on the 
tarmac 
while hatcher was being taken into custody at the airport his 
case was called in a federal courtroom in downtown raleigh 
we notified them this morning to watch all flights coming into 
raleighdurham because we felt like with his arraignment today he 
might come in berryhill said 
he added that marshals had no tips that hatcher would return to 
raleigh on monday 
hatchers sister ginger clark watched through an airport 
window as officials led her brother to the waiting car 
she sobbed pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get 
her brothers attention as reporters and photographers stood around 
her hatcher looked up and smiled at her 
aaron clark who had rented a limousine to take his brother to 
the arraignment grimaced when he saw his brother in custody 
hatcher who was born john edward clark adopted his 
grandfathers family name after the elder man died in 1985 
us district judge terrence boyle entered a plea of innocent on 
hatchers behalf and set his trial to begin sept 26 the same day 
that hatchers codefendant timothy jacobs is scheduled to stand 
trial 
hatcher disappeared after the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
revoked his bond he was declared a fugitive after failing to 
surrender to us marshals in raleigh

three soviet mig17 fighter jets roared 
over new mexico tracked by the whirling arms of chinesebuilt 
earlywarning radar hidden in a canyon 
it was only a test 
we want to understand what the guy were up against can do 
what his equipment can do dave tracy director of the defense 
departments defense test and evaluation support agency said 
monday 
the agency is testing soviet chinese and warsaw pact military 
hardware at kirtland air force base just outside albuquerque this 
month to see how well it works how long it takes to do its job and 
what problems turn up said defense department official james 
wilson 
in mondays test the mig17s flew south from kirtland into the 
pinonstudded manzano mountains where the radar waited down from 
the radar site were antenna fields trailers with technicians 
peering into scopes and simulated artillery sites 
us a7 attack jets from the new mexico air national guard took 
to the air to determine how quickly they could be picked up on the 
chinese radar and how swiftly an alert could be relayed to an 
antiaircraft missile site wilson said 
the agency plans to use its foreign equipment to find out how 
well us hardware performs for example officials said tests 
might find out how easy it is to detect a new us jet on soviet 
radar 
the agency has spent the past year gathering warsaw pact 
equipment ranging from radios to radar and from tracked vehicles to 
fighter aircraft tracy and wilson declined to say how the united 
states acquired the hardware 
much of the equipment was displayed monday at a kirtland hangar 
outside were migs and a troop transport plane inside were tables 
covered with radios and the components needed to keep them working 
as well as operating manuals written in russian 
while the mig17 and mig21 fighters are older versions of what 
soviet pilots now fly they remain in the air as part of the forces 
of such countries as cuba syria iraq afghanistan vietnam east 
germany egypt and india tracy said 
just because it looks little and small doesnt mean it cant 
hurt you he said 
the soviet and chinese radios on display used by warsaw pact 
countries dont have the modern microchips found in us 
equipment but instead use vacuum tubes technology developed in 
the 1940s and 1950s 
but what the equipment lacks in techological sophistication it 
makes up for in simplicity tracy said such radios are easy to 
maintain easy to use and very tough 
vacuum tubes are also less susceptible to the electromagnetic 
pulses that would follow a nuclear detonationo and disrupt 
communications and power tracy said 
they are prepared to operate in a nuclear environment more 
than we thought he said

bruce springsteen teamed up with other major 
rockers in the first us concert of a worldwide tour aimed at 
inspiring people to join amnesty internationals fight for human 
rights 
you have the opportunity to use your freedom to help free 
others said springsteen the closing act at mondays soldout 
performance at john f kennedy stadium 
more than 75000 people attended the 7hour show concert 
officials said no major problems were reported 
joining springsteen were sting peter gabriel tracy chapman 
senegalese singer yousoou ndour folk singer joan baez and 
saxophonist branford marsalis 
it wasnt the first time rock stars banded together for a good 
cause at the stadium in 1985 the arena was the site of the us 
half of the live aid concert to fight hunger 
mondays concert opened with the entire group singing the reggae 
anthem get up stand up baez followed with the the spiritual 
oh freedom 
the crowd listened to ndours brand of african rhythms and 
chapmans songs of protest and lament but it wasnt until sting 
performed more familiar songs of his own and his former band the 
police that the crowd began to respond 
gabriel the driving force behind the tour reminded the crowd 
about the more serious aspects of the tour throwing his fist into 
the air he sang biko in memory of steven biko the black 
south african political activist who died while imprisoned in the 
apartheid state 
springsteen a new jersey native was clearly the favorite as 
calls for bruce drowned out the audio from an animated video 
illustrating the tenets of the universal declaration of human 
rights 
londonbased amnesty international which monitors human rights 
abuses and political prisoners distributed literature and asked 
for signatures on petitions supporting the declaration the 
organization with a worldwide membership of 750000 won the 1977 
nobel peace prize 
amnesty international executive director jack healey said the 
group has collected about 500000 signatures so far and half of 
those attending the philadelphia concert signed the amnesty 
petition 
sign it use it believe in it he encouraged the crowd 
lisa frohne a 28yearold homemaker from brewster ny said 
the concert had galvanized her to start writing letters for amnesty 
international 
it enlightens you to whats going on daytoday life makes 
you forget she said a concert like this brings that out it 
slaps you in the face 
but jay schwartz a 46yearold sales representative from 
sicklerville nj was skeptical about the concerts message 
reaching many people 
its good music most of them are political songs but i dont 
think its registering in peoples heads he said 
the budget for the tour which began in london sept 2 is 
estimated at 23 million although performers are donating their 
time organizers said they expect expenses to outstrip ticket 
sales the tour is partially underwritten with a 10 million 
commitment from footwear manufacturer reebok international 
the tour is due in los angeles sept 21 and san francisco sept 
23 tour officials said they expect to play to more than a million 
people in 14 countries and are negotiating to perform in the soviet 
union

a recruit who drowned during 
rescueswimmer training had been declared unfit for the course 
because of his intense fear of being dragged under water a navy 
doctor testified at a sailors courtmartial 
after lt cmdr david shiveleys testimony the defense rested 
its case monday in the trial of petty officer 2nd class michael 
combe 28 of tempe ariz 
the defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter battery 
and conspiracy in the march 2 death of airman recruit lee mirecki 
in a training pool at pensacola naval air station 
the trial reopens thursday with closing arguments 
the military judge cmdr newell d krogmann was to meet today 
with lawyers to prepare instructions for the panel of five officers 
hearing the case one panel member asked for an additional days 
delay because wednesday is yom kippur a jewish holiday said lt 
cmdr dennis hessler a navy spokesman 
shiveley conceded monday the system probably broke down by 
allowing the 19yearold recruit from appleton wis to return to 
the navy rescue swimmer school after shiveley disqualified him from 
further training 
he related a pretty intense fear to me said shiveley who 
saw mirecki a month before his death i diagnosed him as possibly 
having a phobia 
a psychologist disagreed with shiveleys diagnosis and found 
mirecki fit for training but neither doctor consulted the other 
shiveley said mirecki should have been sent back to him before 
being readmitted 
shiveley said while a noncommissioned officer such as combe 
cannot be expected to detect a phobia he should have recognized 
mireckis panic 
witnesses have testified mirecki panicked and climbed out of the 
pool grabbing an equipment rack as instructors converged on him 
mirecki was pulled free and thrown into the pool where combe dunked 
him and grabbed him in a head hold witnesses say 
a pathologist has testified mireckis phobia triggered heart 
failure then drowning 
two fellow instructors who testified under immunity backed up 
testimony by combe who denied he helped push mirecki back into the 
pool and claimed the recruit completed a lifesaving maneuver in 
which he freed himself from a head hold just seconds before 
collapsing

an overloaded ferry sank in a south china river 
killing 61 people and leaving one missing the official xinhua news 
agency reported today 
the sinking sunday was the eighth major boat accident since july 
and brought the total of people killed to more than 320 according 
to official figures investigators have attributed most of the 
accidents to human error 
xinhua said more than 80 passengers were on the ferry when it 
sank in a river in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region that 
borders vietnam it said the boat was overloaded but did not give 
its capacity or say if the overloading caused it to sink 
the ministry of communications which has responsiblity for 
inland water navigation announced last month it had begun an 
investigation into the safety of chinas river vessels to determine 
if standards should be tightened 
that move followed the july 21 capsizing of a ferry on the min 
river in southwestern sichuan province in which 133 people died 
and the july 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the yangtze river in 
which 71 drowned

a congressional authority on the constitution 
predicted today that a controversial antidrug bill will pass the 
house this week by a wide margin despite measures he called 
stupid and outrageous attacks on the bill of rights 
i think the bill will pass overwhelmingly because theres some 
kind of hysteria on capitol hill said rep don edwards 
dcalif chairman of the house justice subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights 
he said in an interview on cbstvs this morning program 
that four tough amendments added on bipartisan votes last week are 
pretty awful but he said congressmen will vote for the bill 
no matter what the provisions are if one can appear to be tough 
on drugs itll pass big 
asked whether the house was effectively waging a war on the 
bill of rights edwards said yes thats what is happening 
rep henry hyde rill in the same interview termed edwards 
objections nonsense 
i think the provisions are constitutional and i think they 
have the support of the majority of the members hyde said 
the house is expected to vote on the final bill thursday 
approval would mean the differences with a senate version would 
have to be worked out by a conference committee of the two chambers 
the amendments that have drawn scorn from civil libertarians 
would establish 
a federal death penalty for those convicted of murder in a 
drugrelated crime 
denial of federal welfare and other benefits to repeat drug 
offenders 
an exception to the socalled exclusionary rule that would 
allow into court evidence seized without a search warrant 
a civil fine of up to 10000 for individuals accused of 
possessing even small amounts of drugs whether or not there is a 
conviction 
edwards said the fine would be an outrage never before in 
american history have we had civil penalties in criminal matters 
and he said supporters of tough measures against drug 
trafficking were defeating their own efforts with the death penalty 
provision 
the stupid part about this amendment is that hereafter if the 
bill passes we wont be able to extradict drug offenders from 
overseas because countries that dont have the death penalty and 
most dont just wont send them back to the united states to be 
executed said edwards

millions of people in the capital have 
been exposed to serious health hazards by drinking contaminated 
water and the number of cases of diarrhea has soared in the past 
24 hours officials said today 
in most cases the water flowing out of the pipes is unfit for 
drinking an official at the environmental pollution control 
board said he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the floods that inundated threefourths of bangladesh three 
weeks ago have claimed at least 2000 lives according to dhaka 
newspapers they said onefourth of the deaths were caused by 
diarrhea while the others were from drowning snake bites and 
houses collapsing the government whose count is generally 
considered low puts the total number of deaths at about 1000 
the newspapers say at least one million of bangladeshs 110 
million people have been stricken by diarrhea in the past four 
weeks 
the government reported 618656 diarrhea cases including 47361 
in the past 24 hours it said 268 people have died of diarrhea 
the pollution control official said tests sunday showed the 
count of coliform bacteria linked to intestinal diseases in tap 
water was as high as 4000 per hundred milliliters in some areas of 
dhaka he said the permissible limit was 4 per hundred milliliters 
water samples collected at government relief camps showed a 
coliform bacteria count of up to 1600 per hundred milliliters he 
added 
excessive quantities of coliform bacteria in drinking water can 
cause diarrhea dysentery typhoid jaundice and pneumonia 
floodwaters that covered about threefourths of dhaka a city of 
6 million leaked into municipal water pipes the official said 
many pipes had leaks that could not be repaired because they were 
under water 
as the floodwaters recede the municipal corporation has been 
closing the 465 refugee centers set up in schools and colleges so 
classes can resume some of the refugees said they had nowhere to 
go 
rahimullah a 45yearold day laborer went from door to door 
today with his three children after trying for the last three 
days to get a job i am now begging for food for my family he 
said 
ismail hossain 45 said he had come to dhaka after his house in 
khadun 10 miles south of the capital was flooded 
i have no money to rebuild the house and start life afresh 
he said nobody in the village is willing to extend a loan to 
me 
a relief ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said millions affected by the floods were faced with the same 
problems 
the government estimates that 40 million people more than 
onefourth of the countrys population were directly affected by 
the flood it defines those directly affected as having lost 
relatives homes crops or other property 
although bangladesh a lowlying country shredded by mighty 
rivers and cobweblike networks of tributaries is regularly hit by 
floods this summers deluge is the worst in memory 
even before the present flood bangladesh was one of the worlds 
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of 150 and one of 
its biggest foreign aid recipients receiving more than 2 billion 
this year

george bush was in an effective tie with democrat michael 
dukakis in new york the cornerstone of the industrial northeast 
while the republican presidential nominee held substantial 
advantages in polls conducted in mississippi and nebraska 
a poll released monday by the marist college institute for 
public opinion showed dukakis the democratic candidate leading 
bush by 4842 percent among likely voters 
but the margin of error of four percentage points either way 
erased dukakis seeming advantage ten percent of those polled said 
they were undecided 
the statistical dead heat came even though 65 percent of 
potential new york voters said bush has the experience to be 
president and only 23 percent named the democrat 
at the same time 52 percent said the vice president has the 
ability to handle an international crisis while 28 percent said 
that of dukakis nonetheless when it comes to who can provide 
strong leadership dukakis was on top 43 percent to 36 percent 
among new yorkers questioned 
the results were similar to a marist poll in march that gave 
dukakis a 4741 percentage advantage 
a separate poll indicated that dukakis lost rather than gained 
voter support when he posed last week wearing a helmet and riding 
an m1 battle tank at a defense contractors plant in michigan 
in a telephone survey of 1002 registered voters around the 
country last friday through sunday conducted for the boston herald 
and station wbztv in boston 25 percent said they were less likely 
to vote for dukakis based on what they had seen or heard about the 
tank ride 
seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for 
dukakis according to the poll and more than 60 percent said they 
either knew nothing about it or it had no impact on how they would 
vote the poll had a margin of error of 3 percent 
with 36 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the 
presidency new york carries more weight than any other single 
state in the traditionallydemocratic northeast 
new york has been considered a dukakis stronghold in part 
because democrats have a 32 enrollment edge over republicans and 
also because dukakis is from a neighboring state 
but the state was captured by republican ronald reagan in 1980 
and again in 1984 in 1984 cuomo headed up democratic candidate 
walter mondales new york effort and was unable to deliver the 
state for the former vice president 
polls released monday in mississippi and nebraska which 
respectively have seven and five electoral votes indicated bush is 
holding his comfortable leads in those states 
nebraskans favored bush by 4433 percent according to an omaha 
worldherald poll published monday the margin of error in the 
survey of 755 registered voters conducted sept 1415 by sri 
research inc was plus or minus four percentage points 
in mississippi a telephone survey over last weekend by rick 
knox and associates showed bush the preferred choice of 49 percent 
of those polled while dukakis the pick of only 34 percent the poll 
of 1000 registered voters showed just about the same margin as a 
survey conducted a month ago 
it had a margin of error of five percentage points in either 
direction however 
the marist poll conducted last week surveyed 601 new york voters 
said to be likely to cast ballots in the nov 8 election

the case

of councillors was expected to adopt a similar resolution

purchasing much of the grain directly from farmers at fixed prices 
and selling it to retailers at lower prices but japanese consumers 
still pay seven to eight times more for rice than do americans

city officials exasperated by almost daily 
antiabortion demonstrations this summer have passed a bill to 
fine protest leaders who trespass or harass patients at abortion 
clinics 
the city council voted 125 monday for a measure which asks the 
city attorneys office to seek court injunctions against leaders of 
operation rescue the group that organized the protests 
the measure does not interfere with the right to picket and to 
free speech council members said 
barbara magera a staff member of operation rescue in atlanta 
said the decision would not deter the group which has taken 
september off from the protests but vows to return in october 
she said similar actions were taken in new york and in 
philadelphia but protests continued 
the protests that began during the democratic national 
convention in july clogged the citys legal system putting more 
than 700 people in jail and costing atlanta more than 500000 
said barbara asher chairwoman of the citys public safety 
commission and sponsor of mondays resolution 
they are trying to grind the machinery of this city to a 
halt mrs asher said 
councilman hosea williams said he planned to challenge the 
constitutionality of the decision in court the civil rights leader 
compared it to laws passed in the past to deny rights to blacks 
this is a very dangerous bill williams said its going 
to put atlanta in such a bad light 
however councilman jabari simama said the bill will not deny 
this groups rights to exercise its first amendment rights

israels leaders said their launching of a test 
satellite reportedly packed with usmade surveillance equipment 
would not spur the arms race in the middle east 
arab officials and newspapers called mondays launch a spy 
satellite and said the craft would be used for military purposes 
and would threaten the entire arab world 
the launching of a threestage rocket carrying the gray 
horizon1 satellite made israel only the eighth nation to place a 
satellite in space 
there are few countries in the world capable of doing this and 
the citizens of israel can be proud of their country prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said on israel radio 
in washington arab league representative clovis maksoud voiced 
concern over the launch saying the satellite gave israel a 
serious strategic leverage since the country already had the 
capability to fire longrange missiles 
the libyan news agency jana monitored in london described the 
craft as a spy satellite and part of a psychological war being 
carried out by the zionists against the arab nation 
tishrin a syrian government newspaper whose editorials 
generally reflect official stands also called the craft a spy 
satellite and predicted it would be used for military purposes 
the us commitment to expand israels military power is a 
permanent source of danger and tension in the middle east 
tishrin added 
syria is israels main enemy in the middle east 
in egypt and saudi arabia radio stations reported the launching 
with no comment the soviet media ignored the story and israel 
radio quoted a jordanian official as saying the satellite 
apparently had military uses 
both shamir and foreign minister shimon peres dismissed fears 
that the satellite would spur an arms race with arab countries 
the arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do 
anything they can anyway peres said on the radio 
yuval neeman head of israels space agency said the satellite 
would remain in orbit for about a month before disintegrating 
development of the horizon1 was the result of more than 20 
years of israeli space research and was part of the countrys 
effort to become independent in the defense field 
until now israel has relied on the united states to provide 
satellite pictures but some officials have complained the us was 
stingy in supplying intelligence information 
in march 1987 former us navy analyst jonathan jay pollard was 
sentenced to life in prison for selling israel hundreds of us 
military documents 
israeli media have quoted us and israeli sources as saying the 
documents pollard delivered included satellite pictures of iraqi 
and syrian weapons and storage facilities 
if you are fed from the crumbs of others according to their 
whims this is very inconvenient and very difficult said meir 
amit a former head of israels mossad secret service and now chief 
of the general satellite corp a communications satellites 
producer 
a possible source of concern to israel is the news that saudi 
arabia is deploying chinesebuilt css2 missiles about 285 miles 
south of riyad 
satellite photographs displayed by space media network a 
private swedish firm showed the saudis were expanding an airstrip 
and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons 
the israeli satellite weighs about 340 pounds and is believed to 
be carrying a 66pound payload for surveillance usage apparently 
for monitoring activity in arab countries according to a spokesman 
for janes defense weekly the londonbased defense magazine 
tony banks a janes reporter with close ties to israeli 
military sources said israel was not believed to have the 
capability of installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a 
satellite 
us optical equipment is assumed to have been used in the 
payload banks told the associated press in london 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the united 
states was not involved with the israeli program 
pentagon officials said they were unsure exactly what was in the 
satellites payload one source said on condition of anonymity that 
were leaning toward more of an experimental communications 
package as opposed to a true spy satellite 
foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craft 
that would precede the launching of a spy satellite neeman said a 
second satellite was already under development and would be used to 
carry out scientific tests

edward smith could spend at least five years 
in jail separated from the family he tried to protect for fatally 
shooting a youth who was among neighborhood troublemakers pelting 
his house with snowballs 
youths had harassed the family repeatedly for six years they 
had broken into a basement radio repair shop and scrawled graffiti 
on the walls 
smith finally cracked when a snowball smashed a window and cut 
one of his daughters on jan 30 1987 
later that night more snowballs hit the house and smith went 
out on his porch with a 357caliber magnum revolver he fired two 
shots toward a group of boys he intended them as warnings he told 
police 
but one shot hit peter mcgettigan in the spine and exited 
through his chest the 16yearold high school sophomore died 
leaving his parents six siblings smiths family and their 
neighborhood in agony 
smith 49 was convicted monday of thirddegree murder and 
sentenced to five to 10 years in prison 
common pleas judge eugene h clarke jr also found smith guilty 
of weapons possession and reckless endangerment in the nonjury 
trial 
smith received the mandatory minimum term for thirddegree 
murder while using a gun he could receive up to seven more years 
when sentenced on the other charges nov 29 
but one positive outcome of all of the anguish was the formation 
of a neighborhood group citizens for community aid which edward 
williams a crime prevention officer with the philadelphia police 
department said has helped defuse tension 
williams said the circumstances that pushed smith over the brink 
were common in the citys olney section a bluecollar neighborhood 
the kids actually controlled their community in the sense that 
the adults feared coming out of their houses because of 
harassment williams said 
but with the new community organization he added some of the 
kids that i saw that were responsible for some of the tensions have 
changed completely we probably saved a few lives the tension at 
that time was such that it could have exploded again 
drugs alcohol and the lack of places for teenagers to gather 
were major problems he said 
myra fesi the groups executive director said it has helped 
six to eight youths enter education programs or obtain drug or 
alcohol treatment through the juvenile justice system 
the community has to take ownership of the community mrs 
fesi said you cant have cops in your community 24 hours a day 
weve got to do it the people who live there 
after mondays verdict smiths attorney stanley w bluestine 
said its just a very tragic situation all the way around 
i feel bad for the family said smith who remained free on 
15000 bail i feel bad for the boy i feel bad for the sorrow 
and grief ive brought my own family 
the dead youths mother julie mcgettigan said my son is 
dead 18 months mr smiths family has been through god knows what 
in those 18 months and they have more to go through its been 
lousy all the way through and im sorry it happened 
her husband william added the only person i dont feel 
sorry for is smith 
the group formed in the wake of the killing has suffered 
setbacks in its efforts to raise money for a community center mrs 
fesi said 
a woman who took a public role in forming the group moved after 
she was harassed we could never prove who did it mrs fesi 
said they even threatened to bomb her house so she had to 
move 
bluestine said he understood tensions remained and his client 
also moved after the shooting 
its a bad situation up there and from my understanding its 
still continuing he said theres still a lot of problems with 
teenage boys

slumlord is believed to be a fugitive again after being 
inadvertently released from custody officials said 
vijaynard sharma 41 of inglewood posted 20000 bail in a new 
jersey court and was freed friday said ted goldstein a spokesman 
for the los angeles city attorneys office

january while on bail pending sentencing in los angeles for more 
than 100 housingcode violations 
he failed to appear in a new jersey courtroom monday for an 
extradition hearing

unaware that sharma had outstanding warrants with bails totaling 
265 million officials said the name of the judge was not 
immediately known said harriet sherman assistant chief of 
extradition in the los angeles district attorneys office 
deputy city attorney stephanie sautner said she was pretty 
surprised and a little angry when told of sharmas disappearance

warrant however once he was turned over to local authorities 
our warrant no longer applies said john kundts special agent in 
the fbis philadelphia office 
we didnt feel he could be released on any bail said los

gov bill clements touring this city 
where hurricane gilbert caused an estimated 35 million in damage 
says he expects to get federal emergency assistance for the area 
at least 41 tornadoes struck texas in the aftermath of hurricane 
gilbert leaving hundreds of people without homes two san antonio 
residents were among the more than 200 killed overall as the storm 
swept through the caribbean and mexico 
throughout south texas 981 homes were damaged or destroyed by 
the hurricane and tornadoes said red cross spokesman frank 
stipkala in san antonio 
on saturday clements asked the federal government to declare 
brownsville a disaster area he toured the rio grande valley and 
san antonio on monday 
this is far worse than anything in brownsville clements 
said there is no place anywhere in texas that suffered this 
kind of damage 
the declaration would pave the way for assistance from the 
federal emergency management agency and would enable businesses to 
receive lowinterest loans from the small business adminstration 
it also could ultimately help homeless residents with temporary 
housing for a certain period officials said 
mayor henry cisneros and bexar county judge tom vickers escorted 
clements on the tour 
among the stops was an apartment complex where a twister early 
saturday destroyed 120 units damaged 260 units and left 300 people 
homeless 
its amazing to me that no one was killed clements said as 
he climbed over bricks on a tour of the lodge apartments 
vickers said city and county officials were assessing the damage 
and would try to get a report to clements later this week the 
governor said he would await that information before making the 
disaster request 
the approval and certification of it being declared a disaster 
area can happen very quickly but the individual payment will be 
slower than that clements said but the first step is to have 
it declared an emergency and i dont think well have any problem 
doing that 
in contrast to the hardhit san antonio area the rio grande 
valley may not need federal aid officials there said 
harlingen mayor bill card said his city suffered up to 800000 
in damage to mostly private property and the federal assistance 
might not be needed 
brownsville mayor ygnacio garza said the city spent thousands of 
dollars preparing and cleaning up after the storm 
whether it will meet the criteria for a true disaster i dont 
think so or im not sure and really were not too upset about 
that garza said 
south padre island city manager eduardo campriano said the storm 
caused about 100000 in damage to city property mostly road 
damage 
in corpus christi nueces county commissioner jp luby said two 
beach parks suffered about 100000 damage and he was considering a 
request for federal aid 
most of the damage in texas was in san antonio where residences 
at least 5 million in damage a tornado that cut through kelly air 
force base caused 28 million in damage to 12 buildings and 
aircraft parts another tornado destroyed the airconditioning 
system at the veterans administration hospital causing 2 million 
in damage

a major investors service has reinstated 
yonkers bond rating but efforts failed to bring together the two 
sides in the housing desegregation case that led to the citys 
financial problems 
moodys investors service announced monday it had reinstated the 
baa rating on obligation bonds the highest rating is aaa 
the rating was based on the security derived from the setting 
aside of property taxes with the state comptroller as fiscal 
agent for the purpose of meeting debts moodys said city 
officials said 259 million was set aside 
moodys suspended the bond rating aug 4 due to uncertainties 
resulting from the daily fines imposed by us district judge 
leonard sand after the yonkers city council voted to defy his 
housing desegregation order 
sands initial fine of 100 had been due to double daily so that 
the city would have faced bankruptcy by midaugust a federal 
appeals court later capped the fines at 1 million daily 
just as the fines hit the 1 million mark on sept 10 the 
council voted to pass a zoning ordinance related to the location of 
the affordable housing and bring itself into compliance with sands 
order 
yonkers paid 819100 in fines 358041 of which was given to 
the city schools 
sand had found the city liable for 40 years of segregating 
housing and schools in a 1985 landmark decision

after the polio virus found in sewage infected at least eight 
people with the disease the health ministry announced 
six cases of polio were confirmed in the town of hadera 28 
miles north of tel aviv health officials said the victims include 
a 26yearold teacher and a 3monthold boy from the or akiva

the outbreak caught israel by surprise the european division of 
the world health organization to which israel belongs earlier

no polio cases were reported in israel last year and only a 
single case was reported in 1986 
dr avraham morag of hadassah hospital head of the health 
ministrys advisory committee on contagious diseases said that 
besides the eight confirmed cases two more possible cases were 
under observation 
he said health officials also were studying whether to expand 
the immunization campaign to other areas 
morag said the outbreak was caused by overflowing sewage and the 
fact that some people were not vaccinated against polio he said 
massive amounts of the virus were detected in sewage in or 
akiva and the nearby arab village of umm elfahm both in the 
hadera area 
there have been no polio cases among arab villagers but they 
have been included in the new immunization campaign morag said

a prosecutor who was once told her 
short skirts and designer blouses made her look like a bimbo 
has been fired for what her boss called professional shortcomings 
brenda taylor lost her 22000 job as a broward county assistant 
state attorney because of her handling of several drunken driving 
cases her absence or tardiness from court and her failure to 
comply with paperwork her supervisor said monday 
this is garbage said ms taylor 25 it just shows to 
what lengths they will go to get someone 
ms taylor contended she was fired because of the complaint she 
filed last month with the broward county human relations commission 
against assistant state attorney john countryman one of her 
supervisors 
in it she charged him with discriminating against her for the 
clothes she wore designer styles rather than conservative 
bluegray suits 
countrymans problems with ms taylor were spelled out in five 
memos 
i told her that her appearance in court in a short skirt 
created the impression that she was a bimbo interested only in 
meeting men countryman 38 wrote in one memo i stressed that 
she was not but that to outsiders appearance was reality 
on aug 5 supervisors warned ms taylor that her job 
performance during a sixmonth probationary period was 
unsatisfactory and her probation was being extended a month 
since aug 5 nothing of a positive nature has occurred which 
would change the opinion of the administrators ralph ray the 
offices chief assistant said in the termination notice 
harris lowenthal a former assistant state attorney helping to 
defend ms taylor called the job performance criticisms absurd he 
said he doubts any prosecutor has been fired for the same reasons 
i knew it would probably have an effect on my career but im 
a good lawyer and i know that my career as a lawyer will go on

emperor hirohito the worlds longest reigning 
monarch received three blood transfusions today and was in stable 
condition after vomiting blood imperial officials said 
the imperial household agency and other officials did not 
confirm a kyodo news service report that the 87yearold emperor 
appeared to be in critical condition this morning despite 
nightlong treatment by a team of court physicians 
kyodo attributed its report to an unidentified person who 
attended a cabinet meeting this morning it said a predawn 
transfusion had not stopped a hemorrhage in his digestive tract 
the imperial agency said no such announcement had been made 
but in briefings later for japanese reporters iwao miyao vice 
grand steward of the imperial agency said doctors had given 
hirohito 16 pints of blood during the night then 04 pints more 
during the morning and 04 pints again during the afternoon 
an imperial household agency official quoted miyao as saying in 
a briefing at 930 pm i dont think the emperors condition is 
becoming worse but rather that it is stabilizing 
the emperor is in stable condition he has a slight fever and 
is receiving intravenous drip said palace spokesman takenari 
sugawara 
prime minister noboru takeshitas cabinet was expected to 
approve plans thursday to place crown prince akihito 54 in charge 
of state matters defense agency head kichiro tazawa told reporters 
the emperors worsening health caused one former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone to cut short a trip to london and return home 
at least one morning newspaper the englishlanguage japan 
times printed a singlepage extra this afternoon it bore the 
headline ailing emperor vomits some blood and a photo of a 
jogger who paused to pray in front of the palace 
in a briefing to palace reporters this afternoon miyao said the 
emperor would continue to receive blood and intravenous fluids 
kyodo said 
japanese news media mounted an intense watch on the imperial 
palace in central tokyo and reported the arrivals of a stream of 
wellwishers including prime minister noboru takeshita and us 
ambassador mike mansfield 
the japan broadcasting corp reported that hirohito said thank 
you to his son akihito and the princes wife crown princess 
michiko 
the emperors death would plunge japan into official mourning 
hirohito has occupied the chrysanthemum throne since 1926 and 
after renouncing his divinity after world war ii is a figurehead 
with the constitutional role of symbol of state but no power 
older japanese grew up revering him as the divine descendant of 
the sun goddess amaterasu and still honor him highly while younger 
people tend to have less interest in the imperial family 
marine biology is the emperors passion indeed hirohito is a 
widely respected authority on the subject having written or 
coauthored at least 12 books on hydrozoa or sea animals his 
specialty 
late monday court physicians were summoned to the palace to 
treat the emperor and early today miyao told a news conference 
that the emperor had vomited blood a sign of hemorrhaging and 
the doctor had administered the first transfusion the monarch was 
conscious through the procedure miyao said 
hirohito has been frail since an intestinal bypass operation in 
september 1987 but he appeared in public for his 87th birthday on 
april 29 and on several later occasions he and empress nagako 85 
spent most of the summer at an imperial villa outside tokyo 
returning to the capital on sept 8 
since late summer he has suffered from colds and fevers and a 
news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 130 pounds 
he carried before his surgery

michigans new law barring contracts that pay a 
surrogate mother to give up custody rights is constitutional ruled 
a judge who said he still must decide whether a woman can be 
reimbursed for the costs of bearing a child for someone else 
the michigan attorney generals office and the american civil 
liberties union agreed that surrogate arrangements are illegal if a 
mother is paid to give up her parental rights that agreement 
enabled wayne county circuit judge john gillis to rule monday on 
the laws constitutionality without listening to lengthy arguments 
its possible gillis could distinguish between a payment for 
giving up parental rights and a payment for the service of bearing 
a child gillis promised to issue a further ruling within 30 to 60 
days 
the aclu believes the judge will interpret the law to mean it is 
ok to pay a woman for the service of carrying a child so long as 
she wasnt paid to give up custody 
if the judge agrees a woman who was artificially inseminated 
could keep the money and the baby and the man whose sperm was used 
in the insemination would have to fight for custody of the child 
after court gillis confirmed that is the focus of the decision 
still before him 
national coalition against surrogacy cochair jeremy rifkin 
called mondays action a major victory because gillis was the first 
judge to rule on the constitutionality of criminal sanctions for 
surrogacy 
that is crucial to us because we are in the process of moving 
legislation in legislatures across the country he said from 
washington 
noel keane a dearborn attorney is one of the nations most 
prolific surrogacy specialists claiming responsibility for 245 
births including new jerseys baby m 
keane expressed confidence the contracts he has been arranging 
will be found to be legal 
he typically makes 10000 for arranging a birth women who 
agree to be artificially inseminated and then let the biological 
father raise the offspring earn the same amount the infertile 
couple pays the medical costs 
the new law which took effect sept 1 calls for up to five 
years in prison and a 50000 fine for brokers who make money by 
arranging surrogate births advertising or inducing a woman to 
bear a child for an infertile couple also became a felony 
under the law women who enter into surrogacy contracts 
involving an exchange of money risk misdemeanor penalties of 90 
days in jail and a 10000 fine 
the law didnt penalize arrangements involving no exchange of 
money but the aclu argued in a suit on behalf of surrogates and 
wouldbe parents that removing the payment for a womans services 
effectively abolished surrogacy 
michigan was the first state to approve criminal penalties for 
surrogate parent contracts 
kentucky and louisiana have enacted laws declaring such 
contracts illegal but dont impose criminal penalties nebraska 
doesnt recognize as legal surrogacy contracts and indiana has 
barred enforcement of surrogate parenting contracts a florida law 
criminalizing contracts and setting up regulations was passed after 
michigans but took effect july 1 nevada has legalized surrogacy

wine beer champagne and cognac will be available 
in soviet food stores but the kremlin plans to continue sharp 
restrictions on the sale of vodka the communist party newspaper 
pravda said 
the daily said monday that the cabinet known as the council of 
ministers reviewed soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 1985 
antialcohol campaign that raised prices and the drinking age while 
cutting hours of liquor stores and the production of alcoholic 
beverages 
dry wines champagne cognac and beer are permitted to be 
sold in food stores and it was proposed to put an end to queues 
that humiliate human dignity the pravda report said 
muscovites say they have been able to buy champagne expensive 
cognac and sometimes beer in some food stores throughout 
gorbachevs campaign to restrict alcohol sales 
it was not immediately clear whether the council of ministers 
intended to increase supplies to food stores or stock them with 
cheaper more popular beverages to end the long lines of soviets at 
liquor stores 
the policy governing the sale of distilled liquors such as 
vodka has not changed soviets who want to buy vodka still must 
shop at special stores only between 28 pm monday through 
saturday and buy only two bottles a person 
shortly before new years this year a wave of letters and press 
commentaries critical of long lines for wine or champagne at liquor 
stores was published in the soviet media 
in response the kremlin permitted sales of nondistilled 
alcohol on grocery store shelves for the holiday period but only 
for one week 
pravda said monday that the measures gorbachev introduced more 
than three years ago including cutting production of strong drink 
in half reducing sales hours and closing some shops had waged a 
successful war on drunkenness 
it was noted at the council of ministers meeting that 
appreciable success was received in liquidating alcoholism and hard 
drinking after adoption of the decree in 1985 the newspaper 
said drinking has been stopped at factories and plants as well 
as at other public places 
pravda said the antidrink campaign had helped reduce crime and 
helped citizens to live and breathe more freely 
but articles in soviet papers have called the campaign excessive 
and said it mostly hurt the occasional drinker who wanted a bottle 
of champagne or wine for a holiday or family celebration 
the crackdown also led to a surge in moonshining 
the labor newspaper trud reported in may that moonshiners were 
outproducing legal liquor manufacturers and some articles have 
attributed recurring sugar shortages to moonshiners who use it in 
the distilling process 
the newspaper sovietskaya kultura disclosed earlier this year 
that the antidrinking campaign had shut down 70 percent of the 
50000 moscow liquor shops that had been operating since may 1985 
last november pravda reported there were 45 million diagnosed 
alcoholics in the country and millions of others who have avoided 
detection or treatment

a court order that takes the first step 
toward cleaning up southern californias polluted air could lead to 
stronger auto emission controls and a reduction in the number of 
freeway commuters officials said 
us district judge harry hupp on monday ordered the 
environmental protection agency to draft a plan to reduce pollution 
in the south coast air basin which includes los angeles orange 
riverside and san bernardino counties 
hupps order was expected after the epa acknowledged in july 
that it is required by federal law to take over smog control 
enforcement in the basin after the local air quality management 
district missed a deadline for meeting ozone and carbon monoxide 
health standards the order doesnt set a deadline for epas plan 
epa officials who spoke on condition of anonymity told the los 
angeles times they hope congress will extend compliance deadlines 
before the epa is forced to impose stringent restrictions on the 
area 
epa administrator lee m thomas said the agency is legally 
required to draft a plan that would reduce smog by 1993 
that fiveyear deadline would require curtailing rushhour 
traffic 
i think 20 years is by far the more realistic time frame and 
even with that it will require tremendous change on everybodys 
part and even new technology to accomplish it thomas said 
but he said the law wont let me go beyond five years 
mark abramowitz a spokesman for the coalition for clean air 
said the organization along with the sierra club believes that a 
fiveyear deadline would force such strict control measures that 
the public would oppose it he said the environmental groups hoped 
for a 12 to 15year plan 
the basin has some of the worst air in the country despite auto 
emissions standards and controls over industrial polluters

democrat michael dukakis proposed today that the 
federal government require employers to provide minimum health 
insurance coverage for all american workers which his campaign 
said would provide benefits to about 22 million people who have 
none 
underscoring his emphasis on health issues the massachusetts 
governor campaigned at a houston medical center with visits to two 
clinics he was to present his health insurance plan in a speech at 
western kentucky university in bowling green ky 
at hermann hospital part of the texas medical center the 
democrtic nominee sat with a dozen selected patients and family 
members in the waiting room of a cancer ward and asked each in turn 
about medical costs and health insurance problems 
i think its time we did something he said its getting 
worse 
if all goes well on the 8th of november sen lloyd bentsen 
and i are going to do something about it dukakis said spread 
the word 
his campaign issued a statement saying that as president 
dukakis would propose legislation that would require all employers 
to provide basic health plans for their workers with special 
provisions for small and startup businesses 
dukakis health adviser dr david blumenthal of boston said 
the campaign had no estimate of what the proposal would cost 
employers the statement said it would not cost the federal 
government anything 
the statement also said that if elected dukakis would appoint a 
task force to report by march 30 1989 on followup legislation 
that would guarantee universal health coverage thus extending 
benefits to every american working or not 
blumenthal said 37 million to 40 million americans are without 
health insurance he said the initial dukakis plan would guarantee 
coverage to about twothirds of them by requiring that employers 
provide insurance or risk civil penalties the other onethird 
would be covered under the secondstep universal health plan 
the followup plan for all americans presumably would require 
some federal financing but the campaign was silent on that 
question details apparently would be worked out by the task force 
blumenthal said the proposed national plan was patterned after a 
massachusetts system not yet six months old which is to provide 
health care coverage to every state resident by 1992 
the prospective cost of that system is a topic of debate 
dukakis estimated net cost at about 623 million through 1992 some 
critics say it would be twice that much 
the stress on health care was part of the campaign effort to 
take control of the political agenda and choose topics instead of 
replying to republican political offensives 
dukakis punctuated it with a daylong offensive against his 
republican rival 
campaigning with his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
dukakis said he wondered what might have happened during the past 
eight years if president reagan had chosen a vice president 
strong enough to think for himself and speak up for himself 
dukakis said he chose bentsen because he didnt want a yes man 
but a strong man who would speak his mind and make a difference 
we havent had that kind of vice president in bush dukakis 
said 
campaigning in little rock monday dukakis told an invited 
audience of about 800 that bushs proposal for a reduction in the 
capital gains tax is a warmedover call to selfishness 
he said bushs vision is of a complacent america an america 
that wants to look backward 
dukakis added that even republicans realize four more years of 
reaganomics would be bad and four more years of reaganomics 
without reagan would be a disaster

vandals carved racial slurs on doors and 
splashed paint on an entryway floor at the home of mississippis 
first black congressman since reconstruction who is running for a 
second term this fall 
an upset mike espy took time off from his 2nd district campaign 
today to repair the damage to his home in this town a few miles 
north of jackson 
sure it makes you angry he said weve come a long way 
in mississippi but cases like this remind you how far weve got to 
go 
espy a democrat who faces republican jack coleman in november 
said his major concern was for his family 
im the congressman i have the record and i have my 
performance to defend and i can defend it espy said im the 
congressman not my wife my brother or my children 
espy said his wife discovered the vandalism when she returned 
home with her children late monday 
my son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and i had to explain to them 
the history of race relations in mississippi he said they had 
carved the word nigger on two doors and i had to tell my children 
what that meant and why somebody would do that it was not an easy 
thing to do 
if someone wants to come after me let them come but i want 
them to leave my family alone 
the congressman said the racial slurs were carved on doors in 
the covered entryway leading into the house and a garage area he 
said the letters were cut into the doors near the top along with 
us con apparently referring to congressman 
he said plants in the entryway had been uprooted and paint 
dashed on the floor and on some of the plants 
espy said both doors were locked when his family arrived and 
there apparently had been no attempt get inside he said police 
were called and were investigating 
madison police chief jimmy dukes said his officers had filed a 
report on the vandalism and an investigation was under way 
ed cole chairman of the state democratic party called for a 
full investigation of the incident 
i hope this campaign does not degenerate into that level of 
activity he said i think mississippi has gone a long way in 
erasing a negative image it has had outside the state 
mike espy has been a good congressman for this state and he 
has done a whole lot to improve mississippis image he said i 
hope we are not going to allow a few narrowminded people to take 
us back to a period we have gone through 
espy said he had received threatening calls in the past but 
you always expect those there has not been an increase in those 
calls and this is the first time something like this has 
happened 
i think most mississippians would be upset to hear something 
like this has happened he added but we all realize there are 
still some ignorant people running around we also realize that in 
public life we are prone to attack

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen campaigning in east texas oil country said today 
that on energy policy the reagan administration has drilled a 
real dry hole 
bentsen reiterated presidential nominee michael dukakis promise 
to take government action to revive the petroleum industry one day 
earlier in houston dukakis outlined his energy program before an 
audience of oil producers saying he would support government 
intervention if necessary to keep domestic wells in operation 
today in longview bentsen told reporters five out of six 
rigs that were active in 1981 are idle today two out of every five 
jobs in the oil industry have been lost 
standing in front of a rig hauled to the airport for the event 
with a huge american flag as a backdrop bentsen pointed to the 
equipment as a sign of whats happened to texas 
that piece of equipment shouldnt be here at the airport it 
should be out there working in the field he said 
george bush will tell you hes an oilman but when it comes to 
an energy policy this administration has drilled a dry hole its a 
real duster he said 
a day earlier dukakis said he would name bentsen to head a 
bipartisan energy summit as soon after the election as possible 
dukakis said with each passing month we are becoming more 
vulnerable to another oil embargo at the rate were going by 
1995 the united states will be 60 percent dependent on foreign 
oil 
the energy summit is the second panel or commission to which 
dukakis has said he would appoint the texas senator if the 
democratic ticket is elected dukakis has also said bentsen would 
head a council on the space program which like oil has a definite 
interest for texas voters 
the polls in texas show the democratic ticket trailing slightly 
in the race for the states 29 electoral votes 
dukakis in a message bentsen was to carry around the state 
today slammed republican george bush for doing nothing for the oil 
industry as vice president he said bushs failure to appear at the 
people for an energy policy forum to which both tickets were 
invited was indicative 
a former texas oilman and yet he doesnt have time to engage 
in a discussion of energy dukakis said of bush accusing him in 
his adopted home state of ignoring the important issues of the 
campaign 
my friends we dont need any more speeches about the flag 
he said we need a president and vice president who are concerned 
about americas energy future and yours 
dukakis said that at the same time energy demand has increased 
the domestic industrys production has gone down since president 
reagan took office the last eight years in the energy industry 
have been a roller coaster ride with the bottom knocked out 
dukakis promised to remove barriers that have been blocking 
increased use of natural gas in the country to increase the 
filling of the governments strategic oil reserve and to boost 
research on making oil fields more productive 
he also promised to make houston the eor enhanced oil 
recovery capital of the world referring to techniques for 
extracting more oil from a seemingly depleted well and said his 
program would help the oil industry more directly if necessary to 
keep wells from shutting down 
and when the market alone wont provide the incentive to 
drill a government led by mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen will 
he said 
bentsen has made a career in congress fighting on the side of 
the oil industry dukakis said the texas senator would be chairman 
of a bipartisan energy summit just as soon after the election as 
possible 
the group would design a comprehensive energy policy to make 
sure producers and consumers had fair prices he said dukakis 
speech made no mention of alternative energy sources such as 
nuclear power or ethanol 
unlike either george bush or dan quayle lloyd bentsen has 
been a leader in congress dukakis said of his running mate who 
was seated nearby the massachusetts governor listed bentsens 
accomplishments and quayles votes against the oil industry 
those votes say a lot about mr quayle he said and they 
say a lot about the man who selected him 
bentsen who introduced dukakis to the gathering of several 
hundred oil industry people from texas and neighboring states said 
the reagan administration had sentenced the southwest to a deep 
and painful recession 
i know a lot of my friends in the energy business tend to vote 
republican he said but i want to ask them what has this 
administration done to help your industry through the toughest 
period in history 
dukakis he said was the first of the democrats to support 
repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil and was not as 
republicans claimed opposed to all offshore drilling

on his last day in office education 
secretary william bennett today praised the tradition of strong 
local control in new hampshire schools and downplayed the 
importance of kindergarten for youngsters 
it would be a shame for new hampshire to veer toward state 
control of education when we are telling other states to emulate 
new hampshire bennett said at a news conference 
he cited justreleased national statistics on scholastic 
aptitude tests as evidence that local control works average scores 
for new hampshire students were tops nationally among the 22 states 
in which 40 percent or more of the students took the tests which 
are widely used in college admissions 
bennett who appeared at the news conference with republican 
gubernatorial candidate judd gregg was asked to comment on new 
hampshires status as the only state not to require kindergarten 
and greggs opposition to statemandated kindergarten 
bennett did not answer directly but said there is no 
research that conclusively proves that kindergarten gives kids a 
jump 
yes kindergarten is desireable he said but a good 
first second and third grade is more important than a good 
kindergarten 
he added no one suggests that new hampshires education 
system is perfect the general decline in education seen in the 
united states is seen in new hampshire but new hampshire more 
than many other states is on the right track trying to reverse 
the trend 
bennett went from nashua to hollis where he was to briefly 
teach reading and speak to an assembly at the hollis elementary 
school one of 287 winners nationwide in the education departments 
school recognition program 
he was also scheduled to go to boston today for his last 
official appearance as education secretary afterward he planned 
to go hiking in new hampshires white mountains

a report by the national academy of sciences 
called the growing number of homeless children a national 
disgrace yet was issued without its authors strongest 
recommendations and criticism of government failures one 
participant said today 
while the academy published the bulk of the report it declined 
to include detailed recommendations 
those who served on the panel were a little disturbed that 
we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the 
homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be 
taken nathan stark a washington lawyer and panel member said 
today 
but dr fred solomon of the academys institute of medicine 
which sponsored the report termed the recommendations not 
sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included 
the additional comments were included in a supplemental 
statement released today by bruce c vladeck president of the 
united hospital fund of new york who headed the 13member study 
group 
vladeck said the published report doesnt adequately convey 
our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon of homelessness 
the official academy study portrays a homeless america filled 
not only with alcoholics and former mental patients but with 
growing numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal 
existence in rural communities 
the study ordered by congress estimates that on any given 
night families with a total of 100000 children are homeless while 
yet more children have run away or been kicked out by their parents 
the 242page report says children under 18 are the fastest 
growing group among the nations homeless and says this is 
nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with 
the urgency that such a situation demands 
the only indication of the panels stronger position comes in a 
fiveline footnote which says members of the committee 
unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the 
recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of 
homelessness especially the supply of lowincome housing income 
maintenance the availability of support services and access to 
health care for the poor and uninsured 
dr frank press director of the national academy of sciences 
blocked publication of a supplemental statement signed by 10 of the 
panel members he was quoted in the new york times today as saying 
he did so because the language was charged and polemical and 
emotional 
he said the academy has the obligation to stick to the data 
and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible 
the published reports recommendations include a list of largely 
noncontroversial proposals covering eligibility standards training 
and program expansions 
the report calls for instance for improved day care and head 
start programs and efforts to make homeless parents aware of the 
help available for their children it recommends that food stamps 
be allowed to be used in restaurants so people who dont have 
kitchens can use them to save money 
but deleted said vladeck were calls for restoring a 70 percent 
cut in lowincome housing support since 1981 new treatments 
services for the mentally ill and substance abusers and an 
increase in the minimum wage to make adequate housing affordable 
the study did include however an appendix which blamed the 
growing number of rural homeless on the failure of government 
policymakers to recognize the extent of the rural economic crisis 
farm foreclosures foreign competition that has wiped out 
lowwage rural manufacturing jobs and the downturn in energy 
industries have bred increased rural poverty and homelessness says 
the report by consultant larry t patton 
the report said there are no national studies pinning down the 
numbers of homeless children but it uses the most conservative of 
several estimates to conclude that each night at least 100000 
children are in families that must resort to streets organized 
shelters or makeshift quarters 
it cites estimates of the alliance housing council a homeless 
advocacy group that there are 735000 homeless on any given night 
and concludes that at least a quarter of them are members of 
families and 55 percent of the family members are children 
it also cites research by the group indicating that 13 million 
to 2 million people will be homeless for one night or more in the 
course of a year 
the study acknowledges that accurate statistics on the homeless 
are difficult to find 
meanwhile the census bureau announced monday that it will make 
a special effort in 1990 to count the homeless on march 20 of that 
year census takers will visit emergency shelters from 6 pm to 
midnight and street locations where the homeless often congregate 
between 2 am and 4 am 
during 10 months of research the committee and its staff 
visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities boston 
chicago kansas city lexington ky los angeles milwaukee 
nashville san diego san francisco st louis and washington and 
rural areas in alabama minnesota mississippi and north dakota

democrat michael dukakis sought support among working people and 
their families today by proposing requirements that all americans 
be covered by health insurance republican rival george bush 
visited a flag factory and said i want to build an america that 
inspires 
bush told a rally outside the annin flag company in bloomfield 
nj my mission is simple to build a better america that 
simple and that big 
inside he told plant workers today the flags you make still 
inspire americans and those who love our values the world over 
bush has said repeatedly in recent appearances that the flag 
manufacturer has thrived during the reagan administration 
contending that flag sales reflect a patriotic revival during the 
republicans white house tenure 
but dukakis said monday that we dont need more speeches about 
the flag and then unveiled his broad healthinsurance proposal 
today 
the massachusetts governor opened his campaign day with stops at 
a houston medical center and two clinics asking patients and 
family members about medical costs and health insurance problems 
and saying i think its time we did something its getting 
worse 
he was to spell out details of the health plan during a speech 
at western kentucky university in bowling green 
in advance his campaign issued a statement saying that as 
president dukakis would propose legislation to require all 
employers to provide basic health plans for their workers a plan 
aimed at providing benefits to about 22 million people who now have 
none 
the statement also said that dukakis if elected would appoint 
a task force to report by march 30 1989 on followup legislation 
to guarantee universal health coverage thus extending benefits to 
every american working or not that followup plan for all workers 
presumably would require some federal financing but the campaign 
was silent on that question 
dr david blumenthal of boston dukakis health adviser said 37 
million to 40 million americans have no health insurance 
dukakis emphasis on health care was part of an effort to take 
control of the political discussion rather than merely replying to 
allegations by bush 
continuing attacks he began last week on dukakis tenure as 
massachusetts governor the bush told a chamber of commerce 
luncheon in pennsylvania on monday that the democratic nominee had 
an antibusiness scheme 
he said business bankruptcies in massachusetts rose 237 percent 
during the first six months of the year while the national rate had 
fallen 235 percent 
bush also accused dukakis of running a divisive campaign with 
a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences between rich and 
poor between one region of the country and another 
dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen of texas campaigned in 
houston on monday where dukakis said he would support government 
intervention if necessary to keep domestic oil wells operating 
dukakis also said he would appoint bentsen who has made a 
congressional career of helping the oil industry to a bipartisan 
energy summit 
accusing bush of changing his position on offshore drilling to 
suit his campaign needs supporting it in texas and opposing it in 
california dukakis told the audience of about 1000 
george bush is like a coin they just flip him sometimes he 
lands on his head sometimes he lands on his tail 
just as bush did in pennsylvania republican running mate dan 
quayle of indiana attacked dukakis record on the massachusetts 
economy during appearances in knoxville tenn and casper wyo 
charging that dukakis created an economic manacle in 
massachusetts he said the state ranks 40th out of 50 states in 
total employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth it 
actually lost 90000 manufacturing jobs between june 1984 and 
january 1988 he said 
quayle also went after dukakis on what the republicans contend 
is his electionyear conversion to a tougher defense in just a 
week his defense policy went from general confusion to general 
patton he said 
the dukakis campaign swiftly countered the claims made by both 
republican candidates about the massachusetts economy bringing out 
eight business leaders in massachusetts to respond 
my company has grown and prospered under the leadership of 
governor dukakis said one of them wang computer co founder an 
wang a dukakis supporter he created the atmosphere that made it 
possible for us to grow 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said leading members of the 
democratic party would be called on to rebut some bush charges 
while massachusetts business and industry leaders would address 
bush comments about the state economy 
both bush and dukakis were limiting their campaign schedule this 
week in order to prepare for sundays debate in winstonsalem nc 
despite the approaching encounter the sides have not agreed on who 
will ask the questions 
a media generalassociated press poll meanwhile said americans 
see dukakis as more compassionate and bush as more competent but 
arent convinced that either candidate can accomplish most of his 
goals as president 
only 36 percent of those surveyed said bush could accomplish 
most of his goals as president and just 31 percent said dukakis 
could achieve most of his goals nearly half said either would be 
stymied the rest were not sure 
a university of akron poll in ohio showed bush leading 4339 
and one in new york by the marist college institute for public 
opinion showed dukakis ahead 4842 but the fourpoint margin of 
error in each poll made the leads meaningless 
a poll in mississippi gave bush a 4934 lead the poll by rick 
knox and associates had a fivepoint margin of error

days earlier when lt gen prosper avril seized power in a coup 
radio stations reported 
at least three people were killed in the streets during the 
night the stations said nine other people have been reported 
killed in the past two days 
after a night of gunfire and violence in the streets of this 
sprawling capital noncommissioned officers and enlisted men of 
the downtown fourth company arrested their commander maj renaud 
symbert and deposited him unharmed in front of the downtown army 
headquarters the radio stations said 
the stations said gunfire was heard at the army compound in 
mirebalais about 25 miles northwest of the capital as soldiers 
mutinied against their commander lt simeon francois the 
lieutenant fled 
on monday troops of the elite 300man leopards battalion 
handcuffed their leader col abelard denis to the entrance of 
army headquarters firing automatic weapons triumphantly into the 
air they sped in vehicles back to their compound near the wealthy 
suburb of petionville 
soldiers of the 160man aviation corps also briefly detained 
their commander monday before expelling him from their base in 
portauprince 
avril previously army adjutant general proclaimed himself 
president sunday after a coup ousted lt gen henri namphy who ran 
haiti for most of the 2 years since jeanclaude duvalier was 
forced into exile in february 1986 
radio reports said police detective henri toussaint was shot and 
killed as were three unidentified brothers of commander roland 
chavannes of the traffic police 
gunshots filled the air all night and into the early hours

firefighters working double shifts 
today battled a windfanned arson blaze to the edge of this city as 
flames destroyed seven homes scorched more than 18000 acres and 
forced 500 people to flee

temperatures to stir up two major blazes the arson fire grew to 
18000 acres and jumped a containment line late monday outside 
vacaville about 55 miles northeast of san francisco it reached 
within a third of a mile of town said fire captain ken thomas 
authorities established a new line today along a 10mile stretch 
of road along which the 500 residents were ordered to evacuate 
said fire captain john ferreira 
were leaving said david foster 33 one of vacavilles 
61000 residents staying around would be stupid 
ferreira said firefighters were optimistic about holding the 
blaze 
if today goes well for us we should have 100 percent 
containment thursday he said officials predicted that afternoon 
wind could push the blaze toward scattered homes to the west of the 
fire line at the western edge of town 
along interstate 80 the glow from the fire could be seen 13

million worth of telecommunications equipment officials said 
although no incendiary device was recovered in miller canyon 
where most of the destroyed homes were located arson was 
suspected said ferreira

about 300 people were evacuated but authorities said they were 
allowed to return to home monday

the security council unanimously voted 
today to approve an independence referendum for western sahara 
where marxist guerrillas haven been battling moroccos occupation 
forces for 13 years 
the 150 security council vote approved the appointment of a 
special representative of the secretarygeneral to monitor a 
referendum that would result in western saharas independence or 
affiliation with morocco 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar reminded the members 
of the council that on aug 30 representatives of the polisario 
independence movement and morocco met with him in geneva to approve 
the referendum and peace plan with certain reservations 
the proposals aimed at the restoration of peace in the region 
provide a framework for the conclusion of a ceasefire and the 
establishment of conditions necessary for the organization of a 
credible referendum said the un chief 
the referendum will be organized and monitored by the united 
nations in cooperation with the organization of african unity he 
said the organization has played a major role in arranging the 
dialogue between polisario and morocco 
perez de cuellar said a special representative from his office 
a civilian unit a military unit and a security unit would work for 
peace in the area 
the proposals also provide that the kingdom of morocco will 
carry out an appropriate substantial and gradual reduction of its 
troops in the western sahra with remaining soldiers to be 
barracked under the supervision of un military observers 
polisarios fighters would also be quartered under un 
supervision 
the marxistled polisario movement of about 8000 fighters has 
been battling for the independence of western sahara since spains 
colonial administration withdrew in 197576 and moroccan 
occupation troops took over the phosphaterich desert territory in 
northwest africa 
more than 10000 people have died in the nearly 13yearold 
guerrilla war which has cost morocco up to 2 million a day to 
fight 
western sahara covers about 110000 square miles its population 
was set at 76000 in 1974 during the last spanish colonial census 
under the un plan only people born in the territory may vote 
in the referendum 
determining who is eligible will be a major chore for the 
referendum monitors polisario claims about 165000 eligible 
western saharans live in its refugee camps near tindouf in algeria 
which funds and shelters polisario but morocco says they are not 
eligible 
morocco claims that 90 percent of the 150000 residents of 
moroccanoccupied sections of western sahara are eligible but 
polisario says twothirds of them are moroccan immigrants

a space official said tuesday that israels 
first satellite was performing better than expected and he denied 
reports the craft is carrying cameras to spy on arab nations 
i am very enthusiastic about the excellent results moshe 
ortas of israel aircraft industries said on israel radio 
everything is going according to calculations even better 
the launch monday which made israel the eighth nation to place 
a satellite in space provoked sharp protests from arab neighbors 
a staterun newspaper in syria israels main enemy in the 
middle east accused the united states of helping launch the 
satellite and said it would threaten the arab world 
as part of the israelius strategic alliance the enemy 
launched a spy satellite with the help of the united statesfor 
military purposes this is a new threat to the arab nation the 
tishrin newspaper said 
but charles redman the state department spokesman denied the 
united states had any involvement in the launch 
pentagon officials say they are unsure what is in the 
satellites payload were leaning toward more of an experimental 
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite said 
one source who demanded anonymity 
in washington arab league representative clovis maksoud said 
the satellite gave israel a serious strategic leverage since 
the country already had the capability to fire longrange missiles 
the libyan news agency jana monitored in london described the 
craft as a spy satellite and part of a psychological war being 
carried out by the zionists against the arab nation 
newspaper editorials in other arab capitals urged arabs to pool 
resources to match israels technological advances 
ortas denied claims the 340pound test satellite named horizon 
i was carrying surveillance equipment 
we arent getting pictures we dont have anything to get 
pictures from there is no means to get pictures said ortas 
vice president of the electronics division of the agency that 
launched the satellite 
a spokesman for the londonbased magazine janes defense weekly 
said the satellite was carrying a 66pound payload for 
surveillance purposes apparently for monitoring activity in arab 
countries 
because israel is not thought to have the capability of 
installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a satellite 
us optical equipment was believed to be aboard the spokesman 
added 
tony banks a janes reporter with close ties to the israeli 
military said the satellite was unlikely to provide much useful 
surveillance because of the direction of its orbit 
it only gets two decent passes in any 24hour period over arab 
countries and one of these is during darkness which means no sight 
capability except perhaps by infrared light which is not as 
good banks said 
its very chancey its going to see anything at all he said 
in an interview monday from london 
israeli officials said the craft was expected to stay aloft for 
a month 
development of the craft came after more than 20 years of 
israeli space research and was seen as part of the countrys effort 
to become independent in the defense field 
until now israel has relied on the united states to provide 
satellite pictures but some former israeli officials have 
complained the united states was stingy in supplying intelligence 
information 
in march 1987 former us navy analyst jonathan jay pollard was 
sentenced to life in prison for selling israel hundreds of us 
military documents 
israeli media have quoted us and israeli sources as saying the 
documents pollard delivered included satellite pictures of iraqi 
and syrian weapons and storage facilities 
a recent source of possible concern to israel is that saudi 
arabia is deploying chinesebuilt css2 missiles 285 miles south 
of riyadh 
satellite photographs displayed by space media network a 
private swedish company showed the saudis were expanding an 
airstrip and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons 
maj gen yehoshua saguy a retired head of military 
intelligence said earlier this week that israel would save money 
on reconnaisance flights by conventional aircraft and drones 
saguy said another benefit to israel of having its own satellite 
was they pose fewer political problems than surveillance aircraft 
or pilotless planes

attendance returned to normal today at 
caldwell county high school where students had been kept from 
class by parents worried about rumors that a satanic cult planned 
to come to school and kill people 
about 350 youths twothirds of the student body left school 
in a panic friday and about 100 students were absent monday 
said acting police chief john dunning and principal ray wilson 
attendance also was down at the county middle school and grade 
schools officials said 
today though 95 percent of the schools students were in 
class said charlie elder director of pupil personnel attendance 
is normally about 94 percent to 95 percent he said 
its calmed down quite a bit dunning said weve got a 
few called today but not as many as yesterday monday and not 
near as many as friday 
wilson and dunning said there was no evidence of any threat to 
students 
a rumor got started at the high school apparently by one of 
the students to the effect that some people from christian county 
were going to come to the high school sometime friday during school 
hours and start killing people dunning said 
we are continuing to look into the matter but with no 
evidence we are going on the assumption it is a rumor started by 
some kids that has gotten completely out of hand 
another rumor dunning said was that a note was left with a 
gutted black cat that said they would be back to get blond 
blueeyed students dunning said the only cat found anywhere near 
the school was a black one found dead in a road thursday night 
it didnt have a note attached to it and it had been run 
over he said 
dunning said many students called their parents friday 
it created a panic at one time they were calling students to 
the office five and six at a time telling them their parents 
were there to pick them up he said 
those who left and stayed out monday were not been punished 
wilson said 
but he said funding was affected in kentucky schools are 
funded largely on the basis of average daily attendance if 
attendance is low the average drops and so does the amount of 
money the system receives

a car bomb killed three people in east 
beirut on tuesday as christian lawmakers met to choose a 
presidential candidate to challenge the nominee favored by the 
united states and syria 
police said 25 people were wounded in the blast at 9 am in 
east beiruts denselypopulated dora district among the wounded 
was former information minister joseph skaff 50 who was heading 
in a motorcade through dora for the conclave of christian 
parliament members 
a police spokesman said skaff a greek catholic did not attend 
the meeting and was admitted to a hospital in east beirut for 
treatment for minor cuts and burns in the head and neck 
parliament is scheduled to meet thursday to pick a successor to 
president amin gemayel whose 6yearterm ends friday 
failure to elect a new president would plunge lebanon into a 
constitutional crisis that could trigger a new round of violence in 
the nations 13year civil war that has killed more than 130000 
people 
the police spokesman said skaffs three bodyguards also suffered 
minor wounds when the bomb filled with 110 pounds of tnt exploded 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with police 
regulations said the other casualties were pedestrians motorists 
or shopkeepers 
the explosion the 13th car bombing in lebanon this year 
destroyed 43 cars parked in the street shattered glass and started 
several fires the spokesman said he said fire engines took an 
hour to put out the flames 
by police count 104 people have been killed and 378 wounded in 
the previous 12 car bombings 
a christian official speaking on condition of anonymity 
charged that the car bombing was designed to block the bkirki 
meeting 
however 27 of the 41 christian parliament deputies took part in 
the fourhour meeting at bkirki the seat of the maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir 12 miles north of beirut 
they met to try to agree on a presidential candidate after 
rejecting a syrianamerican agreement to name deputy mikhail daher 
a statement issued after the session said they will meet again 
wednesday after consulting with other nonchristian deputies 
the statement said christian deputies stress that parliament 
should convene thursday as called for by shiite moslem house 
speaker hussein husseini to elect a new president 
but they called on husseini to shift the meeting from the old 
parliament building in moslem west beirut to the villa mansour in 
the nomans land of the citys dividing green line to facilitate 
participation of christian deputies 
the date falls one day before gemayels term in office expires 
under the constitution he cannot seek a second consequtive term 
a spokesman for sfeir has said he expects the christian deputies 
to nominate veteran maronite politician raymond edde 
edde living in paris since 1976 after surviving three 
assassination attempts in beirut announced last week he will run 
for president 
edde is acceptable to moslem parliament deputies his 
nomination will create an atmosphere of democratic competition 
within parliament this is what we want to preserve said sfeirs 
spokesman who demanded anonymity 
edde told the associated press in a telephone interview from 
paris on saturday that if elected he will first seek an israeli 
withdrawal from a selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
then ask the syrians to leave 
he warned that unless he succeeds in forcing the israelis out 
he would not return to lebanon and would ask parliament to elect 
another president 
syrianbacked moslem and leftist leaders have threatened to 
declare a separate republic in territory they control if gemayel 
seeks to resolve the crisis by appointing a maronite prime minister 
to head a caretaker cabinet 
according to an unwritten national covenant dating to lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 the president should be a 
maronite house speaker a shiite and prime minister a sunni moslem 
christian deputies boycotted a session at villa mansour aug 18 
preventing parliament from mustering a quorum of 51 voters to elect 
a president 
the only serious candidate at the time was syrianbacked former 
president suleiman franjieh christians rejected him as too closely 
aligned with syria 
moslem politicians charged that the main christian militia was 
working at israels bidding to trying to undermine the elections 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south beirut

the united states first ambassador to the 
mongolian peoples republic flew in this month presented his 
credentials and hopped a train back out heading for his office in 
washington 
its a beautiful country ambassador richard williams told a 
news conference tuesday in beijing where he stopped en route 
it also could become a useful post for tracking developments 
inside mongolias huge socialist neighbors china and the soviet 
union as they move slowly to heal their rift of more than two 
decades 
but he has no plans to move there when the united states 
established relations with mongolia in 1987 the state department 
decided the remote frigid country was too harsh a post for 
permanent residence 
instead williams will be the only american ambassador working 
out of a state department office he will continue holding his 
previous post as head of the departments china affairs office 
and make periodic trips to mongolia 
two junior us diplomats have been stationed in the capital of 
ulan bator for six months working out of an apartment building 
but they will leave for the winter williams said 
during his 10day visit to ulan bator williams said he 
discussed with the mongolians possibilities for finding permanent 
facilities for an embassy and staff but he said the prospect of 
living there himself would take some thinking about 
the winters go down to 40 to 50 below zero he said its 
a little daunting 
mongolia has been closely allied to the soviet union since 
declaring its independence from china in 1921 mongolia has ties 
with 100 countries but only 18 maintain embassies in ulan bator 
most of them east bloc nations 
many have supplies sent in from relatively luxurious beijing to 
supplement the mongolian diet of mutton and sour milk 
williams said his main concerns are to aid americans who travel 
in mongolia and develop usmongolian trade which averages 3 
million annually mostly in cashmere and camels hair exports to 
the united states 
but he acknowledged the new relationship can provide us with 
an interesting additional view of the state of mongoliansoviet 
mongolianchinese and sinosoviet relations 
the soviet union stations nearly 50000 troops in mongolia 
williams said and their presence is one of several key problems 
blocking normalization of chinesesoviet relations the soviets 
pulled an estimated 12000 soldiers out in 1987 but have not 
scheduled further withdrawals 
mongolia took the soviet side in the bitter sovietchinese split 
of the early 1960s but recently has followed moscows lead and 
improved ties with china a mongolian parliamentary delegation 
visited beijing this month for the first time 
williams said the united states considered establishing ties 
with mongolia in the 1960s but did not want to offend the 
nationalist chinese government on taiwan which claims mongolia as 
part of china the united states broke ties with the nationalists 
in 1979 and recognized the government in beijing 
us and mongolian diplomats discussed establishing ties in the 
1970s but mongolia broke off the talks unexpectedly and new 
efforts began only in 1986 williams said

security forces in somalia have executed hundreds 
of unarmed civilians during antirebel operations this summer and 
political prisoners are systematically tortured a human rights 
group said in a report wednesday 
the amnesty international report says human rights have been 
persistently violated during president mohamed siad barres 19 
years in power and that violations have intensified recently in 
countering rebel groups 
between several hundred and as many as 1000 people have been 
summarily executed by government forces in northern regions since 
heavy fighting began in may said martin hill a spokesman for the 
international organization 
the killings sometimes during housetohouse searches for 
ethiopianbacked rebels appeared aimed at terrorizing civilian 
sympathizers he said 
an estimated 200 prisoners also have been executed after summary 
trials in the last three years he said 
the londonbased organization said it had compiled evidence of 
a consistent pattern of torture arbitrary arrests and unfair 
trials of suspected government opponents 
torture victims said they were subjected to electric shocks and 
sexual assault wounded with knives suspended upside conducted housetohouse 
searches and 
arbitrarily killed many people it said 
foreign relief agency workers reported 21 people were dragged 
from their homes and shot to death in separate incidents on may 31 
and june 1 it said 
these were all deliberate extrajudicial executions of alleged 
political opponents as distinct from the indiscriminate heavy 
casualties caused by the battle in the town or subsequent 
bombardment by the government forces the report said 
hill said the 600000 people of hargeisa by and large were 
fleeing and the town is now virtually empty 
there seem to be deliberate attacks on civilians in urban 
areas but the security forces arent sufficiently organized to 
sweep through the countryside he said 
hill said a british reporter accompanying government troops 
during antirebel offensives this summer estimated that between 
30000 and 50000 people have been killed in mainly aerial 
bombardments 
the report said many prisoners held solely for the nonviolent 
expression of their beliefs have been kept for years in deplorable 
conditions often incommunicado and without proper medical aid 
yusuf osman samantar a lawyer and former member of parliament 
has been in prison without charge for nearly 19 years while safia 
hashi madar an employee of a us relief agency and a former 
science lecturer was jailed for life in 1986 for membership of a 
subversive organization the report said 
others include parliamentarians doctors clerics businessmen 
students and refugees it said

large contingents of police were deployed in 
mixed jewisharab areas tuesday as israelis started the 25hour 
fast of yom kippur the day of atonement and the most sacred 
holiday on the jewish calendar 
traffic on the nations highways came to a halt commercial 
flights were suspended and the border with egypt and bridges to 
jordan were closed 
staterun israel radio and television and israel army radio 
stopped transmitting the only day of the year they do so 
yom kippur came during a period of unprecedented conflict 
between israel and the 15 million palestinians in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
over the past nine months more than 265 palestinians and six 
israelis have been killed in what has come to be known as the 
intefadeh arabic for uprising to prevent violence police stepped 
up security in jerusalems mixed neighborhoods and other 
jewisharab areas of the country 
the army announced that as a security precaution palestinians 
from the occupied territories would be barred from entering israel 
between 2 pm tuesday and 8 pm wednesday 
yom kippur ends the ten terrible days during which 
according to jewish faith god decides who will live through the 
coming year and who will die 
during this period from the onset of the jewish new year until 
yom kippur jews bless each other with the greeting gmar hatima 
tova may you be inscribed in the book of life 
before sundown religious jews shed leather shoes and belts and 
don white robes to prepare for the kol nidre service the special 
prayer for forgiveness and life which begins yom kippur 
early tuesday many jews went to stores and markets to carry out 
the ancient rite of kapparot waving the chickens over their head 
the penitents prayed that their sins would be transferred to the 
sacrificial chickens afterwards the chickens were slaughtered 
stores commercial and government offices and public 
transportation shut down early to give workers time to prepare for 
the fast 
a survey by the hadashot daily indicated that 69 percent of 
israeli jews would fast even though the regularly observant portion 
of the population is estimated at only about 20 percent 
in a reflective article on yom kippur in the leftwing daily 
davar columnist amnon dankner wrote 
for many free and wild souls yom kippur is their last link 
with judaism in which not only the religious intent is important 
it is more like taking part in a sporting event which measures 
willpower restraint and even spirituality 
tuesday also marked the 15th anniversary of the 1973 middle east 
war which began on yom kippur when egyptian and syrian armies 
thrust through israeli lines in the occupied sinai desert and golan 
heights and briefly threatened to invade israel itself 
on the eve of yom kippur bereaved families layed wreaths and 
flowers at the gravesides of the 3000 israeli troops who died in 
the 1973 middle east war 
israeli newspapers printed reminiscences and commentaries about 
the war 
davars editor hanna zemer recalled that egyptian president 
anwar sadat had offered israel a territorial settlement in 1971 and 
drew parallels between those days and today 
before the yom kippur war israel did not agree to withdraw 
from the suez canal and that was not the only instance which 
showed that israel knows how to compromiseonly after paying the 
price for the stubborness which preceded it we always come to the 
right conclusions too late

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
lost ground among voters when he wore army gear and rode around in 
a tank a week ago according to a new poll 
a national telephone survey of 1002 registered voters last 
friday through sunday found that 25 percent said they were less 
likely to vote for dukakis based on what they had seen or heard 
about the tank ride 
seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for 
dukakis more than 60 percent said that they had not seen or read 
anything about it or that it had no impact on how they would vote 
dukakis donned a military helmet and jump suit last tuesday and 
took a spin in a 60ton m1 tank as part of an effort to counter 
republican portrayals of him as weak on defense 
the poll taken for the boston herald and wbztv of boston had 
a 3 percent margin of error

the cockpit from the aloha airlines 
boeing 737 that lost part of its fuselage during a flight between 
two hawaiian islands will be turned into a training simulator an 
official of the company that bought it said 
paul hancock director of marketing for flightsafety 
international said monday that the company which makes flight 
simulators used to train pilots was searching for a 737 cockpit 
when it discovered that the salvaged aloha aircraft was being sold 
we recently launched a program to build a 737 simulator and in 
order to do that we have to duplicate the cockpit of the 
aircraft hancock said that can be done a number of ways but 
if possible we look for a salvage cockpit we heard about this 
cockpit and jumped on a plane to go see 
a section of the upper fuselage of the 19yearold plane tore 
away during an interisland hop april 28 but the pilot managed to 
bring the crippled plane to a safe landing on maui officials said 
it was miraculous that only one person was killed in the accident 
although 69 of the 95 passengers were injured 
during the next two years flightsafety workers will remove 
every piece from the cockpit and refurbish it using the aluminum 
structure as a mold workers will construct a fiberglass shell that 
will eventually be the simulator

a report that termed homelessness a national 
disgrace was watered down and should have contained even stronger 
language and more specific recommendations say members of the 
group that worked on the study for the national academy of sciences 
bruce c vladeck president of the united hospital fund of new 
york and head of the 13member committee that prepared the study 
said the academy refused to include a strong supplemental statement 
the report as it now stands basically was rejected by a 
majority of the committee because they felt it was not strong 
enough vladeck said 
the edited final report did not allow us to express our 
outrage our anger and our dismay at what we studied complained 
phyllis wolfe a panel member and the head of health care for the 
homeless inc in washington 
those who served on the panel were a little disturbed that 
we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the 
homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be 
taken added nathan stark a washington lawyer and panel member 
who joined in signing a sixpage supplemental statement issued by 
vladecks office in new york 
despite the complaints vladeck raised the prospect that the 
material in the supplemental statement actually generated more 
attention by being left out of the official report than if it had 
been included 
faced with a choice of leaving out their strongest comments and 
issuing no report at all the majority chose to permit the academy 
to issue the bulk of the study and then make public their 
supplement independently he explained 
and frankly he added i think we wound up getting more 
publicity than we would have if it was buried in the report 
the supplemental statement called for a restoration of federal 
support for lowincome housing to 1981 levels criticising the 
sharp cuts in these programs in recent years 
it also urged a minimum wage at a level which would make decent 
housing possible in most cities and called for the federal 
government to be the guarantor of last resort in health care 
the way you do away with homelessness is to provide homes 
commented stark a former undersecretary at the department of 
health and human services 
the panelists were concerned that not enough emphasis was put 
on the plight of homelessness in terms of just a statistical 
study stark said 
i think the academy is right in one sense he added they 
want all their reports to be as scientific and objective as 
possible 
but he said once he had visited shelters and met the homeless 
and people who work with them he realized that more was needed in 
this report 
the group felt that the tone was important as well as the 
substance and this was not an issue where one can be comfortable 
being as bland as such reports tend to be said vladeck 
dr frank press former science adviser to president carter and 
head of the independent academy of sciences since 1981 was quoted 
in the new york times as saying the supplementary statement had 
been rejected because it was polemical and emotional 
press office said he was not available tuesday and referred 
calls to the academys institute of medicine which organized the 
study as requested by congress 
at that institute dr fred solomon termed the official report 
strong but said some of the specific recommendations were 
not sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included 
the panel members were appalled at what they saw in their 
research solomon said 
he said academy reviewers agreed with many of the panels 
opinions but felt they needed more detailed economic analyses 
before they could be published officially 
the committee members endorsed the official report and were 
at liberty to release their own statement elsewhere which they 
have just done he added 
the official 242page report portrays a homeless population not 
only of alcoholics and former mental patients but one with growing 
numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal existence in 
rural communities 
it calls children under 18 the fastest growing group among the 
nations homeless and says this is nothing short of a national 
disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a 
situation demands

an endangered species of flying 
squirrels and a virgin stand of red spruce are in the way of a 
developers plan to turn a section of national forest into a 100 
million ski resort 
environmentalists are mounting forces to oppose a proposal by 
laurel creek development corp to build a resort community on the 
north slope of big spruce mountain which overlooks the cranberry 
wilderness area in eastern west virginia 
the developer is negotiating with the us forest service to 
swap another piece of forestland for the big spruce land 
were concerned about the precedent here of swapping really 
pristine land at the call of an outofstate developer said mary 
wimmer conservation chairwoman for the west virginia sierra club 
laurel creek officials joined with gov arch moore last week to 
announce the development which has sold 100 club memberships 
already starting at 15000 each the governor claimed laurel 
creek could create as many as 2300 jobs in four years counting 
spinoff services building lots will cost between 100000 and 
500000 moore said 
but laurel creek does not yet own the heart of its project the 
top of the mountain which has an elevation of 4695 feet without 
it officials said monday the resort would have no long ski runs 
joined with 1000 to 2000 acres of land laurel creek already 
owns the company would create a 2300acre complex with two golf 
courses 32 ski runs seven restaurants lodges cabins and houses 
the mountaintop is a scarce habitat for the northern virginia 
flying squirrel which lives in only a few areas of the state 
the rustcolored palmsized animals roam the woods at night 
gliding among the tree tops the flying squirrels have disappeared 
over most of their us range for unknown reasons but 
environmentalists blame the decline on a loss of habitat 
the squirrels like mature red spruce stands which are 
experiencing problems in the region 
the spruce decline along the whole appalachian corridor is 
very serious it is becoming very scarce wimmer said these 
areas need to be set aside 
she said she also is waiting for the forest service to check the 
mountain for other endangered species including the cheat mountain 
salamander which lives in red spruce forests 
local trout fishermen also are concerned the resort would 
pollute day run a trout stream and in turn hurt the williams 
river and the cranberry river which flows through 
nationallyprotected wilderness areas 
and conservationalists have another problem the way the matter 
has been handled 
while the development was announced publicly last week it was 
revealed that the corporation began talking privately with the 
forest service a year ago a land swap 
we feel theres been way too much work done without local 
input on this wimmer said 
richard trochlil of the forest service office in elkins said 
laurel creek had made no firm trade offers to be acceptable the 
land must match big spruces stands of red spruce he said 
he said there was no available figure on how much of the 
mountain would be cut for ski slopes 
he said the mountain is not a wilderness area and that three to 
four forest servicesupervised logging operations already are 
cutting trees in the national forest 
laurel creek officials did not return repeated telephone 
messages left this week

a woman and her daughter pleaded innocent to 
charges they tried to hire a hit man to kill their exhusbands in 
alleged schemes that prosecutors say each woman undertook without 
the others knowledge 
municipal court judge nicholas kasimatas set bail at 50000 for 
judith lynette east 45 of paradise hills and at 30000 for her 
daughter venise lynette morris 27 of la mesa 
they apparently were not working together in the solicitation 
for murder deputy district attorney robert eichler said 
police say criminalintelligence unit investigators heard that 
each woman was looking for a hit man so an undercover officer 
telephoned each separately 
east allegedly offered the officer 10000 to kill her husband 
saying she would pay for it from his insurance policy worth about 
100000 eichler said morris gave the officer a 1000 personal 
check as a down payment on a 5000 fee to kill her exhusband he 
said 
miss morris exhusband was accused of molesting her young 
daughter which was the alleged motive in that case its very 
clear that both defendants together fabricated evidence in that 
alleged molestation case eichler said 
the solicitation charge carries a maximum prison term of six 
years while a conspiracy charge could mean life in prison 
kasimatis scheduled a preliminary hearing oct 3

building on decades of good ties 
with iran west germany is seeking a greater business and 
diplomatic role in the country now that a ceasefire has been 
declared in the iraniraq war 
west german optimism toward iran which sends its students to 
be educated in germany and buys more goods from this country than 
any other grew after the recent release of west german hostage 
rudolf cordes from his proiranian lebanese kidnappers on sept 12 
 
germans have long felt what one expert calls a postromantic 
interest in iran a sector of the west german popular press 
provides constant coverage of the doings of soraya bakhtiary once 
married to the shah of iran 
unlike the united states and other countries that broke off or 
curtailed ties with iran after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini came to 
power in 1979 west germany kept its relations active 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher credited those contacts 
with success in gaining the release of cordes and promised to use 
that goodwill to try to win freedom for other western hostages in 
lebanon held by proiranian kidnappers 
since the time of the german kaisers at the end of the 19th 
century there have been good relations politically economically 
and culturally with iran said dieter vogel the economics 
ministry spokesman in bonn 
less than two days after cordes release the economics ministry 
announced that its no 2 official dieter von wuerzen was heading 
to tehran for a fourday visit to explore further business 
possibilities 
but the announcement was just a coincidence vogel said in 
an interview with the associated press adding that the trip had 
been planned in advance 
west german companies have a good chance of taking part in 
construction and reconstruction projects after the war with iraq 
vogel said 
the welt am sonntag newspaper cited the middle east economic 
survey as saying reconstruction contracts for iran could total 50 
billion 
when the weapons in the persian gulf went silent german 
businessmen began to make their calculations the newspaper added 
vogel cautioned that irans hard currency shortage would make 
foreign payments difficult 
he said west germans respect iranians as trading partners 
despite the countrys radical and sometimes fanatic image 
despite a trading decline due to the iraniraq war iran 
continues to import more goods from west germany than from any 
other country according to the west german economics ministry 
in 1987 west germany sold 15 billion of goods to iran 
including motor vehicles heavy machinery and electronic products 
west germany also imported 500 million worth of goods from iran 
while west german law strictly forbids the shipment of weapons 
to areas of conflict there are occasional reports of such material

an improving trade deficit helped economic 
growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the farm belt 
drought but inflation was more severe than previously believed 
the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of the nations 4 trillion economy grew at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 30 percent in the apriljune 
period that was slower than the 34 percent expansion rate in the 
first quarter but still brisk 
if not for the drought secondquarter growth would have been a 
more robust 39 percent crop and livestock losses for the year are 
estimated at 139 billion and will be even more of a drag on the 
economy in the third and fourth quarters 
the government said accelerating inflation accompanied the 
strong growth one price measure tied to the gnp rose at the 
fastest pace in nearly six years and was more than triple the 
firstquarter rate 
however you measure inflation we got more of it than we 
thought in the second quarter and thats bad news for the financial 
markets said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer in new york 
reacting to the report the bond market opened weak in light 
trading 
the gnp deflator which reflects changes in buying patterns as 
well as prices rose at an annual rate of 55 percent in the second 
quarter compared with 17 percent in the first quarter it was the 
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982 
the secondquarter deflator had been estimated a month earlier 
at a somewhat more moderate 51 percent also the previous report 
had showed stronger secondquarter growth 33 percent instead of 
30 percent 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called tuesdays 
report good news the facts plus the moderating growth rate 
point to inflation remaining under control he said 
jones said the acceleration in inflation after nearly six years 
of economic growth is while troublesome more moderate than in 
previous expansions 
all in all were going to sail into the election in pretty 
good shape he said the general thrust of the economy i would 
think favors the republicans growth is strong but not too 
strong theres some inflation but not as much as there could be 
the federal reserve board concerned with signs of overheating 
in the economy began an inflationfighting program in late march 
by pushing up shortterm interest rates its goal is to curb demand 
and slow economic growth to a level that can be maintained without 
significant inflation 
analysts differ over whether the economy in the quarter ending 
this month is responding some pointing to an upturn in 
unemployment and a slight drop in retail sales last month say 
growth is moderating others see the august figures as more of a 
pause than a trend 
michael k evans head of a private forecasting firm in 
washington said higher interest rates are helping to curb spending 
by consumers who have adjustable rate mortgages and other 
fluctuating loans 
meanwhile he said growth in exports is slowing from 
unsustainably high levels and by next year will be hurt by the 
partial recovery in the value of the dollar this year 
i think we can pretty much say the export boom is coming to an 
end he said 
however bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch in new 
york said investment spending and exports will remain strong 
while consumer spending will remain about the same 
any actual moderation is still in the future he said 
the government attributed its downward revision in the 
secondquarter growth to slightly less expansion than first 
believed in exports and business investment 
exports of goods and services expanded at a 91 percent annual 
rate compared with the previous estimate of 116 percent 
business investment spending shot up 150 percent compared with 
last months estimate of 163 percent 
however consumer spending which represents about twothirds of 
all economic activity was up 30 percent at an annual rate 
compared with the slightly weaker 27 percent previously announced 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual level of 399 trillion in the second quarter 291 
billion higher than the januarymarch period 
in another report the commerce department said that aftertax 
profits by corporations surged 89 percent in the second quarter to 
an annual rate of 1627 billion up from a 25 percent annual rate 
in the first quarter it was the most profitable quarter since the 
julyseptember period of 1983

a church will no longer allow a group of 
american indians to use its property for a powwow because the 
pastor says the event unleashes spiritual forces that are 
antichrist 
in a letter to the powwow organizers david r powell pastor of 
the evangel assembly of god wrote we believe that there is a 
polarity of spiritual belief between us that is irreconcilable 
the group had held the powwow at the church for the last two 
years 
the letter said the church believes it permitted some 
spiritual forces that are antichrist and antiyahweh to operate on 
our facility during the days of the powwow the letter was not 
more specific 
a secretary at the evangel assembly of god said tuesday the 
pastor would not comment further 
the churchs decision had nothing to do with you as a nation 
or race of people or a reflection of your personal or corporate 
conduct or courtesy powell told the american indians 
powwow organizers said they were puzzled and saddened 
its a complete misunderstanding of our culture said jim 
roaix sr of naugatuck editor of the eagle an indianaffairs 
newspaper published by eagle wing press eagle wing is a cosponsor 
of the powwow 
more than 95 percent of american indians are christians roaix

groups still operating on an 18thcentury type of attitude said 
patricia benedict executive director of american indians for 
development of meriden the other sponsor 
powwows are basically social events benedict said 
karen cooper editorial writer at the eagle said tuesday the 
powwow also educated people about the indian culture its like

carcasses of 73 wild horses have been 
discovered in an isolated section of central nevada and authorities 
believe they were gunned down a bureau of land management 
spokesman said tuesday 
federal investigators were tipped by a person who was questioned 
about an earlier rifle slaughter of 44 horses the two sites are 30 
miles apart 
bob stewart bureau spokesman said a helicopter crew monday 
identified 73 piles of bones and other evidence 
the spokesman said ground crews were headed into the remote area 
to verify the cause of death of the horses but the evidence so far 
leads us to believe they were shot 
he said the carcasses and bones of the horses were strewn along 
an area one to two miles wide and about eight miles long 
apparently gunned down over a sixmonth period starting about one 
year ago 
stewart said the person who led investigators to the grisly 
discovery isnt being identified he also declined to comment on 
whether there are any firm leads in either of the horse slaughters 
he said local authorities the us attorney and the fbi have 
been notified about the latest case and land management employees 
have been told to increase their looking and try to spot any 
similar tragedies 
stewart said the carcasses werent spotted immediately because 
crews who fly the area making horse counts fly at higher 
elevations and watch for dust clouds and movement 
he said the maximum penalty for shooting a wild horse is a fine 
of 2000 and a year in prison for each killing 
more than 38000 wild horses now run the open range of 10 
western states up from about 17000 when congress in 1971 made it 
a crime to harrass or kill wild horses on public lands nevada has 
up to 28000 wild horses according to estimates 
at the turn of the century there were some 2 million wild horses 
in the west but they were relentlessly hunted by cowboys and 
mustangers in trucks and airplanes the animals were 
slaughtered for pet food and glue

dozens of people were snookered by a bogus 
classified ad and showed up at a pier tuesday for a nonexistent 
automobile auction of 600 cars audis to mercedes for 50 to 
700 
the situation is frought with humor and everybody was joking 
about it said victor ross spokesman for the city department of 
transportation the agency responsible for disposing of towed and 
confiscated vehicles that are not claimed 
by noon nearly 70 people had arrived at the pier including a 
couple from philadelphia clutching about 5000 in their fists 
ross said they figured they could pick up five audis at a 1000 
each sell them at 2000 and double their money i dont know how 
they planned to drive five cars back 
the ad which appeared in the new york times classified section 
monday said a onceayear liquidation auction would be held 
tuesday at pier 76 in manhattan by the new york city parking 
authority 
there is no such authority and while pier 76 is where impounded 
and confiscated cars are stored auctions are held every friday at 
pier 24 there is no annual clearance sale 
ross said about 400 cars are auctioned by the city each month 
either cars that have been towed away because the motorist 
disobeyed parking regulations or cars confiscated from scofflaws 
the ad was placed by someone claiming to be neil rosen of the 
department of transportation who ordered the 40390 bill sent to 
the department 
with the millions of ads that we run this occasionally 
happens said times spokeswoman nancy nielsen well do 
everything we can to straighten this out with the city

dont start up the band just yet the 
purdy school board says it will appeal a judges order that it 
allow schoolsponsored dancing 
the school board also has asked that the judge stay his order 
pending their appeal 
us district judge russell clark ruled aug 1 that purdy high 
schools centuryold dance ban was unconstitutional because it 
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious 
reasons 
clark later awarded the 21 purdy students and their parents who 
began lobbying for a dance two years ago 1 in damages all they 
requested and nearly 80000 in attorney fees 
but school board officials in announcing late monday that they 
would appeal insisted the ban was not religiously grounded 
in a statement schools superintendent sheldon buxton cited 
concerns about policing and paying for schoolsponsored dancing 
that board members say led them to support the ban 
william fleischaker the joplin attorney who represented the 
prodancers said tuesday that he would advise the students to 
contine with plans for a dance by asking the school boards 
permission to hold on 
i expect that we will have a formal request here fairly 
quickly fleischaker said

a prosecutor whose boss complained 
her short skirts made her look like a manhunting bimbo has 
been fired after lodging a complaint against him with the county 
human rights commission 
brenda taylor a broward county assistant state attorney had 
refused to trade her designer blouses and tightfitting skirts for 
more conservative atire despite memos from her supervisor john 
countryman 
im a little embarrassed for the state attorneys office 
ms taylors attorney harris lowenthal said after mondays 
firing i think theyve stepped into a hole and now theyre 
digging it deeper 
ms taylor on monday received a dismissal letter charging she 
had mishandled drunkendriving cases was frequently absent or 
tardy from court and failed to complete paperwork 
this is garbage said ms taylor 25 it just shows to 
what lengths they will go to get someone ive never been a 
crusader before but it was my neck on the line and i had to do 
something 
ms taylor said her firing came in direct response to the 
complaint she filed against countryman last month charging him 
with discriminating against her no hearing date was set 
countrymans problems with ms taylor were spelled out in five 
memos and in mondays termination letter 
i told her that ts the republican to soften his stance once the 
election is over 
i would hope after nov 8 he would take a closer look 
strauss said certainly former treasury secretary james baker 
one of his principal economic advisers knows we have to so 
something about the deficit 
strauss a former chairman of the democratic national committee 
and former us trade representative who has gained a reputation as 
a skilled negotiator called the national economic commission the 
toughest job he has ever faced he put the chance of success at 
about 70 percent 
strauss told reporters after his appearance that the commission 
is examining the possibility of separating the social security 
funds from general revenues after the budget is balanced critics 
have charged that it is wrong to use current surpluses in social 
security to lower the overall budget deficit since that means the 
money will not be earmarked specifically for retirement benefits 
when baby boomers begin retiring in the early part of the next 
century 
stauss said the panel is examining boosting taxes on cigarettes 
and alcohol and other consumption taxes as preferable to raising 
individual income tax rates 
strauss said the panel probably will make some recommendations 
on reforming the budget process examining such issues as whether a 
twoyear budget would improve congress ability to meet deadlines 
and whether a lineitem veto or a constitutional amendment to 
balance the budget should be adopted 
the 12member commission appointed by president reagan and 
congressional leaders is split evenly between democrats and 
republicans other members include chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca aflcio president lane kirkland and former defense 
secretary casper weinberger

the city council banned use of a police 
videotape on drugtrafficking gangs after black leaders complained 
a profile of gang members promoted racist stereotypes 
the council on monday also agreed to establish a task force to 
plan with police strategies for keeping gangs out of spokane and 
unanimously approved a resolution condemning a recent series of 
racially motivated assaults and vandalism 
police chief terry mangan who had been ordered by city manager 
terry novak to stay away from the meeting to avoid confrontations 
defended the videotape 
we support the task forces efforts and hope it will be 
successful mangan said i just hope this delay this possible 
change of direction does not work to the advantage of drug gangs 
that would be a real tragedy 
a group of black leaders said the videotape which depicts gang 
activity in other cities unfairly blames black youths for the drug 
problem and has caused a backlash by police and racist groups 
the tape had been shown to school and civic groups and on a city 
cable television station 
it is one of the most racist pieces of propaganda i have ever 
seen said jerry harvey a spokane school district employee if 
there had been proper input and consultation this tape would have 
never gone out 
the bad guys come in all colors and wear all kinds of hats 
said carl boston president of the spokane chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
police have repeatedly stopped black youths for minor offenses 
sometimes with guns drawn the black leaders complained 
we think its undue harassment said the rev ezra kinlow 
the police department is there to protect us but we do feel they 
are overreacting 
mangan said the videotape was prepared mostly from network 
documentaries and based on the best advice we were able to obtain 
from a number of cities which have gone through what we are just 
starting to go through 
the task force will be comprised of five black people chosen by 
mayor vicki mcneill two members of the interstate task force on 
human relations and council members sheri barnard and joel crosby

marilyn quayle on tuesday characterized as 
totally insulting speculation that republican nominee george 
bush selected her husband as his running mate because dan quayles 
good looks might attract female voters 
george bush wouldnt have selected someone who could not stand 
in his stead for president she told reporters during her first 
solo campaign tour 
mrs quayle said her husband has established a reputation as an 
expert on defense and arms control issues as a 12year senate 
veteran and has met with many foreign leaders 
the women of indiana have elected him and its certainly not 
because of his looks she said 
during a series of brief interviews with local television 
reporters mrs quayle blamed the media for the controversy 
surrounding the gop vice presidential candidates academic 
performance and military service 
hes never been a person who kowtowed to the media stroked 
them had them in our home she said the washington media 
elite didnt know him and they were struck off guard 
in an earlier interview with abctvs barbara walters mrs 
quayle said the media is overwhelmingly liberal and was pursuing 
her husband because he is conservative 
mrs quayle who met her husband in 1972 when both were 
attending night classes at indiana university law school is 
considered one of the stronger assets of her husbands campaign and 
his most trusted adviser 
a senior campaign official said that in recognition of her 
campaign skills she has been asked to travel independently on 
behalf of the gop ticket she will join the indiana senator for one 
or two days each week 
mrs quayle 39is a practiced campaigner who often pulls her 
husband away from reporters when he begins to respond to impromptu 
questions and tends to make misstatements or garble his words 
she insists she is not trying to protect him but is 
reminding him to cut his conversation short and keep up with his 
campaign schedule 
quayle 41 told one news conferent that his wife is my best 
adviser my strongest supporter the person that i love more than 
anybody else in this world he called her a very strong 
independentminded woman with whom he has a very close 
relationship

never one to mince words kitty dukakis 
has been particularly outspoken at times when questioned about her 
jewish faith or world events affecting the jewish state of israel 
she was quick to express her outrage when pope john paul ii 
embraced austrian president kurt waldheim who was accused of 
complicity in nazi war crimes 
on the other hand she hasnt been afraid to criticize israeli 
efforts to force soviet jews to emigrate to israel instead of the 
united states 
most recently she spoke forcefully when asked about the 
resignations of a handful of volunteers and a ranking george bush 
adviser who were mentioned in allegations of antijewish 
activities one volunteer who resigned had praised a researcher who 
has denied the existence of the holocaust during world war ii 
for anyone to suggest the holocaust was a hoax is very 
painful mrs dukakis said six million jews and millions of 
others lost their lives one has to wonder why these people 
were attracted and recruited to the campaign of my husbands 
opponent 
the prospect of being the nations first jewish first lady is 
not lost on katharine dickson dukakis the wife of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
she returned to brookline on tuesday afternoon from a trip to 
rhode island so she could spend the holiest of jewish holidays yom 
kippur at home she was attending temple israel in brookline 
tuesday night before returning home for the traditional fast 
she has been an active and aggressive campaigner for her husband 
and referred to her faith frequently during appearances before the 
primary in new york where jews are an important voting bloc she 
traces her vigorous lobbying on behalf of refugees from around the 
world to the lessons of the holocaust 
i feel a great deal of pride in my ethnic and religious 
background mrs dukakis leaning back in her chair and breaking 
into a broad smile said in a recent interview at her home 
she said at the outset of the campaign she feared she would 
encounter antisemitism but has said since that that hasnt 
happened but both she and her greek orthodox husband have been 
criticized by conservatives for their interfaith marriage 
james jatras an aide to sen william l armstrong rcolo 
circulated a letter in may denouncing dukakis for his marriage to a 
nonchristian and said dukakis was therefore not a christian in 
good standing mrs dukakis also was targeted by a conservative 
columnist who questioned her commitment to judaism by citing her 
marriage to a nonjew 
the dukakises have said little about either incident choosing 
to ignore instead of publicize them their children john born 
during mrs dukakis first marriage and daughters andrea and kara 
observe the holidays of both the jewish and greek orthodox faiths 
with their parents 
but in other public statements mrs dukakis has said she is 
fiercely proud of her faith and also has promised to host a 
passover seder in the white house if her husband is elected 
president 
mrs dukakis is the daughter of harry ellis dickson associate 
conductor of the boston pops orchestra and the late jane goldberg 
dickson who met her future husband when both were studying music 
and the arts in berlin prior to world war ii 
they left germany as hitler was coming to power while she was 
raised in a jewish home in a predominantly jewish community mrs 
dukakis has said she did not come to fully appreciate her heritage 
until a 1976 visit to israel and the holocaust memorial yad vashem 
in jerusalem 
that visit changed everthing for me she recently told 
haolam hazeh a jewish weekly newspaper i was brought up on this 
memory but i dont think i understood the full significance until i 
visited yad vashem 
mrs dukakis was a member of a presidential commission on the 
holocaust until 1986 when president reagan declined to appoint her

the central intelligence agency has planted 
operatives in nicaragua who seek to stir up public protests in an 
effort to provoke the leftist sandinista government into 
overreacting house speaker jim wright said today 
we have received clear testimony from cia people that they 
have deliberately done things to provoke an overreaction on the 
part of the government in nicaragua wright told reporters in 
answer to a question 
in a subsequent interview wright said agency personnel under 
questioning from members of congress said they had sought to 
generate vigorous demonstrations agents of our government have 
assisted in organizing the kinds of antigovernment demonstrations 
that have been calculated to stimulate and provoke arrests 
cia spokeswoman sharon basso declined to confirm or deny 
wrights information we do brief congress but wouldnt discuss 
that publicly she said 
wright said he did not know whether the us provocations were 
behind a july 10 demonstration at nandaime south of managua that 
resulted in some 40 arrests the antisandininsta contra rebels are 
asking for release of those prisoners as a gesture of good faith 
before resuming highlevel peace talks with the government 
but he said it is unmistakable that the cia has been behind 
some of the public unrest that has led to government crackdowns on 
the opposition and worsened the atmosphere for faltering peace 
discussions between the two sides 
it has been foolish of the sandinistas to respond to those 
provocations wright said referring to the shutting down of 
opposition media outlets like the newspaper la prensa and radio 
catolica a churchrun radio station 
ive made that unmistakably clear to people in nicaragua they 
have to demonstrate their commitment to the democratization they 
have announced in earlier peace agreements he said 
but wright also condemned the us interference i do not 
believe it is the proper role of our government to try to provoke 
riots or deliberately to try to antagonize governing officials 
into foolish overreactions he said 
we should be using the influence of the united states to 
encourage the peace process not discourage it 
the two sides broke off talks on monday in guatemala city after 
failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations and 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega accused the rebels of seeking to 
avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new us military aid

vice president george bush campaigned in 
a flag factory tuesday and declared my friends flag sales are 
doing well and america is doing well 
bush who has sought to turn the pledge of allegiance to the 
flag into an election issue toured the annin flag co and then 
spoke at a rally outside talking about patriotism as well as 
stressing what he said were economic accomplishments of the reagan 
administration 
the republican presidential nominee reiterated his contention 
that democratic opponent michael dukakis had raised taxes several 
times as governor of massachusetts and i believe he will raise them 
again if you elect him president 
americans have a new economic power and im not going to let 
them take that away from you he said with a huge american flag 
as a backdrop 
the flags you make fly over an america that today is stronger 
and more prosperous than at any time in its proud history bush 
told a group of several hundred people many of them employees of 
the plant 
inside he chatted with workers at sewing machines and at one 
point he pushed a foot pedal attached to a machine that cut cloth 
bush has cited the small factory in speeches around the country 
noting that its sales had been up since reagan and he took office 
in 1981 
he joked that he and dukakis whose rallies also prominently 
feature american flags were responsible for only half of the 
purchases of 37000 flags the plant manufactures each week 
the company is the nations largest flag maker 
bush returned to washington to swear in lauro cavazos a fellow 
texan as the secretary of education 
hispanic leaders have questioned the timing of reagans decision 
to nominate cavazos in the waning months of his administration 
bush had said he would appoint hispanics to his cabinet and 
critics suggest reagan speeded the process to help bushs candidacy 
in texas and other states with high hispanic populations 
bush is spending most of his time this week preparing for 
sundays nationally televised debate with dukakis 
bush is reviewing issues and possible questions with top aides 
and policy advisers and later in the week will engage in mock 
debates with former deputy treasury secretary richard g darman 
aides have said 
asked by reporters how bushs debate preparation was going 
campaign political director richard bond said diligent 
you want to avoid costly mistakes and you want to come across 
as presidential bond said 
in his flag speech bushs amplified voice easily drowned out 
the shouts of a few dozen protesters two of whom were carrying 
signs that said patriotism is the last refuge of a scroundrel 
samuel johnson 
also craig livingston a lawyer representing the united 
textiles workers of america passed out copies of a statement 
accusing the administration of a donothing trade policy that 
resulted in layoffs of thousands of our sisters and brothers in 
industry 
livingston told reporters that textile workers are among the 
poorest paid of all workers and that the average wage of those in 
the annin flag plant was between 4 and 5 an hour 
company president randy beard who introduced bush said that 
never has flag demand been as strong as in these past five to six 
years i dont know why it happened but it happened during the 
reaganbush watch 
in his speech bush accused dukakis of accentuating only 
negative economic statistics i would hate to try to win the 
presidency by being so negative he said 
on this day he spared dukakis from some of the attacks that he 
himself has made in recent campaign appearances 
bush has made much of the pledge of allegiance issue in his 
campaign attacking dukakis for vetoing massachusetts legislation 
to require public school teachers to lead their classes in saying 
the pledge however he did not raise that issue in tuesdays 
speech 
bond the political director said new jersey is one of nine 
states the campaign views as crucial battlegrounds in the fall 
election 
the others are california ohio pennsylvania illinois 
missouri texas michigan and wisconsin bond said 
none of them are out of reach for either candidate these are 
the states that are going to get an awful lot of attention he 
said 
bush after his speech stopped at the glenwood diner a few 
blocks away ordered a cup of coffee and a piece of crumb cake and 
bantered with patrons 
several women in the diner told bush he looked better in person 
than on television he asked them why they thought so 
because youre relaxed suggested lucie galioto who said 
she had stopped by the diner with friends on the way home from a 
senior citizens exercise class this way everything is 
spontaneous she added 
you may have something there the vice president said with 
his nationally televised debate with dukakis less than a week away 
bush said he would have to work on appearing more relaxed in front 
of the cameras

international agreements to preserve the 
earths protective ozone layer should cover two industrial solvents 
outside the current treaty an environmental group said tuesday 
the solvents methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride can 
also liberate chlorine that destroys ozone high in the 
stratosphere just as the betterknown chlorofluorocarbon or cfc 
compounds do said the environmental policy institute in a study of 
the ozone problem 
arjun makhijani an engineer and consultant who was principal 
author of the study said methyl chloroform the most common 
industrial solvent probably accounts for onequarter of current 
ozone destruction 
the halogenated solvents industry alliance principal trade 
association of manufacturers and major users of solvents containing 
chlorine said it believed the institute had relied on outdated 
science and had overstated the potency of the two solvents 
steve seidel an ozone expert at the environmental protection 
agency said very little carbon tetrachloride is escaping to the 
atmosphere and methyl chloroform is a definitely second tier 
source of ozone destruction 
about 124000 tons of methyl chloroform are used worldwide each 
year the institute said us use for such tasks as degreasing 
metal in the auto industry is about 35 percent of that total 
some 227000 tons of carbon tetrachloride are used each year 80 
percent of it as a raw material for production of 
chlorofluorocarbon compounds analysts including makijani agree 
that production will decline as cfc production drops under the 1987 
treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998 
methyl chloroform stays in the atmosphere only nine or 10 years 
on average before breaking down said makhijani so short a 
lifetime means 80 percent of methyl chloroform never gets to the 
stratosphere but because theres so much of it the 30 percent 
that reaches the stratosphere is more destructive than cfc113 
one of the solvents regulated by the treaty he said 
because the lifetime is so short reductions in emissions would 
mean an early decline in atmospheric chlorine he said the cfc 
compounds can last more than a century and the atmospheric backlog 
plus all that has accumulated in earthbound products such as 
refrigerators means the effects of production cuts will be a long 
time showing an effect 
we have a few problems with the numbers they used this 
morning said tom cortina spokesman for the industry group 
five to 10 percent is probably a more accurate estimate of 
ozone destruction from methyl chloroform 
controls are not needed on either solvent but if they are 
they should be based on international agreement said fellow 
spokesman steve risotto 
seidel of epa said the agency estimated that methyl chloroform 
was only about 10 percent as destructive of ozone as the most 
powerful cfc compound

police stepped up patrols near the home of 
rep mike espy on tuesday after the black congressman expressed 
concern for his family in the wake of vandalism at his home that 
included racial slurs 
im the congressman not my wife my brother or my children 
espy said as he cleaned paint poured on an entranceway floor at 
his home in suburban madison i can defend myself but i want them 
to leave my family out of it 
espy said his wife returned to home late monday to find a racial 
slur on doors in the entranceway he said the words at the top of 
each door appeared to have been scratched into the wood by a 
pencil or a pen without ink they had started the words us con 
on one door but it appeared the point of what they were using had 
broken 
madison police chief jimmy dukes said he sent officers to the 
house and of course we are going to have extra patrols in that 
area that goes without saying dukes said 
sure it makes you angry espy said weve come a long way 
in mississippi but cases like this remind you how far weve got to 
go 
espy a democrat and the states first black congressman since 
reconstruction is being challenged in the november election by 
white republican jack coleman espy has been leading polls in the 
district his brother has been his campaign manager 
espy said he would immediately return to the campaign but was 
concerned for his family 
my son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and i had to explain to them 
the history of race relations in mississippi he said referring 
to the scratched epithet he said i had to tell my children what 
that meant and why somebody would do that it was not an easy thing 
to do 
espy said plants in the entryway had been uprooted and paint 
dashed on some of the plants 
something like this should not be a part of the american 
political process said coleman contacted by telephone as he 
headed to belzoni for a day of campaigning we should talk about 
the issues and beat each other on top of the head with those 
i cant imagine any of my people doing that coleman said 
who knows why someone would do something like this it may not 
have had anything to do with politics but no matter why it was 
done it was totally wrong and i regret to see it 
espy 34 said he had received threatening calls in the past 
but you always expect those there has not been an increase in 
those calls and this is the first time something like this has 
happened 
i think most mississippians would be upset to hear something 
like this has happened but we all realize there are still some 
ignorant people running around he said

the reagan years have been great for the 
flag business says a member of the family that owns the nations 
largest flagmaking company 
the flag market usually has ups and downs but its been a 
steady incline since the reagan administration came aboard said 
c lee beard vice presidant of annin amp co 
the fourthgeneration coowner and his brother randolph opened 
one of their new jursey factories tuesday to vice president george 
bush who has mentioned the company often in contending that the 
administration has revived patriotic fervor 
my friends flag sales are doing well and america is doing 
well bush said in front of a crowd of about 250 many of them 
annin employees in a flagwaving rally across the street from the 
old brick factory 
c lee beard whose brother joined bush on the rostrum said the 
company has enjoyed a sales increase of roughly 25 percent in the 
reagan years annin is one of a handful of major companies making 
the stars and stripes 
beard said he could not provide exact sales figures 
he credited reagan for the steady growth of his company which 
has expanded from three to five plants during reagans term 
i think his patriotism has stirred flag sales beard said 
hes increased pride in america 
while annin has supplied flags for inaugurations the apollo 11 
moon flight the united nations and the armed forces everyday 
citizens still account for the bulk of sales beard said 
he said the bloomfield factory each week makes about 30000 of 
the small flags that have lately become common fare at patriotic 
celebrations 
in addition about 7000 to 10000 of the 3by5foot flags 
commonly displayed by homeowners are produced each week at the 
factory where women operate machines by hand starting at minimum 
wage 
in another flaginterest indicator the federal government last 
year satisfied more than 109000 requests to briefly fly flags over 
the nations capitol and then ship them to people 
the requests numbered just 43011 in 1979 a clerk said 
while reagan deserves credit for the sales trend beard said 
this years unusually strong september might also have something to 
do with bushs campaign 
labor day usually marks a fast drop in flag buying but demand 
has held steady in 1988 beard said 
the company found out about bushs visit about a week ago and 
quickly arranged five buses to haul in employees from its three 
other new jersey locations beard said annin also has a plant in 
ohio 
despite the good business of recent years beard said hes 
spotted a lesswelcome trend an influx of the redwhiteandblue 
from factories in korea hong kong and taiwan 
those countries lower labor costs enable them to sell flags at 
a lower price and american producers are starting to feel the 
pinch beard said

the house approved steppedup pesticide 
regulation tuesday voting to set an accelerated eightyear 
deadline for completion of safety reviews of hundreds of chemicals 
used by farmers to protect crops 
the measure approved and sent to the senate on a voice vote 
amounts to a barebones bill without groundwaterprotection and 
other contoversial features urged by environmentalists 
this is the art of the possible this will not satisfy hardly 
anyone but this is what we can do at this point house 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
said in urging approval he said lawmakers could return to the 
tougher issues in the future 
the bill calls for completion of hundreds of safety reviews by 
the environmental protection agency within eight years the process 
is designed to end use of the most hazardous chemicals and limit 
utilization of others that present health dangers 
the reviews have been in progress since the mid1970s but 
without a deadline the general accounting office estimates that at 
the current pace of about two dozen a year the task would not be 
completed until 2024 
the bill would largely end indemnities to pesticide makers whose 
products have been ordered off the market for safety reasons thus 
far the epa has been forced to pay 20 million to buy up supplies 
of banned pesticides 
provisions of the bill call for fees paid by manufacturers 
ranging from 50000 to 150000 to finance the reviews the 
industry and the agency would share the cost of storage and 
disposal under the measure which would reauthorize for three years 
the 1947 federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 
environmentalists say the epa has been dragging its feet on the 
safety reviews because it lacks the money to pay the indemnities 
the act has been due for reauthorization since 1983 but 
squabbling among environmentalists labor and the farm lobby have 
frozen action 
we have had difficulty in times past in trying to make this 
happen rep tony coelho dcalif told the house 
farmers have been highly suspicious of legislation they fear 
would ban or raise the cost of pesticides which arose out of world 
war ii chemical warfare research and now represent a fundamental 
element of us agriculture 
certainly with regard to agriculture the efficient and 
judicious use of pesticides is crucial to the safety of the food 
supply that we enjoy today declared rep fred grandy riowa 
government research however has shown that some pesticides can 
cause cancer and other severe health problems environmentalists 
have been calling for tighter regulation since 1962 when naturalist 
rachel carson spotlighted the problem in her bestselling silent 
spring 
most environmentalists have been saying the current bill is 
better than nothing or at least would not make the situation 
worse but they point to a lack of any component that would step up 
monitoring of groundwater which provides the basic drinking supply 
for half of all americans 
a report issued last week by the us public interest research 
group an organization founded by ralph nader said a search of epa 
records showed that 73 pesticides have been found in groundwater in 
34 states 
moreover some environmental groups were opposed to the 
legislation 
were not willing to put pesticide regulation on the back 
burner for three to four years said jay feldman of the national 
coalition against the misuse of pesticides thats not any kind 
of message to be sending out across the country to people who are 
facing chemicals in their drinking water chemicals in their 
workplace and chemicals in their food

the five new cabinet ministers approved 
by irans parliament tuesday include an exguerrilla who fought 
against the shah a former student who occupied the us embassy in 
tehran and two ministers with graduate degrees from american 
universities 
tehran radio said the 270seat majlis or parliament rejected a 
sixth appointee the prospective minister of commerce majid 
hedayatzadeh in the second vote of confidence in prime minister 
hussein musavis government in eight days

rafsanjanis deputy for operations and information at military 
command headquarters irna said 
shamkhani takes over from mohsen rafiqdoust the victim of a 
noconfidence vote in the first parliament session on sept 12 
that session was held amid criticism of the revolutionary guards 
blamed for several battlefield defeats that led tehran to accept a 
ceasefire in the persian gulf war in july 
the radio said hedayatzadeh could not muster the necessary 
votes with only 94 deputies supporting him 
no one was given that portfolio in the first cabinet musavi 
presented it was not clear if the majlis objected to 
hedayatzadehs credentials or to the post itself 
in the previous round the ministers of agriculture and 
education were rejected on tuesday issa kalantari was installed 
as agriculture minister and mohammed ali najafi as minister of

against shah mohammed reza pahlavi before the 1979 revolution that 
brought ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to power 
shamkhani commanded the revolutionary guards along the southern 
front after the gulf war started in 1980 and later rose to the post 
of deputy commander of the guards irna said two of his brothers 
mohammad and hamid died in the war 
an iranian political analyst speaking in nicosia on condition 
of anonymity said shamkhani was at one point entrusted with 
chasing dissidents opposed to khomeinis fundamentalist regime 
known as the mujahedeen khalq 
irna said forouzesh 33 was one of the students who took over 
the american embassy in november 1979 the report did not say 
whether he was involved in keeping us officials hostage for 444 
days 
kalantari 36 has a doctorate in agriculture from iowa 
university and a masters degree from the university of nebraska 
his brother mousa then minister of roads and transportation died 
in a 1981 bomb blast that killed numerous top officials irna said 
najafi 37 has a masters degree in mathematics from the 
massachusetts institute of technology irna said since 1984 he has 
worked as head of training at the islamic republic of iran

resumption of suspended negotiations on the 
future of us military bases in greece could depend on the greek 
foreign ministers planned talks here wednesday with secretary of 
state george shultz a senior shultz aide said tuesday 
foreign minister carolas papoulias is scheduled to meet and 
lunch with shultz in his capacity as current representative of the 
european common market but usgreek relations also will be 
covered assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway told a 
congressional panel 
negotiations in athens on american military bases were suspended

the greek position that was identified as a demand for us forces 
to vacate hellenikon air base at athens international airport ms 
ridgway said 
resumption was tentatively scheduled for october but the date 
is undecided and whether it takes place depends partly on talks 
with papoulias she told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
european and middle eastern affairs 
the disposition of hellenikon will have to be resolved how 
it is going to be dealt with affects the whole negotiations she 
said 
ms ridgway did not disclose the us response to the demand for 
its planes to leavehellenikon she said in answer to a question 
that if agreement cannot be reached we have procedures for 
leaving but we are not at any stage of starting that at this 
time 
subcommittee chairman lee hamilton asked if the illness of prime 
minister andreas papandreou reported to be facing heart surgery 
would affect the base negotiations the greek government has said 
repeatedly that foreign policy is unaffected by papandreous 
illness and officials have been instructed to carry on their 
functions ms ridgway replied 
as to whether the base negotiations would be completed before 
parliamentary elections she said this was uncertain because 
setting of the election date is linked to the prime ministers

the senate rules committee voted tuesday to 
appropriate an additional 108000 for the special committee 
investigating the bureau of indian affairs and alleged 
mismanagement of natural resources such as gas and oil 
last november the committee unanimously authorized a yearlong 
740000 investigation into alleged fraud mismanagement and 
malfeasance in the administration of housing education and health 
programs 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii chairman of the select 
committee on indian affairs said the investigation is the most 
professional i have seen even more so than the irancontra of 
which he was the cochairman 
he said the special committee headed by sen dennis deconcini 
dariz had issued 130 subpoenas and interviewed or taken 
depositions from over 300 individuals 
inouye said there have been allegations of malfeasance 
negligence and criminal activity in which the dollar sum may exceed 
11 billion 
deconcini said the special committee would not be rushed in its 
investigation he said hearings would be held early in 1989 
when the deconcini committee was formed last year inouye said 
the allegations of mismanagement extend to almost ever aspect of 
the administration of indian affairs and include the development 
of indian trust resources and the management of housing programs 
health programs education programs economic development 
initiatives and the administration of law enforcement on indian 
reservations 
the special investigation was prompted by a series of articles 
in the arizona republic last october the newspaper reported that 
multimillion dollar federal indian programs are plagued by fraud 
incompetence and deceit 
as an example inouye said 34 reports of the interior 
departments inspector general and an equal number of reports 
issued by the general accounting office the congressional 
investigative arm since the early 1970s estimate that the interior 
department has failed to collect approximately 57 billion in oil 
and gas royalties from oil companies 
inouye said the interior and gao reports also document another 
58 billion worth of oil and gas that has been illegally siphoned 
off of indian and public lands 
an arizona republic account he said indicates that the 
resulting windfall to oil companies has been placed at more than 
1 billion a year in studies by the interior departments inspector 
general the general accounting office and congressional panels

the drought appears to have slowed the 
recovery in farmland values but appraisers think land prices will 
rise at a healthy clip in 1989 the agriculture department said 
tuesday 
rural appraisers surveyed in august by the departments economic 
research service reported only a 12 percent increase nationally in 
farmland values for may june and july compared with a 18 percent 
gain in the first quarter of the year 
while the appreciation rate for farmland could continue to 
slow in coming months the appraisers were more bullish for the 
year ahead expecting a 46 percent rise in values the report 
said last may surveyed appraisers anticipated only a 36 
percent gain for the coming year 
farmland prices began rising in 1987 ending a 6year decline 
that was part of the worst financial crunch in us agriculture 
since the depression 
in a related report the agency released new 1987 farm income 
statistics which showed state rankings for the first time 
california as usual headed the list 
nine of the top 10 states for net farm income in 1987 were there 
in 1986 the economic research service said north carolina 
replaced washington in 1987 
the top 10 states accounted for 54 percent of total us net 
farm income in 1987 compared with 545 percent in 1986 
the new preliminary state estimates for 1987 showed net farm 
income nationally at 463 billion up more than 23 percent from 
calendar 1986 
economists said the largest percentage increases were in 
wyoming south carolina maine louisiana mississippi and nevada 
the wyoming and nevada gains were due largely to increased 
value of livestock product marketings the report said higher 
cattle prices and livestock inventory reductions contributed 
improved farm income in south carolina maine louisiana and 
mississippi resulted from increased production and higher prices 
for tobacco potatoes cotton and cottonseed generally production 
increased from a relatively poor year in 1986 
net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and 
total expenses during a calendar year and measures the profit or 
loss associated with production in a given year 
additions to inventories are treated as income and allowances 
are made for nonmoney items such as depreciation the 
consumption of farmgrown food and the net rental value of 
dwellings 
the agency also uses a method of accounting for net cash 
income which is the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses current sales from inventories produced in other 
years are counted as gross income 
net cash income is often preferred by some economists since it 
shows how much actual money farmers have to spend during a year in 
1987 net cash income was estimated at a record 571 billion 
compared with the net income of 463 billion 
the usda has forecast 1988 net farm income may be in the range 
of 38 billion to 43 billion and that net cash income could be 
55 billion to 60 billion 
net farm income is typically much more volatile than net cash 
income because weather often causes sharp changes in production 
that lead to swings in inventory values the report said

a heavyset white woman in her 40s is 
pictured in a drawing released by a federal agency tuesday of a 
suspect in the july discovery of 13 time bombs planted in the small 
town of salem 
the bombs which caused no serious damage were found near 
buildings and under the bridges that provide the only access to the 
southern indiana community of about 6000 people 
the devices contained timers attached to as many as 26 sticks of 
gelatine dynamite and were packaged in paper grocery sacks they 
were concealed at various sites in and near the downtown square 
the drawing was released by the us bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms and the indiana state police 
a military explosives expert said at the time that the bomber 
either lacked the expertise to properly wire the bombs or did not 
have an essential component 
three of the dynamite bundles exploded but produced only smoke 
and small fires the 10 others were defused by bomb experts 
no one was injured but authorities said the bombs could have 
caused widespread destruction

the transportation department on tuesday 
excluded farmers and firefighters from a federal requirement that 
drivers of large trucks have a special license saying these groups 
do not have a poor traffic safety record 
the announcement came after several months of public hearings 
and protests from the farm community over new federal requirements 
that are aimed at anyone driving a truck weighing more than 26000 
pounds or any vehicles carrying hazardous cargo 
farmers have complained that the special license requirement as 
enacted by congress would cover drivers of large trucks carrying 
grain and hay even some pickup trucks bulk fuel and fertilizer 
tanks and firefighters driving emergency vehicles 
the law provides for the department to allow exemptions 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the states are being 
notified that they may exempt farmtomarket truck operators as 
long as the vehicles are used to transport agricultural products 
farm machinery or farm supplies no more than 150 miles from home 
generally these vehicles have a better accident record than 
nonfarm vehicles of similar size the department concluded in 
1982 the most recent year cited the accident rate for farm 
vehicles was less than half the rate for nonfarm vehicles it said 
additionally the department said the states may exclude 
drivers of firefighting equipment operated by municipalities or 
volunteer fire departments as well as military personnel including 
national guardsmen who drive military vehicles 
congress enacted the law in 1986 to tighten control over drivers 
who drive large commercial trucks from state to state it is aimed 
at ending the practice by some commercial drivers of obtaining 
licenses from a number of states to conceal traffic violations the 
law also requires minimum standards for commercial drivers and a 
testing program 
both the licenses and testing continue to be administered by the 
states 
at the same time the department said it was rejecting requests 
for similar waivers to transit operators railroad employees and 
public utility employees 
sen john danforth rmo principal author of the 1986 law 
requiring the special licensing said he agreed with the 
departments decision 
the law was not intended to unduly burden farmers as they 
transport their grain to the silo or their crops to market 
danforth said in a statement

the number of confirmed dead in a flash 
flood caused by hurricane gilbert rose to 140 tuesday and 
authorities said a fifth passenger bus had been located in a drying 
river bed 
we have recovered 140 cadavers its difficult to say how many 
more there could be it could be very terrible said daniel 
dimas assistant information secretary for the nuevo leon state 
government 
dimas said by telephone that most of the bodies were being found 
in the santa catarina river about 20 miles downstream from 
monterrey 
earlier authorities said about 100 bodies had been recovered 
and estimated that 200 overall may have been killed in the flooding 
rains unleashed by hurricane gilbert in the 14000foothigh 
mountains surrounding this state capital sent waters raging through 
the normally dry river bed on saturday the flash flood swept away 
five passenger buses and private vehicles that were traveling on 
roads built in the river bed 
the santa catarina divides monterrey which has a population of 
3 million and is the largest metropolitan area in northern mexico 
the flash flood the worst monterrey has seen since 1909 also 
swept away squatters homes streets electricity towers and miles 
of sports facilities that had built on the dry riverbed 
state authorities estimated damage at 90 million 
the torrents destructive path extended for nearly 40 miles 
hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands more flooded with 
water and mud about 30000 people remained in shelters tuesday 
dimas said the fifth passenger bus had been located in the river 
bed 30 miles downstream from here 
the bus is one of four intercity and one urban buses that were 
swept into the river in monterrey 
army soldiers digging through rubble in the crushed and 
overturned skeleton of the local bus found two decaying bodies 
inside it on monday the daily monterrey newspaper el norte 
reported 
dimas said ranches in the mountain region around monterrey and a 
village of about 100 families remained cut off tuesday by flooding 
and mudslides 
were trying to find out what we can do to get supplies to 
these people he said 
the flood waters which were 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide 
had subsided to a shallow trickle about 15 feet wide by tuesday 
but many parts of the monterrey area remained without water 
because of damaged pumps 
health authorities were recommending that citizens throughout 
the region boil water because of increased risk of viral and 
bacterial infections caused by contaminated water 
the water treatment plants are working beyond capacity said 
jorge cavazos state health secretary 
the water could be contaminated with fecal matter and 
sediments he said in a telephone interview 
apart from the damage and deaths in monterrey and mexicos 
yucatan peninsula the storm killed at least 71 people and 
destroyed thousands of homes in texas jamaica honduras the 
cayman islands haiti and puerto rico

education secretary william j bennett spent his 
last day in office tuesday berating michael dukakis and contending 
dukakis advisers tend to look down their noses at the basic and 
instinctive patriotism of a lot of the american people 
bennett also criticized dukakis the massachusetts governor and 
democratic presidential nominee for vetoing legislation that would 
have penalized teachers unless they led their students in the 
pledge of allegiance 
but in attacking the dukakis veto which followed advisory 
opinions from the state attorney general and supreme court that the 
bill was unconstitutional bennett also agreed with dukakis that 
any student who objects should not be required to recite the pledge 
dukakis supporters turned out in force to greet bennett terming 
him a hypocrite for criticizing dukakis at a time when state 
spending on education has increased significantly and the reagan 
administration had tried to cut programs and eliminate the 
education department 
bennett appearing at a news conference on behalf of republican 
presidential nominee george bush said dukakis had at best an 
average record on education and called his veto of the pledge bill 
his most famous educational act 
bennett said he would oppose such a law at the federal level 
because education is a state issue but he said he supported state 
laws that required the pledge while excusing students who object on 
religious or other grounds 
dukakis believes recitation of the pledge should be a voluntary 
tradition in schools while bennett called for state laws that 
require recitation but do not penalize students who object 
if you dont like the pledge of allegiance youre going to 
hate the declaration of independence bennett said 
in a 1986 assessment bennett praised improvements in sat scores 
that moved massachusetts into the top third of states which 
administer the tests and also credited the state for putting in 
place important reforms to improve teacher quality through testing 
of new teachers performance incentives and alternative 
certifications to attract the most qualified candidates into 
teaching 
after being read those comments tuesday bennett said check 
the record and see what belongs to dukakis and what belongs to 
king a reference to former gov edward j king when told the 
teacherquality legislation was part of a package dukakis supported 
in 1985 bennett said that may well be the governors record 
itself is not distinguished 
bennett during a recent television appearance said most 
dukakis advisers come from brookline and cambridge communities 
where he said many residents have disdain for patriotism 
bennett whose tenure was marked by such outspoken and 
controversial comments refused to apologize tuesday but said he 
was referring specifically to dukakis advisers 
a lot of the dukakis crowd the dukakis advisers do have i 
think a sense of intellectual superiority and do tend to look down 
their noses at the basic and instinctive patriotism of a lot of the 
american people bennett said 
at the earlier meeting with reporters brookline state rep 
eleanor myerson invited bennett to visit her town where dukakis 
the democratic presidential nominee grew up and still lives 
if mr bennett thinks brookline disdains basic american 
values he should visit our town and visit the civil war world war 
i world war ii korean war and vietnam veteran memorials honoring 
brookline citizens who died to protect his freedom to insult their 
memory myerson said

four inmates who were issued pink prison 
uniforms to show they have been exposed to the aids virus are suing 
the sheriff contending the outfits stigmatize them and constitute 
cruel and unusual punishment 
the complaint filed monday was part of an amendment to a lawsuit 
the orleans parish jail inmates already filed alleging they are 
kept segregated in cramped quarters and denied regular exercise 
counseling and adequate medical care 
sheriff charles foti said he is not singling the inmates out for 
punishment or humiliation colorcoded uniforms are used at the 
jail to designate the sections to which inmates are assigned he 
said 
light pink or rose colored scrub suits are the color in the 
jails infectiousdisease unit he said 
if they were in white or green would that make a 
difference he said what is pink i wear pink all the time 
pastel colors thats a very soothing type of color 
foti said he recently adopted the color code because the cotton 
scrub suits and jump suits are lighter and easier to clean and keep 
track of 
federal prisoners wear blue inmates who are housed in the tents 
in the prison yard wear white and inmates in the prisons general 
medical ward wear green foti said

the house on tuesday passed and sent to the 
senate a bill aimed at permitting the bureau of land management to 
resume transfers of land to western municipalities and counties for 
landfills 
the bill approved on a voice vote with minimal debate exempts 
landfills from the requirement in current law that land leased or 
sold to municipalities revert to the government if used for 
purposes not spelled out in the deed 
this requirement could leave the federal government liable for 
cleanup of any hazardous waste placed in municipal landfills the 
bureau concluded last year in suspending transfers of parcels for 
landfills 
more than 300 communities have acquired landfills this way 
the interior committee added a requirement to the bill that 
virgin land be inspected to make sure it contains no hazardous 
waste and that towns cities and counties getting these parcels 
pledge to follow hazardous waste laws and regulations 
but these requirements do not affect existing landfills 
rep mike synar dokla chairman of the environment and 
natural resources subcommittee of the government operations 
committee had sought tougher requirements from the interior 
committee his subcommittee reported two years ago that the bureau 
was ignoring guidelines promulgated by the environmental protection 
agency for landfills under the jurisdiction of federal agencies 
let me urge the blm to be responsible in moving land to 
municipal ownership including leased land synar said in a 
statement on the floor tuesday

the greens environmental group fared so 
well in elections last sunday that they might not be able to fill 
all the seats they won on local and town councils party officials 
said tuesday 
the greens became the first new party in 70 years to make its 
way into swedens parliament winning 20 seats in the 349member 
riksdag 
their popularity was boosted by ecological concern and a plague 
that killed thousands of seals in the northern seas making the 
environment the top issue in the election campaign 
the swedish environmentalists became the second largest greens 
party in europe winning 55 percent of the vote 
greens hold 43 seats in the west german bundestag about 9 
percent of the total environmental parties also are in the 
parliaments of italy belgium austria switzerland luxembourg 
portugal iceland and finland 
the greens also won seats in 260 of swedens 284 municipal 
councils but party officials said that as of late monday the 
looseknit organization had no members to fill all its seats in 23 
of them 
party official anders lindberg said that in some districts the 
greens had asked people not to vote for them for lack of local 
candidates and urged them to support other local parties with 
strong environmental programs 
but greens ballots were available at all polling stations and 
many voters ignored the call 
in sweden anyone can register as a candidate for local office 
simply by writing his or her name on the ballot 
lindberg said that when early opinion polls indicated strong 
support for the greens we had to urge our more reluctant 
passive members to put their names down as candidates 
now there are a handful of cases where we have no members to 
take our seats lindberg said he expressed concern that a 
perfect stranger hostile to the environmentalists could take a 
greens seat 
if no candidate is registered the seat will remain empty for 
the threeyear term 
the greens also face the question of whether to give up their 
decentralized ideology and organize a more rigid party machinery 
they have virtually no national organization or official party 
leaders but two people eva goes and birger schlaug have emerged 
as semiofficial spokesmen 
the greens advocate abolishing nuclear power within three years 
raising taxes on energy and allocating more funds to alternative 
energy sources 
the party also campaigned for developing the railway system to 
take airpolluting cars and buses off the roads stopping the 
burning of toxic waste putting industry under stricter pollution 
controls and encouraging biological farming 
one problem the partys victory resolved was its financial debts 
from its unsuccessful 1982 election bid as a sitting party in 
parliament the greens will receive government funds up to 1 
million during its first year

department sanctuary at adobe mountain 
he told us he would be taken care of out there and that we 
could go out and see him whenever we wanted to luenz said

the popularity of semiautomatic or automatic 
assault weapons is increasing dramatically among criminals 
especially among those trafficking in illegal drugs an antigun 
group said tuesday 
the group said police officials across the country are concerned 
about how frequently criminals are found to possess highpowered 
automatic assault rifles or shotguns some capable of firing 30 
rounds in a few seconds 
the number of assault weapons in civilian hands both 
criminal and law abiding is estimated to be in the hundreds of 
thousands perhaps millions said a report by the education fund 
to end handgun violence which keeps track of the firearms industry 
and favors tighter controls over the sale of guns 
the group said there are no nationwide statistics available on 
the misuse of such assault weapons but that police organizations 
government agencies and progun control groups agree the number of 
such weapons has increased dramatically in recent years 
assault weapons are characterized by having the capability of 
firing a large number of rounds on a single magazine great muzzle 
velocity and compact design often including folding stocks that 
make it easier for the weapon to be concealed 
the assault weapons are quickly becoming the leading topic in 
americas gun control debate and will most likely remain the 
leading gun control issue for the near future the report said 
it said automatic and semiautomatic weapons such as the ar15 
ak47 and uzi are among the most popular weapons of drug dealers 
and are readily available in most states 
for criminals the weapons look intimidating have increased 
firepower and can be purchased under the same controls as a 
hunting rifle or shotgun the report said it said the weapons 
are popular not only among criminals but also survivalists and 
rankandfile gun aficionados 
while the group said no national statistics were available on 
how many such weapons are in circulation it said in 1987 almost 
onethird of the weapons seized by the drug enforcement agency were 
semiautomatic and 16 percent were fully automatic 
of the 388 guns seized by the washington dc police department 
during the first six weeks of this year the vast majority were 
either semiautomatic or fully automatic the report said 
the study was conducted in conjunction with the new right watch 
a group which monitors right wing organizations

the justice department announced tuesday there 
is insufficient evidence to seek indictments in the investigation 
of action taken by philadelphia city officials and police in the 
1985 move confrontation which left 11 people dead and nearly two 
square blocks in flames 
the investigation examined whether the officials or police 
violated the civil rights of those who died in the bombing and 
ensuing fire said assistant attorney general william bradford 
reynolds 
we just found insufficient evidence to go forward with an 
indictment of anybody reynolds head of the departments civil 
rights division said in an interview 
it was the second time a criminal probe of philadelphia mayor 
wilson goode and others in connection with the move incident has 
been concluded without indictments a local grand jury in 
philadelphia earlier this year strongly criticized city officials 
for their handling of the confrontation 
refraining from extensive comment goode said he was happy that 
the investigation was over adding two grand juries have fully 
investigated this matter and have reached a point of no criminality 
involved for that i am pleased 
the local grand jury discounted assertions that police gunfire 
in an alley behind the move compound kept people from fleeing the 
burning rowhouse and reynolds said the federal probe also had 
examined that aspect of the matter 
in a threeparagraph statement announcing the end of the federal 
probe the department said no report will be issued by the fderal 
grand jury in philadelphia which has been looking into the matter 
since april 1987 
the panel based its inquiry on the work of an fbi investigation 
launched in july 1985 
it is a very positive thing to look forward rather than to 
look back and it really serves no purpose to go back and 
revisit and rechurn those waters reynolds said when asked why 
the government had decided not to press for a grand jury report on 
the matter i feel quite strongly that the proper way for a 
prosecutor to proceed is to make his or her decision announce it 
and nothing is to be served by any commentary after that 
reynolds praised the fbi said the statements of more than 250 
witnesses had been carefully considered and that we are satisfied 
there is no basis for a criminal indictment based on our 
thorough review of all the evidence 
five children and six adults died inside the barricaded west 
philadelphia rowhouse on may 13 1985 when police dropped a bomb 
on the dwelling in an attempt to evict move followers philadelphia 
mayor wilson goode approved the use of a bomb which contained the 
powerful military explosive c4 and was dropped from a helicopter 
the police bomb touched off a rooftop fire that soon raged out 
of control while fireman held back afraid they would be hit by 
gunfire that had echoed through the neighborhood the fire engulfed 
almost two square blocks and destroyed 61 rowhouses

western opinion polls showing hostility toward 
nuclear weapons and rising popularity for soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev present a challenge for nato to better explain and sell 
its basic defense policy us assistant secretary of state rozanne 
ridgway said tuesday 
for all of these nato countries it means a requirement for 
explaining defense policy and the approach to dealing with the 
soviet union from a position of strength she told a 
congressional hearing arms control negotiations to achieve a 
proper defense at the lowest possible level require a very long and 
elaborate public presentation 
ms ridgway termed startling and a matter of concern the results 
of an opinion survey two months ago by a leading european 
newspaper west germanys frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 
rep lee hamilton dind told the house subcommittee on 
european and middle eastern affairs that the poll showed gorbachev 
was popular with 70 percent of the west germans questioned that 79 
percent opposed nuclear weapons in europe and 51 percent rejected 
the idea of nuclear deterrents 
we are also seeing the results of other polls that were very 
hostile ms ridgway said adding that such sentiments seem not 
limited to particular age groups it creates problems for all of 
us some of those attitudes are present in our own country 
probably in the same proportions she said 
hamilton gave no information on the number polled or margin of 
error in the july 22 opinion survey he also said 68 percent of the 
west germans questioned opposed modernization of nuclear forces and 
only 14 percent favored it that mistrust of the soviet union has 
almost vanished and there is growing acceptance in germany of 
gorbachevs claims that soviet military power is for defense rather 
than offensive purposes

an armenian activist said about 400000 people 
jammed the main square of yerevan tuesday night and heard renewed 
demands for armenian annexation of nagornokarabakh where reports 
said a curfew was imposed and a bomb damaged a workers dormitory 
new violence hit the disputed territory over the weekend with 
one man said to have been killed and at least 25 people officially 
reported injured 
the armenian activist rafael popoyan said many residents in 
the armenian capital who struck last friday remained off the job 
tuesday vowing to stay out until the armenian supreme soviet or 
parliament met in new session to reconsider their annexation plea 
in a telephone interview from yerevan on tuesday popoyan said 
members of the karabakh committee a group pressing for annexation 
of nagornokarabakh told the yerevan crowd that onethird or 115 
members of the republics supreme soviet signed a request for a 
new session 
at 10 oclock tomorrow morning people will be on the square 
waiting for an official announcement popoyan said he said that 
according to law the session must be held if onethird of the 
supreme soviet members request it 
popoyan said committee members also told the crowd that a curfew 
was in effect in stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh 
popoyan a 46yearold former political prisoner said he had no 
details 
the predominantly armenian population of nagornokarabakh a 
mountainous region of the republic of azerbaijan began agitating 
in february for annexation to armenia ethnic riots broke out in 
sumgait an industrial city of azerbaijan at the end of february 
that left at least 32 people dead 
the area in the southern soviet region near the turkishiranian 
border has been tense since then according to the official tass 
news agency armenians and azerbaijanis traded shots sunday in 
khadzhaly village in nagornokarabakh 
an editor at the official news agency azerinform in azerbaijan 
said in a telephone interview that a 61yearold carpenter injured 
in the clash died monday in a hospital the editor who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said he did not know whether the man was an 
armenian or an azerbaijani 
tass said 25 people were hurt in the fighting but popoyan said 
reports in yerevan reported up to 70 injured 
popoyan and dmitri volchek an editor of the unofficial moscow 
journal glasnost said a bomb exploded monday at a dormitory 
housing armenian construction workers in abovyan a few miles from 
stepanakert 
popoyan said no one was hurt he said a leaflet found at the 
site called the blast a present to residents of karabakh 
calls did not go through to stepanakert operators said the 
telephone line was down 
in a possible prelude to greater police activity in armenia and 
azerbaijan tass called for order the people are demanding that 
law and order be enforced everywhere lawenforcement services 
along with the public are taking necessary measures it said 
officials in yerevan said police patrols were increased but 
popoyan said police made no effort to break up the meeting tuesday 
night 
the armenian parliament in june asked the national supreme 
soviet to permit armenia to annex nagornokarabakh the central 
government rejected that demand and offered instead a plan of 
social and economic development 
tass said many workers were showing restraint ensuring normal 
operation of farms transportation and factories but all the 
same irresponsible elements first of all in the nagornokarabakh 
autonomous region continue working up tension provoking disorders 
and resorting to arson and other illegal activities 
popoyan said stores farms food processing plants and 
transportation were operating in yerevan but many other 
enterprises and schools were closed 
he estimated that 1 million people attended a monday night 
gathering in yerevan a duty officer at the armenian ministry of 
internal affairs said more than 250000 people attended 
tass said several meetings were held in azerbaijan as well 
a new strike was called last week in stepanakert where workers 
were off their jobs for weeks during the summer 
in baku on tuesday the azerbaijani communist party chief 
abdulrahman vezirov told a meeting of local officials the clashes 
were part of antisocial activities that must be combated with 
work among the people and stricter control over lawandorder tass 
reported 
armenians are predominantly christian most azerbaijanis are 
shiite moslem armenians also differ linguistically and culturally 
from ethnic azerbaijanis

nasas inspector general said tuesday he 
expects more indictments charging aerospace manufacturers with 
certifying falsely that bolts used on the space shuttles had been 
properly tested 
bill colvin said he had been assured by engineers that there are 
no defective bolts in critical areas on the shuttle discovery 
which is to be launched sept 29 from the kennedy space center in 
florida 
we are looking at false certification he said that does 
not necessarily mean they are defective 
the los angeles times quoted darrell lee president of lee 
aerospace products of simi valley calif as saying his company is 
one of many under investigation 
colvin said it would not be appropriate for him to discuss lee 
aerospace no charges have been filed against the firm 
at this point in time our interest is in fasteners colvin 
said i would expect more indictments 
ron bledsoe chief of the quality engineering division at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala said the false 
certifications were uncovered during an audit in february and march 
there are some of lee aerospaces bolts on the shuttle we 
know that he said weve actually gone in and evaluated where 
these bolts were and in any critical application we conducted 
extensive stress analysis and determined there was no safety 
issue 
bledsoe said the shuttles right booster contains 614 lee bolts 
and the left booster has 595 and that lee bolts account for 60 
percent of the 2000 bolts inside the rockets 
even with those bolts that were in there i couldnt say we 
would have a problem with them bledsoe said but they just 
didnt meet all the requirement we have we want to assure 
ourselves all bases are covered 
arthur o sammons of canoga park calif was indicted sept 9 
by a federal grand jury in birmingham ala on 26 counts of making 
false statements to nasa and 17 counts of mail fraud involving 
shuttle bolts made by lawrence engineering and supply of burbank 
calif 
in the sammons case federal authorities said the cost of 
identifying and removing the suspect bolts was 1 million an 
estimate that colvin called conservative sammons faces up to five 
years in prison and a fine of 10000 each on the false statement 
counts and five years and 1000 fines on each count of mail fraud 
bledsoe said 357 bolts were taken off the two booster rockets in 
may or june all made by lawrence engineering he said no defective 
bolts were found among those tested 
there are military specifications that set the standard for 
bolts colvin said some bolts must meet a certain threshold or 
be able to withstand certain pressures others might have to meet 
certain chemical specifications so they dont rust and deteriorate 
the testing is done either by the manufacturer or supplier and they 
certify to us that this has been done

educators gathered tuesday to grapple with the 
practical and philosophical problems that would confront teachers 
in developing a kindergarten12th grade curriculum on the national 
holiday honoring slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
if we teach the principles of nonviolent social change to the 
kids from kindergarten what do we do when they stage a walkout 
one educator asked 
the answer from harold sims of the atlantabased martin luther 
king center for nonviolent social change you have to teach them 
the principles of nonviolent social change let them know that 
civil disobedience was the last step following long period of 
negotiation 
teaching dilemmas parental reaction lack of course materials 
training and faculty support were some of the issues raised during 
the miniconvention on infusing educational materials related to 
martin luther king jr into the curriculum of the nations 
schools sponsored by the education committee of the federal 
holiday commission and the king center 
committee members included national education association 
president mary futrell sister catherine mcnamee president of the 
national catholic educational association manya ungar president 
of the national parents and teachers association lawrence 
davenport assistant secretary of the department of energy and 
mrs christine king farris kings sister 
saying she hoped this would be the first of many 
conferences designed to make available audiovisual materials 
training programs and other classroom aids futrell said you 
cannot simply go out and say im going to teach about the life of 
dr king unless you know about his life unless you understand and 
have resources available 
futrell said the purpose of the convention was to give the 
participants an opportunity to come together and talk about how 
we teach about king and how we inculcate that into the curriculum 
many of the speakers discussed the problems associated with 
their particular constituent groups 
one problem is that no one has ever been really taught about 
king said gordon ambach of the council of chief state school 
officers 
you have to recognize that an association like mine is 
predominantly white anglosaxon protestant middle class and 
suburban said ungar of the national pta 
the board members with which i deal are not reflective of 
the greater society particularly that portion of society which 
increasingly has problems getting their voices heard and their 
agenda addressed she said 
she noted that her group was reaching out to other 
organizations such as the antidefamation league to help produce 
literature by next june 
the pta board which prepared itself through training in human 
relation skills and a task force for inclusiveness suggested that 
the state and local chapters initiate programs which demonstrate 
a commitment to the things that martin luther king espoused and 
stood for she said 
to do this the parents have got to educate themselves and 
find out who martin luther king was ungar said we hope to 
have literature aimed at the parents talking about how we either 
overtly or covertly teach prejudice teach racism or perpetuate 
this cycle of hatred and violence she said

foreign minister dante m caputo of 
argentina was elected president of the 43rd general assembly 
tuesday and promptly denounced developed nations for their 
pitiless system of piling up third world debt 
caputo was swiftly elected after the 159nation world body 
convened in a mood of optimism and conciliation over many 
international issues despite the bitter presidential contest 
between caputo and barbados ambassador to the un dame nita 
barrow 
in his inaugural speech caputo set the tone for his yearlong 
presidency of the world body which is dominated by poor developing 
nations and distanced himself from much of the industrialized west 
caputo cited the contrast between political peace and economic 
injustice the widening of the gap between rich countries and a 
large part of the developing world 
the 47yearold former professor and politician was elected by a 
vote of 91 to 66 with one abstention in secret balloting by 158 
nations south africa the 159th member is disqualified from 
voting the abstaining nation was not identified 
the post is largely ceremonial but the president has great 
prestige and can wield considerable influence in setting agendas 
limiting speeches and setting the tone for debate 
caputos election was a major setback for britain which lobbied 
against him and for dame nita britain and argentina were foes in 
the falklands war of 1982 won by britain and the general 
assembly consistently has taken argentinas side 
the race was expected to be close but caputo won handily over 
the 71yearold nurse and public health expert who became the 
barbados envoy in 1986 
the united states did not disclose its secret vote 
diplomatic sources said caputo who had been courting black 
africa won many votes in the nonaligned movement he also won 
votes of the soviet union and socialist countries cuba japan 
arab nations which need argentine food and some european nations 
which have emigrant ties to argentina the sources said 
caputo named foreign minister in 1983 by president raul 
alfonsin last month expelled south africas consul for organizing 
a conference in argentina without proper diplomatic clearance 
in his speech after tuesdays election caputo praised the 
improved atmosphere for international cooperation betwen east and 
west 
caputo cited un achievements in the iraniraq ceasefire 
afghanistan settlement western sahara and other areas he also 
denounced the continuing infamous practice of apartheid in south 
africa refering to that countrys policy of racial segregation 
he pointed to the sharp deterioration of the situation in 
israelioccupied territories he called for an international peace 
conference on the middle east and supported the right of all states 
in the region to exist within safe boundaries and the right of the 
palestinian people to selfdetermination 
but he reserved his strongest comments to condemn the economic 
gap between the industrialized and the developing world 
caputo noted the remarkable difference between all the 
progress made toward ensuring world peace and the little or 
nothing we have done to prevent the widening of the gap between 
rich countries and a large part of the developing world 
he said one of the clearest examples of this impotence is the 
question of the external debt of the developing countries no 
structural improvement has taken place for the debtors since the 
outbreak of the the crisis in 1982 
the argentine envoy warned that high interst rates together 
with the pitiless system of successive refinancing plans and the 
perverse outflow of financial resources of indebted countries to 
credtors will end up eliminatng possibilities of investment for the 
developing world 
argentina has a foreign debt of 56 billion the third highest 
in the developing world 
of the three sources of global conflict eastwest tension 
regional conflicts and the unfair relationship between north and 
south a major un effort must be directed toward helping the 
developing world caputo said 
he said northern nations ensured their own wealth by imposing 
poverty on developing nations but emphasized that the 
industrialized nations need the development of other nations to 
consolidate their own progress 
they need it he said because development guarantees 
peace in the third world and global security and because expansion 
of trade of developed countries will depend increasingly on growth 
of economies of the south

resumption of suspended negotiations on the 
future of us military bases in greece could depend on the greek 
foreign ministers planned talks here wednesday with secretary of 
state george shultz a senior shultz aide said tuesday 
foreign minister carolas papoulias is scheduled to meet and have 
lunch with shultz in his capacity as current representative of the 
european common market but usgreek relations also will be 
covered assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway told a 
congressional panel 
negotiations in athens on american military bases were suspended 
sept 5 when ambassador alan flanigan the us negotiator 
returned to washington for instructions on a major element in 
the greek position that was identified as a demand for us forces 
to vacate hellenikon air base at athens international airport ms 
ridgway said 
resumption was tentatively scheduled for october but the date 
is undecided and whether it takes place depends partly on talks 
with papoulias she told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
european and middle eastern affairs 
the disposition of hellenikon will have to be resolved how 
it is going to be dealt with affects the whole negotiations she 
said 
ms ridgway did not disclose the us response to the demand for 
its planes to leave hellenikon she said in answer to a question 
that if agreement cannot be reached we have procedures for 
leaving but we are not at any stage of starting that at this 
time 
subcommittee chairman lee hamilton dind asked if the illness 
of prime minister andreas papandreou reported to be facing heart 
surgery would affect the base negotiations the greek government 
has said repeatedly that foreign policy is unaffected by 
papandreous illness and officials have been instructed to carry on 
their functions ms ridgway replied 
as to whether the base negotiations would be completed before 
parliamentary elections she said this was uncertain because 
setting of the election date is linked to the prime ministers 
health 
ms ridgway was also asked about the status of us military 
bases in turkey covered by an agreement that runs into 1990 
we are prepared to negotiate with turkey on the renewal of 
that agreement in good order she said i think it is a good 
agreement we are happy with it turkey is happy with it as far as 
i know 
ms ridgway praised the rival greek cypriot and turkish cypriot 
leaders for meeting in geneva and nicosia under un auspices in 
august and september and agreeing to meet again 
we continue to support strongly a negotiated settlement of the 
cyprus problem she said declaring that un secretary general 
javier perez de cuellar enjoys our full support 
asked to explain what members of congress termed conflicting 
us and turkish reports about iraqi use of poison gas against 
the kurdish minority in iraq ms ridgway said most of the kurds 
who managed to reach turkey were those who escaped the attacks 
while the us findings were based partly on evidence not available 
to turkey 
asked if turkey were barring un experts from investigating the 
issue she said the whole matter was under discussion and not yet 
resolved

thought dukakis would 
of the twothirds of the respondents who thought preserving 
american family values to be a cutting edge issue 52 percent

but on the issue of creating new jobs which twothirds found 
important dukakis was favored over bush 53 percent to 43 percent 
neither candidate led on fighting drugs and crime holding down 
the deficit and protecting the environment bush was ahead among 
voters who were concerned about issues such as the pledge of 
allegiance the strategic defense initiative and antiabortion

as a result of the attack on kabul 62 innocent people 
including women and children were killed and 104 were wounded 
radio kabul said in a report monitored in islamabad it gave few 
other details 
the report tended to reinforce claims by western sources that 
usbacked moslem insurgents have surrounded the heavilyfortified 
afghan capital attacking government and sovietheld positions 
in another report tuesday radio kabul said 10 people were 
killed when six surface rockets launched by extremist opposition 
elements slammed into various parts of kabul it was not 
immediately clear whether the 10 fatalities were included among the 
62 reported killed 
the report said since the april 14 signing in geneva of an 
accord providing for the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan anticommunist rebels have rocketed the city 16 times 
the 16th attack occurred tuesday it said 
tass also reported tuesday that afghan soldiers captured 14 
caches of arms near kabul that contained more than 700

the annual gathering of finance ministers and 
other economic officials at the world bank and international 
monetary fund beginning this week in berlin is unlikely to produce 
a major change in world economic policies according to a senior 
treasury department official 
the world economy is in the best shape that weve seen for 
a very considerable period of time said the official on tuesday 
adding that american policy will continue steady during president 
reagans final months in office 
our principal objectives will be to assure our partners of the 
continued us commitment to and support for the economic policy 
coordination process and the debt strategy said the official he 
said us officials also would try to build on the considerable 
progress being achieved in promoting a sound world economy and a 
stable financial system 
the berlin meeting will be the first opportunity for new 
treasury secretary nicholas brady to get acquainted with his 
foreign counterparts the official noted brady was confirmed as 
secretary earlier this month to replace james baker who resigned 
to head george bushs presidential campaign 
inflation remains moderate and while continued vigilance is 
needed on that front there is no evidence of generalized price 
pressures emerging the official said 
he said external imbalances like the us trade deficit and 
the japanese trade surplus are coming down more quickly in fact 
than many people projected as the latest us trade figures have 
recently confirmed 
he said economic growth in the major industrial countries this 
year will be approximately 4 percent with continued expansion next 
year 
during the berlin meeting the wealthiest countries known as 
the group of seven or g7 plan to review their coordinated 
approach to the world economy to see if it can be strengthened the 
official said 
we expect the participants of that meeting to reaffirm the 
policy directions that have been adopted including the 
understanding on exchange market cooperation the official said 
in recent years the g7 countries have worked together to lower 
the value of the us dollar and raise the west german deutsche 
mark and japanese yen on exchange markets 
this has lowered the price of us exports and made them more 
competitive in the world market helping to narrow the difference 
between what the amount of goods and services the united states 
exports and imports 
the official said the us government continues to stand by its 
approach to easing the third world debt burden as fundamentally 
sound and believes that significant progress has been and is 
being achieved 
the approach outlined in 1985 by baker called on commercial 
banks and international lending agencies to increase loans by 29 
billion to the poorest 15 countries of the world in exchange for 
moves by those countries toward freemarket economies 
lending by the commercial banks however has fallen 20 billion 
short of what the baker plan envisioned this has prompted other 
countries most notably france and japan to suggest alternatives 
the official said debtforequity swaps used by some latin 
american countries to reduce their indebtedness showed promise 
under the procedure governments grant commercial banks shares in 
governmentowned businesses in exchange for forgiveness of the 
government debt to the banks 
debtequity swaps have totaled 9 billion dollars by our 
estimate in the last 18 months or two years said the official 
theres room for substantially more activity of this kind if 
various debtor countries would further open their markets and 
remove foreigninvestment restrictions

the house on tuesday passed a bill that will 
allow federal agencies to locate in suburbs outside washington 
dc a move city officials said would mean a substantial loss in 
local taxes 
the bill which amends a 1959 law requiring that federal 
agencies be housed in the district of columbia was prompted by 
concern that federallyleased land within the city had become too 
expensive the bill passed by a voice vote now goes to the senate 
this legislation is important in that it would provide needed 
flexibility in the location of certain executive agencies in the 
national capital region at a significant savings to the 
government said rep glenn m anderson dcalif chairman of 
the public works and transportation committee 
average lease rates in the nations capital range from 27 to 
37 a square foot compared to only 18 to 22 per square foot in 
prince georges county md and 22 to 31 per square foot in 
alexandria va anderson noted 
a recent study by the general services administration the 
agency which handles all federal land purchases and rental 
agreements found that 6 million could be saved on a 10year lease 
of 100000 square feet if a federal agency moved to a suburban 
location 
rep guy molinari rny the bills chief sponsor said more 
than 50 independent agencies would be allowed to relocate outside 
washington 
however the legislation would not allow the principal offices 
of the 13 cabinetlevel agencies to move outside the district 
the fact of the matter is that we have the opportunity in many 
cases to lease equivalent space nearby in the suburbs at half of 
what it would cost to stay in the district said molinari 
were not anticipating any large massscale exodus but this 
could save millions and millions of taxpayer dollars 
but while the bill could ultimately mean a savings for federal 
taxpayers city officials said they will be scrambling to make up 
for the lost revenue 
this takes a lot of federal lease space in the district and 
sends it out to the suburbs said julius hobson the citys 
intergovernmental liason officer what we will lose is sales tax 
revenue from federal employees eating and shopping in the city 
hobson did not know exactly how much tax revenue the city would 
lose

democrat michael dukakis proposed a broad health insurance 
program for american workers tuesday and told republican rival 
george bush its about time you came out from behind that flag 
and addressed the issue bush draped himself in patriotism 
visiting the nations largest flag manufacturer 
dukakis seeking support from working people said the federal 
government should enact legislation requiring most employers to 
provide basic health insurance benefits for employees and 
dependents 
i think its time we did something said dukakis he said he 
wanted to extend health insurance to all americans and that the 
first step would be to provide it to working people through their 
employers 
campaign aides said the first phase of dukakis program would 
give benefits to about 22 million people who have none leaving 15 
million or more americans still awaiting protection under a 
national health insurance plan 
bushs campaign derided dukakis plan as socialized medicine 
and a prescription for financial disaster 
criticizing bush for what he said was a record of neglect and 
indifference on health care issues dukakis said today hes 
visiting a flag factory mr bush dont you think its about time 
you came out from behind that flag and told us what you intend to 
do to provide basic health care for 37 million of our fellow 
citizens 
with their first facetoface debate just five days away 
dukakis campaigned in houston and bowling green ky while bush 
made a brief campaign hop to bloomfield nj to visit the annin 
flag co 
my friends flag sales are doing well and america is doing 
well said bush who has stressed patriotism in his campaign and 
has attacked dukakis for vetoing a massachusetts bill that would 
have required public school teachers to lead students in reciting 
the pledge of allegiance 
americans have a new economic power and im not going to let 
them take that away from you bush said at a rally outside the 
plant he spoke in front of a huge american flag in a state 
regarded as a key battleground of the presidential race 
the vice president returned to washington in time to swear in 
fellow texan lauro cavazos as education secretary the first 
hispanic member of the cabinet 
hispanics are a key voter bloc particularly in states such as 
california and texas and both bush and dukakis have pledged to put 
a hispanicamerican at the cabinet table 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle campaigned in boise 
idaho telling a crowd of more than 1000 at the state capitol that 
dukakis policies are the policies of the past our policies are 
the policies of the future 
quayle addressing the dukakis insurance proposal said he 
favors pilot projects and tax incentives to encourage businesses to 
provide insurance for workers 
sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee 
campaigned in the financially pinched texasoklahoma oil patch 
promising that a democratic administrations energy policy would 
get american oil wells operating again with tax incentives and 
other subsidies he promised dukakis would light a fire under 
federal regulators blocking the sale of natural gas to the 
northeast 
dukakis began the day in houston where he visited hermann 
hospital part of the texas medical center in the waiting room of 
a cancer ward dukakis met with a dozen patients and family 
members asking about medical costs and health insurance programs 
saying it was time to address the problem dukakis added if 
all goes well on the 8th of november sen bentsen and i are going 
to do something about it spread the word 
later he flew to bowling green to outline his insurance 
proposal at western kentucky university 
dukakis the son of a physician said he intends to make sure 
that when americans get sick the first question they hear will 
be the question my father used to ask the question that doctors 
and nurses ask every day not how can you pay but where does it 
hurt 
dukakis health adviser dr david blumenthal of boston said 
the campaign had no estimate of how much dukakis plan would cost 
employers if elected dukakis will appoint a task force to report 
by march 30 1989 on legislation that would guarantee universal 
health coverage extending benefits to every american working or 
not the campaign said 
with bush occupied on the campaign stump his staff stepped in 
to criticize dukakis health insurance proposal 
this is socialized medicine and as such is a prescription for 
financial disaster said bush press spokesman mark goodin the 
dukakis plan would put the american economy in the hospital and 
would list it in criticial condition 
goodin said more than 82 percent of americans under 65 are 
insured under private or medicaidtype health insurance he said 
that 75 percent of the workforce is covered by employer health 
insurance 
an abc newswashington post poll released tuesday showed the 
candidates practically tied although the numbers showed bush 
leading dukakis 50 percent to 46 percent the margin of error of 
plus or minus three points washed out the lead 
the survey of 1271 likely voters was conducted sept 1419 
the survey found that 54 percent of the respondents dont know 
enough about dukakis compared with 70 percent who found bush to be 
a known quantity 
bush was favored among respondents who considered holding down 
taxes and preserving american family values to be prime issues 
while dukakis was favored among those who thought creation of new 
jobs to be a key issue 
although the debate is scheduled for sunday both sides were 
diputing how high the rostrums should be for the two candidates 
said a source in the bush campaign who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the source said the sixfootoneinch bush usually speaks at a 
52inch podium but had already agreed to use a 46inch one at the 
request of the dukakis campaign but on tuesday dukakis aide paul 
brountas called and said aides to the fivefooteight governor want 
it at 42 inches or 44 inches the bush campaign source said 
brountas the source said countered with a proposal that if it 
stays at 46 inches dukakis wants to use a riser that is 
unacceptable to the bush people because it introduces 
artificiality the official said

on futures contracts the cftc said in a release tuesday 
the commission also charged chilmark with unauthorized trading 
and with failing to provide customers with the price of the option 
prior to purchase 
the consent order of permanent injunction was approved sept 15 
by the us district court for the southern district of florida 
simultaneously an administrative complaint by the commission was 
settled 
chilmark founded in 1985 was a mediumsized firm operating in 
new york city but began expanding rapidly in 1986 opening seven 
offices in southern florida by 1987 it had 250 sales brokers and 
took in more than 13 million in commissions 
the cftc accused chilmark of high pressure sales tactics 
typical of a boiler room operation and of routinely making 
false or deceptive statements in soliciting customers 
the complaint described a sales operation where the paramount 
goal was to maximize commission income by maximizing the number of 
options purchased by customers and misrepresenting the profit 
potential the agency said 
most of chilmarks customers spent 40 percent to 60 percent of 
their investment on commissions it said 
chilmark officials could not be reached for comment at their new 
york headquarters early tuesday evening

firefighters used a 20footwide 
blackened dirt barrier to keep a 4dayold arson fire from 
advancing on homes near a road outside city limits despite erratic 
winds tuesday 
firefighters ordered the evacuation of 500 people along a 
10mile stretch of pleasants valley road just west of city limits 
fearing that afternoon winds could fan the blaze toward scattered 
homes near the road the residents were allowed to return to their 
homes by tuesday night 
the backfire operation was pretty darn successful the wind 
has cooperated said kirk landuyt fire camp spokesman for the 
california department of forestry 
the miller fire named for the canyon in which it began has 
burned 22000 acres since it started saturday seven homes were 
destroyed sunday it is one of two major california blazes that 
have destroyed 31 homes and about 30000 acres of wildland brush 
and timber since the weekend 
gov george deukmejian on tuesday proclaimed states of emergency 
for shasta and solano counties the first step in making state and 
federal aid available to victims of the wildfires 
elsewhere across the west however the situation was improved 
as the worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close in 
all nearly 70000 fires have been tallied blackening more than 
41 million acres about half of them in alaska 
i think fire season is just about over here spokeswoman 
madelyn kempf said tuesday as crews broke camp and began departing 
from the 34500acre red bench fire in montanas glacier national 
park it rained almost all last night she said some 200 
firefighters also left oregons willamette national forest on 
tuesday although others remained behind to finish firefighting 
efforts there 
in yellowstone national park things are very calm said 
spokeswoman marsha karle officials monday released 1000 soldiers 
who had spent more than 30 days battling flames that blackened 
nearly half the 22 millionacre park 
temperatures in the park reached only the 40s tuesday but 
forecasts called for 60s and 70s later by friday fire 
behavioralist bruce freet said just two days of dry weather could 
spell a return to the active burning seen two weeks ago 
outside vacaville bill morgan watched as firefighters burned 
brush around his 675000 pleasants valley road home as part of 
their attempt to stop the fire at the road 
we just moved in what a heck of a housewarming said 
morgan 42 
i hope they catch the sucker that started this put him in 
jail for a hundred years and throw away the key said fred shaw 
18 another pleasants valley road resident 
john ferreira a captain with the california department of 
forestry said firefighters were optimistic that the blaze wouldnt 
jump the road but said afternoon winds could push the fire to the 
homes west of the road the fire was 50 percent contained or 
surrounded at midday tuesday 
if today goes well for us we should have 100 percent 
containment thursday ferreira said 
the fire monday came to within one halfmile of the vacaville 
city limits but did not threaten the populated area of the city of 
51000 45 miles northeast of san francisco 
the 7800acre fern fire near redding 220 miles north of san 
francisco was 75 percent contained tuesday morning but winds were 
hampering firefighters there too 
im looking at the flag and its standing straight out said 
forestry department spokesman richard just 
six people have been injured in the fern fire including a man 
listed in critical condition after a tree fell on him when he was 
clearing burned timber 
the fire also destroyed 24 residences just said earlier 
reports put the number of homes destroyed at seven but officials 
said tuesday that a recount showed other homes chiefly mobile 
homes had also burned sunday or monday 
the fern fire started when someone shot out an insulator from a 
power line about 20 miles east of redding ferreira said the miller 
fire has been determined to be arson because all other causes were 
eliminated and truck tire tracks were found near where the fire 
started saturday there are no suspects

sandinista government officials and 
contra rebels blamed each other tuesday for the breakdown of talks 
aimed at stabilizing a ceasefire in the 7yearold civil war 
the two sides held talks monday in guatemala city in an attempt 
to reopen peace negotiations to end the war that has claimed more 
than 28000 nicaraguan lives 
the interest of managua is to agree on a definitive 
ceasefire which the contras have rejected victor hugo tinoco 
deputy foreign minister and sandinista negotiator told the 
progoverment newspaper el nuevo diario on tuesday 
last week the contras accepted the leftist governments proposal 
to hold the talks in guatemala but the usbacked rebels said 
they would enter formal negotiations only after the release of 40 
opposition leaders jailed in july during antigovernment protests 
the sandinistas and the contras on march 23 signed a pact which 
provided for a temporary truce and highlevel talks in managua but 
the contras say they will participate in talks anywhere but the 
nicaraguan capital where they say their movement is restricted 
the sandinistas insist that managua be the site of negotiations 
this is a clear demonstration of the lack of sandinista desire 
to establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit a 
democratic opening said roberto ferrey one of seven contra 
leaders he spoke tuesday on the rebels clandestine radio 
liberation 
a series of meetings to set a timetable for the rebels to lay 
down their arms permanently and for the sandinistas to institute 
democratic reforms ended in stalemate june 9 
president daniel ortega speaking on staterun radio monday 
night said the goal of the rebels was to make it appear the 
government was unwilling to bend so that the us congress would 
resume military funding for the contras 
the congress cut off military aid to the rebels feb 29 the 
contras citing soviet supplies to the sandinistas claim they need 
such aid to act as a bargaining chip in negotiations 
the yankees are interested through the contras to try to 
show that nicaragua has an intransigent position to approve 
military aid for the counterrevolutionaries ortega said 
we should speak with those who pay the gunslingers and not 
talk with the gunslingers the sandinista leader said referring 
to the repeated nicaraguan call for bilateral talks with the reagan 
administration 
ortega said reagans obsession with nicaragua has opened the 
possibility of a direct military invasion of his country by 
american troops he said the number of american surveillance 
flights over nicaragua have increased after the march truce 
the president also charged the us government has continued to 
supply the contras and the unarmed contras an expression used 
to describe internal opposition groups 
ortega cited the usgovernment linked national endowment for 
democracy which he said provided more than 600000 for opposition 
political parties and groups including 47000 for the la prensa 
opposition newspaper 
as many as 10000 contras fled from nicaragua in the past five 
months to base camps in eastern honduras congressional aid 
approved in march provides only for nonlethal goods to be 
distributed in honduras 
contra sources say no more than 2000 rebels remain inside 
nicaragua 
in a related development nicaraguan foreign minister miguel 
descoto brockmann said tuesday that his government hopes to open 
direct talks with the united states after a new us president is 
elected in november 
until now this has been impossible but we hope that with a 
new administration we can do this descoto told reporters in 
caracas venezuela 
the future is black if the us does not decide seriously to 
redefine its vital interests in latin america to exclude the need 
to interfere in internal affairs said descoto who is among 
delegates from 26 latin american and caribbean nations meeting in 
venezuela to discuss regional economic issues

the united states will soon resume 
negotiations on an agreement that could scale down us use of 
military bases in spain and cut off us military aid to the 
strategic mediterranean country a senior state department official 
said tuesday 
preparations for relocating the supersonic f16 jets and crews of 
the us 441st air tactical wing from torrejon air base outside 
madrid to italy are going very smoothly said assistant 
secretary of state rozanne ridgway 
spain insisted on removal of the 441st unit from the 
highprofile torrejon base early in the current talks which 
however will provide for us air and naval forces to continue 
using other spanish installations 
testifying before the house subcommittee on european and middle 
eastern affairs ms ridgway gave few details of the base 
negotiations suspended in midsummer and expected to resume soon 
but ambassador reginald bartholemew the chief us negotiator has 
just returned to madrid she said 
both governments wish to get this agreement behind us she 
said we remain hopeful that a basis for settling the few 
remaining issues can be reached soon 
ms ridgway said spain will not contribute to the estimated 500 
million construction costs nato will pay for the us units new 
facilities in italy and under the new base agreement will not 
receive us military aid 
us budget austerity last year reduced american aid to spain to 
slightly over 100 million down from 403 million in military 
credits and grants annually pledged in an expiring fiveyear 
agremeent between the two countries 
asked if the new arrangement would be consistent with spains 
role in nato ms ridgway replied spain has defined its role in 
the alliance as it deems appropriate for spain i think that 
while we might wish for more the spanish are very clear about what 
is possible and that is what we are working on she added 
meanwhile another alliance member portugal recently restated 
to a pentagonstate department team its concern about declining 
levels of us military aid but declared it intends to continue 
providing us access to lajes air base in the azores islands ms 
ridgway said 
the us delegation in lisbon had some good talks during 
consultations on broadening bilateral cooperation she said 
another round of talks is expected in october she added 
the portuguese government voiced concern last march that current 
us aid of 117 million is little more than half the 1985 level

the case of three men charged in the 
kidnapmurder of a us drug enforcement administration agent slain 
in mexico went to a federal court jury tuesday 
the jury got the case against the trio 3 years after the death 
of dea agent enrique camarena whose battered body was discovered 
at a ranch in the mexican countryside 
the defendants are alleged to have acted at the behest of 
mexican drug baron rafael caro quintero prosecutors contend caro 
ordered camarenas slaying to wreak vengeance for dea assaults on 
his drug empire 
two defendants are charged with kidnap murder and conspiracy 
and one with being an accessory after the fact in the murders of 
camarena and his pilot 
defense attorneys argued the three are scapegoats of a 
government intent on closing the books on the politically volatile 
case which disrupted relations between the us and mexico 
jurors who heard eight weeks of testimony were instructed by 
us district judge edward rafeedie then received the case they 
selected a foreman then retired until wednesday to begin 
deliberating 
earlier in the day a prosecutor delivered his final statement 
denouncing defense lawyers for outrageous and obscene 
arguments he called for conviction of all defendants 
assistant us attorney roel campos in a rebuttal that drew a 
barrage of objections from the defense and an unsuccessful motion 
for mistrial said the lawyers had stooped to unwarranted personal 
attacks on the prosecution team 
he denounced this tactic of personal slander 
they have accused us of somehow presenting perjured testimony 
of somehow coaching witnesses said campos ladies and 
gentlmen did the prosecution in this case do anything improper 
im here to tell you we did not 
special agent camarena died in the service of his country 
campos told jurors he died in the same way a marine on a foreign 
shore would die for his country 
camarena was abducted in the mexican city of guadalajara on feb 
7 1985 his body and that of his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
were found buried at a remote ranch in mexico several weeks later 
they were severely beaten and camarenas skull was crushed 
campos drew the loudest objections from defense attorneys when 
he reviewed the evidence against rene verdugo urquidez 36 and 
raul lopez alvarez 28 both charged with camarenas murder lopez 
is a former mexican state police officer verdugo is an admitted 
drug trafficker their lawyers said campos was misstating evidence 
against them 
a third defendant jesus felix gutierrez 38 is charged with 
helping caro escape from mexico after camarenas brutal murder 
lopezs attorney yolanda barrera moved for a mistrial after 
campos told jurors that the defendants do not face the death 
penalty he said he was responding to a defense statement that the 
defendants are fighting for their lives 
they face a possible maximum of life imprisonment 
rafeedie who denied the mistrial motion nevertheless 
instructed jurors to disregard the subject of penalties which he 
said was entirely taboo 
your job the judge said is to reach a verdict regardless 
of what the consequences might be 
the case stirred bitter feelings between mexican and american 
officials after mexican police officials were linked to the killing 
and to caros escape to costa rica 
nine men were indicted in los angeles in connection with the 
camarena slaying but only three are standing trial here caro 33 
and three other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on 
related charges in mexico an eighth man has died and another is a 
fugitive

visiting soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze warned tuesday that the ecological threat 
now facing mankind could be as dangerous as the nuclear arms race 
he said upon arriving for a 24hour stay in denmark that he 
expected ecology to be among issues he will discuss with officals 
here he said european issues arms reductions and danishsoviet 
topics were also on the agenda 
the ecological threat is mounting with the same speed and 
scope as the nuclear threat shevardnadze told reporters at 
copenhagens kastrup international airport 
there are really many problems in the modern world there are 
hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons and conventional 
arms systems and not the least the ecological situation which 
is also a great danger 
his official visit to denmark is the first by a soviet foreign 
minister since andrei gromyko now president came here in 1976

publishers of sexoriented 
newspapers would be forced to post 24hour guards at newsracks to 
prevent minors from buying the papers under a law given preliminary 
approval 
but city attorney james penman said tuesday he would recommend 
that city leaders rescind the ordinance because it conflicts with 
state law which takes precedence the city council gave the 
ordinance initial approval by a 42 vote monday 
penman said he had done further study since making a statement 
earlier tuesday that he believed the law would stand up to 
constitutional scrutiny 
i dont see the ordinance as opening a pandoras box or 
undermining the first amendment he had said 
were just responding to the communitys concerns about 
keeping adult material away from children thats all 
the ordinance believed by penman to be the first of its kind 
allows coinoperated machines with adult publications only if 
publishers hire guards to make sure minors arent among the 
customers 
a final council vote is scheduled oct 3 if approved the 
ordinance would become law in 30 days barring appeals 
the constitution protects publishers from laws that ban their 
written material but courts have sided with cities that restricted 
the availability of pornography to people under age 18 penman said 
sexoriented newspapers published locally are sold in newsracks 
throughout the city alongside those for conventional daily 
newspapers 
no representatives of adult publications attended the council 
meeting but the measure has drawn criticism from publishers who 
would be affected by it 
theres absolutely no way we can man all the newsracks said 
bill berk editor for the los angelesbased hollywood press 
penman wouldnt comment on the financial feasibility 
but the concern we were asked to address was how to protect 
minors how to prevent them from buying adult material and thats 
what this ordinance does he said 
police chief donald burnett spoke in favor of the measure which 
would allow officers to seize coinoperated newsracks that are not 
monitored by adults 24 hours a day 
councilmen michael maudsley and jess flores voted against the 
proposal saying they believe the money required to defend it in 
court could be better spent 
my concern is i think it is a first amendment issue 
maudsley said were going to spend an awful lot of money going 
to the supreme court 
sherri tuckett who heads a group supporting the measure was 
among those who presented a petition signed by about 700 residents 
this ordinance has nothing to do with the first amendment 
she said if adults want to purchase these publications thats 
fine but we have a responsibility to keep our children from being 
exposed to this type of material 
im not objecting to the newsracks being on the sidewalks but 
i am against them being so readily available to curious minors 
this stuff can be harmful to them

ousted president ferdinand marcos 
received at least 477 million in kickbacks from japanese firms 
between 1966 and 1981 the manila chronicle newspaper reported 
tuesday 
it said the figure was contained in a 1987 report by the 
presidential commission on good government established to retrieve 
the estimated 10 billion the government says marcos embezzled 
before his february 1986 ouster 
according to the newspaper marcos received commissions on 
projects which japanese firms undertook as part of an agreement to 
help rebuild the philippines as reparation for damage during 
japanese occupation in world war ii 
these included irrigation flood control and construction of 
highways and bridges 
it may be inferred that contracts were not necessarily awarded 
to the lowest bidder but to the japanese trader or supplier who was 
willing to give a commission to filipino officials particularly 
then philippine president ferdinand marcos the newspaper quoted 
the report as saying 
the newspaper said at least 17 million of the total 477 
million was deposited in secret swiss bank accounts 
allegations that marcos received kickbacks from japanese firms 
are not new and have been aired frequently here since the former 
president fled to hawaii in february 1986 after his ouster in a 
civilianmilitary uprising 
the allegation was based on affidavits filed by former public 
works minister baltazar aquino no relation to president corazon 
aquino 
baltazar aquino is to give a deposition in november about 
irregularities in the marcos administration marcos has petitioned 
the antigraft court to allow him to return to crossexamine the 
former minister 
the government has asked the court to reject marcos request a 
decision is pending and the government is expected to appeal to 
the supreme court if the petition is granted

for two months but then objected because he was an atheist 
pelvas left the company four months later and lost a damage 
lawsuit in which he contended he effectively had been fired but 
the eeoc lodged a complaint against the company charging religious 
discrimination 
us district judge earl carroll ruled in favor of the agency in 
may 1987 barring mandatory services at the plant the appeals 
court allowed services to resume while it considered the case but 
ruled monday that objectors must be allowed the option of staying 
away 
where the practices of employer and employee conflict it 
is not inappropriate to require the employer who structures the 
workplace to a substantial degree to travel the extra mile in 
adjusting its free exercise of religion rights if any to 
accommodate the employees rights said the opinion by judge 
joseph sneed 
the lone dissenter judge john noonan said townley had done 
enough by allowing the employee to wear ear plugs and read a 
newspaper while attending the services 
jake townley was not available for comment tuesday and helen 
townley who answered the telephone at the couples home said 
im not interested in talking about that today 
jake townley has said in depositions that he intends to follow 
gods law and continue with the services even if his actions 
conflict with us law and oneil said she did not expect him to 
back down 
the townleys lawyer said he would consult them about a possible 
appeal

the government refused to issue a 
permit tuesday that would allow an opposition coalition to hold a 
protest march saying the rally could lead to violence 
the democratic coordinates last rally on july 10 ended in a 
bloody clash between police and protesters 
interior minister tomas borge said the permit for sundays 
planned march was denied because the protest was intended to 
create disturbances 
the opposition coalition protested the decision 
political groups should have access to the means of 
communcation take part in the right of association and the ability 
to hold public manifestations duilio baltodano a democratic 
coordinate leader was quoted as saying by the newspaper la prensa 
late tuesday 
the opposition coalition is made up of opposition political 
parties and organizations forty opposition figures were arrested 
during the previous rally and face criminal charges 
borge acknowledged during a news conference tuesday that the 
denial of the march permit left the government open to criticism 
but he added it would be worse and would be a larger 
political cost and a greater pretext for our enemy and more of an 
argument for aid to the contras the ussupported rebels if 
there were provocations here that led to bloodshed in the streets 
of managua 
in washington tuesday house speaker jim wright said the cia 
admitted in congressional testimony that it used undercover agents 
in nicaragua to stir up public protest hoping the leftist 
government would overreact 
wright dtexas said he did not know if the july 10 
demonstration in nandaime south of managua was the result of us 
provocations 
scores of people suffered injuries in the nandaime rally 
witnesses saw police beat kick and shove demonstrators with rifle 
butts officials were injured by rocks hurled by the protesters 
the sandinistas later claimed the us embassy backed the march 
and charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine the 
government the following day the us ambassador richard melton 
was expelled from the country 
la prensa was suspended for 15 days and the roman catholic radio 
station was temporarily shut down 
government officials recently have charged that the united 
states seeks to justify a reason to approve renewed military aid 
for the rebels who have been fighting to oust the sandinistas 
since 1981

the government outlined sweeping 
legislation tuesday to prevent funds reaching terrorists including 
new police powers and a change in bank secrecy laws 
home secretary douglas hurd unveiled the proposals at a police 
conference in this northwest resort town the measures will come 
before parliament next year police welcomed them but civil 
libertarians expressed some concern 
the time has come for firm action to throttle the flow of cash 
to terrorist organizations hurd said 
he said the laws include outlawing handling funds for 
terrorists freezing or confiscating these funds and freeing banks 
from secrecy rules so they can inform police of suspect deposits 
we shall draw the definition of terrorist purposes wide 
enough to catch anyone connected with this trade of death hurd 
said 
police will be able to seek warrants to get at relevant 
material including bank records of transactions he said 
the laws would bar handling assets that are to be used for 
terrorist purposes even if that activity is going on in an 
otherwise legitimate business hurd said 
a court convicting a person could confiscate any property or 
money that he has handled and that is intended for use in terrorist 
acts or in connection with terrorism hurd said adding the court 
would assume the money was tainted unless someone with an 
interest in it could show otherwise 
anticipating criticism hurd said while democracies need to 
consider long and hard before adopting such measures our 
conclusion is that the police and the courts must no longer lack 
the necessary powers to find and cut off the fuel which sustains 
the engines of murder 
the proposals were seen mainly as a weapon against the outlawed 
irish republican army which is fighting to rid northern ireland of 
british rule and unite the protestantdominated province with the 
95percent catholic irish republic 
sarah spencer general secretary of the national council for 
civil liberties objected to making the defendant prove funds were 
not destined for terrorist activity saying in many cases this 
could prove an impossible task 
alan wright a senior northern ireland police official welcomed 
the proposals 
if we can stop the iras money at source we can help prevent 
them buying arms and explosives he said no organization can 
last without funds 
protestant rev ian paisley leader of the democratic unionist 
party said the measures were too little too late he said the 
restrictions could be dodged by funneling the money to the outlawed 
iras legal political wing sinn fein 
britain claims one source for the estimated 85 million 
reaching ira coffers annually is noraid a proira fundraising 
group in the united states 
hurd did not spell out whether the new laws would affect noraid 
contributions but said bilateral agreements would be sought with 
foreign governments to help seize suspect funds

announced tuesday night that eight generals were retired

reorganized and that democratic reforms be brought to haiti

seeking

there was no announcement of an army reorganization during 
avrils address the announcement had been expected monday but a 
goverment official said the high command was hesitating to make it 
fearing a loss of its authority 
it was unclear if that spurred the unrest among soldiers late 
monday and tuesday 
after a night of gunfire and violence in portauprince

portauprince on tuesday arrested their commander maj renaud 
symbert and deposited him unharmed outside the downtown army

tropical storm helene formed in the eastern 
atlantic on tuesday and showed potential for strengthening into a 
hurricane in the next day or two the national hurricane center 
reported 
helene is the eighth named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season and the first since hurricane gilbert formed in the 
caribbean and went on to ravage jamaica and mexico 
helenes winds based on satellite photos reached 60 mph 
tuesday and was moving west at about 15 mph according an advisory 
from the hurricane center 
meteorologist randy lascody said a storm path cannot be 
projected until it moves closer to the caribbean 
its going across the warmest water of the year now which is 
perfect to fuel its growth lascody said tuesday night but it 
really would be very premature to give a guess on what may happen 
it still has a long way to go 
storms that form this month near the cape verde islands off 
africas coast are often the seasons strongest because of ideal 
hurricanespawning conditions forecasters say 
factors such as lowpressure zones in the caribbean and 
highlevel winds will affect the path of the storm said lascody 
it looks like it will reach its makeorbreak point sometime 
later this week he said 
the depression that became helene had initially seemed 
disorganized but satellite photos showed circulation had improved 
the hurricane center has not yet received ship reports on the 
storms intensity 
at 1030 pm edt helenes center was located 1500 miles east 
of the lesser antilles at latitude 12 north longitude 378 west 
it will take about four days for helene to get close enough to 
the caribbean to allow an air force reconnaissance plane to overfly 
the storm until then hurricane forecasters will have to rely on 
satellite reports said forecaster miles lawrence 
he emphasized there was no way to tell if helene would become as 
powerful as the deadly gilbert which forecasters have called the 
storm of the century 
gilbert which had winds about 175 mph at its peak did not 
reach tropical storm strength until reaching the caribbean

ken wahl does not behave like a tv star 
he would consider that a high compliment 
on a recent visit to new york to participate begrudgingly in a 
minimal amount of publicity for his show cbs wiseguy he 
plopped down in a hotel dining room chair in long hair baseball 
cap and faded denim jacket the disguise helps him avoid the public 
attention that makes him uncomfortable 
wahl avoids the glitter of show business like the plague when 
not working on the series which is filmed in vancouver he lives 
in boston with his wife and kids and he doesnt hang out with 
other actors 
im just an actor when the cameras on he said the rest 
of the time im just kenny and i just do what i do i like it that 
way 
wahl who grew up in chicago had aspired to be a professional 
baseball player but an injury ended that dream when he was 19 and 
going nowhere he decided he had nothing to lose by driving out to 
los angeles to try acting it looked like a better job than 
stacking auto parts 
when id come home from work you know id watch television 
like every other average guy go to the movies occasionally and i 
just wasnt intimidated by it he said it just didnt seem 
like it was that big of a deal that it shouldnt be all that 
difficult 
i figured well i cant play baseball i didnt have an 
opportunity to go to college or anything so i thought id give it 
a shot i had nothin to lose and i got lucky 
thats the kind of luck that other actors spend lifetimes wiping 
bars and waiting tables for 
thats why i dont hang out with them wahl said theres 
a lot of sour grapes i dont need the aggravation i say 
what am i supposed to do not do it because you waited tables for 
15 years i didnt tell you to do that thats why i set the time 
limit because i didnt want to be one of those people who would 
wait tables for 10 or 15 years waiting for the big break to happen 
because a lot of them are real bitter and i just dont want to 
live life that way 
wahl gave himself 18 months to make it or go back to chicago 
and pick a trade school but he quickly landed his first starring 
role in the movie the wanderers he later had a supporting 
role in the paul newman movie fort apache the bronx starred 
opposite bette midler in jinxed then opposite cheryl ladd in 
purple hearts 
in the critically praised wiseguy wahl stars as vinnie 
terranova an agent of the organized crime bureau who goes so deep 
undercover he is sometimes tempted to go over the line the show 
languished in the ratings its first season but picked up viewers in 
summer reruns and will be back this season 
wahl says even if the series became a big hit he would prefer 
to walk away in about three years rather than dragging it on as 
long as anybody will watch 
hed like to go back to movies because ever the pragmatist 
theyre less work and dont look to see him on a stage anytime 
soon hes never been on one and says hes only seen three or four

when steve falacy saw 
open flames near the virginia cascade in fireravaged yellowstone 
national park recently he stopped his truck ran into the 
blackened woods with a shovel and attacked the hot spots 
im from montana and i wont let it burn anymore said 
falacy who grew up in missoula and lives in albuquerque nm 
he shouldnt have done it because he had no firefighting gear 
or protective clothing and because snags are dangerous but his 
wife becky said she couldnt stop him 
hes really upset she said 
the falacys were in yellowstone to check out the damage from the 
worst forest fires in centuries nearly half the parks 22 million 
acres have been charred by wildfires this summer 
it was about what i expected but steve just couldnt take it 
when he saw the flames becky falacy said he saw flames and 
went right down there you couldnt stop him 
falacys typified the reactions of people from the yellowstone 
neighborhood the states of montana idaho and wyoming 
i didnt realize how much damage there is until we saw it for 
ourselves said bonnie townsend of bozeman mont it was bad 
enough reading about it this is so awful i cant describe it 
living near the nations oldest national park generates a 
proprietary interest in its welfare and there is much anger over 
the events of the summer 
however tourists from distant parts of the united states and 
overseas are less emotional about the damage and say they expected 
to see far worse 
when it all grows back it will be twice as pretty said jack 
quiggle of huntington beach calif 
quiggle said television coverage of the fires had led him to 
believe that all id see was burned trees they made it sound 
like the whole park was scorched to the ground 
forest fires burn in a scattered pattern called a mosaic by 
foresters acres of blackened trees are interspersed with untouched 
stands other sections are burned at ground level but foliage is 
untouched 
many of the parks most popular attractions have escaped the 
fires no damage is visible at the falls near canyon artist point 
and the north shore of yellowstone lake old faithful however is 
partially surrounded by scorched trees 
a tour group from australia marveled at the parts of the park 
that remain at least so far undamaged 
we thought it might be worse said val ellerington of 
cokedale new south wales but its a beautiful place 
weve been able to see the falls and old faithful and what we 
wanted to see and were so glad we could see yellowstone at all 
she said 
milton and marie wright of nashville tenn said they too 
expected more damage 
gazing out over the spectacular canyon and the falls of the 
yellowstone river marie wright said she hated to see the burned 
trees visible from some roads but wasnt disappointed with the 
park 
the main reason to come to the park is the things like old 
faithful the canyon animals and geysers and all these things are 
here she said theres a lot left

on a host of issues from star wars and 
student aid to child care and the nicaraguan contras republican 
george bush and democrat michael dukakis offer voters clear 
distinctions on where and how they would lead the country as the 
next president 
but in many areas including how they propose to reduce the huge 
federal budget deficit or provide longterm health care for the 
elderly each candidate has been purposely vague especially about 
the cost of their good intentions 
as they prepare for a headon collision on the issues in their 
first nationally televised debate sunday night in winstonsalem 
nc here is a look at the major stands of the republican and

bushs response to the question of tax increases consists of 
three words no no no he has vowed i wont raise your 
taxes period he proposes to lower the 28 percent capital gains 
tax to 15 percent dukakis says that would cost the treasury 30 
billion or more but the vice president contends it will generate 
more revenue than it loses bush also has suggested expensive new 
tax credits for oil and gas exploration and child care 
dukakis says no serious candidate for the presidency can rule 
out the possibility that we will need new taxes to get our budget 
deficit down and our economy back on track his first target a 
crackdown on tax evaders who he says cheat the treasury out of 110 
billion a year if taxes prove necessary as a last resort dukakis 
says i would see that they are raised on the basis of the 
ability to pay he opposes a cut in the capital gains tax 
calling it a tax break for the wealthy

bushs solution to the annual 150 billion federal deficit is a 
socalled flexible freeze on all federal spending except social 
security it would allow government programs including defense to 
grow no faster than inflation some would have to be cut to allow 
for spending increases that bush has promised for education child 
care and other initiatives but he has not specified where the cuts 
would come he favors a lineitem veto and a balanced budget 
amendment to the constitution the most important action we need 
to take on the budget deficit is to hold the line on taxing and 
spending bush says 
dukakis promises to make tough choices on spending but for 
the most part refuses to say where the ax would fall he opposes a 
balancedbudget amendment to the constitution but favors lineitem 
veto authority for the president he has said he does not envision 
major cuts in domestic programs and has hinted that any savings 
from cutting back on the strategic defense initiative and such 
weapons as the railbased mobile mx missile and midgetman missile 
would be offset by a buildup in conventional weapons there are 
only four ways to reduce the budget deficit cut spending increase 
revenue bring down interest rates and improve economic 
performance he said we must do all four

bush says i believe that the reagan administrations 
approach in rebuilding americas defenses is fundamentally 
correct he has not suggested scrapping any pentagon weapons 
systems although he says the proposed singlewarhead midgetman 
missile would be costly he promises to press ahead with research 
and eventual deployment of sdi or star wars the spacebased 
missile defense system although he cautions that a full deployment 
would be very expensive 
dukakis opposes the railbased mx missile he says the midgetman 
is strategically sound but very costly he is against plans to 
build two more navy aircraft carrier task forces at a cost of 18 
billion each he has called star wars a fantasy and says he 
would reduce its research budget to 1 billion dukakis says 
republican mismanagement has left the military short of tanks 
artillery and other conventional weapons he supports the stealth 
bomber trident ii submarinebased missiles the advanced tactical 
fighter the ss21 sea wolf fastattack submarine and advanced 
cruise missiles as well as more tanks and artillery

the october wholesale heating oil contract lost 001 cent to

analysts said the market opened lower influenced by a report 
that saudi arabia intentionally was violating its production quota 
in a direct challenge to the 12 other nations of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries 
the petroleum intelligence weekly a respected industry 
newsletter said the quota violation was a saudi strategy ahead of 
next weeks meeting of the cartels price monitoring committee to 
bring other quota violators back in line with opec pricing policy 
by competing with them for market share 
the meeting is scheduled for sept 25 and 26 either in vienna

saudi arabia is opecs largest oil producer and once was 
considered the swing producer and in a position to influence other 
opec members but recently some analysts have questioned saudi 
arabias leadership role 
iraq for example has refused to abide by an opecimposed 
quota saying it needs the oil revenue to rebuild its wartorn 
country other member nations also have admitted violating output 
limits

negatively they said last weeks optimism that an opec price 
meeting could lead to production limits and higher oil prices has 
now turned mixed

dollars foreign exchange value to help curb the us trade deficit 
since then the dollar has declined by nearly 45 percent against 
the japanese yen a move cited as a key factor in cutting the 
deficit over that time 
also during the west berlin discussions the g7 nations are 
slated to review their economic coordination policies the group of 
seven comprises the united states west germany japan canada 
france britain and italy 
observers say the group of seven likely will reaffirm its 
intention to keep the dollar steady at around current levels and 
restate its belief that an excessive rise or fall of the dollar 
would be counterproductive to world economies 
world bank and imf officials and private economists say the 
importance of the berlin meeting is not its results but the new 
ideas it produces 
i dont think there will be any major decisions but there 
should be a lively exchange of new ideas peter pietsch 
economist for the commerzbank in frankfurt said in an interview 
helmut hartmann an imf spokesman told reporters last week 
we expect no historical decisions 
also scheduled to meet this week on thursday are deputy finance 
ministers of the group of 24 developing countries 
the plight of heavily indebted developing nations is expected to 
be a major topic during the berlin talks 
according to imf annual report released sept 14 the industrial 
nations are in good financial health but the overall situation 
among developing countries remains far from satisfactory 
the imf report said total debt of the developing countries 
increased 104 percent in 1987 from the previous year to 12 
trillion while their average growth rage fell to 34 percent in 
1987 from 42 percent in 1986 
the third world debt issue likely will be dramatized in west 
berlin by protests expected to be staged concurrently with the 
finance meetings about 40000 protesters have said they will come 
to west berlin to denounce what they see as unfair treatment of the 
developing nations by richer industrialized lands and calling for 
general third world debt relief according to organizers 
industrialized nations and private banks have been encouraging 
developing countries to undertake economic reform in exchange for 
help with their debts pietsch the west german economist says 
that strategy continues to show the most promise 
however some indebted nations have called for more sweeping 
solutions to their problem including partial or whole debt 
forgiveness 
a general debt relief would not help to stabilize economies 
and societies pietsch said 
we need to be flexible and look for new instruments to help 
reduce developing countries debts the debt countries are also 
creating lots of innovations in order to overcome their problems 
he said 
french economics minister pierre beregovoy has indicated that 
during the west berlin discussions he plans to unveil a proposal 
aimed at encouraging banks to step up their lending to 
middleincome debtors 
other topics likely to be discussed during the meeting are the 
us trade and budget deficits protectionism and high inflation in 
latin america 
the united states represented by its newly appointed treasury 
secretary nicholas brady is expected to stress that the next us 
president would continue the nations cooperation with the rest of 
the g7 countries 
there also could be discussion of a possible soviet entry in the 
imf 
hans klein west germanys minister for economic cooperation 
said last week he would be extremely happy with such a move 
which he said likely would speed up structural economic reform 
within the soviet union

its inventor says the baby bag was born 
of desperation 
in years past elizabeth andrews would have to grit her teeth 
and try stuffing her 4monthold daughter jesse into a snowsuit 
while the child twisted kicked and screamed until her veins bulged 
bundled and ready jesse needed a diaper change once outdoors 
her mittens fell off creating another trauma 
this was no way to enjoy winter andrews thought 
some type of baglike outfit would be more convenient and more 
protective of the babys face so andrews stitched together a cozy 
little bunting sack to replace the traditional snowsuit called it 
baby bag and began selling the insulated outfit in stores it was 
an immediate success 
its a good product to sell because its a very simple design 
and the promotional pictures are always cute because the babies 
are cute andrews said during a recent interview at her office in 
this portland suburb 
in 1980 a year after she began selling the bunting suits 
andrews and husband ben ellison formed baby bag co they sold 681 
bags that winter 
the company now sells more than 30000 bags a year and has 
recorded annual revenue over 500000 andrews also has expanded 
the companys facilities in maine expanded her product line added 
a manufacturer in seattle and begun to set up marketing in europe 
the bag which retails for 30 to 40 is displayed in several 
catalogs nationwide and sells in about 800 stores in the united 
states and canada it has been written up in good housekeeping and 
parents magazines and was displayed among several new consumer 
products on abcs good morning america program 
using the bag is relatively easy parents can slide a child in 
and out of the bag without the pushing and pulling associated with 
tightfitting snowsuits 
the baby is warmed by its own body heat which rises from the 
bottom of the bag loosening the strings at the top of the suit 
provides ventilation without having to undress a baby as with 
traditional snowsuits 
andrews 39 says the outfit was born of desperation just the 
sight of a snowsuit coming out of the closet sent her daughter into 
a 15minute tantrum 
i needed something to pop her in and get outside quickly 
because once she was outside she was fine andrews said 
andrews sewing experience was limited to repairing a few sails 
on the sloop she and her husband operated as a charter boat 
undaunted she stitched a prototype onepiece suit that drew 
favorable comments from people who noticed the curious attire 
she hired a camden tent company to make the bags she distributed 
to friends who encouraged her and her husband to open a business 
they patented the bag and tried to persuade the outdoor 
outfitter ll bean based in nearby freeport to buy their idea 
and manufacture the product but the company turned them down 
saying andrews and her husband should develop the product 
themselves 
with a few magazine advertisements a 5000 bank loan and 500 
baby bags manufactured by a local sportswear company the couple 
began a mailorder business at home in 1980 telephone orders 
poured in day and night from around the country 
soon after a product buyer at ll bean helped andrews improve 
her idea and the outfitter finally agreed to carry the bag in a 
december 1983 mailorder catalog the backing from ll bean 
coupled with a few magazine ads and displays at trade shows pushed 
annual sales to 350000 by the spring of 1984 while her business 
succeeded andrews marriage fell apart she sold the mailorder 
division to another maine company good gear for little people but 
was frightened by the prospect of managing a wholesale business 
alone 
i was a child of the 60s who never thought i would ever have 
to be serious about anything she said i had never been a 
person with a purpose or a goal 
the warm and cheerful andrews says she adopted a slightly 
sharper edge following her divorce quickly realizing that 
companies took her product more seriously once they saw she was 
assertive and persistent 
last year she moved the business to cumberland where she lives 
with jesse now 10 and her second husband leonard krill 
they renovated their barn into offices where andrews dressed in 
jeans and running shoes scurries around with her three employees 
managing a line of products that now includes mittens booties 
snowcuffs for ankles hooded jackets and pants 
the products are made in fryeburg by stitchers for a sportswear 
company who work parttime for andrews they can produce about 
7000 baby bags a month and thousands of the other accessories 
andrews chuckles at her success calling it a real story about 
how people who dont know anything about anything can do 
something

revenue of 13015 billion in the first quarter 
jeff schaefer senior vice president at the securities industry 
association said inflation pressures and concerns about higher 
interest rates had a negative effect on the securities business 
in addition to lower volume there was a lowering of 
securities prices in both the fixed income and equity markets

taxpayers not a bankfinanced 
insurance fund should pay for the multibillion dollar bailout of 
insolvent savings and loans according to the president of the 
american bankers association 
charles pistor told iowa bankers monday there was no alternative 
but to use taxpayer money because of the large and rapidly growing 
problem of insolvencies of thrifts and the deterioration of the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp the agency that insures 
deposits in sampls 
he said congress should accept the facts of life that the 
problem requires taxpayer support 
pistor was equally adamant in opposing the use of funds from the 
federal deposit insurance corp which insures bank deposits to 
help foot the bill 
the fdic wasnt created to bail out insolvent thrifts he 
told the bankers 
while deregulation has blurred many of the former distinctions 
between commercial banks and thrifts each institution has its own 
regulatory and insurance systems 
the fdic insures an individuals deposits of up to 100000 at 
commercial banks and the fslic provides similar insurance at 
thrifts the insurance funds are supported by premiums paid by the 
insured financial institutions 
pistor who also is chairman of northpark national bank in 
dallas said an aba committee would recommend today not only that 
tax funds be used to deal with the growing problem but that the 
government step in to halt the growth of the insolvencies and to 
increase the pace of liquidating insolvent thrifts 
pistor said the report to be released today in washington would 
blame the growth in thrift insolvencies on inadequate regulation 
and supervision 
the deterioration of the thrift industry and the fslic will be 
the single most dominant financial issue for bankers in 1989 
pistor said 
he estimated the bailout would cost 50 billion to 100 billion 
considerably more than predicted by the federal governments 
general accounting office the gao estimated last week that the 
cost of merging closing or disposing of insolvent thrifts would be 
in the range of 45 billion to 50 billion 
he said that while banks and thrifts were separate entities 
this is a bank problem and the cost of coping with it is 
rising by 1 billion a month 
bankers across the country are concerned there could be a 
saturday night massacre in which congress would merge the 18 
billion fdic fund with the fslic he said in an interview before 
his speech we are worried there could be confiscation of a fund 
built up by us 
bankers also are worried pistor told reporters because the 
practice of allowing insolvent thrifts to continue operating was 
cutting into profits 
socalled braindead thrifts are paying excessive interest 
rates to attract depositors forcing banks to compete and driving 
up the cost of raising money he said 
our banks feel the pressure when insolvent thrifts build up 
credit costs he told the convention 
over the long term he said congress should bring thrift 
regulations up to the same standards that exist for banks and 
should permit bank holding companies to acquire and operate thrifts

csx corps decision to sell some of its 
major holdings and repurchase up to 38 percent of its outstanding 
stock is designed to return the company to its railroad roots csx 
officials say 
the restructuring program evidences our continued commitment 
to increasing stockholder value by concentrating our resources on 
our core transportation businesses said hays t watkins 
chairman of the richmondbased transportation holding company 
watkins said monday that csx believed the firms common stock 
was an attractive investment but said the repurchase plan will 
permit stockholders who desire to sell their stock an opportunity 
to do so at a premium over the current market price 
csx parent company of csx transportation csx energy csx 
properties and csx technology will repurchase up to 60 million 
shares of common stock beginning this week 
each csx shareholder will be invited to tender shares at prices 
specified by the shareholder ranging from 28 to 33 per share 
the company will select a single purchase price and will pay that 
price for up to 40 million shares tendered at or below that level 
the stock repurchase will be funded with cash and shortterm 
borrowings csx said 
csx also will sell its natural gas transmission and natural gas 
liquid processing businesses texas gas transmission corp of 
owensboro ky and csx ngl corp of houston texas 
the company said also it might consider selling some of its 
resort properties including the greenbrier hotel in west virginia 
the csx announcement triggered positive investor reaction its 
stock closed monday at 3062 per share up 375 on a volume of 
almost 35 million shares in new york stock exchange trading 
standard amp poors corp responded to the announcement by placing 
certain csx securities on its creditwatch with negative 
implications a possible prelude to lowering the companys credit 
rating 
sampp said even though csx had cash and shortterm investments of 
11 billion at midyear the company would need to borrow money to 
finance its announced intention to trim 8200 jobs from its 
railroad payrolls 
csxs decision to unload the pipeline and possibly certain 
resort properties marked a major move away from the diversification 
strategy that csx has embraced in recent years said george t 
williamson director of reserch for financial corp of virginia 
i think what it shows is almost a restlessness at the senior 
management and board level with the price of their stock he 
said they obviously consider it very much undervalued 
the pipeline and resorts should bring csx more than 1 billion 
said andrew geller a senior investment officer for provident 
national bank in philadelphia 
when combined with the existing cash and shortterm investments 
he said the company will have more than 2 billion that can be 
used to repurchase stock 
csx earlier this year agreed to sell its csx ol and gas corp 
subsidiary for 612 million to a major french energy concern total 
compagnie francaise des petroles

kroger co the nations largest grocery 
chain has reaffirmed its plans for a major restructuring after 
receiving an unsolicited 432 billion takeover bid from the haft 
family of maryland 
kroger received the 55pershare bid for each of its 786 
million outstanding shares on monday by the hafts dart group inc 
the offer was revealed in a letter to krogers board by dart 
chairman herbert h haft 
in his letter which was made public by kroger haft said dart 
was offering shareholders 43 cash per share and securities with a 
trading value of about 12 per share 
all terms including price are negotiable and we are 
confident that together wer can determine and appropriate 
proportionate ownership of the combined companies by dart groups 
shareholders and krogers shareholders haft said 
the news of the offer pushed up krogers shares monday in 
active trading on the new york stock exchange kroger rose 175 a 
share to close at 5275 kroger based in cincinnati operates 
more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience stores and 15 
membership warehouses in 29 states the company also processes a 
variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to 
outside customers 
dart based in landover md owns the crown books bookstore 
chain and the auto parts retailer trak auto stores 
last week kroger said its board was considering a 38 billion 
restructuring that would involve a special dividend of 40 a share 
in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with a trading value 
of about 8 per share 
kroger spokesman paul bernish said that while darts offer was 
being reviewed the company has not dropped its plans for the 
restructuring which is scheduled to be taken up by the board at 
the end of september 
the company declined further comment 
the kroger bid was the first takeover offer dart has made since 
its failed bid for stop amp shop cos earlier this year the haft 
family has expressed interest in fw woolworth co and zayre corp 
this year but has not bid for either retailer 
haft and his son robert have earned reputations as corporate 
raiders because they have bought up big stakes in retailers made 
unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited from the sale of their 
stock when the companies bought back the shares or went private in 
buyouts by other firms 
their targets in the past have included supermarkets general 
corp safeway stores inc both of which are supermarket 
companies and dayton hudson corp 
the hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating a 
retail company 
in early august the hafts filed for federal approval to acquire 
a substantial stake in kroger 
analysts had mixed reactions to the latest dart offer 
edwin pincus an analyst with josephthal amp co inc in new york 
said he doubts the sincerity of the buyout offer because it wasnt 
made until after krogers restructuring proposal was announced 
if they were serious they would have done it before the 
fact pincus said theyve done it after the fact

japans economy contracted during the second 
quarter due mainly to lower demand for exports and declining 
investment in private housing the government reported tuesday 
overall economic growth as measured by the gross national 
product declined at an annual rate of 39 percent during the april 
to june period the economic planning agency said on an adjusted 
basis the gnp fell by 1 percent the agency said 
during the first quarter japans gnp grew 27 percent or at an 
annual rate of 113 percent according to the government report 
the decline in the total value of goods and services produced in 
japan during the period was the first quarteronquarter 
contraction in the countrys economy since the january to march 
1986 period when the economy briefly declined under the impact of 
the sharply rising yen 
the governments gnp growth rate target for the current fiscal 
year is 38 percent 
agency officials said a 15 percent decline in foreign demand 
for japanese products and services and a downturn in private 
housing investment over the previous quarters levels more than 
offset a modest growth in domestic personal consumption and private 
capital investment 
the greatest declines were in the yen value of exports of 
televisions video tape recorders radios and motor vehicles they 
said the japanese yen has risen by about 83 percent against the 
us dollar in the past three years making japanese products more 
expensive overseas 
but despite the downturn from healthy gnp growth levels in 
previous months agency officials said japans economy remained 
fundamentally strong 
its still showing a positive progression overall said one 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
theres no reason to think that japanese economic expansion 
has ended said kenji ito senior economist for the industrial 
bank of japan the fall in housing investments is a little 
steeper than expected but on the whole we thought the numbers 
would be in this range 
the economic planning agency had predicted earlier that the 
second quarters gnp would remain unchanged or decline slightly 
from the previous quarter after statistics showed housing starts in 
japan were peaking 
housing construction had boomed because of low interest rates 
and huge government expenditures in public works which indirectly 
stimulated construction and other industries

a federal appeals court ruling indefinitely 
blocking the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers is 
the most encouraging sign yet for halting the deal the main 
opposition group said 
the us circuit court of appeals ruling monday prevents the 
detroit free press and the detroit news from proceeding with a 
joint operating agreement until the court rules on the challenge 
brought by michigan citizens for an independent press 
the court also set an oct 28 hearing on the challenge to the 
merger and agreed to expedite the case 
john f kelly the michigan state senator who leads the 
organization comprised of advertisers and readers opposed to the 
merger said he was extremely encouraged by the ruling 
we jumped all the procedural hoops kelly said monday we 
finally got to a forum that is willing to look at the merits of the 
case 
to qualify for the indefinite halt of the merger opponents had 
to prove they have a substantial likelihood of success on the 
merits of their claim 
in granting the order the court said opponents of the merger 
have presented a serious legal question 
free press publisher david lawrence characterized the court 
order as simply another development in a very long now almost 
30monthold process 
what pleases me is the quite expedited schedule he 
said that means everyone will get an earlier answer 
the free press which has lost 100 million since 1980 is owned 
by knightridder inc gannett co bought the news in 1986 before 
the dailies asked the justice department to approve the joint 
operating agreement 
louis weil publisher of the news referred questions about the 
appellate court ruling to sheila gibbons a spokeswoman for 
gannett who could not be reached for comment 
frank hawkins a knightridder executive in miami was 
unavailable for comment 
kellys group disagrees with former attorney general edwin meese 
iii who ruled that the newspapers qualify for an antitrust 
exemption under the newspaper preservation act of 1970 
they argue that the exemption which would create the largest 
joint operating agreement in the country is unwarranted because 
the two dailies are losing money only because they have engaged in 
a 9yearold pricecutting war to put each other out of business 
knightridder and gannett are the nations two largest newspaper 
publishing companies 
the two papers have a combined weekday circulation of 12 
million the merger of the two dailies advertising circulation 
and production departments would create one of the nations largest 
local newspaper publishing companies and would result in the loss 
of between 600 and 800 jobs 
knightridder which has threatened to close the free press if 
the joint operating agreement is not approved argues that the 
newspaper is powerless to reverse losses by raising prices

opecs price committee may not call for an 
emergency meeting of the full cartel when it meets later this 
month the president of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said tuesday 
speaking at a press conference at the asiapacific petroleum 
conference here rilwanu lukman also said opecs production may be 
higher than recent estimates 
lukman said the fivemember committee scheduled to meet sept 25 
and 26 at an as yet undisclosed location has a number of items on 
its agenda besides the current oversupply of oil that has depressed 
world prices 
present oil market conditions are serious but whether they 
warrent an emergency meeting is for the committee to decide 
lukman said its by no means the only problem we have on 
hand 
while the price committee cannot determine policy or set 
production limits it has the authority to call a meeting of the 
full cartel which can 
world oil prices have declined in recent weeks on fears that 
several opec countries were continuing to overproduce adding to 
the already excessive supply of oil last week us crude oil 
prices dipped to near a twoyear low then rebounded slightly on 
reports that opec was reducing its output 
however lukman estimated opec production is between 19 million 
and 195 million barrels a day higher than recent estimates of 
between 185 million and 19 million barrels 
the opec president cautioned it was difficult to assess current 
cartel output 
i think some people are very brave or very smart to make an 
estimate he said 
on monday an industry newsletter said that saudi arabia opecs 
largest producer was intentionally exceeding it production quota 
to challenge other members to reduce their output 
lukman said opec cooperation with nonopec oil producers would 
be another topic for discussion at next weeks meeting along with 
the iraniraq cease fire he said collaboration with nonopec 
producers is perhaps the only way we can get better crude oil 
prices 
the fact of the matter is theres some form of overproduction 
and its not just opec alone lukman said 
lukman said opec is looking for specific cuts in nonopec 
production as a guide to what opec will be able to do ourselves 
to help in pushing prices up 
the cessation of hostilities between iran and iraq would help 
opec planning he said but added that he doesnt expect iraq to 
return to its opecassigned quota of 15 million barrels a day 
iraq is said to be producing approximately 27 million barrels 
of oil a day and the countrys oil minister said recently that it 
may have to increase its output to gain the necessary revenue to 
rebuild its wartorn economy 
if they want to do 27 million suppose saudi arabia says they 
wont go below 10 million barrels per day as a counter to what 
iraq said lukman asked quickly stressing his example was 
hypothetical earlier he denied he had information that saudi 
arabia was overproducing

million settlement in the massive washington public power supply 
system lawsuit leaving 18 defendants on trial over a record 225 
billion bond default

after the city council approved the settlement monday as the 
federal trial continued in tucson ariz 
plaintiffs in the case including more than 24000 bond buyers 
sued over wppss 1983 bond default which came after it abandoned 
two nuclear power plants under construction the default was the 
biggest ever in the municipal bond market

district judge william browning richland will pay wppss 
bondholders 65 million of which 3725 million will be paid by 
twin city fire insurance co 
the remaining 2775 million comes from 1982 bonds richland sold

to tucson from seattle because of pretrial publicity seven other 
utilities settled with the plaintiffs before the trial began 
earlier this month 
defendants argued in opening statements monday that a 1983 
washington state supreme court ruling was to blame for the default 
the high court invalidated agreements that 88 utilities signed to 
participate in building the nuclear plants financed by the bonds 
the cause of the loss here is almost like an act of god an 
act of the supreme court of washington said ralph nickerson 
attorney for the klickitat county public utility district 
the ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by some utilities questioning 
the agreements validity by nullifying them the court removed the 
guarantee that the bonds would be paid even if the plants were 
never built 
although the ruling applied to them none of the utilities was 
part of that lawsuit 
in opening arguments last week bondholders attorneys said the 
defendants lied about power needs in the northwest rising costs 
and construction delays they contended that if the truth had been 
told the bond would not have gone on the market 
defense attorneys argued monday that their clients revealed all 
the information they were supposed to provide and did their best to 
estimate costs and construction schedules 
the evidence will show that these official statements were as 
complete and accurate as people could make them and they were not 
filled with misstatements said attorney james hagan 
representing financial consultant blyth eastman paine webber inc 
hagan and nickerson said public utility commissioners and blyth 
employees were so confident in the information that they also 
bought bonds 
testimony is scheduled to begin thursday after a twoday recess 
wppss was formed by public utilities to build and operate major 
electric plants in washington idaho and oregon

analysts said 
we had a little technical bounce here but i dont know if its 
going to last said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
he noted a lack of sell orders at the opening bell and said the 
buying was led by investment firms and commodity funds the major 
sellers on monday 
rumors of new export sales also supported the grain markets

the prospect of naturally sweeter bread and 
new export markets is sparking fresh interest in the cultivation of 
hard white winter wheat in the plains states 
while the hard red variety has been king of the plains for more 
than a century a number of growers in kansas texas oklahoma 
nebraska and colorado are now giving white a try 
the american white wheat producers association which sprang 
from a group organized in kansas the nations no 1 
wheatproducing state says millers may pay premium prices for 
white wheat because it yields more flour per bushel 
white also has bread baking qualities comparable to hard red 
long the worlds premium bread wheat 
because of its lighter kernel color amber rather than the red 
more of the white wheat kernel can be ground and the flour is 
lighter in color than that of red wheat said don keesling 
president of the producers group 
the white wheat flour also has a slightly sweeter taste because 
the kernels lack the tannins that give red wheat bran a bitter 
taste keesling said thus bakers can save money by cutting down 
on sweetners normally used to offset the slight bitterness of red 
wheat flour 
my wife bakes with whole wheat flour from white wheat 
sometimes and people think the things taste sweeter even though 
the sugar in the recipe actually is reduced said keesling a 
chase kan farmer 
hard red wheat has been the favorite among us growers because 
it had the advantage of catching on first after russian immigrants 
introduced it to the great plains as a result little hard white 
wheat is now grown in the united states some is raised in montana 
and california and researchers in idaho and washington are 
experimenting with hard white varieties 
most of the white wheat cultivated in the united states is of 
the soft variety grown primarily in the pacific northwest and used 
in cookie and biscuit products 
the movement to hard white is small but organized the new 
producers group is incorporated as a marketing cooperative which 
controls the sale of the members white wheat said howard tice 
executive director of the kansas association of wheat growers 
the white wheat will be treated as a specialty crop and 
separated from hard red for marketing and storage to avoid mixing 
it with other varieties on the open market the white wheat will be 
sold on a contract basis by the cooperative 
keesling expects kansas growers to plant more than 2000 acres 
of hard white wheat this fall mostly in the western part of the 
state where growing conditions are best moister conditions in the 
east have caused the hard white wheat to exhibit head sprouting 
in which the kernels in the heads of the plants begin to sprout 
destroying the value of the grain for milling purposes 
kansas state university wheat breeders are working on a new 
variety with resistance to sprouting but it is several years down 
the road 
one ksu variety being tested this year may be released in 1989 
said joe martin a ksu wheat breeder stationed at the fort hays 
experiment station 
kurt feltner ksu associate agriculture dean and director of 
agriculture experiment stations said increased grower interest has 
given a dramatic boost to white wheat research begun in the late 
1950s 
within the past 18 months or so the administration has given 
us the green light to go ahead and increase our efforts because of 
the extraction rate and possible marketing niches for white 
wheat feltner said 
ktech inc a state economic development agency gave the 
university a 160000 grant that was matched with 160000 from the 
kansas wheat commission to work on white wheat and other wheat 
projects feltner said grain scientists are studying white wheat 
quality and end uses and agricultural economists are studying its 
market potential 
one of the areas being evaluated is white wheats export 
promise many of the worlds importing countries prefer white 
wheat said ksu breeder martin 
hopefully this would open up some new avenues in some 
traditionally australian white wheat markets martin said 
australian white has been a favorite in the soviet union the 
middle east and southeast asia us exporters would likely target 
some of those strongholds 
i think were probably a couple of years away from knowing 
whether white wheat is going to have an exciting start in kansas or 
whether its going to be a gradual transition said feltner

with something as simple as a greeting 
card truesillia ruth shank hopes to help bridge the gap between 
the separate worlds of the sighted and the blind 
it seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the 
simple little pleasures of life said mrs shank sitting in the 
living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her 
7monthold card company sucurre greetings sucurre means to 
assist in french 
can you imagine being 30 40 or 50 years old and having to 
wait for someone to read a stack of christmas cards to you or not 
being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for 
your wife or a birthday card for your child she asked 
the inspiration for sucurre greetings which mrs shank owns 
with her husband came while she was working on an advertising 
project with a blind businessman 
he was doing things i couldnt do even with my sight she 
said it just didnt seem right that he needed someone to go to a 
store with him just to pick out a card 
because of the limited market braille greeting cards have not 
been manufactured by established card companies said adam ash 
publisher of the gift reporter a trade publication for the gift 
industry some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some 
braille cards at christmas and others translate greeting cards to 
braille when requested 
at best what youve been able to get up until now is a card 
for a sighted person thats been brailled these cards are designed 
specifically for a visually impaired person but are still 
appealing to a sighted person as well said paul ponchillia a 
professor in the department of blind rehabilitation at western 
michigan university ponchillia who is blind helped the shanks 
design the cards 
the shanks also coowners of a yearold advertising and 
printing company hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant 
designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide 
audience underneath the design is a description of the object in 
braille inside braille appears under the message typically a 
short phrase with slightly raised letters 
one lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover 
inside the message is my hearts all aflutter 
in addition to her basic line of 25 cards mrs shank said she 
also has a line of christmas cards for the holidays 
we want the person to get the full impact of the card a card 
that everyone can enjoy said mrs shank a bubbly 32yearold 
mother of three 
she does the embossing by hand her husband michael art 
director at an area television station does much of the designing 
and printing most of the brailling is done by blind volunteers 
distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops 
but mrs shank says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up 
distributors for the cards in other parts of the country the cards 
sell for 2 and 250 locally 
if the cards catch on the shanks would like to provide jobs for 
blind rehabilitation and training groups 
and it looks like the cards may be catching on marshall fields 
has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of 
department stores as well as an alphabet book mrs shank designed 
for use by both sighted and blind children 
before getting involved in this i never really knew a blind 
person and i dont think i ever remember seeing a book thats shown 
me what brailles like she said we planned the book to get 
rid of the gap between sighted and blind children we want a 
sighted child to know what braille feels like and a blind child to 
be able to feel the letters that were seeing maybe that way we 
can get rid of some of the prejudice 
prejudice is a subject mrs shank knows well 
because im black some people might ask why im not doing 
something for a black cause well blindness knows no color when 
people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped 
people maybe theyll stop being prejudiced about black people

leave it to show business veteran thomas 
scallen to team the forces of olympic silver medal figure skater 
elizabeth manley and the harlem globetrotters 
canadas superstar on ice wont suit up with the magicians of 
basketball but she is performing under the same flag scallens 
international broadcasting corp 
scallens company purchased the hollywood califbased 
globetrotters and ice capades for 30 million in december 1986 from 
metromedia inc signing manley to the ice capades fall tour is one 
of many moves the former public defender banker and motion picture 
executive has made to revitalize the skating troupe 
he also has added a second squad to the globetrotters and hired 
female players sandra hodge nancy lieberman and joyce walker to 
draw more women to the games 
whats more scallen recently acquired the boblo island 
amusement park near detroit for 195 million he says the 272acre 
island in the lower detroit river will generate cash flow during 
the summer months when the globetrotters and ice capades are idle 
what we are is a miniwalt disney said the 62yearold 
scallen we want to expand within the concept of quality family 
entertainment 
besides the ice capades globetrotters and boblo island 
scallens company owns a controlling interest in century park 
pictures a hollywood production company that made the movie 
shoot to kill starring sidney poitier and tom berenger a 
second film south of picasso is in the works and will feature 
tom hanks 
scallen also has his eyes on more regional amusement parks and 
some television stations it was scallens sale of big country tv 
of abilene texas for an aftertax profit of 49 million that 
allowed him to purchase the ice capades and globetrotters 
lets say john kluge chairman of metromedia inc and walt 
disney are my role models scallen said 
so far scallen has transformed international broadcasting from 
an obscure penny stock company which lost 12 million on sales of 
2 million in 1986 to a 34 million company that expects to post 
net earnings this year of more than 2 million international 
broadcasting stock now trades in the range of 10 a share on the 
national overthecounter market 
the business seems to fit scallens colorful past 
there was the law degree from the university of denver that 
allowed him to work in that city as a public defender before 
returning to his hometown of minneapolis where he acquired his 
love of skating he said he returned to minnesota to join a law 
firm in which his father was a partner 
from there he turned to a banking career starting the bank of 
minneapolis and helping to finance joe robbies purchase of the 
miami dolphins professional football team but he quit that to 
launch his show business career that eventually had him running 
shipsteads amp johnson ice follies holiday on ice and the clyde 
beattycole bros circus he also worked briefly in a top executive 
post at 20th century fox 
his darting moves through the entertainment world were briefly 
derailed in the early 1980s when scallen ran afoul of canadian 
securities laws he was convicted but later pardoned for 
distributing a false prospectus on a loan he arranged to help 
finance his acquisition of the vancouver canucks hockey team 
in typical style scallen emerged from the episode relatively 
unscathed he was paroled after serving nine months of a twoyear 
prison sentence and was pardoned in 1982 by the solicitor general 
of canada later he even sold the canucks for a profit he says 
theres no way of telling how painful an experience like that 
prison term was scallen said after receiving the pardon 
particularly when i believed then as i do now that i didnt do 
anything wrong 
as ibc has grown from two employees in 1982 to 2000 employees 
this year the demands on scallen have increased but he says he 
loves it and he has refused to dilute his control over the company 
this company is my life and its a delight scallen said 
from his topfloor office in minneapolis signature skyscraper the 
ids center 
splitting time between minneapolis and an office in hollywood 
scallen operates the company with a skeletal administration that 
includes no middle managers he says he wont make an acquisition 
unless its a business i can run myself and he still spends 
time at the ice rink staging ice capades shows 
thats how i get my kicks scallen said those shows are 
the last big spectaculars in this country 
carolyn follese who follows international broadcasting for 
summit investment co of bloomington minn said her only concern 
about the company is that scallen tries to do everything 
when i started with this stock it was a dime follese said 
i just thought scallen was going to do it and sure enough he did 
hes performed some real nice miracles lately

one of the most popular games played today is 
terrorizing the american household its great fun and profitable 
too 
among those at the forefront of the movement are the media the 
government the business community the fraternity of seers in such 
fields as economics finance and science and the outright 
exploiters fear sells you know 
you can sell fear to anyone concerned about physical or economic 
well being and if you dont think so just take a look at the 
magazine rack or the book stall the field is wide open if fear 
doesnt exist you can create it 
some of the fears are legitimate perhaps but since there is no 
end to them it becomes impossible to sort them out how can you 
worry about radon the well water the air you breath and the 
weather together 
are you sure your children arent overdosing on vitamins are 
they consuming too many fats too much salt whats your 
cholesterol level when did you last check your blood pressure you 
say you havent had a physical 
you were warned about the hurricane danger and still you havent 
taken precautions dont you know the season continues into 
october tornados you know can occur at any time of year are you 
the kind of person who hasnt yet begun preparing for the 
greenhouse effect 
you say that the latter hasnt even been demonstrated thats 
pride and arrogance talking especially if you live on the 
seacoast just what will you do if the ice caps melt raises the 
ocean level and swallows up your city 
more to the moment winter is coming are you sure your pipes 
are insulated had your flu shots remember that little leak in the 
roof last winter it could become a big one in january 
how are your finances do you mean to say that in these perilous 
times when nobody knows what awful thing will happen next you 
have no financial plan no will when was the last time you checked 
your health insurance 
are you prepared for the coming recession have you made plans 
to benefit from the coming boom if that comes before the coming 
recession and what if deflation comes instead you have to be 
ready for that possibility too 
your economic preparedness kit should include procedures for 
handling the coming real estate collapse the stock market 
collapse the bank collapse have you really considered the dangers 
of that variable rate mortgage of yours 
no matter what the politicians say incidentally you should 
worry about higher taxes but you should worry too if they arent 
raised because then the federal budget will remain in deficit and 
that is bad 
hold on says economist howard ruff he says you should add the 
shrinking federal defict to your fear list 
it is to be feared in the same way that a junkie fears the 
cutoff of his supply he warns the withdrawal symptoms could 
be severe a deficit stimulates an economy when it shrinks the 
junkies get sick 
ruffs fear list includes deflation higher interest rates 
dukakis election inflationhedge investments the stock market 
and the collapse of the american family my greatest concern 
there are so many things to fear that for diversion some 
securities seers have strung together lists of things not to fear 
such as missing out on a bull market in stocks or failing to 
prepare for a strong economy 
having exploited fear a decade ago with the book the coming 
real estate crash which either didnt occur or somehow wasnt 
observed by millions of americans the same author has now written 
panicproof investing 
a fearsome situation is developing said a worrier the other 
day what are we ever going to do about all these used and unused 
fears that are piling up and polluting the environment 
he said it was really something to worry about

the us economy fueled by an exportdriven 
manufacturing boom but held back by losses from the drought 
expanded at a strong 30 percent in the apriljune quarter the 
government said today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew to a seasonally adjusted 
annual level of 399 trillion in the second quarter a 291 
billion increase from the januarymarch quarter 
it was an unexpected downward revision from a preliminary 
estimate a month ago of 33 percent growth last quarter the 
economy had grown at a 34 percent annual rate in the first quarter 
if not for the drought second quarter growth would have been a 
more robust 39 percent crop losses for the year are estimated at 
139 billion and will be even more of a drag on the economy in the 
third and fourth quarters 
the government attributed the downward revision in the second 
quarter to slightly less growth than first thought in the two 
strongest sectors in the economy export sales and investment 
spending by business 
exports of goods and services expanded at a 91 percent annual 
rate compared with the previous estimate of 116 percent 
business investment spending shot up 150 percent compared with 
last months estimate of 163 percent 
however consumer spending which represents about twothirds of 
all economic activity was up 30 percent at an annual rate 
compared with a slightly weaker 27 percent previously announced 
the linchpins of growth during the first half of this year have 
been a boom in manufacturing triggered by the export surge and the 
consequent spending spree by manufacturers to modernize and expand 
their factories 
but the strong growth has been accompanied by faster inflation 
the government said a price measure tied to the gnp rose at the 
fastest rate in nearly six years 
the gnp deflator which reflects changes in buying patterns as 
well as prices rose at an annual rate of 55 percent in the second 
quarter compared with 17 percent in the first quarter it was the 
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982 
nevertheless presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the facts plus the moderating growth rate point to inflation 
remaining under control he said the report was good news 
in another report the commerce department said that aftertax 
profits by corporations surged 89 percent in the second quarter to 
an annual rate of 1627 billion up from a 25 percent annual rate 
in the first quarter it was the most profitable quarter since the 
julyseptember period of 1983 
the federal reserve board concerned about statistics showing a 
tightening labor market and factories straining toward the limits 
of their capacity began an inflationfighting program in late 
march by pushing up shortterm interest rates 
as reports on third quarter economic activity emerge some 
economists are seeing signs of the desired slowdown among them 
civilian unemployment at a 14year low in june of 53 percent 
rose in july and again in august to 56 percent more people 
looking for work means less upward pressure on wages 
retail sales a good barometer of consumer demand fell 02 
percent in august after a lackluster 01 percent rise in july 
industrial operating rates edged up another notch in august 
from 836 percent to 837 percent but the increase was caused by a 
temporary surge at utilities rates in the closely watched 
manufacturing sector edged down from 839 percent ot 838 percent 
for all of 1988 the reagan administration is predicting real 
growth of 35 percent which if realized would be the strongest 
since 1984 
however some economists such as michael k evans a private 
forecaster in washington see the annual growth rate easing to less 
than 3 percent in the quarter ending this month 
evans said growth rates in both exports and investment spending 
will be unable to maintain their recent torrid pace meanwhile he 
says consumer spending will be hit sooner by feds tightening of 
the money supply than in the past because more people have 
adjustablerate mortgages and other loans tied to interest rate 
fluctuations 
rates have not gone up that much but consumers are being 
cautious theyre just not taking on the debt to pay for those 
bigticket items he said 
evans predicted that overall economic growth will wind down 
enough to allow the fed to lower interest rates near the end of the 
year 
but other analysts say the economy at the end of the second 
quarter had too much momentum for any appreciable slowdown to occur 
during the current quarter 
james annable chief economist of first national bank of 
chicago predicted third quarter growth of more than 35 percent 
the fastest of the year 
the sluggishness in the consumer sector he said is only part 
of an economy in transition from consumerled growth to tradeled 
expansion 
and weve got at least another year and probably two years of 
trade improvement coming he said 
nevertheless the slow numbers released so far for august will 
give fed policy makers the excuse they want to take a break from 
pushing interest rates higher between now and the nov 8 election 
he said 
the fed loves it theyre going to stand pat they can 
not involve themselves in the election and thats exactly what they 
want to do but after the election if im right that means 
interest rates will start to go up again he said

unless the financial industry takes a 
real interest in a new form of farm lending the opportunity may 
not arise again an investment firm executive told a forum of 
midwestern bankers tuesday 
jeff rodman said the newly created federal agricultural mortgage 
corp known as farmer mac could help banks keep rural customers 
and reduce the risk of writing farm loans farmers meantime are 
hoping the agency will spur competition for farm loans and hold 
down interest rates 
rodman said that despite high hopes for farmer mac there are 
many unanswered questions about the agency designed to establish a 
secondary market for farm loans one big unknown is how much of a 
demand exists for such new markets 
if farmer mac does not sell well im afraid its an 
opportunity we may not get again he told a seminar at the iowa 
bankers association convention 
farmer mac was established by congress to enable rural lenders 
such as banks insurance companies and the farm credit system to 
combine loans and use those pools of mortgages as security for 
investments sold to the public it is still in the process of being 
organized and is months away from adopting even such basic 
regulations as how its loan pools will be organized 
rodman is vice president for marketing for mabsco capital inc 
a des moinesbased company designed to provide banks access to 
secondary markets mabsco is owned by the insurance company mutual 
of new york and state banking associations in iowa and 11 other 
states rodman said his company is interested in becoming one of 
the organizations pooling farm loans and selling mortgagebacked 
securities to investors 
about 8 billion in new farm mortgage credit is extended every 
year and only part of that will qualify for farmer mac securities 
according to the federal reserve bank of kansas city mo that will 
make farmer mac a small country cousin to such providers of 
secondary residential mortgages as ginnie mae freddie mac and 
fannie mae 
the outstanding principal balances of residential mortgages 
backing securities guaranteed by those three established agencies 
formally known as the government national mortgage association 
federal home loan mortgage corp and federal national mortgage 
association totaled more than 670 billion at the end of last 
year according to the kansas city fed 
whats more farm loan demand has been in the doldrums in recent 
months 
following the farm crisis of the first half of the 1980s in 
which farm debt rose to record levels bringing down many banks 
survivors began staging a recovery assisted by huge government 
subsidies as a result many surviving agricultural and rural banks 
are flush with cash 
but rodman said credit could begin getting tight as early as 
1989 making farmer mac a welcome tool for assuring liquidity and 
enabling lenders to shift the risk of longterm loans to investors 
this summers drought reduced crop yields thinned livestock 
herds and held down many farmers income at a time when the 
government is beginning to move to reduce its subsidies and 
analysts are predicting loan demand from farmers will be growing as 
they expand plantings next spring not only are farmers expected to 
plant more next year but the price of seed and fertilizer is 
rising and interest rates have been headed higher 
if loan funds get tight we can see demand develop quickly 
to harness farmer mac rodman said 
analysts say yields on farmer mac securities should be 
competitive with fannie mae and other secondary markets for 
mortgages the securities will be backed with a 15 billion line 
of credit at the us treasury that can be tapped if losses in any 
mortgage pool exceed a 10 percent reserve fund established by 
lenders and pool operators

wheat and corn futures closed higher tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade amid rumors of new us grain sales to 
the soviet union but soybeans finished narrowly mixed on a lack of 
strong bullish signals 
it was a day pretty much ruled by rumors said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
talk that the soviets had purchased 1 million to 2 million 
metric tons of both corn and wheat prompted buying in those 
markets he said 
rumors that government officials had scheduled an afternoon news 
conference regarding the ongoing graintrade negotiations with the 
soviet union added further fuel to the rally but officials later 
denied a news conference was planned 
a rumor that the soviets had purchased 500000 metric tons of 
argentine soybean meal lent only marginal support to the soybean 
market such a purchase would indicate new demand for soybeans but 
players in the us soybean market are looking for more demand for 
the homegrown product to develop 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 404 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with september at 273 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to 4 cents higher with september at 251 a 
bushel soybeans were cent lower to 10 cents higher with

international business machines corp said 
tuesday it would offer onestop service for equipment made by other 
companies but analysts said most customers would rather deal 
directly with their suppliers than go through ibm 
ibms offer was part of its biggest announcement since june 1987 
in the field of computer networking products and services ellen 
hancock the general manager of communications systems said in an 
interview 
among other things ibm announced easier ways for its computers 
to connect to equipment made by other companies using international 
communications standards and better methods for customers to 
manage their networks by remote control 
several analysts said they had doubts about how customers would 
respond to ibms offer to serve as the single point of contact for 
customers when they had problems with any of their equipment 
whether made by ibm or another company 
digital equipment corp launched a similar service last week a 
signal that both companies see the possibility of a lucrative 
business in managing and servicing computer networks 
if customers have a problem with equipment made by say wang 
laboratories inc they would rather deal directly with wang than 
go through ibm which is a competitor of wang said stephen payne 
chief executive of pa consulting in hightstown nj 
payne said he also doubted how many customers would opt for 
another service in which ibm would install probes in a companys 
network and then monitor it for trouble from an ibm location 
you could think of lots and lots of reasons why this might not 
fly said bart stuck a vice president at probe research inc in 
cedar knolls nj 
ms hancock agreed that the services were not for everyone but 
said some customers would prefer to have someone else handle their 
network management and service

the prospect of a bidding war over kroger co 
loomed tuesday as the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
offered 46 billion for the supermarket operator topping an offer 
from dart group corp made the day before 
kohlberg kravis which earlier this year outbid dart for stop amp 
shop cos offered to pay 5850 per share for each of krogers 
786 million outstanding shares or a total of 46 billion 
the new yorkbased kohlberg kravis said in a letter to kroger it 
proposed to buy the retailer for a combination of cash debt and 
equity in the company that would formed after a buyout 
on monday the haft family that controls dart offered 55 per 
share or a total of 432 billion to buy kroger a dart 
spokesman stanley rubenstein said the landover mdbased company 
had no comment on the competing kohlberg kravis offer 
kroger stock soared after the kohlberg kravis announcement 
closing at 5625 a share up 350 from monday in new york stock 
exchange composite trading 
kroger reacted to the latest offer as it did to the dart bid 
saying it was reviewing the proposal but would continue to explore 
the possibility of a restructuring 
last week kroger said it was considering a 38 billion 
restructuring that could make the company less attractive for a 
buyout the cincinnatibased retailers board of directors was to 
review the proposal by the end of this month the company said 
in its letter tuesday kohlberg kravis noted the restructuring 
proposal and the dart offer and said its own bid will better 
serve the interests of the company and its shareholders 
the investment firm said it would pay 50 in cash plus 850 in 
securities for each kroger share 
dart chairman herbert haft also told kroger in a letter made 
public monday his company was offering shareholders a better deal 
than the restructuring plan haft offered 43 cash per share and 
securities with a trading value of about 12 per share 
kroger said its restructuring would involve a special dividend 
of 40 a share in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with 
a trading value of about 8 per share the company has declined 
further comment on what the restructuring would involve 
analyst elizabeth m shiels of the investment firm hilliard 
lyons inc louisville ky said tuesday the added pressure on 
kroger made it likely the company would sell off some of its assets 
either as part of the proposed restructuring or under new 
ownership 
kroger would most likely keep its core supermarket business but 
would consider selling its food production or convenience store 
operations she said 
i think no matter who acquires the company those are likely 
candidates said ms shiels 
itll become a smaller company itll become a leaner 
company she said 
kroger operates more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience 
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states it also processes 
a variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to 
outside customers 
dart owns the crown books bookstore chain and the auto parts 
retailer trak auto stores 
the kroger bid was the first takeover offer dart has made since 
it lost a battle for stop amp shop to kohlberg kravis in february 
dart made a hostile 103 billion offer for stop amp shop but the 
hafts target agreed to a 12 billion leveraged buyout by kohlberg 
kravis 
herbert haft and his son robert have earned reputations as 
corporate raiders because they have bought up big stakes in 
retailers made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited from 
the sale of their stock when the companies bought back the shares 
or went private in buyouts by other companies 
their targets in the past have included supermarkets general 
corp safeway stores inc both supermarket companies and the 
dayton hudson corp retailer 
the hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating a 
retail company

a former programmer has been convicted 
of planting a computer virus in his employers system that 
wiped out 168000 records and was activated like a time bomb doing 
its damage two days after he was fired 
tarrant county assistant district attorney davis mccown said he 
believes he is the first prosecutor in the country to have someone 
convicted for destroying computer records using a virus 
weve had people stealing through computers but not this type 
of case mccown said the basis for this offense is deletion 
its very rare that the people who spread the viruses are 
caught said john mcafee chairman of the computer virus industry 
association in santa clara calif which helps educate the public 
about viruses and find ways to fight them 
this is absolutely the first time for a conviction mcafee 
said 
in the past prosecutors have stayed away from this kind of 
case because theyre too hard to prove mccown said tuesday 
they have also been reluctant because the victim doesnt want to 
let anyone know there has been a breach of security 
donald gene burleson 40 was convicted monday of charges of 
harmful access to a computer a thirddegree felony that carries up 
to 10 years in prison and up to 5000 in fines 
a key to the case was the fact that state district judge john 
bradshaw allowed the computer program that deleted the files to be 
introduced as evidence mccown said it would have been difficult 
to get a conviction otherwise he said 
the district court jury deliberated six hours before bringing 
back the first conviction under the states 3yearold computer 
sabotage law 
burleson planted the virus in revenge for his firing from an 
insurance company mccown said 
jurors were told during a technical and sometimescomplicated 
threeweek trial that burleson planted a rogue program in the 
computer system used to store records at uspa and ira co a fort 
worthbased insurance and brokerage firm 
a virus is a computer program often hidden in apparently normal 
computer software that instructs the computer to change or destroy 
information at a given time or after a certain sequence of commands 
the virus mccown said was activated sept 21 1985 two days 
after burleson was fired as a computer programmer because of 
alleged personality conflicts with other employees 
there were a series of programs built into the system as early 
as labor day 1985 mccown said once he got fired those 
programs went off 
the virus was discovered two days later after it had eliminated 
168000 payroll records holding up company paychecks for more than 
a month the virus could have caused hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in damage to the system had it continued mccown said 
the defense argued during trial that burleson was set up by 
someone using his terminal and code burlesons attorneys tried to 
prove he was vacationing in another part of the state with his son 
on the dates in early september when the rogue programs were 
entered into the system 
but prosecutors presented records showing that burleson was at 
work and his son at school on those dates 
defense lawyer jack beech maintained burleson is innocent and 
but said his client might not have enough money to appeal 
besides beech said burleson is likely to get the minimum 
sentence of two years probation 
mccown said he is hoping for a stiffer sentence 
bradshaw on tuesday ordered a presentence investigation and set 
sentencing oct 21 
burleson already has lost a civil case waged against him by uspa 
in connection with the incident the jury in that case ordered him 
to pay 12000 to his former employers 
mcafee said his organization had documented about 250000 cases 
of sabotage by computer virus

the stock market posted a modest gain in 
lethargic trading on tuesday recovering some of the ground lost in 
the previous session 
its been pretty dull said charles jensen a technical 
market analyst for the investment firm mki securities corp 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which fell 1707 
points on monday bounced up 640 points to close at 208748 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
862 issues up 603 down and 500 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 14222 million shares 
up from 13577 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
16739 million shares 
the dow jones industrials opened slightly higher traded in a 
narrow range for most of the day and finished near the days highs 
jack baker head of institutional trading at shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the gains reflected a technical rebound from 
mondays selloff 
people are nervous about yesterdays decline there doesnt 
seem to be any urgency to rush into stocks i dont see the buying 
there as any more than a kneejerk reaction to yesterdays 
decline he said 
alfred e goldman director of technical market analysis at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis said the market appeared to be 
consolidating its gains of the past few weeks and expects prices to 
trend gradually higher 
the market is not acting like it is ready to start a serious 
advance because we are not seeing cumulative buying by 
institutional investors he said 
traders remain skeptical about the direction of the economy the 
fear is that if the economy accelerates inflation may rise as well 
and the federal reserve will feel pressure to push interest rates 
higher 
in its latest economic report the government lowered its 
estimate of secondquarter economic growth from its estimate a 
month ago 
mkis jensen said that while the downward revision indicated a 
more moderate pace expansion he noted that positive development 
was offset by an upward revision in a measure of inflation tied to 
the gnp figures 
as a result jensen said bond prices held in a narrow range for 
most of the day providing little support to stock prices 
with bond yields still relatively attractive jensen said many 
traders have found little incentive to take the risks associated 
with the uncertain returns on stocks

texaco inc will continue operating in 
ecuador until the ecuadoran government takes complete control over 
the pipeline and oilfield operations the two now run jointly a 
company spokesman announced tuesday 
ecuadors new center left government headed by president 
rodrigo borja announced monday night it woudl assume control of 
the transecuadorian pipeline next year and take over oilfield 
operations in 1990 when its contract with the state compania 
ecuatoriano de petroleo cepe expires 
texaco manages 375 percent of ecuadors petroleum industry oil 
accounts for about twothirds of ecuadors export revenue 
the announcement surprised us though we knew it would 
eventually happen rodrigo perez a texaco spokesman said at a 
quito press conference 
perez told reporters the government failed to notify texaco 
about its plans and said the us oil giant would have preferred 
prior talks with the government but he added the government is 
exercising its rights according to existing contracts 
under its agreements with texaco cepe can take over the 
companys operations provided it notifies the firm of its plans a 
year in advance 
a minor controversy arose monday when a government spokesman 
termed the takeover a nationalization the government later 
announced it simply was fulfilling the terms of its contract with 
texaco and not nationalizing its assets

a former connecticut bank president convicted 
of federal racketeering and briberelated charges for his part in 
the multimillion dollar fraud schemes of john peter galanis was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison tuesday 
i think youre dangerous us district judge charles l 
brieant told anthony j marchese before sentencing him to 15 years 
for racketeering and an additional five years for crossing state 
lines to commit bribery 
marchese 48 of southport conn could have been sentenced to 
a maximum 55 years in prison and 530000 in fines 
brieant ruled that marchese who was defended by a 
courtappointed lawyer had no capability to pay fines or make 
restitution 
a federal court jury in white plains ny had convicted 
marchese and galanis 45 of del mar calif and formerly of 
greenwich conn on july 5 of participating in a racketeering 
enterprise that looted banks fleeced investors and defrauded the 
government of taxes 
prosecutors contended galanis masterminded a phony oil and 
gasdrilling tax shelter scheme that netted more than 172 million 
in fraudulent tax writeoffs for about 2500 investors 
the socalled galanis organization also left a rockland 
county ny bank insolvent fraudulently took over a westport 
conn bank forced utah banking officials to take over another 
financial institution in salt lake city and stole 39 million 
from three california mutual funds 
marchese was acquitted of involvement in the oil and gas shelter 
scheme but was convicted of helping bribe officials of the peoples 
national bank of rockland county in monsey ny and defraud utah 
bank officials he was not charged in the other fraud schemes 
evidence at the threemonth trial showed marchese paid 240000 
in bribes to peoples national banks chairman and another 12000 
to its senior vice president to get the bank to buy more than 17 
million in promissory notes from galaniscontrolled entities 
on sept 13 1985 the rockland county bank was declared 
insolvent and taken over by the federal deposit insurance corp 
marchese who worked at banks in new jersey and connecticut and 
was president of metropolitan bank amp trust in bridgeport conn in 
the 1970s also helped the galanis organization take over the utah 
bank 
through the racketeering conviction the jury found marchese had 
helped make fraudulent misrepresentations to state and federal 
regulators to secure controlling interest in heritage bank amp trust 
of salt lake city and to obtain a 45 million cash loan 
in april 1987 utahs department of financial institutions had 
to take over heritage 
as of this minute i still dont feel that ive done anything 
illegal other than possibly to have much too narrow a focus and 
concentrate only on the banking aspects marchese told the judge 
before his sentencing in manhattan 
as a former bank president marchese was extremely valuable to 
the galanis organization said brieant 
the judge said marchese had no remorse and no understanding 
of why he was convicted i think youre dangerous to yourself and 
to others because of what you did and your lack of understanding 
brieant is to sentence galanis who faces a maximum penalty of 
207 years in prison and 8 million in fines on sept 28 in white 
plains
