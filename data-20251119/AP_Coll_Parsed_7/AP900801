texas on wednesday banned all fishing in 
galveston bay because of a 500000gallon oil spill threatening 
public health as well as miles of shoreline and environmentally 
sensitive estuaries 
in another development the captain and helmsman of a greek 
tanker whose collision with two barges caused the spill blamed the 
accident on a state pilot at a federal hearing 
and federal officials approved the use of oileating microbes to 
help clean up the spill which threatens birds and other wildlife 
in nesting grounds around the bay 
the greek tanker shinoussa collided saturday with two of three 
barges towed by the tug chandy n in the houston ship channel which 
passes through the bay heavy black oil spewed from the barges 
until tuesday the doublehulled tanker didnt leak 
the state health department banned fishing as of midnight 
wednesday because the spill presents a health threat according to 
neil travis chief of the agencys consumer health protection 
bureau in austin 
its as much a precautionary measure as anything else 
travis said adding that officials grew concerned after seeing 
shrimpers pull trawls through an oil slick some oiltainted shrimp 
have been caught 
the indefinite ban for all of galveston bay and connecting 
waters covers all aquatic organisms including fish crabs oysters 
and shrimp said biologist don pitts of the state parks and 
wildlife department which will enforce the ban 
everybodys just kind of taken by surprise said john 
collins secretary of the texas live bait dealers association 
theres really not too much you can say just do it its for 
peoples health 
coast guard officials said less of the 17mile slick was visible 
wednesday indicating the oil either had begun dissipating or had 
sunk 
but environmentalists said if the oil has reached the bays 
bottom it may present an even more serious threat to wildlife 
i think its a worse situation than if it was floating on the 
surface said larry mckinney of the state parks and wildlife 
department he said oil on the bottom could kill small aquatic 
life breaking a crucial link in the food chain 
the bay is protected from the gulf of mexico by barrier islands 
that contain nesting grounds for dozens of species of birds and 
other wildlife environmentalists fear that the proximity of the 
islands and the oils thickness would make it difficult to 
dissipate 
two seabirds have died and oily birds were spotted but there 
were no new reports of dead wildlife 
cleanup crews used six skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to 
scoop up the oil which already has tainted several beaches around 
the bay more than 50000 gallons of oil had been retrieved by 
wednesday coast guard officials said 
salvage crews slid a sling under the crippled barge to help 
refloat it said coast guard spokesman dennis schaefer 
the tankers captain and helmsman testified at the opening 
session of a hearing by the coast guard and the national 
transportation safety board 
capt nikolos fioratos of greece and helmsman mohammad s haque 
33 of bangladesh claimed pilot raymond fincher of the houston 
pilots association misdirected the shinoussa into the path of the 
barges 
haque said the shinoussa headed out to the gulf of mexico had 
been traveling alongside a liberian tanker headed into the ship 
channel just before the accident occurred the barges also were 
heading in behind the liberian ship hellespont faith 
fioratos 44 said he thought fincher had been directing the 
tanker to travel too fast at 14 knots and too close to the 
liberian ship 
it was very close my estimate is about 10 meters fioratos 
said we almost greeted the other ship by hand 
fioratos said he didnt express his concerns because he didnt 
want to make trouble for his crew 
haque said the pilot ordered him to go left then quickly 
ordered him to go right after realizing the tanker was headed for 
the barges 
haque said he responded immediately but it was too late the 
experienced helmsman hadnt steered through the channel before 
fincher who has yet to testify disputed haques account he 
put the rudder the wrong way at a critical time the pilot said 
a home video shot by a timothy hanes of spring who was on a 
sailboat during the accident could provide some answers officials 
said 
hanes said the shinoussa passed a vessel on the left then 
collided with the apex towing co barges 
hanes is to testify and the videotape is to be aired during the 
threeday hearing 
a federalstate task force said oileating microbes could be 
spread thursday on the spill which extends in patches for 17 miles 
in a process called bioremediation the microbes convert the oil 
into a fatty substance fish can eat 
the coast guard continued to direct traffic through the channel 
opening one lane at a time the shipping disruption costs about 
15 million a day said ted thorjunssen president of the west 
gulf maritime association

the resignation last month of atlantas roman 
catholic archbishop was prompted by the discovery of his twoyear 
relationship with a woman his successor said wednesday 
archbishop eugene a marino 56 who was the nations highest 
ranking black roman catholic resigned july 10 for what he said 
were health reasons and the need for spiritual renewal 
psychological therapy and medical supervision he had 
relinquished his duties in may because of severe stress and a near 
heart attack 
but atlanta television station waga reported wednesday that 
marinos resignation followed the churchs discovery of a 
relationship between the archbishop and a lay minister vicki r 
long 
marinos temporary successor bishop james p lyke said the 
former archbishop gave permission wednesday to confirm the 
relationship after the television stations report 
neither the television station nor lyke said if the relationship 
was sexual 
lyke told the atlanta constitution that church officials were 
told in march that marino was involved with a woman he defended 
the decision of the archdiocese to withhold the details of marinos 
resignation he said marino was the only one who could call the 
shots 
the rev peter dora atlanta archdiocese spokesman said church 
officials wouldnt comment further until a news conference thursday 
in 1987 ms long filed a 23 million paternity suit against a 
priest donal keohane of columbus alleging that he fathered her 
child the church is paying child support but denies that keohane 
is the father of child a blood test later concluded that keohane 
was not the father of the child 
ms long declined to comment about the allegations involving 
marino 
the television station reported it had obtained photographs of 
marino and ms long attending various functions together and a 
flight insurance policy for a trip to mexico taken by marino ms 
long was listed as the archbishops beneficiary on the policy 
church officials refused to say where marino was 
marino was ordained in 1962 and consecrated as a bishop in 1974 
he was named archbishop of atlanta in may 1988 the nations first 
black archbishop 
he came to atlanta coming from washington dc where he was 
auxiliary bishop to cardinal james hickey 
the pope appointed lyke auxiliary bishop of cleveland to be 
administrator of the archdiocese of atlanta which covers 69 
counties in northern georgia with catholic population of more than 
150000 until a new archbishop is appointed

the president of the american bar association 
reported that 55000 cash given him by a client was stolen from a 
hotel safe deposit box 
stanley chauvin a louisville ky lawyer who heads the aba 
said he had put the money in a rented box at the hyatt regency 
hotel where he is staying during the groups annual convention 
chauvin 55 said he discovered the money missing when he 
checked the box tuesday night he declined to say how much money 
disappeared 
but hotel spokeswoman nancy ruth said chauvin reported 55000

cloth bag 
chauvin told police he had picked the money up from a client 
on the way from louisville lt kenneth bringe said wednesday

tampered with but police questioned employees took fingerprints 
and checked the boxs lock 
ms ruth said there are only two keys to the box a guard key

iraqi troops have launched an offensive 
against kuwait the kuwaiti embassy said wednesday night 
faleh bader director of the ambassadors office said we 
confirm there is an offensive at kuwait border and we have no 
comment 
the attack started about midnight kuwaiti time 5 pm edt 
bader said 
earlier in the day the iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat was 
summoned to the state department afternoon for a meeting with 
assistant secretary john kelly 
department spokesman richard boucher said kelly repeated to the 
iraqi envoy the us desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions 
with kuwait and urged iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations 
in the region 
kelly told a house subcommittee tuesday that while the united 
states has no treaty obligations that would mandate military 
support for kuwait the united states does believe strongly in 
respect for territories of all states in the region 
the united states whose persian gulf naval patrols helped iraq 
defeat iran in the 19801988 war has six warships in the area 
they have been conducting exercises since july 23 with forces of 
the united arab emirates some 700 miles southest of kuwait 
iraq had moved about 100000 troops to its border with kuwait 
after claiming that kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the 
opec cartel had depressed the world price thus diminishing iraqs 
revenue and that kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that 
straddles the border 
iraqi officials on wednesday walked out on talks in jiddah 
saudia arabia aimed at resolving the 2weekold crisis with 
neighboring kuwait and complained that kuwait was not negotiating 
seriously 
iraq threatened to invade once before in 1961 after britain 
ended its protectorate over kuwait iraq then claimed kuwait as 
part of its territory but the appearance on the kuwaiti side of 
the border of troops from britain and other arab states deterred 
further action by iraq

new york air traffic controllers declared a fuel 
emergency aboard an avianca jet from colombia after the pilot said 
he only had 15 minutes of fuel a federal aviation administration 
spokeswoman said wednesday 
the tuesday night incident was a chilling reminder of januarys 
avianca flight 52 which crashed into a hillside in cove neck long 
island killing 73 people on board after it ran out of fuel en 
route to kennedy international airport 
air traffic controllers declared a fuel emergency tuesday on 
board avianca flight 20 also heading for kennedy airport 
controllers made the declaration after they detected some 
reluctance by the planes pilot to call a fuel emergency according 
to joseph fuscella an air traffic controller 
the controllers immediately put all other planes in the area on 
hold and gave the 767 jetliner a straightin pattern to kennedy 
where it landed safely at 924 pm said diane spitaliere the faa 
spokeswoman 
the jet reportedly had only 5 minutes of fuel left on board when 
it landed according to fuscella and spitaliere 
spitaliere said that the faa is looking into the incident 
fuscella said avianca 20 en route from cali and bogota had 
followed the same flight path up the east coast as flight 52 
flight 20 apparently was placed in an undetermined holding 
pattern in the washington area 
the incident developed about 30 miles south of kennedy airport 
when the pilot told new york regional controllers he had only 15 
minutes of fuel left 
the air traffic controllers alerted controllers at the local 
control station known as tracon or new york terminal radar 
control based in garden city on long island 
there was some confusion as to whether the pilot had said 15 
minutes or 51 minutes said fuscella 
tracon controllers contacted the pilot who confirmed that he 
had only 15 minutes of fuel on board 
he was asked if he wanted to declare a fuel emergency said 
fuscella 
when they detected some reluctance in his voice the 
controllers mindful of the avianca crash decided to declare an 
emergency and bring him right in said fuscella 
avianca flight 52 crashed after being placed in holding patterns 
for 90 minutes the crew apparently failed to properly alert 
controllers of a fuel emergency 
if an emrgency hadnt been declared tuesday the plane would 
have been instructed to take its position at the end of a line of 
aircraft waiting in a pattern to land at kennedy 
the final landing flight then would have taken approximately 25 
minutes according to fuscella 
by putting flight 20 at the head of the line it took the plane 
12 minutes to land he said 
fuscella said there were numerous planes in a holding pattern 
tuesday because of severe thunderstorms in the area and normal 
evening congestion 
the flight scheduled to land at 824 pm was an hour late but 
it was not clear where the delay occurred or what caused it 
the controllers proceeded on the side of caution in light of 
the other crash said spitaliere 
fuscella agreed saying this certainly was a deja vu 
situation

the new director of a bulgarian weapons company 
whose arms have been linked to terrorists plans to share 
information with western governments the new york times reported 
the newly appointed general director of the kintex arms company 
anton saldjiski said an interview published in the papers 
thursday editions that the company had records of all weapons and 
ammunition exported to warsaw pact nations and to countries like 
libya syria and iraq 
some of these nations are suspected by western governments of 
having transferred arms to the palestinian liberation organization 
the irish reublican army and other groups 
if western governments obtain weapons used by terrorists and 
trace them to bulgaria kintex will tell them what country the arms 
were orginally shipped to saldjiski said 
he said kintex had just joined interpol the international law 
enforcement group 
he said kintexs customers must sign contracts stipulating that 
they wont deliver the weapons to a third country 
to my knowledge we have not been involved in the direct supply 
of arms to terrorists but it is possible that these arms have 
reached such groups via governments we have supplied legally he 
said

plo

the iron curtain that bisected europe 
has been lifted but it remains in place above the arctic circle 
an electrified fence runs along the soviet side of the 120mile 
frontier said hugo overgaard the norwegian border commissioner 
norwegian and soviet scouts exchange salutes still without 
speaking but the norwegians say they no longer crouch into firing 
position when they see each other 
soviet officials require at least two weeks notice of a visit 
from norway soviet civilians are allowed within 18 miles of the 
frontier only if they live in the area overgaard told reporters 
the border joins norway with the kola peninsula home of the 
soviet nuclear submarine fleet the gulf stream keeps the barents 
sea free of ice allowing the soviets to operate naval bases and 
the port of murmansk through the winter 
to the north is a vast sea area without defined national 
boundaries spokesmen for statoil norways national oil company 
say its petroleum reserves may surpass those of the north sea 
central europe is being disarmed while in the north there is 
continued strong dynamics with naval forces said sverre lodgaard 
of the peace research institute in oslo the nordic area does not 
get its share of the detente in other regions 
soviet border guards held a norwegian man briefly in july and 
said he was captured on their side of grens jakobselv a stream 
marking the border 
a week before soviet guards chased and shot at a norwegian 
fisherman who denied violating the frontier norway protested the 
shooting but foreign ministry spokesman vegard ellefsen said the 
soviets did not provide an explanation 
there are signs of change border guards from the two countries 
plan a soccer match this month at kirkenes on the norwegian side 
and the possibility of providing visas in two days is being 
discussed 
norways territory on the frontier is bleak low hills forests 
and rocks and relatively unfortified 
juri kosereff son of soviet refugees lives on the norwegian 
side of the grens jakobselv which runs through a sandy beach into 
the sea 
in the old days there was no border here he said we went 
over the river back and forth as we wanted on the other side were 
a store and an inn he and an old woman are the only remaining 
inhabitants of what once was a village straddling the border 
when kosereff was young the other side of the river and part of 
the village was in finland the soviet union claimed the territory 
after world war ii and sealed the border 
fewer than 30 people a year crossed the line in the late 1940s 
norwegian officials said the traffic gradually increased to 3000 
last year 
soviet officials require two weeks to process applications by 
visitors planning day trips by sea ferry or airplane from kirkenes 
to murmansk a travel agent said those taking organized bus tours 
must apply three weeks ahead and visas for private land trips take 
four to five weeks 
all land travelers pass through a norwegian border post at 
storskog 7 miles south of kirkenes 
frontier conditions have been affected very little by 
variations in eastwest relations said overgaard the border 
commissioner 
yellow signs and border poles along the grens jakobselv make 
clear that offlimits soviet territory starts about 11 yards away 
kosereff plans to visit the soviet union for the first time on 
a bus trip to see an aunt in murmansk the straightline distance 
is about 110 miles but his bus will have to go hundreds of miles 
out of its way through finland to avoid soviet military areas

the soviet union is piling up a record harvest 
but much of the grains and vegetables are expected to rot rather 
than ease the countrys worsening shortage of food 
the centrally planned economy has been unable to adjust to the 
bounty and the stunning yields reported by the news media are 
threatened by shortages of fuel storage space and transport 
while consumers face barren shelves in city grocery stores and 
officials warn of critical shortages by winter soviet television 
shows mounds of fresh wheat dumped in rural parking lots because 
grain elevators are full 
the soviet union annually loses 20 to 30 percent of its food 
harvest on the way to market grain and vegetables pour from leaky 
trucks rutted highways slow food convoys railroad schedules 
become scrambled and air transport for produce is rare 
last week russian federation president boris yeltsin ordered 
emergency incentives in his republic to prevent a catastrophe 
in the food supply other officials have warned of civil strife if 
the food shortages are not solved 
this is the moment when it is necessary to move from words to 
deeds or moscow could face winter without vegetables or 
potatoes food producers warned in a letter printed saturday on 
the front page of moskovskaya pravda 
it said much of the moscowarea vegetable crop was endangered by 
a shortage of hands for the harvest 
preliminary estimates indicate the grain crop in this critical 
year for soviet reform could top 230 million tons soviet 
television reported monday that would surpass last years record 
211 million tons and swamp 1988s mediocre tally of 195 million 
tons 
us experts predict the soviets will harvest 215 million tons 
of grain 
this year food grain harvests are enormous tass said 
reporting prime minister nikolai ryzhkovs visit to a farming area 
tuesday 
as one example tass said the saratov region is producing 44 to 
66 bushels per acre instead of the usual 66 to 88 bushels for the 
same range 
us wheat yields this year are running at 386 bushels per 
acre according to the department of agriculture 
ryzhkov also visited neighboring northern kazakhstan where one 
collective farm is producing three times as much grain as last 
year television news reported but 250 railcars a day are needed 
to haul it away and officials are able to provide only half that 
number 
farmers shown on soviet television suggested the radical step of 
allowing anyone to buy grain and store it themselves under soviet 
central planning collective farms grow grain and sell it to the 
state 
yeltsins emergency measures permit farmers in russia to sell on 
the open market 30 percent of the grain they are under contract to 
sell to the state at fixed prices according to the government 
newspaper izvestia 
yeltsin also promised that anyone who works on the harvest would 
be give special coupons allowing them to buy scarce consumer items 
soviet farms previously relied on temporary labor drafted from 
urban factories to help with the harvest but now that president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms call for factories to turn a profit 
they are refusing to send employees to the fields 
regional officials in yaroslavl declared a state of emergency 
and ordered local factories to provide labor to the farms izvestia 
reported 
in the southern republics of georgia and armenia a blockade of 
the railways has cut fuel deliveries to the farming areas that 
produce much of the soviet unions fresh fruits and vegetables 
tass news agency reported tuesday 
the blockade is aimed at enforcing promised multiparty reforms 
in georgia interfax said it has cut all train routes into georgia 
and armenia except those through azerbaijan armenia is locked in a 
deadly territorial dispute with azerbaijan 
meanwhile tass reported tuesday that yeltsin who is pushing 
his republic to more radical reforms than those approved by 
gorbachev has called a session of the russian congress for the end 
of october that session would consider the right to own land to 
inherit purchase and sell it tass reported tuesday 
gorbachev has called for longterm leasing of farmland but not 
outright ownership with the inherent right to earn a profit on 
buying and selling it which is abhorrent to diehard communists 
however gorbachev may be changing his views former politburo 
member yegor ligachev told reporters several weeks ago that he 
split with gorbachev because he could not agree with the soviet 
presidents new support for private property

supreme court nominee david h souter renewed 
his lowprofile tour of senate offices tuesday even ducking a 
reporters question about exiled new york yankee owner george 
steinbrenner 
while chatting briefly with journalists outside one senators 
office the new hampshire judge was asked any kind words for 
george steinbrenner 
after laughing heartily souter resolutely skirted controversy 
yet again i wouldnt touch anything that hot he replied 
steinbrenner was banned by the commissioner of baseball monday 
from any further involvement in the management or daytoday 
operations of the yankees 
most of the questions thrown at souter focused on mondays 
release by people for the american way a liberal group that 
supports abortion rights of a 1976 brief in which the new 
hampshire attorney generals office referred to abortion as the 
killing of unborn children 
souter who was the state attorney general at the time did not 
author the brief and the lawyer who did said tuesday i dont 
recall him looking at the language talking to me about the 
argument or approving any line of argument 
souter declined tuesday to comment on the brief asked if he 
thought it would play a role in his confirmation hearings set to 
begin sept 13 before the senate judiciary committee he answered 
youll have to tell me 
also while souter was state attorney general he opposed a 
federal civil rights regulation in 1976 that eventually was upheld 
by the supreme court and was defended by the thenus solicitor 
general robert bork the washington post said in wednesday 
editions 
the equal employment opportunity commission rule required the 
state to submit a racial breakdown of its employees and souter 
argued that it treated every employer as if he were a suspected 
bigot 
the rule made the state color conscious rather than 
colorblind spouter argued according to the newspaper report 
senators on both sides of the issue say souter will be asked 
about abortion during the september hearings 
the supreme court is closely divided over the issue four of the 
courts current eight members appear ready to overturn the 1973 
decision in roe vs wade that legalized abortion that makes 
souters potential vote a critical one 
souter paid courtesy visits tuesday to four senators 
republican charles grassley of iowa and democrats dennis deconcini 
of arizona tim wirth of colorado and patrick moynihan of new york 
he was accompanied by fred mcclure president bushs 
congressional liaison 
asked at one stop whether he had any criticism of the news 
coverage seeking to discern his views on abortion and other issues 
souter said theres nothing id wish to say thats not an 
endorsement 
souter declined to predict how much time he would be spending in 
the nations capital in advance of the confirmation hearings i 
havent worked out a schedule he said

new yorkers may not have heard the news over the 
screech of subway trains the boom of oversize car stereos and the 
wail of firetruck sirens but the nations noisiest city is getting 
even louder 
were losing our hearing and we dont even know it says 
antinoise activist arline bronzaft a lehman college psychology 
professor whos conducted research on the effects of noise 
on a recent morning she stood at an upper east side 
intersection decibel meter in hand trying to be heard over the 
rumble of trucks and buses 
were getting 90 decibels and this isnt even broadway she 
shouted 
she crossed the street to where a jackhammer was pounding a 
sidewalk the meter hit 100 
noise is where cigarette smoking was 30 years ago bronzaft 
says everybody knows its bad for you but a lot of people dont 
do anything about it 
prolonged exposure to 85 decibels or more can damage your inner 
ear and cause permanent hearing loss increase your blood pressure 
and cholesterol give you ulcers and indigestion 
even on a side street with no traffic bronzafts noise meter 
ranged between 70 and 75 like a room with an loud air conditioner 
or a quiet vacuum cleaner 
although there is no scientific evidence that new yorkers are 
particularly hard of hearing studies have indicated that people 
living in rural settings tend to lose less hearing over a lifetime 
than those who live in cities 
samuel stempler director of the citys bureau of air resources 
says new york is considered the nations noisiest because of its 
population density fourteen times that of any other city and 
its getting noisier because of increased traffic and construction 
such increases and new sources of noise boost the average noise 
level in the city by as much as a decibel a year according to some 
experts 
if you want to put up a building you need an environmental 
impact statement that says it will increase the noise level by no 
more than two decibels explains bronzaft but no one checks 
after the building is built and no one figures out the overall 
affect of a lot of new buildings 
noise seems to beget noise dr thomas fay of columbia 
presbyterian medical center says that as the city gets louder so 
must fire engine sirens to be heard over the din firefighters lose 
more of their hearing and demand even louder sirens 
and theres always a new earache such as boom cars 
vehicles equipped with huge speakers sometimes filling the rear 
floor space of hatchback cars 
bronzaft was visiting her mother the other day when one drove 
past suddenly the whole house shook she recalls i thought 
someone had turned on the radio full blast in the next room 
however boom cars still rank behind the three airports rush 
hour traffic air conditioners discos car alarms and horns 
construction and elevated subway tracks 
the citys noise code which prohibits casual honking and 
construction noise between 6 pm and 7 am is one of the 
nations strictest the problem is enforcing it 
new yorkers file more than 16000 noise complaints a year 
bronzaft notes that last year the city department of environmental 
protection issued citations in response to only about 20 percent of 
complaints 
stempler says his office has only 42 agents to cover noise and 
air pollution complaints seven days a week and police have other 
things to do 
besides he says noise is a relative thing what i perceive 
as noise might be music to your ears

the commerce department approved the sale of 
industrial furnaces to iraq even though the manufacturer told us 
officials the items could be used to produce nuclear weapons 
material documents show 
the white house intervened to block the sale of the furnaces 
this month effectively reversing the commerce departments earlier 
decision 
the action came as congress passed sanctions against iraq and 
the administration weighed whether to restore iraq to a list of 
countries that support terrorism us officials believe that iraqi 
president saddam hussein is seeking to develop nuclear weapons 
technology 
a senior state department official said tuesday that the united 
states is placing new restrictions on exports of items to iraq that 
could be used for the middle eastern countrys development of 
missiles or chemical and biological weapons 
iraqs threats against neighboring kuwait and its massing of 
troops along the two countries disputed border are just the latest 
moves that are causing the administration grave concern 
assistant secretary john h kelly told a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee 
commerce department officials had discussed the industrial 
furnaces with officials of consarc corp the rancocas njbased 
furnace manufacturer several times in 1989 according to minutes 
of the conversations obtained by the associated press 
for instance on feb 22 1989 consarcs president raymond 
roberts and tina olnick a company employee held a meeting with 
alan c stoddart a special agent from commerces office of export 
enforcement 
mr stoddart said the departments main concern is nuclear 
nonproliferation according to the minutes 
the minutes continued mr roberts again stated that the 
customer tells us they will be making titanium castings for making 
medical prostheses 
however the equipment can be used without modification on 
zirconium for which the principal end use is nuclear 
gary milhollin executive director of the wisconsin project on 
nuclear arms control said the highperformance furnaces such as 
the ones iraq sought can be used for a number of purposes 
including melting plutonium for bomb cores and titanium for missile 
nose cones 
the iraqis said the titanium a lightweight metal would be used 
for artificial hip and knee joints for victims of the persian gulf 
war with iran 
in a feb 15 1989 conversation roberts told jeff tripp of the 
commerce department that despite the iraqi statement there is 
nothing to stop them from melting zirconium the main use of which 
is cladding material for nuclear fuel 
on march 15 1989 ms olnick consarcs contract administrator 
asked the commerce department whether the company needed a 
validated export license to ship the furnaces 
an individual validated export license is generally needed to 
export items like the furnaces that would appear to have a direct 
nuclear capability said a commerce department official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
in the letter ms olnick said consarc did not believe a 
validated license was necessary but we would appreciate an 
assessment of the department of commerce 
she added we have informed the customer that we will not 
proceed with the project until we have received approval to export 
the equipment in either the form of an assessment that an export 
license is not required or an approved export license 
roberts could not be reached by telephone tuesday to discuss the 
documents but he said earlier his company had received permission 
to ship furnaces to iraq ms olnick said she could not talk about 
the matter 
commerce department officials have refused to talk about the 
consarc case 
but after a furnace was seized by the customs service on a dock 
in philadelphia last month us officials said it would require 
consarc to obtain a validated license it is unlikely such a 
license will be granted they said 
the state department has asked the commerce department to place 
restrictions on export of items with potential weapons uses that 
are much like the curbs already in place for nuclear technology 
according to kellys testimony tuesday and congressional sources 
briefed on the moves 
the change would mean a license is required for any item that 
could be destined for a program of chemical or biological weapons 
development or for use in developing missile delivery systems for 
weapons kelly said 
the restrictions should be put in place within the next month 
the state department official said

stripping away centuries of damask marble and paint 
in the apartment where ignatius of loyola worked and died 
restorers have discovered the simple way the saint lived his final 
years 
today his jesuits opened the rooms to the public 
to inaugurate the restored rooms on tuesday the 434th 
anniversary of the spaniards death the order chose a brief 
ceremony of prayer led by peterhans kolvenbach a dutch priest who 
is head of the society of jesus the formal name of the roman 
catholic order whose members began missions and universities 
worldwide 
tourists will now be allowed to visit the four small rooms in 
what is now a jesuit residence attached to the church of jesus 
where the saint is buried in the heart of downtown 
theyll be able to see the crudely finished poplarandfir desk 
where ignatius worked on the constitution for the order he founded 
and stroll through the dining room where he chatted with his 
missionaries before they headed for distant india or central 
america 
there is even a pair of leather slippers believed to be the 
saints slippers 
visitors will discover that the man who traded nobility for 
avowed poverty and chastity was a tired old man who shuffled 
along in his bedroom slippers trying to continue his religious 
work while suffering badly from gallstones in his last years said 
the rev thomas lucas a jesuit from california who directed the 
14monthlong restoration 
lucas lived in the residence in the early 1980s while a student 
i was always embarrassed when friends came and asked to see 
the rooms whose walls were covered in the 19th and early 20th 
century with red damask drapes and blocked by marble altars said 
lucas 
before beginning the restoration lucas said he read all 7000 
letters the saint had written while working in the apartment from 
15441556 
now the walls are whitewashed a wooden cabinet used by ignatius 
in his bedroom serves as a simple altar and six layers of paint 
were removed from the ceiling by a team of restorers headed by an 
expert from the vatican museums 
the 500000 restoration was paid for by donations solicited by 
jesuits and grants from foundations lucas said it is part of 
preparations for the orders celebration of the 500th anniversary 
next year of the saints birth 
the jesuits 25000 strong make up the churchs largest order 
ignatius apartment is across the street from venezia palace 
one of the residences of pope paul iii who approved the orders 
constitution in 1540 
ignatius chose to live downtown to be where the action was 
lucas said the followers of ignatius served the prostitutes 
daughters of prostitutes taught the catechism on the streets 
his philosphy was go anywhere do anything in service to the 
church lucas said 
ignatius was aware of a deep faith in 1521 while reading about 
the life of jesus the work was one of the few books in his house 
where he was recovering from a wound 
he was imprisoned briefly during the inquisition he also tried 
to go with his small band of followers to the holy land to convert 
moslems to christianity but warfare thwarted that plan and he 
headed to rome instead 
in contrast to his austere final years ignatius is buried in a 
golden tomb imbedded in a bronzeandmarble decorated altar in the 
church itself lighted by chandeliers and studded with precious 
stones

gene therapy a new medical magic bullet in 
the war on cancer diabetes and many inherited disorders could be 
used on patients for the first time this fall 
a federal panel approved the use of gene therapy for two 
disorders on tuesday and a national institutes of health scientist 
said that if the technique works it gives medicine a powerful new 
way to cure the incurable 
this is the first step in what probably will be a revolution 
in medicine over the next two decades said dr w french 
anderson an nih researcher 
a proposal by anderson to use gene therapy to treat an inherited 
immune system disorder and one by dr steven rosenberg to treat a 
lethal skin cancer were approved by the recombinant dna advisory 
committee at nih 
the proposals still must be approved by the food and drug 
administration but experts said the nih panels ok is the most 
crucial 
anderson said the plans by his team and by the rosenberg team 
were considered experimental models for the eventual widespread use 
of gene therapy 
these two proposals are the best ways to demonstrate that gene 
therapy works anderson said from here it should open up into 
a broad range of therapies for cancer aids genetic disease and 
cardiovascular disease 
anderson said that if he and rosenberg can prove the concept of 
using curative genes to treat disease there already are plans to 
use similar systems to treat leukemia hemophilia diabetes 
aplastic anemia and cancers of the colon and the kidney 
rosenberg also an nih scientist said his system of using genes 
to make tumorfighting blood cells could be adapted to treat nearly 
every type of cancer but first he cautioned it has to be proven 
effective in the medical trials approved tuesday 
this is only important if it works he said this is very 
new and one can never be sure what could happen 
gerard j mcgarrity chairman of the nih panel called the 
approval historic 
what were doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines 
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal he said 
medicine has been waiting thousands of years for this 
rosenberg said researchers should know within six months after 
the treatments start whether or not the gene therapy works 
both rosenberg nd anderson said they expect fda approval of 
their proposals soon and will start treating patients by this fall 
the therapies approved by the committee both involve 
manipulating the fundamental genetic pattern within cells by 
inserting genes that instruct the cells to produce new proteins 
these proteins can fight the disease directly such as with cancer 
or the proteins could combat disorders by restoring normal hormones 
or enzymes that were missing 
to create the cells used in gene therapy scientists first 
splice the desired gene into the genetic pattern of a harmless 
virus target cells such as lymphocyte blood cells are cultured 
so they multiply into billions the cells then are exposed in test 
tubes to the genetically altered virus 
the virus infects the cells and inserts its genetic pattern 
which includes the transplanted gene into the gene structure of 
the cell the target cells and their offspring will then contain 
the new gene 
rosenberg plans to add a gene to a blood cell called the 
tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte or til 
this cell will normally seek out and attack a cancerous tumor 
but it is not strong enough by itself to control the tumor 
rosenberg earlier developed a way to remove til cells from a 
patient multiply them in a test tube and then return the cells to 
the patients blood stream 
this procedure has been used in patients with malignant 
melanoma a lethal skin cancer and about half have improved it is 
the half who died that led rosenberg to turn to gene therapy to 
improve the technique 
rosenberg plans to insert into the til cells a gene that will 
command the cells to produce a protein called tumor necrosis 
factor this protein kills tumor cells by blocking them from 
establishing a blood supply 
in effect the genetically altered til cell will be turned into 
a factory making a tumorkilling protein inside the tumor itself 
anderson and his team will use a slightly different technique to 
correct a condition called severe combined immunodeficiency disease 
this rare inherited disorder occurs in children who are born 
lacking a key gene in their white blood cells without this gene 
the cells cannot produce called adenosine deaminase or ada which 
is essential for a healthy immune system 
anderson plans to insert into white blood cells a gene that will 
make ada the altered cells will then cause the patients body to 
build resistance to disease

an army commando described as extremely 
dangerous was at large tuesday after escaping from marshals who 
were taking him to court for an appearance in a rape case 
master sgt marshall l brown 37 has been a green beret a 
ranger and most recently a member of the elite antiterrorist delta 
force he took part in the failed raid to free us hostages from 
iran 
brown who escaped monday is considered very very 
dangerous said police maj augustine comella in cranston where 
brown is accused of raping two woman 
brown is charged with raping two cranston women last year he 
also is charged with two rapes in north carolina where he was a 
member of the army special forces stationed at fort bragg 
he escaped from two armed marshals as they took him and two 
other prisoners from a station wagon to the providence courthouse 
brown who police described as an expert locksmith was able to 
free himself from his handcuffs while being taken to the courthouse 
from jail said joseph dinitto a corrections department spokesman 
he broke away from marshals and ran no shots were fired 
the marshals report indicates they did not know with whom they 
were dealing according to officials at the adult correctional 
institution cranston police however said they informed both the 
marshals and the corrections department of browns background 
brown who faces life in prison if convicted had been held at 
the aci without bail pending a pretrial hearing monday 
brown of spring lake nc was attending a nineweek course at 
the naval education and training center in newport when cranston 
police arrested him on june 11 1989 
following his arrest in rhode island brown was charged in north 
carolina with raping two wake county women whose assailant had 
scaled balconies to reach their secondfloor apartments 
he became a suspect in the north carolina rapes based on the 
accounts of the attacks the rhode island women gave brown was then 
linked to the rapes through a dna analysis performed by the fbi 
he is still receiving military pay as a master sergeant in the 
army said sgt jerry hansen of fort bragg and depending on 
the outcome of the civil case the military will decide what 
jurisdiction it is going to have over him

and endangered 
mongolian officials say baker as an honored guest can hunt any 
animal he wants but a small brouhaha developed in washington over 
reports that he sought a rare animal 
the washington post said baker an avid hunter originally 
wanted to go to the altai mountains of southwestern mongolia to 
hunt an argali sheep famed for its curly horns and a difficult 
target 
d baatar in charge of the safari department at mongolias 
state tourism agency zhuulchin said the government allows 25 
argali sheep to be killed each year in the altai the cost per 
hunter is 25000 including transportation guides meals and a 
license to kill a second animal an ibex 
argali are not endangered according to george schaller science 
director of the new yorkbased organization wildlife conservation 
international and a leading field biologist schaller who 
recently spent several months in the gobi studying rare bears said 
argali are merely overhunted in some areas 
but the issue was sensitive enough that baker decided instead to 
head for the gobi and seek a wild goat the post said us 
officials in ulan bator say they dont know his target or how much 
the license will cost baker not the us government will pay for 
the hunting trip they say 
bakers hunting plans appear to have caused no stir in mongolian 
conservation circles which are divided on the ethics of allowing 
foreign hunters to kill rare animals for muchneeded hard currency 
every year about 300 foreigners come to this littledeveloped 
nation to hunt providing the government with about 2 million 
baatar said most are americans and some hunt animals mongolians 
themselves are not allowed to kill 
badam an inspector at the ministry of nature and environmental 
protection and who like many mongolians uses just one name said 
any citizen who kills a rare snow leopard except to defend himelf 
or his herd faces a 500 fine that represents nearly two years 
income for the average mongolian 
but the communist party newspaper unen said last week the 
cabinet gave permission for three snow leopards to be killed by 
foreign hunters and an austrian hunter had already killed one the 
report said the hunter had tried unsuccessfully last year and 
returned this spring with three dogs and two assistants the price 
for the license was 16000 it said 
goidyn dembereldorj the nature ministrys chief of 
international scientific and technical cooperation said he and 
others at the ministry were taken by surprise 
we should not continue it i think he said but he said 
mongolian herdsmen complained recently that snow leopards are 
becoming more numerous and are attacking their horses and cattle 
there is no reliable count of snow leopards which are nocturnal 
and elusive estimates vary from 400 to 4000 
tserendeleg vice president of the union for the conservation of 
nature and the environment refused to comment on the snow leopard 
killing but he said he has asked the swissbased international 
union for the conservation of nature which favors protecting snow 
leopards to help compensate herdsmen whose livestock are killed by 
the leopards 
so far the union has not responded he said

imagine las vegas with snow at 30 below 
or atlantic city with moose and spruce 
alaska voters aug 28 consider a measure to legalize casino 
gambling including blackjack roulette poker craps slot 
machines and horse and dog racing 
alaskas history is rich with tales of gamblers during the wild 
and woolly gold rush years of the late 1800s later during the 
territorial years gambling was largely tolerated even where it was 
illegal 
but times have changed support is said to be weak for turning 
alaska into a vegas north and the measure has received little 
promotion its backers have taken no contributions and plan no 
media campaign sponsor jeffrey macktaz said 
gov steve cowper a democrat has argued gambling would lead to 
more crime corruption and other social ills 
my guess is not one voter in 10 in alaska sees this coming 
he said last week the initiative if its passed threatens to 
change alaska into something radically different from what it is 
today 
the measure would allow gambling in a community only if local 
voters authorized it a fivemember board would regulate the 
industry licenses would be granted only to municipalities state 
agencies or people holding a liquor license 
supporters say gambling would provide jobs and a stable source 
of income as oil revenues decline the measure provides for set 
percentages of gambling profits to go to the state and 
municipalities where the gaming takes place 
we just feel there is some merit to having legalized gambling 
in alaska to attract tourism and using the proceeds of that to help 
the economy macktaz said 
cowper said any economic benefits would be offset by increases 
in crime the costs of regulating the industry and damage to the 
states image as a wilderness vacation destination 
legalized gambling imposes social problems of a massive nature 
wherever its conducted the governor said those problems 
include child neglect drug and alcohol abuse property crimes and 
political corruption cowper said 
he said alaska would have to hire a massive number of 
regulators and auditors we would have to have a fully staffed 
gambling board we would have to hire a lot of new police officers 
we would have to build new jail space 
an antigambling group the alaskan no dice organizing 
committee said in a pamphlet most of us came here because we 
were attracted to the spectacular scenery the opportunity to live 
off the abundant natural resources the hunting and fishing the 
wilderness and downhome people bringing people here to herd them 
into 24hour neon jungle will not bring our type of people 
macktaz said gaming in alaska would not lead to las vegasstyle 
casino developments bigtime casinos wouldnt be that interested 
in alaska considering our population and the difficulty in getting 
here he said 
the casinos probably would be smaller developments competing 
with lake tahoe nev where tourists can enjoy outdoor activities 
by day and take in floor shows at night said macktaz who runs a 
concert production company

a successor to slain amazon 
environmentalist chico mendes says the men who planned that killing 
continue to threaten witnesses and rubber tappers 
osmarino amancio rodrigues 33 said tuesday that rubber tappers 
believe a group of businessmen and ranchers masterminded the mendes 
shooting but were never called to testify in the case 
the head of the snake was not hit rodrigues told a group of 
foreign journalists those who planned it are still at large 
mendes a rubber tapper who led a movement to stop destruction 
of the rain forest was shot to death on dec 22 1988 at his home 
in the western amazon town of xapuri 
a cattle rancher and his sons were arrested for the shooting 
they have not yet been brought to trial 
rodrigues said four rubber tappers have been shot to death in 
the region since mendes was slain one victim jose brito had been 
slated to testify in the trial 
he was going to testify how chico mendes death was planned 
rodrigues said but two guys on a motorcycle shot him down right 
on the street 
those who oppose the ranchers get frequent anonymous death 
threats he said they call up and say is chico mendes ok 
howd you like to be ok like chico 
a prime target is rodrigues himself he said as president of 
the rubber tappers union in brasileia near xapuri he has emerged 
as a leader of conservationist movement carrying on mendes 
struggle to save the amazon jungle from destruction 
rodrigues is constantly accompanied by four union bodyguards 
plus a police escort but said he still doesnt feel safe 
he sharply criticized the amazon policy of president fernando 
collor de mello who took office in march 
collor got high marks from conservationists for nominating 
renowned ecologist jose lutzenberger as environment secretary and 
ordering the expulsion of gold miners from indian reservations 
but rodrigues said there have been few practical results 
rodrigues said the government must learn that the rain forest 
can be profitably developed without destroying it slashandburn 
clearing by ranchers and farmers has destroyed an estimated 8 
percent of the 2 millionsquaremile amazon wilderness 
rubber brazil nuts cocoa and tropical fruits are abundant in 
the amazon but often rot for lack of processing or transportation 
he said 
rodrigues has toured europe and the united states to raise money 
for the conservation movement despite many pledges of funds not a 
cent has reached brazil yet he said 
foreign aid will help environmentalists stand up to ranchers 
mining interests and loggers who buy the votes of the poor and 
control local politics rodrigues said

a fogbank as thick as those that blanket 
president bushs oceanside home in maine on summer mornings is 
rolling in to obscure his planned fall campaign offensive and this 
time he wont have radar to help guide him 
bush was enveloped in a thick fog the real kind early last 
sunday when he went out for an earlymorning spin in his speedboat 
in the atlantic and soon lost sight of land 
a small orange coast guard boat laden with radar and other 
sophisticated navigation equipment helped to escort the president 
and his briefly disoriented secret service escorts back to safety 
aghast at fastgrowing rumors fed by confusing radio traffic 
overheard by local boaters that the president had been 
temporarily lost at sea the white house quickly issued a statement 
asserting that the chief executive had never been in danger nor 
lost 
but navigating the political waters without losing his way is 
likely to be even more challenging 
with traditional republican rallying beacons blurred by 
international and fiscal realities bush may find himself wandering 
around the country in september and october praising democratic 
leaders backing new taxes and defending cuts in defense spending 
thats not exactly the kind of redmeat rhetoric that inspires 
republicans to jump to their feet and open their wallets 
but much has happened since bush in 1988 told audiences read 
my lips no new taxes asserted that the cold war still raged 
and called for maintaining the defense buildup of the reagan years 
faced with an annual budget deficit of 169 billion the 
president abandoned his campaign vow against new taxes and 
initiated a search for a bipartisan package of 50 billion in new 
taxes and spending cuts but in so doing he immediately lost the 
republicans favorite perennial issue portraying democrats as the 
party of higher taxes 
bush even toned down his gop speeches last week after democrats 
complained that they were too partisan and threatened to undermine 
yettomaterialize progress in budget talks 
he even started praising a onetime nemesis house majority 
leader richard gephardt for the missouri democrats role in the 
budget negotiations 
the dismantling of the berlin wall and the crumbling of the 
soviet empire have taken away defense spending as a key 1990 issue 
even as bush toured an mx missile site in wyoming and praised 
nuclear readiness his own pentagon was charting a wide array of 
defense cuts 
bush also will likely steer away from the emotional abortion 
issue even though he mentioned his own antiabortion stance 
frequently in 1988 
the less he says about the subject the better it will be for 
confirmation chances of his supreme court nominee david souter 
whose lack of a record on abortion may be his biggest selling point 
furthermore republican strategists are mindful of the drubbing 
that antiabortion gop candidates took in gubernatorial races last 
year in new jersey and virginia 
the savings and loan crisis which touches both democrats and 
republicans is certainly a nowin issue for the president if 
there ever was one particularly in light of the role of his son 
neil in the collapse of a denver sampl 
so whats left for bush to talk about 
well for one thing theres tv actress roseanne barrs 
shrieking rendition of the national anthem last week in san diego 
my reaction is it was disgraceful bush declared 
and theres always broccoli he told a gop audience in 
philadelphia last week that he wasnt about to change his 
opposition to the dreaded green vegetable 
bush hasnt done much to lift the political fog 
we all know that the democrats have a long track record on 
spending he told a republican gathering but if the berlin 
wall could come down in the same year that america goes nuts over 
the teenage mutant ninja turtles who knows who could happen 
next 
actually bush may end up reconsidering his decision to spend 
almost all september and much of october on the campaign trail 
efforts to reach a bipartisan budget accord will go into 
highgear in september given the nearcertainty that one wont be 
forged before the august congressional recess 
bush may find himself out talking about ninja turtles and 
broccoli to lessthanenthusiastic audiences as major defense cuts 
and new taxes are being decided back in washington

prices of commodities at the farm have leveled 
off this summer but the agriculture department says the overall 
index is still up from a year ago 
moreover a department analyst said tuesday consumers are 
seeing food prices rise faster than had been predicted earlier in 
the year 
prices at the farm were unchanged from june to july the usda 
said tuesday the index was 27 percent above a year ago however 
prices were higher during the month for lettuce apples and 
milk but declines were reported for cattle wheat and eggs the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary 
report 
most prices are midjuly averages which will be revised this 
month for example the latest report showed june prices dropped 2 
percent instead of the 13 percent decline indicated a month ago 
the report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses were 
up 05 percent from april when the previous estimate was made and 
34 percent above july 1989 the prices paid index is computed 
quarterly 
ralph l parlett jr of the departments economic research 
service said a new 1990 forecast due out this month will put us 
right back to the early 1980s when retail food prices were 
climbing sharply 
earlier the agency had forecast retail food prices would 
probably go up 3 percent to 5 percent this year and some have 
recently talked about a rise of 4 percent to 6 percent 
according to usda records annual food price increases were 86 
percent in 1980 and 79 percent in 1981 before slowing their upward 
rise in the next few years 
parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990 
increase would probably exceed 6 percent food prices rose 58 
percent in 1989 the most since 1981 
its obvious that 3to5 percent forecast is out in left 
field he said beef and pork thats whats doing it pork 
particularly 
recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in the 
range of 55 billion to 59 billion compared with about 54 
billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 47 billion to 51 
billion compared with 49 billion last year 
based on the preliminary figures the july price index for 
livestock and poultry dropped 12 percent from june but still 
averaged 89 percent more than a year ago meat animals were down 
15 percent from june but averaged 11 percent more than in june 
1989 
milk prices rose 30 cents in july to an average of 1410 per 
l00 pounds that was up 150 from july 1989 the farm price of 
milk rose to a record 16 per hundredweight in december before 
easing down 
crop prices overall rose 16 percent from june but averaged 
44 percent below the yearearlier level 
vegetable prices rose 20 percent from june but were down 14 
percent from a year earlier lettuce tomatoes and sweet corn led 
the july increase 
fruit prices were up 79 percent from june and 13 percent above 
a year ago apples grapefruit and peaches rose in july while 
oranges pears and lemons were down 
wheat prices pressured by a bumper harvest dropped 27 cents 
during the month to 281 per bushel 
feed grains declined with corn prices down two cents from june 
to 261 per bushel 
the report said 
cattle averaged 97 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
down from 9810 in june but up from 9460 in july 1989 those are 
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 6010 per 100 pounds unchanged from june but up 
from 4590 in july 1989 
corn at 261 a bushel was down from 263 in june but up 
from 247 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 281 per bushel compared with 308 in june and 378 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 710 per 100 pounds compared with 708 in june 
and 745 in july 1989 
soybeans were 588 per bushel unchanged from june but down 
from 683 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 637 cents per pound compared 
with 623 in june and 595 a year earlier 
eggs were 556 cents per dozen compared with 627 in june and 
649 in july 1989 
milk was 1410 per 100 pounds up from 1380 in june and the 
average of 1260 a year ago 
broilers were 369 cents per pound live weight compared with 
341 cents in june and 387 cents a year earlier

the two republicans out to oust sen carl 
levin are trying to paint the twoterm democrat as too liberal for 
mainstream michigan 
but first each challenger wants to convince voters hes the 
right republican to consider as a replacement for levin 
so far the michigan senate race has been a threeman parade in 
which levin leads the lineup without bothering to glance back at 
the two republicans 
next in line is threeterm rep bill schuette who has made 
heavy use of the liberal label as he shores up his position as the 
heavy favorite in tuesdays gop primary 
bringing up the rear is the other gop contender attorney clark 
durant who sees both levin and schuette as part of the same 
problem 
durant casts both men as washington insiders who dont have the 
political courage to fight the establishment and seek innovative 
solutions to the nations woes 
levin doesnt have a primary opponent and has raked in 5 
million so far to defend his seat 
durant and schuette say levin is vulnerable because his liberal 
views are out of step with michigan 
levins backers counter that his views havent changed since 
voters sent him to the senate 12 years ago on top of that the gop 
hasnt won a senate race in michigan since 1972 
the durantschuette race has been a lowkey contest waged 
mainly in the party trenches but both campaigns hope to change 
that with television ads in the final week 
schuette has been running ads for more than a month and 
durants campaign said their ads would begin today and run through 
the election 
durant tried to engage schuette into a series of debates across 
of the state but schuette said hed debate only if durant would 
release his income tax returns and pledge to follow a no negative 
attack course 
as set out by schuettes campaign that would bar durant from 
mentioning schuettes name or record in his ads 
what am i running against here a ghost durant responded 
the question republicans have to ask themselves is whose ideas 
are best going to offer a contrast to carl levin and whos best 
equipped to take on carl levin durant said i want the people 
to decide and bill wont engage in that 
schuette insists durant isnt his focus and shouldnt be 
im running against carl levin he said beating carl 
levin is the goal here not beating up on other republicans 
schuette is a boyishlooking 36yearold with the husky voice of 
a latenight disc jockey he established himself as a rising gop 
star in 1984 when he did the near impossible and ousted incumbent 
democratic rep don albosta 
hes the favorite of the republican establishment and has close 
ties to president bush that began when he served as a top operative 
for bushs 1980 campaign 
yet schuette broke with the president when bush broke his read 
my lips no new taxes pledge 
we have a difference of opinion schuette said im 
nobodys boy 
he plays up his experience in congress in unseating albosta and 
hits hard on the conservative republican line of keeping taxes low 
a strong defense and easing government regulation to let the 
economy grow 
he also focuses on what he calls defining issues crime 
drugs and levins opposition to capital punishment to support 
his contention that the senators views are out of step with 
michigan voters 
durant lumps schuette and levin together as part of the 
washington establishment that he says is paralyzed by special 
interests and their campaign contributions 
durant says that as a rocksolid conservative outsider hed be 
a stronger gop opponent for levin he emphasizes cutting taxes and 
government regulation to give people more control over their lives 
and wallets 
the campaign carries faint echoes of the 1988 presidential wars 
that nearly shredded the michigan republican party that fight 
pitted the gop establishment backing george bush against the more 
conservative and populistoriented factions led by jack kemp and 
pat robertson 
durant a national cochairman for kemp helped lead the 
anybody but bush drive of kemp and robertson supporters that 
eventually lost 
some bush backers held a grudge against durant but that has 
faded as hes campaigned hard to win support in all three camps 
his campaign says 
schuette campaign director douglas mcauliffe said his campaign 
has done its best to forget about 1988 and unite the party 
bill schuette has been saying this over and over theres a 
new level of maturity in the michigan republican party they 
havent won a us senate race since 1972 and theyre tired of 
losing he said

nolan ryan won his 300th game tuesday night 
pitching the texas rangers to an 113 victory over the brewers and 
adding to the legend of the man whos still throwing fastballs at 
age 43 
ryan who is the games alltime strikeout leader and has a 
record six nohitters became the 20th major leaguer to get 300 
victories except for spitballer gaylord perry every pitcher to 
win that many games has been elected to the hall of fame after 
becoming eligible five years after retirement 
ryan who has won 11 games and lost four this season allowed 
six hits in 7 23 innings he struck out eight increasing his 
career total to 5219 walked two and threw 146 pitches 
it was not the overpowering classic ryan but it counted and 
it also served to bring baseballs focus back to the field one day 
after new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was disciplined 
in fact commissioner fay vincent stayed away from county stadium 
perhaps not wanting to steal attention from ryan 
the crowd of 51533 largest of the season in milwaukee 
included 15 of ryans family and friends and rangers owner george 
bush son of the president they gave a standing ovation when he 
walked to the dugout before the game and loudly cheered him 
throughout the evening 
flash bulbs popped all during the night and 300 signs dotted 
the ballpark at ryans home field in texas there were 7828 
people in the stands to watch the game on the scoreboard at 
arlington stadium and fans across the country tuned in the game on 
tv 
with texas leading 51 in the eighth two errors by second 
baseman julio franco and two singles led to two unearned runs 
sabotaging ryans chance to finish with the complete game he wanted 
so much 
brad arnsberg relieved preserving a 53 lead and the win for

although he is more discreet nowadays libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi is still promoting revolutionary movements 
around the world as recent events in both liberia and trinidad 
demonstrate us officials and private analysts say 
i dont think they the libyans have been less active 
theyve been less conspicuous said robert kuppermann a 
terrorism specialist at the washingtonbased center for strategic 
and international studies 
charles lichenstein a distinguished fellow at the heritage 
foundation also a washington think tank said gadhafi is more 
prudent than he was during the early 1980s but otherwise hasnt 
changed much 
he is still one of the great security threats that we have to 
contend with lichenstein said 
a state department official asking not to be identified said 
the trinidad government rejected a request months ago for the 
import of medical supplies from libya suspecting that the 
shipment actually consisted of weapons 
over the past several days gadhafis long reach has been 
demonstrated by the bloody upheavals under way in both liberia and 
trinidad two countries where rebel leaders have acknowledged 
receiving assistance from the north african leader 
the bush administration has sought to minimize the extent of 
gadhafis involvement in the two countries 
officials described charles taylor a liberian rebel leader and 
gadhafi ally as an opportunist with no particular philosophical 
underpinning he appears to have sought out gadhafi for help 
because he had nowhere else to turn they said 
as for the revolt in trinidad the state department has said 
that although gadhafi has provided training to the insurgents 
there is no indication of a direct libyan involvement in the 
seizure last friday night of trinidads prime minister and dozens 
of other officials 
why liberia and trinidad 
lichenstein suggested that liberia is an attractive target for 
gadhafi because of the large array of us military and 
communications facilities in the west african country 
he added that in the event of a rebel success in trinidad 
gadhafi could use that country as a launching pad for 
destabilizing other caribbean countries 
gadhafi seems less of a preoccupation for the united states now 
than he was in 1986 after us authorities concluded that he was 
behind the bombing of a west berlin discotheque frequented by 
americans a us army sergeant was killed in the incident 
president reagan retaliated by ordering us jet fighters to 
bomb tripoli and benghazi 
apparently chastened gadhafi virtually disappeared for an 
extended period but he eventually shook it off lichenstein 
said 
lichenstein said gadhafi nurtured by oil revenues is 
continuing to support dozens of other rebel organizations 
particularly radical palestinian groups 
his hand is still involved in various groups we dont know 
about lichenstein said

infants and toddlers would be required to sit 
in child safety seats on airline flights under legislation heading 
to the senate floor 
the measure approved tuesday by the commerce committee would 
order the federal aviation administration to require the seats on 
domestic airline flights it would be left to the faa to decide a 
height and weight limit for children needing the seats 
the committee approved the bill on a voice vote and sent it to 
the full senate no date has been scheduled for its consideration 
this is a great step forward for this bill we cannot continue 
to treat our youngest airline passengers like secondclass citizens 
when it comes to airline safety said sen christopher bond 
rmo who sponsored the legislation 
currently infants under 2 can fly free by traveling on the laps 
of a parent or guardian 
all of the major airlines permit infants to travel in safety 
seats which are attached to a regular airline seat and generally 
charge a reduced fare comparable to that for children between ages 
2 and 12 unticketed infants usually can use a vacant seat at no 
cost 
the airlines air transport association airline unions and 
consumer groups have advocated mandatory safety restraints 
generally for children under age 2 
the legislation stemmed from the death of a 23monthold child 
in a crashlanding of an airliner last year at sioux city iowa 
the accident killed 112 people three other children under age 2 
were injured 
a similar proposal by rep jim lightfoot riowa is pending in 
the house 
the national transportation safety board has recommended that 
approved safety seats be required for children under 40 inches in 
height or weighing less than 40 pounds 
the faa has said it would consider mandatory restraints but has 
proposed a regulation only to require that airlines allow child 
seats on board if passengers want to use them the practice 
already followed by the industry 
the faa in testimony before a house panel in midjuly said 
requiring child seats would end up costing more lives than it would 
save it estimated that the expense of buying tickets for infants 
would cause more families to travel by automobile and lead to 
increased numbers of traffic deaths and injuries 
the senate bill also calls for the united states to seek a 
similar child safety seat requirement for international flights 
from the international civil aviation organization

the energy department says its putting some 
of the best scientific minds to work on the problem but a senator 
compares the effort to three witches chanting over a bubbling 
caldron 
the subject highly radioactive wastes that have been stored for 
decades at the hanford nuclear weapons facility in washington state 
there is increasing concern some of the tanks might explode and 
no one seems to know exactly what chemicals are inside or what 
years of radiation have done to them 
the hanford tanks present a serious situation if not an 
imminent hazard cautions the energy departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety 
john ahearne a physicist and the panels chairman told a 
senate hearing tuesday that hes not ready to accept energy 
department officials assurances that the dangers of an explosion 
are low theres too much uncertainty he said there is an 
urgent need to determine what is in the tanks 
for decades highly radioactive wastes were poured into 
underground tanks on the hanford atomic weapons reservation a 
560squaremile complex in southcentral washington where plutonium 
was processed for years for the nations weapons program 
were trying to find out whats in the existing tanks leo 
duffy the energy department official in charge of cleanup 
activities at atomic waste sites told the senators he said some 
of the best scientists were trying to close a huge gap in 
information 
nevertheless duffy called the situation under control 
but several senators were not as certain 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the governmental affairs 
committee likened it to trying to manage a potential bomb 
without knowing exactly what youre dealing with 
and sen brock adams dwash calling for a more scientific 
approach said the effort to date reminded him of three witches 
with a bubbling caldron saying bubble bubble toil and trouble 
theyre stirring it and dont seem to know whats in there 
last march the energy department for the first time disclosed 
that it was worried about a chemical explosion in some of the 
tanks there was concern that secondary chemical reactions might 
burst the tanks and release large amounts of radioactive materials 
that concern was expressed even more strongly by the advisory 
board headed by ahearne in a letter july 23 to energy secretary 
james watkins the letter was made public by glenns committee 
tuesday 
the technical basis for the analysis from which the hanford 
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak 
considering the potential consequences the advisory panel said 
each successive review of the hanford tanks indicates that the 
situation is a little worse 
plant operators and senior doe officials have only sketchy 
information on conditions in the tanks with no clear knowledge of 
the chemical reactions going on in the tanks and unreliable 
temperature sensors the panel continued 
there is an urgent need to determine what is in the tanks 
what are the risks and what actions should be taken to ameliorate 
the hazards the letter said 
an accident involving similarly stored wastes in the soviet 
union in 1957 released huge amounts of radiation and contaminated 
an area covering hundreds of square miles forcing the evacuation 
of 10000 people 
to this day children are not allowed near the areas that were 
heavily contaminated and agricultural crops from the region are 
not allowed to be sold elsewhere officials said 
but duffy said the soviet site is not the same as the hanford 
plant 
highly radioactive wastes also are stored in tanks at the 
savannah river weapons plant near aiken sc and at a plant near 
west valley ny but those tanks contain different chemicals and 
do not pose the same risks as the tanks at hanford officials have 
said

amid growing congressional furor over the cost 
of the savings and loan bailout a top federal regulator is 
sounding an alarm over shrinking reserves in the fund backing 
commercial bank deposits 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp told the senate banking committee on tuesday that it would 
not be unreasonable to predict a 2 billion loss in the bank fund 
this year 
meanwhile at the capitol the house voted 4244 tuesday to 
toughen criminal penalties for ripoffs by savings and loan 
officials and to create a special prosecutor and a national 
commission on the sampl debacle 
seidman said the bank fund lost 851 million in 1989 and 424 
billion in 1988 as bank failures soared to postdepression highs 
nevertheless seidman said the fund which is maintained through 
an insurance premium paid by banks should be able to pay for any 
foreseeable bank failures without help from taxpayers 
at this point looking at the banks we can actually count on 
failing we believe we have the resources to handle them but that 
still would put us in a very much stressed position he said 
the 1989 and 1988 losses reduced insurance backing 25 trillion 
in deposits at the nations 12500 banks to 70 cents per 100 of 
deposits the lowest point in modern history seidman said 
with another loss this year coverage could slip to 50 cents or 
60 cents per 100 less than half the agencys target of 125 per 
100 he said 
seidmans comments were his most pessimistic yet concerning the 
bank fund only two months ago he said the fund could post a small 
profit absent major bank failures in 1990 
seidman indicated the fdic board may consider an emergency hike 
in insurance premiums paid by banks those premiums as provided by 
last years savings and loan bill are already increasing from 83 
cents per 100 of deposits in 1989 to 12 cents this year and 15 
cents next year 
however the board has the power to raise them as high as 225 
cents next year each 1 cent increase brings the fund about 250 
million 
our board will be monitoring this very carefully and obviously 
that is an action they will be looking at he said 
seidman said his revised assessment of the insurance fund was 
based on a general deterioration of the value of commercial real 
estate held by banks not on any new projection of a major bank 
failure 
so far this year 113 banks have failed last year 207 banks 
failed or required federal assistance to stay open down slightly 
from a postdepression record of 221 in 1988 
very frankly we have probably the weakest real estate markets 
overall that weve had for quite a few years he said adding 
that the weakness has spread from regional pockets in the southwest 
and new england to include most areas of the country 
however kenneth guenther of the independent bankers association 
of america a trade group said seidmans reassessment indicates 
there are shoals under the water and the agency is planning for 
a major bank failure 
i wonder where the big bank hits are going to come from 
are some of the major texas deals going sour guenther said 
the legislation that passed the house would increase the maximum 
prison terms up to life in prison for the worst offenders and 
boost fines that could be levied against individuals and 
institutions convicted of savings and loan crimes 
it would also create new felony categories to close loopholes 
for those who conceal assets from the government or who try to 
obstruct government inquiries into financial institutions and give 
the government new authority to go after the assets of failed sampls 
the bill would authorize adding 153 million to the federal 
governments law enforcement efforts and create a special 
counsel within the justice department to oversee a new financial 
institutions fraud unit 
banking committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas one of the 
few to vote against the measure said proponents hoped the measure 
would fool the american people that the crisis was being solved 
the senate passed its version of a savings and loan crackdown as 
part of an overall crime bill the two chambers must reconcile 
their differences before a bill can be sent to the president

five years after a plague of locusts hit 
africa a congressional report says its still unclear whether the 
plague was stopped by a fouryear 275 million international 
pesticide attack or just by the weather 
a 130page report released tuesday by congress office of 
technology assessment failed to resolve whether the weather or the 
massive pesticide effort should get credit for stopping the plague 
in 1985 locusts and grasshoppers attacked 23 countries from 
portugal to tanzania and from iran to the atlantic in 1988 
hurricane gilbert blew fragments of locust swarms to the yucatan 
coast of mexico though apparently they did little damage there 
some claim this is the first time a desert locust plague has 
been stopped in its tracks and that the control program deserves 
full credit they seem to be right the report said 
yet others contend that the weather contributed more than 
control to the insects decline they also seem to be right 
of the 46 governments and 12 international organizations that 
joined in the attack the united states contributed the largest 
amount giving nearly 59 million from the agency for international 
development 
andrew natsios who heads the agencys office of foreign 
disaster assistance said the control program was a success though 
he acknowledged weather may have had something to do with the 
fading of the threat he called the report selfcontradictory 
none of the people on the survey ever went to africa he 
said 
the report praised the agency for coordinating efforts of other 
us agencies international donors and african officials but it 
suggested that too much pesticide was used about 34 million 
gallons and that there ought to be more research on how to use 
the pests own habits against them 
so far scientists have not found ways to do that

the justice department is concerned that 
oliver norths victory before an appeals court could have a wider 
impact affecting other cases involving defendants who testify under 
a similar promise of immunity 
officials are reviewing the decision which held that the trial 
judge did not take proper steps to determine if norths 
congressional testimony influenced his trial said justice 
department spokesman dan eramian 
the department does not have a direct interest in the north case 
because the former white house aide was prosecuted by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh 
in a 21 decision last month the us circuit court of appeals 
in washington ordered a witnessbywitness and review of the 
evidence presented at norths trial to determine if it was 
tainted by references to the testimony the former white house 
aide gave under a limited grant of immunity from prosecution 
that use immunity barred walsh from using any of norths 
testimony or information derived from it to prosecute the former 
marine lieutenant colonel 
eramian said justice department prosecutors were concerned about 
the cases impact in a limited number of cases in which a defendant 
is prosecuted after testifying before congress amidst widespread 
publicity 
justice department officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the decision could have more widespread 
applications as in case where courts or grand juries grant use 
immunity the procedural requirements set down by the court could 
be impossible for prosecutors to meet the officials said 
eramian stressed that the department was not necessarily 
considering participating in any appeal that walsh might undertake 
but if walsh appeals the decision the justice department could 
file a brief stating its legal position 
walsh has more than a month to decide whether to appeal the 
ruling to the full appellate court or ask the supreme court to 
review the issue 
norths weeklong appearance on capitol hill in 1987 received 
widespread television and newspaper coverage which his lawyers 
contend affected the memories of witnesses in the case 
the former national security council aide was placed on 
probation and ordered to perform 1500 hours of community service 
for his three felony convictions 
some legal experts say the decision by two appellate judges 
appointed by president reagan radically extended a 1972 supreme 
court decision that prohibits prosecutors from introducing a 
defendants compelled testimony as evidence 
what they did in this case was to virtually change use 
immunity into transactional immunity under which the government 
agrees not to prosecute someone in return for their cooperation 
said g robert blakey a notre dame law professor who drafted the 
1970 use immunity statute 
the court in effect created a rule that once anything was 
disseminated as widely as norths testimony it necessarily 
affected the trial blakey said there was nothing particularly 
unusual about the north testimony that it would irretrievably taint 
anybody who read it 
the two circuit judges who joined in the ruling laurence h 
silberman and david sentelle were both appointed by reagan and 
are generally regarded as members of the courts conservative wing 
patricia wald the appellate courts chief judge and the 
dissenter in the north case was appointed by president carter 
the two majority judges simply let north off blakey said 
if that sort of solicitude was paid to criminal defendants 
generally we wouldnt be talking about reagan judges

president bushs top economic adviser says no 
matter what additional clean air controls are approved by congress 
it will be expensive to the economy and result in job losses for 
some workers 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers urged senate and house negotiators to hold down the cost 
of compromise clean air legislation and reiterated that bush 
opposes any bill that is substantially more expensive than the 20 
billion a year proposals he made last year 
the president is not prepared to see american firms workers 
and consumers overcharged or to see economic growth slowed 
needlessly boskin said in a letter to rep john dingell dmich 
dingell who heads the house negotiating team trying to work out 
a compromise clean air bill with the senate had asked for an 
economic assessment of the air pollution controls being considered 
on capitol hill 
house and senate staff members meanwhile met most of tuesday 
and were expected to continue discussions through the week as the 
two chambers work out differences in clean air bills approved 
earlier this year 
a compromise bill is unlikely to emerge from conference before 
late september 
in his letter to dingell boskin belittled suggestions that most 
of the additional costs to the economy of tougher air pollution 
controls could be offset by savings elsewhere instead he said 
the tighter controls will result in reduced productivity and hamper 
us industrys ability to compete with foreign industries 
environmentalists congressional supporters of tough new 
pollution controls as well as some senior officials of the 
environmental protection agency have argued that the substantial 
costs imposed on industry by the new clean air requirements would 
be offset by reduced health care spending and growth in new 
industries spawned by the need for pollution controls 
epa administrator william reilly has been among those who have 
argued that while some industries may suffer from the new 
requirements other businesses dealing in pollution control 
activities may prosper and provide new jobs as well as new exports 
the assertion that expanded clean air programs would on 
balance create jobs increase productivity and make the us 
economy more competitive in world markets are at best wishful 
thinking boskin wrote 
a spokesman for reilly said the epa chief agrees with boskins 
analysis reilly and boskin are eye to eye on this said epa 
spokesman dave cohen 
boskin said the administration proposal to congress would have 
added about 20 billion a year in new pollution control costs to 
the economy by the time all the new requirements go into effect in 
the year 2005 he said the bills approved by both the house and 
senate would cost 25 billion somewhat higher than previous 
administration estimates for the senate bill of 215 billion 
there was no explanation for the difference 
but boskin said if the most costly features of both the house 
and senate bills are kept in a final bill the cost could increase 
to 35 billion a year president bush has threatened to veto any 
clean air legislation he considers too costly or a threat to 
economic growth 
but boskin said that bush all along has known that tougher air 
pollution controls will be costly he is fully aware that any 
environmentally strong clean air bill will reduce real income 
growth and cause some temporary unemployment the president 
believes that our nation is able and should be willing to pay a 
reasonable price to clean its air

america is heading toward a recordbreaking 
murder toll this year as a result of increasing quantities of 
assault weapons and drying up supplies of cocaine according to a 
senate committee 
we are in the midst of a growing epidemic of homicide 
senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel said tuesday 
in releasing the committees grisly forecast 
the report predicted that there would be 23220 murders across 
the nation this year about 2000 more than the figure for 1989 and 
ahead of the previous record of 23040 which was set in 1980 
americas murder rate of 105 per 100000 people makes it the 
most murderous industrialized nation in the world the panel 
said in great britain the rate is 08 per 100000 in japan 10 
in west germany 12 
the report said the upsurge can partially be traced to dwindling 
supplies of cocaine in major cities that have escalated the drug 
wars 
in addition the report pinned increased murders on a growing 
arsenal of assault rifles it called the weapons of choice for 
drug dealers and the weapons of doom for law enforcement 
personnel 
the national rifle association however scoffed at that 
statement 
every study done by law enforcement agencies including the 
fbi the new york police department and the florida assault weapons 
commission demonstrates the minuscule involvement of such weapons 
in criminal violence said nra federal liaison david conover 
the judiciary committee also cited a fresh wave of jobless 
crimeprone teenagers as a reason for the increase in killings 
the committee said cocaine prices are up and purity levels are 
down 
this means supplies are scarce and that in turn means that 
drug dealers are going to be fighting for their turf and customers 
the more they fight the higher the death toll a tragic 
consequence of winning the war on drugs 
the report said that since 1985 a new crop of 18 to 24 
yearolds with all of their attendant violence has become an 
abnormally large segment of the population 
the nations murder total fell 18 percent from 1980 to 1985 but 
has risen 22 percent since then 
dr lynn richardson associate chief of emergency services at 
new yorks harlem hospital center told lawmakers of a young woman 
rushed in several weeks ago the right side of her head had been 
blown away by a rifle in an apparent drug shootout she said 
doctors saved a 6month fetus and that the child is clinging to 
life 
philadelphia police commissioner willie l williams said 35 
percent of his citys killings last year were related to drugs 
we now have drug dealers who shoot it out with semiautomatic 
weapons on our streets murdering innocent children williams 
added 
professor james a fox of the college of criminal justice at 
northeastern university in boston said crime might get worse as 
unemployment and pregnancy among youths now just becoming 
teenagers rises as well 
in fact the forecasting model developed 15 years ago 
indicates a resurgence in violence in the 1990s fox said the 
worst may be yet to come 
drawing on fbi figures the committee said california led the 
nation in murders last year with 3158 the panel projected violent 
deaths this year in the nations mostpopulous state at 3442 a 9 
percent increase 
the largest percentage increase projected by the committee was 
in idaho which had 26 murders last year the panel projected a 50 
percent increase to 39 this year 
the greatest percentage decrease predicted was 67 percent in 
both new hampshire and north dakota new hampshire had 36 murders 
last year the forecast is for 12 this year north dakota had four 
murders last year the lowest in the nation the projection is for 
one this year

womens groups are fighting moves to cap job 
discrimination damages allowed under a major civil rights bill 
while the white house supports such a plan as a way to head off a 
bonanza for trial lawyers 
women are at risk of being sacrificed once again on the altar 
of business interests patricia ireland vice president of the 
national organization for women told a news conference tuesday 
the debate over job discrimination damages for women members of 
religious minorities and the physically handicapped intensified as 
the house prepared to debate the civil rights bill 
the measure similar to a bill already passed by the senate 
appears likely to come to the house floor later this week 
the bush administration says the bill would lead to the use of 
hiring quotas and has been threatening a presidential veto unless 
it is changed 
major provisions range from a ban on harassment in the workplace 
to barriers to reopening courtapproved fairhiring agreements 
the bill provides for openended damages for women who are 
victims of intentional discrimination such as sexual harassment or 
refusal to hire based on gender 
critics say it will encourage discrimination suits because 
lawyers will be hungry to share in sizeable damages awards 
opponents are hoping to insert limits on damages when the bill 
comes to the house floor 
womens groups and bill sponsors dislike the idea of limits 
because a 1981 law allows openended damages for racial bias in the 
workplace they envision cases in which black women alleging 
racial discrimination could collect more than white women in 
lawsuits against the same employer 
while we strongly support the elimination of discrimination in 
the workplace it is impossible for us to condone secondary status 
based on gender religion or physical ability said joan bronk 
president of the national council of jewish women 
it is totally unacceptable to write into law for the first 
time so clearly and consciously that sex discrimination on the job 
is someone less offensive than race discrimination ireland said 
there has been speculation however that support for the 
measure among conservative southern democrats could wither if a cap 
on damages is not added at some point before the measure is sent to 
president bushs desk 
at the white house deputy press secretary alixe glen praised a 
measure sponsored by rep john j lafalce dny the proposal 
would allow compensatory payments of up to 100000 in 
discrimination cases in which the court felt it were necessary to 
deter the employer from persisting in bias 
the plan would also soften provisions that would make it easier 
for those filing discrimination suits to win cases based on 
statistics 
glen said the lafalce plan represents a bipartisan consensus 
in the house that would lessen the likelihood of quota hiring and 
constrains the potential litigation bonanza for trial lawyers by 
limiting damages to appropriate cases 
we hope and expect the democratic leadership to allow a vote 
on the lafalce substitute said ms glen who acknowledged the 
lafalce amendment was similar to a plan defeated in the senate

the house is completing work on a 
comprehensive housing bill that is under a veto threat because it 
disregards a presidential demand for higher down payments on 
mortgages backed by the federal housing administration 
the legislation expected to pass today must be reconciled with 
a different senate version that includes the tougher administration 
down payment requirements 
president bush threatened to veto any bill that would not keep 
the fha insurance fund solvent at a time of escalating defaults 
even before the house voted overwhelmingly tuesday night to 
require roughly the same cash down payments as under current law 
bush warned that such a requirement would be unacceptable 
the fha language was the main focus of debate tuesday night but 
it is only a portion of legislation that would authorize about 28 
billion for the governments housing and home ownership programs 
for fiscal 1991 
the comprehensive legislation would establish new programs to 
help firsttime home buyers permit lowincome americans receiving 
public housing assistance to own their homes and encourage 
production of new rental housing 
both the administration and house members agreed to an annual 
fee to be charged home buyers in order to keep the fha insurance 
fund solvent with the administrations proposed charge slightly 
smaller 
but the house plan adopted 4182 also requires the lower down 
payment requirements it was sponsored by reps bruce vento 
dminn and thomas ridge rpa 
the administration maintains that americans qualifying for fha 
mortgages should pay more up front than under current regulations 
because those who put up more cash will be less likely to default 
vento and ridge argued the administrations down payment 
requirements would make it impossible for thousands of americans to 
buy a home 
the fha payments at settlement would vary with the price of the 
house under the ventoridge language americans buying a 65000 
home would pay upfront charges of 4115 
the administration would require payments of 4939 on the same 
house 
the higher cost proposed by the administration would result from 
a requirement that buyers pay twothirds of the closing cost at 
settlement the ventoridge language would allow the closing costs 
to be financed through monthly mortgage payments 
the fha changes were a reaction to an analysis by the price 
waterhouse accounting firm which said the insurance fund is 
currently solvent but is losing money at an alarmingly fast rate 
the administration contends the savings and loan crisis has 
demonstrated the dangers of allowing an undercapitalized federal 
insurance program to operate on an unsound basis 
supporters of the ventoridge provision said the administration 
plan would exclude up to 100000 potential home buyers the 
administration has maintained that no more than 35000 people would 
be shut out 
voting against ventoridge were reps thomas petri rwis and 
jim cooper dtenn

grossingers hotel and country club the 
borscht belt retreat that launched eddie fishers career and helped 
jack dempsey develop his punch will soon be little more than a 
summer memory 
the catskills hotel which entertained 100000 guests a year in 
its heyday in the 1940s and 50s probably will be sold off 
piecemeal to end years of financial trouble said barbara 
balliberstrauss its bankruptcy trustee 
the 812acre resort in the town of liberty has been empty since 
1986 when it was closed for a 30 million renovation and expansion 
project that never was completed 
before air conditioning and convenient air travel a getaway for 
hot tired new yorkers meant a twohour drive to the catskill 
mountains 
but like many resort areas close to big cities the catskills 
faded as other parts of the world became more accessible and an 
extended summer siesta became unfashionable grossingers went into 
a slide with other hotels in the region 
joe risitano 60 who has vacationed in the catskills since 
1948 was hired as a security guard at grossingers and said he 
spent tuesday turning away people curious to see the hotel 
a lot of people are saying their grandparents stayed here and 
always talked about it he said now they want to see it its 
nostalgia you know 
fisher who made his debut at grossingers 41 years ago and was 
discovered there as legend has it by eddie cantor returned to 
help kick off the facelift in 1986 which was halted in 1989 more 
than a dozen contractors filed liens of more than 87 million 
against the owners contending they had not been paid 
the owners a group of new york city investors had bought the 
resort from the grossinger family in 1985 
the financial trouble is a far cry from the heydy of 
grossingers and other resorts in the catskills known as the 
borscht belt for the jewish crowd that vacationed there and the 
jewish singers and comics who entertained them 
grossingers had it all a 27hole golf course ski slope 
indoor and outdoor pools and tennis courts post office shopping 
arcade two kosher kitchens and a 1500seat dining room 
dempsey rocky marciano ken norton and michael spinks trained 
there lucille ball performed at the resorts two nightclubs joel 
grey and leslie uggams advanced their careers at grossingers 
mamie eisenhower was one of many political figures who regularly 
vacationed at the 600room resort famous for its allyoucaneat 
meals three times a day including a breakfast menu that included 
seven styles of herring 
the resort was opened in 1914 by austrian immigrants selig and 
mahlke grossinger losing money the family sold it for 9 million 
in 1985 to grossingers associates an unrelated group of investors 
last december the owners filed for protection from creditors in 
us bankruptcy court under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
balliberstrauss said the hotel and its contents likely will be 
liquidated under chapter 7 
what we plan to do is meet with lenders in order to determine 
the best approach to take balliberstrauss said 
in his the glory and the dream william manchester listed 
the first singles only weekend held at grossingers among the 
greater events of 1962 followed by john glenns spaceflight and 
the cuban missile crisis

relations secretary of state james a baker iiis visit starting 
thursday will rank as relatively tame 
american adverturerbusinessmen were running car services 
between the chinese border and ulan bator then called urga as 
early as 1916 and were embroiled in smuggling kidnappings and 
shootouts 
their cadillacs and dodges were the first cars in this 
landlocked central asian nation whose very name for many americans 
epitomizes things remote exotic and dangerous 
the first official us envoy came in 1920 from beijing to 
evaluate a plea from mongolian princes for help in ousting their 
chinese overlords 
but when mongolian revolutionaries made their move in 1921 it 
was the soviet red army that helped starting a sevendecade 
alliance that sealed off mongolia from the west more effectively 
than geography 
one brief contact came in july 1944 the communist party 
newspaper unen recently reported when us vice president henry 
wallace stopped in ulan bator while traveling between china and the 
soviet city of irkutsk 
the united states and soviet union were world war ii allies and 
mongolian soldiers also were fighting the japanese 
unen said reporters were keen for their first look at an 
american 
but he was very ordinary the paper said he emerged 
without any hat dressed in a very light suit and without any tie 
wallace who like baker stayed three days met with 
thendictator marshal horloogiyn choybalsan visited museums took 
in a play and met mongolian horsemen whom he surprised with his 
knowledge of racehorses 
another contact came in the early 1960s after the united states 
stopped blocking mongolian entry into the united nations mongolia 
invited us supreme court justice william o douglas to visit and 
he gave lectures on the us legal system 
american hunters began arriving in 1967 starting up what has 
become a multimilliondollar safari industry for mongolia 
negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations failed 
however both in the early 1960s and in the late 1970s finally as 
the cold war thawed relations were established in 1987 
the united states sent its first resident ambassador in june 
even as the soviet union continued pulling its troops out a 
complete soviet troop withdrawal is scheduled for 1992 
but americans are still relatively rare in ulan bator which 
bears a heavy soviet stamp in its architecture food and consumer 
goods the cadillacs and dodges are long gone replaced by official 
fleets of boxy black berras from the soviet union 
ordinary mongolians said they were surprised to hear of bakers 
visit many people in washington were too despite its location 
between china and the soviet union mongolia is not key to american 
strategic planning 
one motive appears to be bakers interest in hunting he will 
spend two days on a private hunting and fishing expedition in the 
gobi desert 
us officials say baker also will sign a consular agreement and 
an agreement to send peace corps volunteers they are expected to 
start teaching english next year 
the two sides also are negotiating a general trade agreement 
mongolia is seeking mostfavorednation trade status from the 
united states which would entitle it to the lowest tariffs on its 
exports total trade between the countries last year was 16 
million 
baker also will meet with mongolias communist leaders and 
representatives of new opposition parties that contended in the 
countrys first free elections sunday 
nyamdoo the mongolian ambassador to washington said baker did 
not confirm his trip until the opposition dropped its threat to 
boycott the elections the state department said the visit serves 
to demonstrate our support for mongolias peaceful democratic 
reform process 
it is a subtle slap at neighboring china with whom the 
washington has halted most highlevel visits since the chinese army 
attacked prodemocracy protesters in beijing in june 1989 it would 
have been natural for baker to stop in beijing which is a main 
gateway to mongolia 
opposition activists say they hope to learn from the us 
democratic system they want us investment and development aid to 
reduce mongolias dependence on the soviets 
the mongolian government also wants trade investment and 
technology 
mongolia is ready to get anything he can give to us deputy 
foreign minister choinhor said jokingly monday 
american businessmen are slowly starting contacts 
the new yorkbased textile company amicale industries recently 
started a joint venture in mongolia to process camel hair 
exploration associates of houston is searching for oil and 
ringling brothers circus has signed up mongolian circus acts 
mongolian vodka is expected to appear in us stores next year 
one measure of mongolian interest in the united states came when 
a group of scholars founded the mongoliaus association in may 
gonchigdorj a founding member said 500 people showed up for the 
first meeting

here at a glance are the major issues in 
campaign finance legislation before the senate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats want to set voluntary limits on how much senate 
candidates can spend in primary and general elections overall the 
ceilings would range from just under 2 million for a candidate 
from a small state to 103 million in california candidates could 
exceed the general election caps by 25 percent with contributions 
of 100 or less from instate voters 
republicans oppose absolute ceilings saying they inhibit the 
ability of challengers to raise enough money to overcome 
incumbents they offer flexible ceilings that would exempt 
money from instate donors and outofstate contributions of 250 
or less 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats offer a variety of incentives to encourage candidates 
to abide by voluntary spending limits they would offer senate 
candidates a total of 20 million in government vouchers every 
twoyear election cycle to help pay for certain tv and radio ads 
republicans offer no public financing proposals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats would retain the current 1000 limit that an 
individual can contribute for each primary and general election 
the 25000 annual limit on what an individual can give to all 
candidates and party committees would be raised to 30000 
republicans would halve the 1000 ceiling on individual 
contributions from nonstate residents but they would exempt gifts 
to national and state party committees from the ceiling allowing 
individuals to give up to 340000 a year

both parties have agreed to a proposal by president bush to ban 
corporate union and trade association political action committees 
they doubt the ban could be extended to ideological pacs keyed to 
issues such as abortion or gun control because of constitutional 
questions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats would put new limits on spending by state party 
organizations for voter registration education and turnout 
activities 
republicans have no fixed ceiling on such spending but they 
would require state parties to subject a third of such expenses to 
federal limits on contributions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats would limit a candidates contributions to his own 
campaign to 250000 and bar candidates from repaying the money 
with contributions received after an election 
republicans would do the same they also would let the opponents 
of candidates who use more than 250000 of their own money raise 
contributions of up to 5000 from individuals up from 1000 
otherwiseequals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democrats would use public funds to subsidize threefourths of 
the cost of firstclass campaign mail up to a certain limit 
republicans would forbid members of congress from using their 
franking privilege for mass mailings during an election year

opening night at the new york city opera 
revealed many of the reasons why sometimes its worth going there 
rather than to the nations leading opera house next door 
its not too often that the neighboring metropolitan opera 
engages a cast of relatively unknown american singers to render a 
wellacted appealing performance without the distractions of star 
turns 
the city opera did it tuesday with the marriage of figaro 
not sublime mozart and not a transcendent musical experience but 
yet a satisfying theatrical one 
city opera had to cancel much of its last season because of a 
strike settled early this year and tuesdays was its first 
performance under new director christopher keene 
the singers responded well to each other and the action was 
completely in harmony with the notes conducted by scott bergeson 
there was some heaviness in moving passages and the singers at 
times seemed to produce blocks of notes rather than lines but 
generally bergeson kept things moving the ensembles really the 
glories of figaro were wellbalanced intonation problems 
surfaced occasionally in the orchestra 
the sets and costumes of carl toms were straightforwardly 18th 
century spare and unencumbered by rococco ornament but warm with 
wood paneling and ochre colors 
john copleys direction of this 1977production was completely 
engaging but most engaging of all was maureen oflynns susanna 
she showed that a small voice spinning focused lines with dramatic 
feeling conveyed through the notes is better than any prima donna 
display 
figaro is really a work about love and all its handmaidens 
jealousy lust marital fidelity ardor and trust oflynn with 
agility displayed all of these her interplay with dean petersons 
figaro was completely convincing 
oflynn was full of charming touches the saucy curtsy when the 
count discovers it is her not a lover in his wifes closet her 
prompting of figaro when the count questions him about a letter 
her demure feigned acquiescence to the counts advances 
peterson was a fine match for the pert oflynn tall athletic 
graceful and able to move quick from smiling cockiness to 
bewilderment as his fortunes changed moment to moment in the battle 
of wits with the count 
peterson sang well but his voice had a gruff quality thats not 
really suited to figaros character it is perfect for masetto the 
rough peasant hothead in don giovanni he showed great aplomb 
in the opening scene when a mannikin holding the counts cloak and 
wig fell over he picked it up put back the dummys head and even 
gave it a pat all the while continuing his part unfazed 
william stone was a fine count almaviva a character much like 
don giovanni confined to his house and servants he brought the 
fierceness necessary to make us believe the fear of his jealousy by 
the countess sung by renee fleming 
fleming whos won a good many awards and seems to be on her 
way evoked a mixed reaction her voice is creamy and she too is no 
wigcarrying manikin as an actress her third act aria dove 
sono had a breathtaking soft section 
but at times particularly in the porgi amor cavatina that 
opens act ii fleming tended to eat words and add so much 
expression to each note that the melodys sense of direction was 
lost she also had to zero in a few times on the right pitch 
though her entrance in porgi amor was perfect 
the only real disappointment of the night was cynthia rose in 
the pants role of cherubino the hopeless adolescent wooer of older 
women she blared out loud notes and struck only false ones in her 
stage business often smiling inappropriately capering awkwardly 
and showing none of the sensuality this role needs 
john calvin west made his debut as dr bartolo and bellowed a 
little in his vendetta aria but was an amusing presence even 
more so was the dried up quavering don basilio of jerold siena 
down to his sagging left sock

motorists in carcrazy southern california 
would have to leave their wheels at home every other day under 
proposals offered by the environmental protection agency for 
cleaning up the nations dirtiest air 
the plan offered tuesday is aimed at cutting ozone a major 
component of smog by 86 percent by early next century 
it is a backup to a cleanair plan approved in 1989 by the south 
coast air quality management district the epa plan would take 
effect only if state and regional governments in the districts 
area fail to reduce smog significantly 
the epa proposals were prompted by a lawsuit filed by 
environmentalists in 1982 
we have been very concerned that the local district has been 
backsliding said jan chattenbrown president of the coalition 
for clean air this plan will send a clear message if the 
district wont do the job the epa will step in 
the epa guidelines include a proposal for nodrive days if other 
methods fail to reduce ozone such a plan would use odd or even 
numbers on license plates to assign alternate driving days for the 
areas 12 million motorists 
it is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities that we 
are presenting the nodrive day it is not one we are 
endorsing said daniel w mcgovern epa western regional 
administrative director 
state and local authorities have been engaged in an 
extraordinary effort to address this problem themselves which we 
all hope will render a federal plan as unnecessary 
other features of the epa plan include reduction of emissions by 
6 percent a year from pollution sources such as household products 
industrial solvents and pesticides extending pollution control 
standards to construction equipment pleasure boats and offroad 
vehicles and a requirement that new motor vehicles are 85 percent 
to 90 percent cleaner than current vehicles 
the current threestep aqmd plan affects everything from lawn 
mowers to refineries at an estimated cost of 262 billion a year 
but later steps of that plan include the use of technology not 
yet developed making its effectiveness a guessing game 
in 1988 the most recent year available los angeles exceeded 
the national standard for ozone 150 times compared with 20 times 
for new york and chicago 
the federal plan takes longer to achieve goals set by the 
regional agency the aqmd plan calls for reducing current ozone 
averages by 86 percent in 2007 the epa by 2010

the dollar has lost 41 yen from last friday and is at its 
lowest since its 14647yen close on february 23 
dealers said the dollar which also was sold in new york over 
the narrowing interest rate gap between japan and the united

dumped the dollar as soon as tokyos morning session started 
under the current situation with little difference in both 
countrys interest rates theres no reason to buy the currency 
dollar said a dealer with daiichi kangyo bank 
lower interest rates tend to make a countrys currency less 
attractive to foreign investors 
but the currency soon rose and ended higher than the opening 
because there was a greater than expected demand for the dollar 
below the 146yen line said yutaka hayashi a dealer with the 
mitsui taiyo kobe bank

interest so easily said masaki wakabayashi a trader with

the lead singer for judas priest says the 
heavy metal group once recorded a phrase backwards but didnt bury 
subliminal messages promoting suicide in an album blamed for the 
deaths of two young fans 
rob halford was the first of four band members to testify in a 
lawsuit brought by the parents of the two fans 
there are no subliminals of any nature on the 1978 album 
stained glass he said tuesday 
halford testified he recorded a backward phrase in the song 
love bites on the british bands album defenders of the 
faith in the mid1980s 
halford said he recorded the phrase in the dead of the night 
love bites backwards and played it simultaneously with the same 
words recorded forwards he said the backward version sounded like 
garbled speech 
district judge jerry carr whitehead who is hearing the case 
against the band and cbs records without a jury asked halford why 
he did it 
when youre composing songs youre always looking for new 
ideas new sounds just as an artist would add another piece of 
paint to a canvas halford said 
he said it was the only time he could recall deliberately using 
the technique on any of the groups 14 albums 
halford earlier gave a 10second a cappella demonstration of his 
vocal style using better by you better than me a song the 
families claim contains subliminal messages that led their sons to 
shoot themselves in a suicide pact 
halford sang better by you better than me you can tell her 
what i want it to be accenting the end of each line with a huff 
of breath 
the families of raymond belknap and james vance claim those 
lines contain the subliminal message do it 
the youths shot themselves in a deserted church playground in 
1985 belknap 18 died immediately vance then 20 blew away the 
bottom half of his face he died in 1988 of complications from his 
injuries and the various medications 
the band and cbs records deny any hidden messages exist they 
contend the supposed do it sounds are an exhalation of breath 
and a combination of drums guitars and vocals

president joaquim chissano has 
announced that for the first time in mozambiques history 
opposition parties will be allowed to compete for power 
the move reported tuesday by the national news agency aim was 
considered a major concession that could help end the nations 
13yearold civil war 
the conflict has claimed about 100000 lives most of them 
civilians 
for those who want to form parties as long as they obey the 
law as long as they behave peacefully we have no right to prevent 
them from doing so aim quoted chissano quoted as saying 
chissano said the political bureau of the ruling frelimo party 
had voted unanimously to adopt a multiparty system and that it 
should be in place for parliamentary and presidential elections 
next year 
frelimo has ruled mozambique as the sole legal political party 
since independence from portugal in 1975 the party was marxist 
but has undergone reforms in recent years and officially dropped 
its marxist label last year 
rebels of the mozambique national resistance began their 
insurgency in 1977 and the war has made this southeast african 
nation one of the poorest countries in the world 
almost half of mozambiques 15 million people require food aid 
more than 1 million people have been displaced and the annual per 
capita income is under 200 
the rebels known by their portuguese acronym renamo demand a 
multiparty system and free elections 
the government and rebels held their first direct talks three 
weeks ago in rome no major breakthroughs emerged but more talks 
are considered likely 
asked if renamo could become a legal political party chissano 
said i dont imagine that renamo will have any difficulty in 
fulfilling the criteria 
renamo knows the country they have people in all the 
provinces and districts they have the possibility of creating a 
base though how big it would be i dont know 
the rebels have no clear political program they have devastated 
the country with hitandrun attacks and have been accused of 
widespread civilian atrocities by the us state department and 
others 
the government controls the major cities but the rebels are 
active throughout the country in rural areas 
no government acknowledges supporting the rebels although south 
africa openly backed them before signing a 1984 mutual 
nonaggression pact with mozambique 
mozambique still receives most of its military help from the 
soviet union but the government has developed close ties with the 
united states and other western countries in recent years 
britain helps train the army and the united states is the 
leading donor of food aid

plo chairman yasser arafats guerrillas 
crushed the main base of an iranianbacked breakaway palestinian 
faction outside this port city today then clashed with its 
fighters in a nearby refugee camp 
police said at least six guerrillas were killed and 30 wounded 
the fighting beginning with a 90minute lightning assault on 
the base was part of a fatah crackdown on followers of renegade 
maj jamal suleiman 
it spread to ein elhilweh the largest palestinian refugee camp 
in lebanon after arafats guerrillas crushed suleimans main base 
in jabal alhaleeb or the milk mountain on the camps eastern 
edge 
suleiman 35 and about 30 of 150 fighters escaped the attack on 
the milk mountain base and took refuge at the nour or light 
mosque in ein elhilweh where they were joined by other sunni 
moslem fundamentalist palestinians 
col wajih abu ali commander of the palestine liberation 
organizations military police in the sidon region said the 
fundamentalists fired on fatah forces from the mosque and a nearby 
alley that is their stronghold in the camp 
he said sheik hisham shreidi a cleric connected with the 
fundamentalist hamas movement in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza was supporting suleiman in the fight against mainstream fatah 
witnesses in ein elhilweh said shreidi and a dozen other 
bearded clergymen were using the mosques louspeakers to blare 
calls for jihad or holy war against arafat 
arafats men according to col abu ali were responding to 
the shooting 
one witness speaking on condition of anonymity said a fierce 
clash was under way with automatic rifles and rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers 
its a sensitive situation abu ali said fatah cannot 
easily attack a mosque to evict them other antiarafat groups 
might suppport them too the situation in the camp is very tense 
however he said by finishing off suleimans base at jabal 
alhaleeb fatah eliminated a major threat to its rear guard in 
the area 
suleiman who heads ein elhilwehs martyrs battalion has sided 
with the proiranian hezbollah or party of god in its 
confrontation with the syrianbacked amal militia that broke out 
july 16 both militias are comprised of shiite moslems lebanons 
dominant sect 
at least 186 people have been killed and 560 wounded in the 
current round of amalhezbollah clashes for control of southern 
lebanons iqlim altuffah or apple province southeast of ein 
elhilweh 
fatah guerrillas joined forces with amal against hezbollah 
because they fear a fundamentalist expansion would threaten plo 
bases in ein elhilweh and the nearby mieh mieh camp on the 
outskirts of sidon 
sidon provincial capital of southern lebanon is 10 miles 
northwest of iqlim altuffah 
suleiman who has been getting support from hezbollah and the 
sunni moslem islamic grouping extremist faction for the past year 
fired 40 rockets on fatahs positions in iqlim altuffah on monday 
wounding at least seven guerrillas plo sources said 
they said fatah guerrillas launched their threepronged attack 
with grenades and machine guns against suleiman behind heavy 
artillery fire circling his 50man garrison in jabal alhaleeb 
arafat has at least 5000 hardcore fighters in the sidon region 
representatives of the red cross amal hezbollah and a 
1000strong plo disengagement force deployed in the apple province 
met behind closed doors at the headquarters of sidons militia 
leader mustafa saad to try to enforce a ceasefire originally 
called for sunday

the social security administration will 
schedule no more hearings for disability benefit appeals in 
september if they involve travel or other outside expenses 
however an agency spokesman said tuesday the decision does not 
affect thousands of hearings already scheduled and does not mean 
additional hearings cannot be booked 
philip gambino said the hold on additional travel or outside 
expenses is temporary and happens annually as the agency approaches 
the end of its fiscal year in september gambino said 
he denied a report published in the todays editions of the new 
york times saying the agency had suspended hearings in 
september because of the yearend financial crunch 
we havent canceled any hearings he said 
were still going to do hearings during september gambino 
said i cant even tell you if were going to do less in 
september than we are in august 
he estimated that the agency holds some 20000 hearings a month 
at more 200 locations around the country for people who are 
appealing decisions that deny or reduce the social security 
disability benefits they receive

a computerized databank of actions taken 
against incompetent physicians and dentists will start operating 
sept 1 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said tuesday 
that the national practitioner databank is intended to prevent 
physicians and dentists who have been disciplined from moving to 
another state and setting up new practices without detection 
the databank will store reports of malpractice actions 
licensure disciplinary actions by state medical and dental boards 
and actions by professional societies hospitals and other health 
care entities after a formal peer review process 
the reports must be made beginning sept 1 actions taken before 
then do not have to be reported 
hospitals will be required to check the databank when a 
physician or dentist applies to join the medical staff or receive 
clinical privileges sullivan said 
also hospitals will be required to check the databank every two 
years concerning physicians and dentists on their medical staffs or 
those who have clinical privileges 
state licensing boards also will have access to the information 
and individual physicians dentists and other health care 
professionals will be able to see their own records attorneys 
representing a physician or dentist may have access under limited 
conditions 
some have been critical of the data bank because members of the 
public will not have access to the information and retroactive 
reporting will not be required

a grand jury refused to indict a white 
policeman who fatally shot a black teenager in the back but new 
jerseys attorney general said the probe was tainted by autopsy 
errors and a new panel will be convened 
the slaying of phillip pannell jr 16 on april 10 touched off 
a night of rioting in teaneck a new york city suburb once called a 
model integrated community 
after word of the grand jury action spread on tuesday officers 
with riot sticks in hand milled around the teaneck police station 
but the evening passed without incident 
the grand jury refused to indict officer gary spath 29 who 
faced charges of manslaughter and improperly using deadly force 
attorney general robert del tufo said a serious mistake in 
pannells autopsy by medical examiner lawrence j denson led to 
an incorrect conclusion concerning the possible actions of mr 
pannell at the time he was shot 
the mistake permeated and distorted the investigation and the 
grand jury presentation the medical examiner has admitted his 
error del tufo said 
the attorney refused to answer questions and left the news 
conference 
robert galantucci spaths lawyer accused gov jim florio and 
del tufo of attempting to buy an indictment and said the call 
for a new panel was unscrupulous 
they shouldnt be playing politics with the grand jury 
system he said 
the victims father said he was disappointed but hopeful 
this is a sad day its three and a half months since my son 
was shot in the back for no reason pannell said 
but he said he had a message for the youth of teaneck chill 
out 
im willing to give america another chance for justice he 
said i feel justice will be served 
late tuesday community leaders counseled teaneck youths 
gathering behind the police station not to resort to violence 
try to be calm talk it out over the next few days said ted 
wells of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people he urged the gathering to trust the judicial process 
calling the empaneling of a second grand jury an extraordinary step 
if there was a scam theyd give no indictment shut up and 
bite the bullet he said 
a key question before the panel was whether pannell had raised 
his hands in the air and pleaded with police not to shoot as some 
witnesses said or whether he twice stopped and turned in a 
threatening way toward the officers 
officials close to the case say one crucial question is whether 
pannell was frisked by officer wayne blanco moments before he was 
shot according to the record of hackensack 
blanco said he frisked the teenager and warned spath about a 
gun he felt in pannells jacket according to the newspaper 
but teenagers with pannell said there was no frisking before 
the youngster ran and the man whose telephone call alerted police 
about a youth with a gun said he backed the youths accounts when 
he testified before the grand jury the paper said 
police said they recovered from pannells clothing a 
chromeplated athletic starter pistol that had been modified to 
fire live ammunition 
weve been praying for the pannell family all along and will 
continue to pray for the pannell family spath said at a news 
conference 
black leaders had demanded that a special prosecutor handle the 
case but instead it was transferred from bergen county to a state 
grand jury sitting in the state capital and a deputy attorney 
general handled the case

reconciliation talks between iraq 
and kuwait in their dispute over oil borders and money apparently 
collapsed today and the iraqi delegation left for baghdad sources 
said 
senior officials from the two persian gulf nations failed to 
hold a scheduled second round of talks despite intensive 
behindthescenes efforts by host saudi arabia the sources said 
iraq maintained a hardline on the twoweekold disagreement 
they said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the sources said saudi king fahd was expected to try to arrange 
a meeting between president saddam hussein of iraq and kuwaits 
emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah in an attempt to break the 
impasse 
president hosni mubarak of egypt and other arab leaders also 
were trying to defuse the tension and bring the two sides back 
together 
the most important issue on the table in jiddah is the dispute 
over the countries joint border which has been undemarcated since 
kuwait won independence in 1961 
iraq accuses kuwait of encroaching upon the frontier and 
building oil installations military posts and farms it has in the 
past few weeks moved an estimated 100000 troops and hundreds of 
tanks on the kuwaiti border 
iraq is demanding that kuwait compensate it for 24 billion 
worth of oil drilled from a border oilfield it claims iraq also 
insists that kuwait write off loans of billions of dollars kuwait 
made to it during the eightyear iraniraq war 
iraqs had also complained about an oil glut that cost it 14 
billion being caused by overproduction on the part of kuwait and 
united arab emirates 
but that dispute appeared to have been settled by firm pledges 
of discipline by the two countries at last weeks geneva meeting of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
on tuesday kuwait had sent crown prince and deputy premier 
sheik saad alabdullah alsabah and iraq its no 2 leader izzat 
ibrahim to jiddah the saudi monarch succeeded in getting the two 
leaders to kiss and embrace 
sheik saad and ibrahim along with their delegations met for 
two hours in the presence of the saudi crown prince abdullah and 
separately 
they were feted at a dinner banquet by the saudi monarch and had 
been set to resume their peace parley this morning

the dollar firmed against european currencies this 
morning but dropped against the japanese yen 
spot gold prices regained some of the ground lost in tuesdays 
trading in new york 
in tokyo the dollar sank to its lowest level since february 23 
it closed at 14665 yen down 085 yen from tuesday later in 
london the dollar was quoted at 14612 yen 
other dollar rates in europe compared with late tuesday

dealers in tokyo said institutional investors noting the 
narrowing gap between us and japanese interest rates began 
dumping dollars as soon as the tokyo market opened and the us 
unit fell below 146 yen 
once that happened there was a greater than expected demand 
for the dollar below the 146yen line said yutaka hayashi a 
dealer with the mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
several analysts believe the dollar will sink as low as 140 yen 
this summer and perhaps dip below 15620 deutsche marks the 
lowest level since world war ii 
there is not a lot of reason why the market should start 
buying the dollar said jim oneil international economist at 
swiss bank corp in london 
the dollars weakness in the foreign exchanges is helping 
support gold prices although dealers are debating whether gold has 
sufficient support to move convincingly into a technical chart

in yet another move to end years of 
isolation as an orthodox communist state albania has announced its 
intention to permit joint ventures and other forms of foreign 
investment 
the presidium of the peoples assembly or parliament also 
approved a decree granting limited rights to stage public 
demonstrations and proposed setting up a special commission to 
consider constitutional changes 
the presidiums decisions were reported tuesday by the state 
news agency ata in a dispatch monitored in vienna it did not 
elaborate on the constitutional questions 
the moves come just weeks after about 5000 albanians flooded 
embassies in tirana the capital and received permission to leave 
their homeland 
many of the refugees complained of bleak economic prospects as 
well as the lack of political freedom albania is europes poorest 
country and last hardline communist state 
the new economic reforms apparently are designed to help 
alleviate the countrys economic backwardness and provide technical 
knowhow 
the decree on foreign investments stated that foreign 
embassies firms or individuals or albanians residing abroad can 
make investments or carry out related economic activities 
while the official announcement did not specifically mention 
joint ventures it said that enterprises with participation of 
foreign capital can carry out their economic activity in various 
sectors of the economy 
ata said the aim of such enterprises is the modernization of 
existing projects or the setting up of new projects with advanced 
technology 
it said joint ventures could help in extracting and processing 
raw materials increasing exports and decreasing dependence on 
imports producing more consumer goods and creating new jobs 
most contracts would require government approval ata said 
the presidiums decree on meetings gatherings and 
manifestations would grant albanians only limited freedom of 
assembly 
the decree as reported by ata apparently would continue to ban 
most antigovernment demonstrations including protests similar to 
those at embassies earlier this month 
such gatherings where appeals against the constitutional order 
are launched where calls are made for committing violations of 
the law where violations of relations with other countries are 
aimed at are banned the ata report said

federal regulators say they were unaware that 
one of an arizona insurance executives corporations had pleaded 
guilty to a felony when they allowed him to buy 15 savings and loan 
associations 
the sale of what now is known as bluebonnet savings bank of 
dallas was underwritten by taxpayers to the tune of at least 185 
billion and perhaps 3 billion congressional investigators say 
bluebonnet now is among the nations most profitable savings 
institutions 
the sale of the faltering sampls to james m fail who has 
insurance operations in 47 states was approved by the federal home 
loan bank board in december 1988 a few days before a lucrative tax 
break for sampl investors was to expire 
while i certainly had misgivings about mr fails background 
he did not to my knowledge at that time fail to qualify to 
purchase the sampls george m barclay president of the federal home 
loan bank of dallas told a senate judiciary subcommittee tuesday 
barclay said he was aware that in 1976 fail has entered into a 
plea bargain that resulted in dismissal of a fraud indictment in 
alabama the law says an indictment within the past 10 years should 
serve as a presumptive disqualifier to own an sampl 
barclay said he did not know however that fail at the same 
time had pleaded guilty to a felony fraud indictment on behalf of a 
corporation he controlled that plea amounting to a conviction 
could have disqualified him 
had i understood on dec 22 1988 the facts as i believe them 
to be today i certainly would have objected to mr fails 
acquisition of bluebonnet barclay testified 
critics in congress are citing bluebonnet as the worst example 
of the sampl mess which now is conceded to be the biggest financial 
scandal in the nations history 
m danny wall who at the time of the sale headed the federal 
home loan bank board defended the choice of fail as a buyer 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the antitrust 
subcommittee said that if the rival group had been allowed to buy 
bluebonnet it would have saved taxpayers 97 million 
thats not true at all wall said if the two bids were 
compared on the same basis the final terms of the bluebonnet 
negotiations were significantly better than those offered by 
rival bidders he said 
fail put up 1000 cash to make the purchase and borrowed the 
remainder of the required 70 million capital contribution 
including 10 million that was paid several weeks later than had 
been agreed 
metzenbaum has questioned the role in the bluebonnet affair 
played by robert j thompson who was a congressional liaison for 
thenvice president bush thompson refused to answer a subpoena to 
testify tuesday and metzenbaum said he will ask the full judiciary 
committee to compel thompson to comply 
we believe that mr thompson made good use of his access 
at key junctures in the bluebonnet acquisition process 
metzenbaum said 
thompsons lawyer stanley brand told reporters outside the 
subcommittee hearing room that thompson did nothing wrong and 
scrupulously followed federal regulations in acting on behalf of 
fail 
the new york times reported in todays editions that thompson 
was able to review a 1989 draft report by the inspector general of 
the bank board that found fail should have been precluded from 
buying the texas thrifts 
the newspaper said thompsons lobbying firm helped regulators 
prepare a response to the report 
thompson said in an interview in the washington post on tuesday 
that in exchange for helping fail he was paid a lobbying fee 
given a 150000 loan and promised 2 percent of profits from 
bluebonnet metzenbaum said that percentage could be worth tens of 
millions of dollars 
thompson contends the subcommittee has no jurisdiction over 
banking matters and accused the panel of systematically turning 
over his private documents to the times 
wall who was the top regulator of sampls denied any impropriety 
and said he had met with thompson only three times never to 
discuss bluebonnet

fastmoving developments in afghanistan to end the bloodiest 
conflict dividing the superpowers 
the diplomats began two days of talks whose centerpiece was 
expected to be afghanistans 12yearold civil war which has 
claimed more than 15 million lives and left the country in ruins 
we will be able to help solve the afghanistan question

the document was in response to bakers july 18 offer at a 
meeting with shevardnadze in paris of us technical advice to help 
the soviets salvage their failing economy 
with democratic changes sweeping eastern europe and disputes 
over german reunification largely settled washington and moscow 
are eager to end regional conflicts in asia such as those in 
cambodia and afghanistan the afghan war is costing the superpowers 
billions of dollars in weapons and economic aid 
baker arrived in irkutsk early today from singapore and goes to 
mongolia on thursday the soviets invited him to the siberian 
wilderness of cedar birch and pine trees to reciprocate for 
shevardnadzes trip to wyoming last fall 
the two envoys sampled nature after hopping aboard a white and 
blue hydrofoil later today for a 43mile cruise along the 
treelined angara river to a fishing lodge near lake baikal which 
contains onesixth of the worlds fresh water 
from the log cabin set in the forest they boarded a small boat 
to go fishing before sitting down for dinner and a second round of 
talks 
shevardnadze and baker are believed to be working on a formula 
for a ceasefire in afghanistan and an interim government to rule 
the country 
the sovietsupported afghan president najibullah has been 
unable to bring the usbacked rebels fighting his government to 
the bargaining table and washington has been pressing for him to 
step down 
najibullah flew to moscow on sunday for what soviet officials 
said was medical care but shevardnadze told reporters today he was 
vacationing in a location other than moscow he would not say where 
the soviet source said it was a pure coincidence that 
najibullahs visit coincided with the bakershevardnadze talks and 
expressed confidence he would return to afghanistan as president 
the source said najibullah was likely to meet during his visit 
with gorbachev who began a vacation this week on russias crimean 
peninsula 
aside from wanting to reduce tensions both superpowers are 
trying to end the afghan war for economic reasons 
the soviet union is anxious to reduce foreign aid so it can put 
more resources into solving a domestic economic crisis that is 
keeping food and consumer goods off store shelves fueling a budget 
deficit and crumbling the countrys infrastructure the 300 
million a month the kremlin reportedly spends to maintain the 
najibullah government is a likely target 
the united states would like to trim its budget and the senate 
intelligence committee has voted to cut secret aid for the afghan 
rebels from 300 million to 200 million a year 
soviet troops fought moslem guerrillas in afghanistan for nine 
years after a 1978 coup that installed a communist government 
moscow withdrew the last of its soldiers in february 1989 under a 
unbrokered peace agreement but the war continues and is at a 
stalemate 
baker told reporters he and shevardnadze also would discuss a 
treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons and cuts in conventional 
arms both sides are trying to agree on the nuclear treaty so bush 
and gorbachev can sign it at their moscow summit

african national congress leader 
nelson mandela said he and president fw de klerk had a cordial 
meeting today to discuss the communist partys representation in 
talks with the government 
mandela said he would comment later on communist party leader 
joe slovos standing as an anc delegate in talks that are to begin 
monday 
at a meeting last week de klerk suggested to mandela that slovo 
be dropped from the anc negotiating team because of police 
allegations that the communist party was plotting a secret revolt 
since that meeting and todays questions have been raised about 
the accuracy of the police information given to de klerk 
mandela and other anc leaders believe significant progress could 
be made at next weeks talks with the government on ending 
guerrilla activity returning exiles and freeing prisoners 
convicted of politically motivated crimes 
mandela and slovo have denied any plot existed for a secret 
revolt and they appeared together at a communist party rally on 
sunday the anc and the communist party are longtime allies because 
of their common opposition to apartheid the two groups share 
several top officials 
police have backed off their contention that slovo was at a 
meeting at which communist party members allegedly discussed 
continuing the armed revolt while a new constitution is negotiated 
the communist party released a transcript of the meeting which 
does not match the one police leaked to newspapers 
scores of anc and communist party guerrillas have been detained 
without charge in the past few weeks including mac maharaj a 
member of the anc executive committee who returned to south africa 
in june under de klerks promise of indemnity from prosecution 
police contend the indemnity for past actions does not exempt 
anc leaders from prosecution for crimes they may commit while in 
the country for negotiations police say guerrillas are continuing 
to cross the border illegally store weapons and plan and train 
for military actions 
anc leaders have given conflicting statements on guerrilla 
activity but have generally noted that there is no ceasefire with 
the government

a lawyer charged with sedition and freed 
on bond accused the government today of extreme cruelty for 
holding him and others similarly charged incommunicado in a prison 
psychiatric wing 
gitobu imanyara who edits a monthly magazine often critical of 
the government was charged with sedition thursday and released 
tuesday on 8700 bond the charge stems from the most recent issue 
of the nairobi law monthly which was devoted entirely to 
multiparty politics law and democracy 
president daniel arap moi and other government leaders 
vehemently have rejected calls for multiparty democracy in kenya 
claiming more than one party could lead to tribalbased political 
groups and even warfare between the countrys approximately 40 
ethnic groups 
imanyara and two other lawyers were picked up in early july in a 
wave of arrests that netted kenyas most vocal proponents of 
political change including two former cabinet ministers and the 
son of keyas first vice president 
the three were held for 20 days without charge before being 
released on july 25 but imanyara was immediately arrested again 
and charged with sedition the following day 
imanyara said that during his six days in jail he was held 
incommunicado in the psychiatric wing of kamiti prison on nairobis 
outskirts 
he said he found others similarly charged also being held there 
including a presbyterian minister the rev lawford ndege imunde 
who was sentenced in march to six years imprisonment for having 
been found with allegdly seditious entries in his desk diary 
imanyara who was imprisoned from 1982 to 1985 after defending 
120 air force officers charged in a coup attempt described the 
conditions a kamiti as extreme cruelty 
he said he and the others were kept in solitary confinment and 
never allowed to leave their unlighted cells 
he said toilet paper and tooth brushes were not provided and a 
single chamber pot per prisoner was supposed to serve as wash basin 
and toilet 
imanyara said they were given two blankets and fed cornmeal mush 
for breakfast and beans at night 
the conditions are about 20 times worse than detention he 
said i am really concerned about the people in that place 
he said that in addition to imunde the others he found in the 
psychiatric wing were former detainees george anyona edward oyugi 
and isaiah ngotho kariuki and a rural ruling party official 
augustine gathangu they also were arrested in the government 
crackdown and were charged last week with sedition 
attorneys for anyona oyugi kariuki and gathangu charged at a 
bail hearing tuesday that their clients had been tortured the 
judge refused to set bail and adjourned the hearing until aug 7 to 
give the government time to respond

fifteen years after the last us troops 
pulled out of vietnam save the children hopes to become the first 
american service organization to return to the southeast asian 
country 
the westportbased international child assistance agency reached 
agreement last month with the government of vietnams poorest 
province thanh hoa to start a longterm program aimed at 
increasing food production improving education and curbing 
malnutrition 
its a special opportunity joy carol director of the 
organizations asia pacific programs said tuesday we were 
working in vietnam from 1963 to 1975 now we are returning because 
we know the need is so great there 
carol also called the program which is scheduled to begin in 
november a project of reconciliation and healing 
the program which has the endorsement of the vietnamese mission 
to the united nations and the vietnam veterans of america 
foundation is a pilot project which if successful may be 
extended to other areas of vietnam 
it represents the first time save the children will provide 
longterm service to a country that does not have diplomatic 
relations with the united states 
we think programs like this only can add to what we think is

construction spending was flat in june after 
two consecutive monthly declines the government said today in a 
report pointing to further evidence of weakness in the building 
industry 
the commerce department reported that residential 
nonresidential and government construction spending totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4475 billion 
but it also said the declines in april and may were not as 
severe as first reported the april decline was revised from 22 
percent to 19 percent and the may drop was changed from 04 
percent to 03 percent spending had risen 04 percent in march 
despite the recent weakness construction spending in june was 
37 percent above that of the same month in 1989 when it totaled 
4316 billion 
spending in january and february posted large gains which 
analysts attributed to unseasonably warm weather that prompted some 
builders to steal activity scheduled for later in the year 
in addition high interest rates and tighter lending 
requirements have held back construction projects in some areas 
the industry weakness was suggested in the labor departments 
recent report showing a loss of 14000 construction jobs in june on 
top of a 179000 decline during the three previous months 
residential spending declined 22 percent to 1961 billion at 
an annual rate after falling an identical 22 percent the previous 
month 
singlefamily spending was off 35 percent to 1113 billion at 
an annual rate following a 40 percent decline in may 
apartment construction was unchanged at 308 billion after 
rising 15 percent the previous month 
nonresidential spending jumped 39 percent to 1071 billion 
after falling 09 percent in may leading the increase was a 102 
percent gain in spending on office buildings 
the oftenvolatile government sector edged down 01 percent to 
1084 billion after advancing 38 percent in may

sudan will ask the united nations to give 
more relief supplies to governmentheld areas in the embattled 
south and less to rebelcontrolled regions a cabinet minister said 
today 
peter orat minister of relief and displaced people was quoted 
by the governmentowned alinkaz alwatany newspaper as saying that 
a un team of experts would survey areas in western and southern 
sudan next week to verify government claims that displaced 
inhabitants have returned home 
the government has claimed that some rebelheld areas had been 
recaptured by government forces leading to the repatriation of 
refugees to those areas 
orat said a previous agreement with the united nations set the 
ratio of relief distribution at 33 percent for rebelheld areas and 
67 percent to governmentcontrolled areas he said the government 
will ask the united nations to change those ratios to reflect the 
repatriation of the refugees 
also today the military government freed 18 trade unionists who 
were in custody on suspicion of instigating strikes the official 
sudan news agency reported suna said the releases were a good 
gesture from the revolution and a move to allow them to open a new 
page 
sudans powerful trade and professional unions played an 
important role in overthrowing president gaafar nimeiri in 1985 
they were active in sudanese politics until lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir dissolved the unions shortly after taking power in a 
military coup in june 1989 
after coming to power elbashirs government arrested scores of 
unionists and made strikes illegal 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army took up arms against 
the government in 1983 demanding greater autonomy and economic 
reforms in southern sudan the fighting created famines that killed 
hundreds of thousands of civilians 
in 1989 a uncoordinated relief operation dubbed operation 
lifeline sudan was successful in averting a repeat of the 1988 
starvation which un officials said killed 260000 people 
the un operation has continued in 1990 at a smaller scale and 
is facing political and logistical problems from the government and 
the rebels

south pacific nations today criticized 
a us plan to burn chemical weapons on a remote pacific atoll and 
said they would not allow the region to become the toxic waste 
disposal center of the world 
but the communique issued by the 15nation south pacific forum 
at the end of a twoday meeting stopped short of condemning the 
united states 
the chemical weapons which were stockpiled in west germany and 
elsewhere are to be destroyed at an incinerator now being tested 
on the johnson atoll 
the united states has agreed to move its entire stockpile of 
chemical weapons out of west germany by the end of the year 
also to be destroyed are 1200 tons of weapons already on 
johnston atoll which are so badly corroded by sea air they cannot 
be moved in addition a leaking stockpile of about 100 us 
mustardgas rounds dating from world war ii recently was found in 
the solomon islands 
despite assurances from washington the pacific leaders said 
they remained concerned by the substantial potential risks to the 
environment of the incineration of the chemical weapons 
prime minister bob hawke of australia argued in favor of the 
plan saying scientific evidence indicated the incineration was 
safe he said the project was in the interests of worldwide 
disarmament 
the communique called for the incinerator to stop operating when 
the current project is completed 
the pacific leaders whose governments represent about 25 
million people will discuss the issue friday with a us 
delegation 
also on hand for discussions will be representatives of canada 
china britain japan and france 
on a related matter many pacific leaders also strongly object 
to french nuclear testing in polynesia

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has 
invited his israeli counterpart david levy to talks on resolving 
the middle east conflict an israeli official said today 
the official from israels foreign ministry who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity said shevardnadzes invitation 
was given verbally by the leading soviet consular delegate in 
israel alexei chestakov 
the soviet union severed diplomatic relations with israeli 
following the 1967 middle east war but has been gradually improving 
ties since stationing consular representatives in tel aviv three 
years ago 
a shevardnadzelevy meeting would not be the first between the 
soviet foreign minister and a highranking israeli official 
shevardnadze met last year with former foreign minister moshe 
arens like levy a member of the rightwing likud bloc and also 
met with former science minister ezer weizman a leading dove in 
the leftleaning labor party 
chestakov told levy in a meeting tuesday that shevardnadze 
believes the soviet union should give high priority to doing 
something immediate to lessen tensions in the middle east the 
foreign ministry official said 
no date was set for the meeting but it was likely the two would 
meet in new york city in september when foreign ministers 
customarily attend the opening sessions of the un general 
assembly 
repeated efforts by the united states to initiate talks between 
israel and representatives of the palestinians have repeatedly 
stalled israel has refused to meet with members of the plo which 
palestinians who have been waging an uprising in the occupied 
territories say is their sole representative 
the soviet union is the key military supplier of syria israels 
most implacable foe in the middle east 
in the meeting with chestakov levy urged the soviets to quickly 
resume full diplomatic ties with israel the lack of such ties 
legitimizes the arab hostile position toward israel levy was 
quoted as saying 
the soviet union has refused to resume diplomatic ties until 
israel moves toward making peace with palestinians 
the moroccanborn levy 52 holds the no 2 spot in prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
he took office when shamirs coalition was installed on june 11

the chinese army celebrated its 63rd anniversary 
today with little fanfare but with renewed calls for strengthening 
the political and moral fiber of the nations fighting force 
last year a media barrage surrounded the aug 1 anniversary 
designed to repair the armys image after the military crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement in beijing but this year the even got 
little publicity 
tiananmen square closed last year for a military awards 
ceremony was open today and filled with tourists neither the 
square nor adjoining changan avenue were decorated for army day 
the communist party peoples daily carried a speech by party 
chief jiang zemin on its front page but there were no red 
headlines a tradition on major holidays 
in the days prior to aug 1 speeches and newspaper commentaries 
emphasized that the army is subordinate to the communist party and 
that political education must be strengthened 
jiang told the nation in a televised speech tuesday night that 
the basic factor in strengthening army construction is to persist 
in the partys absolute leadership over the army 
only by upholding the partys leadership can the army maintain 
its proletariat nature and maintain its correct political 
direction he said 
jiang urged soldiers to enthusiastically study 
marxistleninist theory vigorously improve the quality of their 
ideolgocial thought and strengthen their ability to resist 
bourgeois liberalization and other corrosive decadent influences 
bourgeois liberalization refers to western ideas 
marshal nie rongzhen one of the last surviving of chinas 10 
marshals said in an interview published earlier this week that 
political integrity was just as important as ability in 
selecting officers 
alluding to a wellknown saying by revolutionary leader mao 
tsetung that power comes from the barrel of a gun nie said the 
barrels of guns are very important but even more important is 
whose hand the barrels of guns are in 
his words were echoed in a commentary in the army newspaper the 
pla daily which called on educational facilities particularly 
military academies to firmly place moral or political 
education in the number one position 
whether army school graduates are politically up to standard 
is in direct relation to who has control of the barrel of the 
gun the unsigned commentary said

house speaker thomas foley today denounced the 
irish republican army for the murder of british parliament member 
ian gow and said the bombing would not stifle political efforts to 
make peace 
the clear and despicable purpose of this callous act was 
intimidation through terror foley said in an unusual speech on 
the house floor traditionally house speakers do not take to the 
floor to speak about nonlegislative matters 
reconciliation and necessary economic change cannot be 
purchased with the gun and the bomb he said 
gow a conservative and a close friend of prime minister 
margaret thatcher was killed monday when a bomb detonated in his 
car at his home gow was an outspoken foe of the ira 
the iras guns and bombs have not brought independence for 
northern ireland nor will they they havent brought jobs or the 
elimination of sectarian discrimination nor will they what they 
have bought in the years since british troops were sent to 
northern ireland in 1972 is the deaths of many more civilian 
bystanders than of soldiers or policemen foley said 
the ira pretend to be the protector of the catholic minority 
but the ira is responsible for the deaths of many more catholics 
than protestants in fact many more deaths than can be attributed 
to the british forces or the police 
neither foley added will violence deter open discourse and 
the pursuit of peaceful political agreement among freely elected 
governments and legislatures 
he expressed strong solidarity with our sister house in 
westminster in its time of duress and sorrow and concluded by 
urging that whatever the governments of ireland and of the united 
kingdom may resolve with respect to northern ireland they do so 
without any reference and in common defiance to the terror 
tactics of the ira

the reports had been sent to the companys president at the 
time demetrios b haseotes by james m mumma director of loss

the military filed murder charges 
today against three american drug agents and 13 filipino policemen 
in the slaying of three soldiers killed during an alleged drug bust 
last month 
officials in washington said today that the charges against the 
three american agents have no merit that the men have been 
removed from the philippines and that they will not return to 
stand trial 
the charges were filed with the provincial prosecutor against 
philip needham andrew fenrich and jake fernandez agents of the 
us drug enforcement administration according to brig gen 
gerardo flores chief of staff of the philippine constabulary 
flores said 10 of the 16 were charged before a military court 
under philippine law prosecutors decide whether to indict those 
charged by police 
the us embassy said the three americans have left the country 
and have no immediate plans to return needham was assigned to 
the dea office in bangkok thailand and the others were posted in 
manila 
in bangkok needham said he had no comment on the incident and 
referred all further inquiries to the drug enforcement 
administration in washington 
these charges have no merit dea administrator terrence 
burke said in a statement issued in washington today 
dea spokesman joe keefe who confirmed the three agents have 
left the philippines said in washington that the men didnt even 
use their firearms on the day the shooting incident occurred 
we would like to emphasize that the dea agents were working at 
the request of the philippines government in cooperation with the 
national bureau of investigation he said 
were cooperating with the philippine government on this 
situation keefe said but he added that there are no plans to 
return the three dea agents to the philippines to face the murder 
charges 
the charges stem from a july 10 incident in which col rolando 
de guzman deputy chief of the northern luzon command his 
intelligence officer maj frank calanog and another soldier were 
slain in what police said was a shootout during a drug bust 
according to the national bureau of investigation de guzman and 
the others tried to sell 10 million worth of heroin to needham 
who was posing as a buyer shooting broke out when the three 
resisted arrest the bureau claims 
but flores said his investigation showed the three were slain 
under the control of police and could not have fired their 
weapons 
brig gen virgilio david chief of the militarys narcotics 
command called the slayings coldblooded murder 
the high values in law enforcement are taken into 
consideration and to prevent crimes flores said we arrest 
suspects not kill them 
embassy officials have not given a detailed account of what they 
believe transpired 
ten of the filipinos ordered arrested are members of the manila 
police department detailed to the national bureau of investigation 
during the case they include capt reynaldo jaylo cited by 
president corazon aquino last month as one of the countrys 
outstanding police officers 
the three others are assigned to the national bureau of 
investigation and include epimaco velasco assistant to bureau 
director alfredo lim 
when lim announced the shootout last month he told reporters 
that an american later identified as needham escaped 
the next day however the philippine daily inquirer quoted 
unidentified military sources as saying needham was a dea agent 
from bangkok 
military sources said on condition of anonymity that senior 
officers suspect the killing was a plot by the cia to drive a wedge 
between the military and the police and encourage a coup attempt 
against mrs aquino 
the us embassy for years has denied repeated speculation that 
washington was secretly supporting coup plots to force the 
philippines into extending the lease on the six us military 
bases the lease expires next year 
senior officers speaking on condition of anonymity expressed 
outrage that national bureau of investigation agents had 
murdered their comrades on orders of the americans 
mrs aquino has faced six coup attempts since she took office in 
1986 after a people power revolt that ousted longtime dictator 
ferdinand marcos 
the dea says the philippines is a transshipment point for heroin 
and a new form of methamphetamine called ice and a main source 
of marijuana

democrats on the house armed services 
committee today hailed their 283 billion defense bill for 
reflecting the new threat the new challenges with deep budget 
cuts in the strategic defense initiative and a halt to the stealth 
bomber program 
i think its a combination of the changes in the soviet threat 
and the changes in the budget deficit rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the panel said of the bill that was approved by the 
committee overwhelmingly 4012 
acknowledging the end of the cold war the legislation makes 
wholesale reductions in several major strategic programs and for 
the first time ever kills a major weapons system the b2 bomber 
aspin said 
the committee realized that youve got to take something out 
and one candidate with the lowest priority was the b2 the 
chairman told reporters at a news conference 
the air forces chief of staff gen michael dugan predicted 
that in the end congress will not kill the b2 saying in an 
interview on fox television today that thoughtful men and women 
will come to the conclusion that if you want peace you have to 
prepare for war 
but rep patricia schroeder dcolo said that the bill very 
much fits the new threat the new challenges 
some republicans gave the legislation low marks on tuesday 
it stinks said rep william dickinson of alabama ranking 
republican on the committee i voted against it and i will 
strongly urge the president to veto it 
the legislation which the full house will consider in early 
september slashes 24 billion from bushs proposal of 307 billion 
in military spending for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 it also 
marks a drop from this years 305 billion defense 
the senate is expected to take up its 289 billion version of 
the defense bill later this week 
among major provisions of the house bill is an end to the 
radarevading b2 stealth bomber at the 15 planes currently in 
development a cut of 29 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative elimination of all money for two landbased nuclear 
missile systems and a cut of 129500 military personnel 
president bush had called for two stealth aircraft in fiscal 
1991 47 billion for sdi commonly known as star wars more than 
2 billion for the mx and midgetman missiles and a troop reduction 
of 38000 
while chopping money from strategic programs the panel rejected 
defense secretary dick cheneys second attempt in two years to kill 
the v22 osprey a tiltrotor aircraft that has widespread support 
in congress 
the armed services committee added 403 million for the marine 
corps hybrid plane which is manufactured in texas and 
pennsylvania 
if you like to smell the pork youd love this bill 
dickinson quipped 
although support for the b2 bomber remains in the senate the 
panel dealt a serious blow to bushs plan to build a 75plane 
fleet at nearly 865 million apiece the aircraft are the 
costliest planes ever built 
on monday the panels procurement subcommittee eliminated funds 
for the bomber in the new fiscal year thus cutting off purchases 
after the first 15 the full committee voted 3420 tuesday to 
reject an amendment by rep ike skelton dmo to reverse the 
subcommittees action 
people were surprised the berlin wall fell down said rep 
john kasich rohio cosponsor of legislation to cancel the b2 
program its surprising the armed services panel killed a major 
weapons program 
nine republicans voted to terminate the stealth bomber kasich 
said 
bush had sought 46 billion in the budget for two of the 
batwinged planes next year and advanced procurement of parts for 
six more in the following year 
the senate armed services committee in its version of the 
defense bill approved earlier this month adopted the 
administrations request 
on another major strategic system bush had called for 21 
billion for the multiplewarhead mx missile and for moving the 
missiles from fixed underground silos to railroad cars he also 
sought 202 million in research money for the singlewarhead 
midgetman 
the house committee eliminated all that money and instead 
created a 600 million pot for developing the next generation of 
intercontinental missiles 
the panel also called on bush to report to the panel in 90 days 
on which new missile the administration wants a mobile mx or the 
new midgetman and end the longrunning debate over which project 
to back 
the committee also approved 
one of two seawolf attack submarines bush had sought five 
destroyers at a cost of 36 billion and 12 billion for the 18th 
trident missilelaunching submarine 
a ban on spending any money to move the 401st tactical fighter 
wing from torrejon de ardoz spain to crotone italy or any other 
location overseas 
the provision touched off a lengthy debate in the committee 
with republicans criticizing the amendment as detrimental to the 
us position in the north atlantic treaty organization 
postponing fullscale development of the advanced tactical 
fighter delaying the scout attack helicopter project and 
restricting the c17 transport plane program until cheney can 
certify the first flight

radio free europe began 
broadcasting directly from prague on wednesday after 40 years of 
transmitting news to czechoslovakia from abroad 
for the first time in history rfe is broadcasting directly 
from within a country about that country instead of from abroad 
said pavel pechacek director of czechoslovak broadcasting for 
radio free europe 
for 40 years rfe broadcasts were jammed in czechoslovakia and 
the rest of eastern europe to prevent the flow of uncensored 
information about the soviet bloc and news from the west 
the fact that we are now able to transmit over czechoslovak 
radio is really the best proof of the progress and development 
which has taken place in this country in the short period of eight 
months pechacek said 
he was referring to the period following the peaceful revolution 
last fall that toppled the communist regime in czechoslovakia

president mikhail s gorbachev and his main 
political rival boris n yeltsin have formed a joint committee to 
revamp the soviet economy in a sign that gorbachev is willing to 
move faster toward market reforms 
the 12member committee which held its first meeting wednesday 
brought together moderate reformers loyal to gorbachev and more 
radical reformers supporting yeltsin the president of the huge 
russian republic who recently quit gorbachevs communist party 
a western diplomat termed the move rather important because 
the national government was in danger of falling far behind 
economic changes introduced in russia the largest of the soviet 
unions 15 republics 
if they dont do something like this they are going to be 
left behind the diplomat said speaking on condition of 
anonymity russia is going to move ahead fast 
more rapid reform of the soviet economy also could increase the 
chances for obtaining western aid which gorbachev says is 
necessary to reform the economy 
gorbachevs top economic adviser nikolai y petrakov said in 
an interview that the decision to form the committee was the most 
important information of 1990 in soviet domestic politics he 
said gorbachev and yeltsin signed the agreement saturday after 
several days of talks 
the economists appointed to it will develop a common economic 
policy for the nation petrakov said it was too early to say what 
they might recommend but their work should be done by sept 1 
when the national and russian parliaments reconvene economic 
reforms will be of top priority at the sessions 
the committee includes such proponents of reform as petrakov 
deputy premier leonid a abalkin presidential council member 
stanislav shatalin economist and writer nikolai shmelev yeltsin 
deputy grigory yavlinsky and russian finance minister boris 
fyodorov 
the interfax news service identifed yavlinsky as the author of 
yeltsins 500 days economic program to move russia to a market 
economy 
over gorbachevs objections yeltsin was elected in may to head 
russia which contains threefourths of the soviet unions land and 
more than half its people since then he has slowly outlined plans 
to overhaul the republics economy 
he has shown tolerance toward private property and in recent 
weeks indicated he intends to radically reform land ownership and 
seize control of banking that brought a sharp response from 
gorbachev who on sunday urged soviet republics not to try to break 
away from the central money and banking system 
gorbachev and his premier nikolai i ryzhkov have moved more 
slowly on the economy and are facing sharp criticism for its 
failures yeltsin and other reformers have urged ryzhkov to resign 
yeltsin also quit the communist party last month starting an 
exodus of leading reformers 
the independent postfactum news service reported that gorbachev 
and yeltsin froze ryzhkov out of their agreement and that the 
premier refused to sign it for several days 
a januaryjune economic report released sunday indicated the 
soviet economy continued to deteriorate in the first half of the 
year the gross national product the value of retail prices of 
all goods and services produced dropped 1 percent labor 
productivity dropped 15 percent 
the postfactum news service reported that the committee will not 
recommend immediate price increases which is something ryzhkov 
recommended 
under his proposal bread prices would have increased in stages 
beginning july 1 but the national parliament rejected the idea it 
told the government to return with a better plan in the fall 
yeltsin also opposed the plan saying it would hit soviet 
consumers too hard 
a top russian republic official deputy parliamentary chairman 
boris isayev told a briefing tuesday that a special parliamentary 
session of the russian republic would be called in late october to 
reform farm policy 
the government intends to submit measures that would allow 
farmers to own land for life to inherit it and buy and sell it 
tass quoted isayev as saying

the first press freedom law went into effect in 
the soviet union wednesday guaranteeing broad rights for 
journalists and potential publishers 
the law unanimously approved by the supreme soviet legislature 
in june after months of debate promises the press and other 
mass media are free and censorship of the mass media is 
forbidden 
censorship by the communist party the government and a special 
censorship agency kept the soviet news media under tight control 
before president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
political pressure on the media began to lighten under 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness but until now they 
still lacked legal protection from interference 
technically freedom of the press was guaranteed by a 
declaration in the soviet constitution but the new law is the 
first to spell out detailed guarantees of press freedoms 
soviet journalists new freedoms include the right to attend 
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters the right to 
refuse to prepare reports that are against a journalists 
convictions and the right to hold interviews with officials they 
now can withdraw their byline if the contents of a story are 
distorted by editing 
to establish a new publication or news organization the new law 
says soviets need only provide their name address frequency of 
publication circulation figures and source of financing 
all publications will be permitted except those calling for the 
violent overthrow of the government promoting racial or religious 
intolerance or publishing propaganda for war violence or cruelty 
but a bigger barrier is the shortage of newsprint and its 
increasing costs distribution of paper and printing plants will 
remain part of the state economy 
the law goes into effect at a time when there is an acute 
shortage of newsprint and printing services tass reported 
wednesday 
just when subscriptions are to be received the ussr 
ministry of communications announced the establishment of higher 
tariffs for the delivery of printing matter to subscribers as a 
result the price of most newspapers and magazines will at least 
double wiping out many publications

the registerguard eugene ore on the income gap 
resentment of the rich is a recurrent theme of american 
politics it has fueled populist sentiment that rises angrily and 
then lies dormant for a while 
a new wave of such feeling may be sweeping toward the electoral 
beach today the reason is that during the 1980s in the united 
states the rich got considerably richer the poor got poorer and 
the majority in the middle treaded water 
a report confirming that common impression was issued by the 
center on budget and policy priorities based on data released by 
the congressional budget office 
the center concluded the combined incomes of the richest 
25 million americans now nearly equal the combined incomes of the 
100 million americans with the lowest incomes 
these developments have powerful implications for public policy 
and politics the clearest example of the former is the capital 
gains tax cut advocated by the bush administration 
the center says the data show clearly that the rich gained the 
most from the tax cuts approved during the reagan years and it 
calculates that 94 percent of the benefit from the proposed capital 
gains tax cut would go to the richest 20 percent of americans 
making the gap between the rich and the notrich wider than ever 
 
the facts of national income disparity cannot be glossed they 
represent a disturbing problem that needs to be addressed by all 
parties and factions not disguised or ignored

its hard not to laugh at the pentagons idiocy 
consider the 99920 pair of pliers pratt and whitney managed to 
foist on the bluesuited dopes of the air force paying almost a 
grand for a pair of pliers after all is something curly larry 
and moe might do with their inheritance when pratt and whitney 
explains theyre multipurpose not only do they put the clips on 
but they take them off it goes somewhere peewee hermans 
imagination could not follow 
its funny that is until you realize whos been had until you 
realize that pratt and whitney set the price just 80 cents under 
the 1000 limit that would have required the air force to buy the 
damn thing from the people who actually made it instead of a 
greedy middleman take away that big score motive and the air 
force might have shlepped down to sears and bought it for 249 and 
gotten a lifetime warranty to boot

the parkersburg wva news on the congressional mailing 
privileges 
one of the worst abuses of office regularly perpetrated on 
capitol hill is the use of taxpayersupported free 
congressional mailing privileges to send de facto campaign 
brochures to constituents among the worst offenders are freshman 
members of the house who use the franking privilege to put their 
names and usually their pictures before the voters this helps 
them build name recognition which is crucial to any election 
effort but is especially important to those seeking reelection 
an informal study by the washington post found that members of 
the house are urging some inventive ways to get around the few 
restrictions on franked mail members are limited to three 
massmailed newsletters but there is no limit on the number of 
notices for meetings that may be sent out nor is there any limit 
on mailings of less than 500 pieces 
well surprise surprise freshman house members and many of 
their more senior brethren as well have found an easy way around 
that one hold lots of meetings meetings that just happen to take 
place during the six months prior to elections and by all means 
dont rely on the local media to publicize these purely 
nonpolitical meetings with constituents no siree better tell them 
about it by postcard 
several times 
at a cost of about 13 cents per piece of bulk mail each 
massmailed town meeting notice newsletter to 225000 households in 
an average congressional district would cost the taxpayers 
29250 the post notes 
no wonder the house has a 98 percent reelection rate when an 
incumbent sends out three or four mass mailings a year he is 
taking a de facto 100000plus campaign contribution straight from 
taxpayers many of whom would not give him a dime if openly 
solicited it is difficult if not impossible for any challenger 
to overcome the bottomless and unprincipled pockets of incumbents 
who abuse their mailing privileges

long beach calif press telegram on the louisiana abortion law 
veto 
antiabortionists in louisiana are helping to shape the future 
of international family planning more directly than you might ever 
imagine in france the maker of the abortion pill ru486 admits 
that drugs distribution has been slowed by fears of american 
opinion the result is that ru486 which has the promise of saving 
hundreds of thousands of womens lives each year has been kept 
away from countries desperate to have it 
in louisiana gov buddy roemer vetoed two excessively 
restrictive antiabortion bills passed by the state legislature 
this year the first long since gone permitted abortion only to 
save the mothers life the second expanded abortion to victims of 
incest and aggravated rape as long as the crime was reported to 
police and medical attention was sought within seven days such 
cruel and unusual conditions prompted roemers second veto 
in such a process an erroneous message is sent around the world 
that most americans are rabidly opposed to abortion indeed the 
german conglomerate that owns the french pharmaceutical firm that 
makes ru486 is so afraid of an american boycott that it has 
relegated international control of ru486 to the world health 
organization 
the feeble sensitivities of european industrialists no doubt 
give pleasure to many antiabortionists yet when 200000 women 
worldwide die for lack of a reliable lowcost lowrisk abortion 
procedure the efforts to make ru486 unavailable are in themselves 
inhumane

president bush promised today to turn up the 
political heat on democrats unless they produce a deficitreduction 
plan by the end of the week republican lawmakers said 
however the white house said bush was not imposing any 
deadlines and expected that budget talks would intensify in 
september when congress returns from its summer recess 
congressional democrats gave no indication they were ready to 
offer a budget proposal 
noting that republicans have been hit with tough criticism for 
their package house budget committee chairman leon panetta said 
we didnt pledge that every time the republicans slit their 
wrists that we would slit ours 
the republican plan calls for increasing taxes on alcohol and 
limiting tax deductions on state and local taxes 
bush discusssed the budget impasse over coffee and donuts this 
morning with about 150 republican members of the house and senate 
bush vowed to veto spending bills and force congress to live 
with a sequester or deep automatic cuts if the lawmakers fail to 
come to terms on a plan to slash 500 billion from the deficit over 
the next five years gop leaders said 
gop lawmakers left the session declaring that bush was getting 
ready to go on the offensive unless the democrats offer their own 
version of a deficitreduction plan within 48 hours 
house republican whip newt gingrich said the first phase of 
the summit has collapsed 
indeed it appeared unlikely that serious bargaining would 
happen before september when the vacationing bush and congress 
both return to washington 
gingrich said bush indicated he was willing to stay in 
washington to get a budget agreement even though he is under 
pressure from his wife to join her at their kennebunkport retreat 
gingrich quoted bush as saying you know barbaras up at 
kennebunkport with two dogs one of them sick and with six 
grandkids and she needs me 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said bush in 
his meeting with republicans said we have been dealing with the 
democrats in good faith and we have a plan we are prepared to share 
with them when they present theirs they have not yet done so 
in contrast with gop lawmakers predictions that bush would get 
tough with the democrats popadiuk said merely that it was 
obvious that we are frustrated by this process that theres very 
little progress and of course the american people can judge for 
themselves on this issue 
i can expect the president to speak out but in what degree or 
in what shape form or manner i do not know popadiuk said 
lawmakers said bush told them he wants a budget plan from 
democrats by friday 
if that doesnt happen said house republican whip newt 
gingrich i think he may start getting tough in august i 
think the white house has been far more patient than i would be 
white house deputy press secretary alixe glen said you can 
assume that when the gop lawmakers go home they wont be shy about 
the footdragging weve seen by the democrats about finding a 
credible solution to the budget deficit 
were not going anyplace until the democrats get some 
numbers on the table said house minority leader bob michel of 
illinois bush is certainly not going to keep his trap shut all 
during august 
i think that the first phase of the summit has collapsed 
said gingrich 
congressional democrats while not flatly ruling out that they 
would present a budget proposal before the august recess gave no 
indication they would do so instead they said the goal now was to 
work out a schedule with the administration for reaching a 
deficitreduction pact in september 
getting involved in partisan recriminations isnt going to 
help that process said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
bush and the republicans held out hopes of reviving the budget 
negotiations in early september after congress returns from its 
summer vacation 
but unless the democrats put a plan on the table by friday 
there will be no agreement before congress takes its recess next 
week they said 
the president said he hoped the democrats would submit a plan 
by friday said gingrich but if they dont then obviously any 
agreement to not talk in public has no meaning he said 
he hopes to bring everybody back in early september and have 
serious negotiations said gingrich but hell veto spending 
bills across the board if theyre above his spending request he 
will sustain a sequester until congress passes a fiveyear 
agreement and not let the congress get out of sequester 
the white house previously has estimated that without a budget 
agreement the grammrudman law could inflict automatic cuts of 
100 billion or more on many federal programs in october 
about 150 of the 176 house republicans and 45 gop senators 
attended the strategy session with bush over coffee at the white 
house participants said 
michel said hes a very kind gentle individual but 
brother hes got fire in his belly over the summit 
negotiations where were getting nowhere and he takes all the 
brunt of the criticism 
republicans have been furious with democrats for not offering a 
deficitreduction plan at the 12weekold budget talks the 
bargaining is aimed at shrinking a budget shortfall expected to 
reach 169 billion next year not including the 100 billion cost 
of rescuing failed savings and loans 
details of a bush administration plan surfaced last week 
containing 54 billion in spending cuts and new taxes for fiscal 
1991 which starts oct 1 it included higher alcohol levies and a 
limit to the deductibility of state and local income taxes 
proposals that drew widespread criticism including from the gop 
some republicans criticized white house chief of staff john 
sununu and white house budget chief richard darman last week for 
not keeping them informed about the administrations ideas about 
cutting the deficit 
democrats have not even tried to put their own budget plan 
together in recent private meetings among themselves according to 
participants instead they and administration officials are trying 
to hammer out a schedule for completing a pact when lawmakers 
return to the capital in september 
budget talks will continue intermittently during the august 
break democrats have said

chiefly abortion rights the high court must confront 
no one can predict what souter would do in all instances as

the providence ri journalbulletin on barney frank 
the house ethics committee has voted to reprimand rep barney 
frank d mass for his dealings with a prostitute named stephen 
gobie this strikes us as the appropriate punishment for frank 
 
the fact that franks relationship with gobie was a 
private matter and did not involve his duties as a member of 
congress suggests to us that a reprimand is sufficient discipline 
under the circumstances 
franks political future now rests where it belongs with his 
constituents the voters of the fourth congressional district of 
massachusetts know all they need to know about the gobie affair 
and may cast their ballots accordingly 
in our view it is not the proper function of the house to judge 
members on their personal lives unless of course those personal 
lives interfere with public responsibilities franks 
transgressions were not criminal nor did they involve his 
duties as a congressman

grand forks nd herald on the federal farm bill 
farm country politicians have been wringing their hands all week 
about the fate of the farm bill what if the president were to veto 
it 
a farm bill veto would not be such a bad thing certainly it is 
better than five more years of confused and haphazard farm policy 
certainly it is better than international confrontation about 
agricultural trade and certainly it is better than more 
bellyaching about the high cost of farm programs 
a presidential veto only means that the current farm bill would 
be extended for a year congress could use that extension to begin 
a realistic overhaul of farm programs

chicago tribune on childrens tv 
last week the house of representatives voted to protect children 
from the dangerous effects of unwholesome television no it didnt 
outlaw live coverage of the house of representatives part of what 
mark twain once called the only distinctly native american criminal 
class instead it placed new burdens on broadcasters who are 
accused of neglecting the interests of children 
the house which would never presume to tell dr seuss what to 
write nevertheless feels perfectly justified in trying to dictate 
what childrens tv programmers should offer members have detected 
the smell of commerce and their nostrils are offended 
their remedy is a limit of 10 minutes of commercials per half 
hour on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays and a new requirement 
that the federal communications commission consider the amount and 
type of kids programs when it rules on the renewal of 
broadcasters licenses 
president reagan killed a similar bill shortly before leaving 
office if the latest version gets through the senate president 
bush should do the same 
if there is a problem it lies well within the authority of 
parents those who prefer more elevating fare than teenage mutant 
ninja turtles can direct their kids to plenty of options 
watching sesame street and mister rogers neighborhood 
picking up a disney feature at the video store or curling up with a

dozens of supporters and a handful of protesters 
greeted patrons arriving today for the opening of an exhibit of 
robert mapplethorpe photographs that incensed sen jesse helms and 
got a museum director arrested in cincinnati 
the crowd of about 150 people largely made up of those 
supporting the show was orderly and no incidents were reported 
an estimated 200 visitors were lined up outside less than an 
hour after the museum opened its doors said denise spencer a 
marketing assistant at the institute for contemporary art which is 
showing the exhibit the small museum is allowing just 75 people at 
a time to view the exhibit 
these people are trying to force their morality on the rest of 
us said jim edgerley of the conservative american freedom 
coalition as he stood among a crowd of demonstrators patrons 
police and reporters on the museum steps 
as edgerley spoke two men stood in front of him locked in a 
deep passionate kiss see this is the kind of behavior this is 
promoting edgerley said 
others praised the show 
id read a lot about it and i was curious i went to see what 
was objectionable but i didnt find it objectionable i thought it 
was interesting said 70yearold eleanor bleakie 
meanwhile a public television station that had broadcast the 
most sexually explicit homoerotic photographs from the socalled 
x portfolio on its newscast tuesday night said this morning 
that it got about 100 calls in reaction to the newscast most of 
them supportive but several people said they were swearing off 
public television forever a station official said 
producers of wgbhs 10 pm newscast said they aired the x 
portfolio pictures tuesday to let viewers decide for themselves 
how they feel about them 
the coverage thus far never shows you this all you get is 
what is in the mind of the writer and we want our coverage to let 
the viewer decide with both sides presented said john 
vanscoyoc the stations managing editor 
the photos have stirred a national debate over federal funding 
of work deemed offensive the station which like other public tv 
outlets receives federal funding devoted 24 minutes of the 
halfhour newscast to the exhibit and the outcry over its explicit 
homosexual and sadomasochistic images 
despite efforts by protesters to have the photos banned support 
for the show has been strong in boston once known as a city of 
bluenoses for banning books and movies 
a mapplethorpe supporter was arrested tuesday after disrupting 
the news conference of a coalition opposed to the showing artists 
and playwrights gave speeches in support of the exhibit and 
marches and rallies were planned for today 
first amendment common sense a coalition opposed to the 
exhibit pressed public officials to halt it as obscene 
were calling for a revival of common sense said an 
opponent evelyn dubel were concerned about the wellbeing of 
our neighbors especially our children 
david ross director of the art institute said he was proud to 
have the show of 124 photographs taken by mapplethorpe from 1969 
until shortly before he died of aids last year in boston at age 42 
what we have to fear is the suppression of these ideas were 
talking about art ross said this is not a pornography 
exhibit this show is a celebration of beauty 
alan foster wgbh news director said the station received at 
least 63 calls within 15 minutes of the programs conclusion the 
line was attached to an answering machine and it was not 
immediately known how callers felt he said 
twenty callers dialed the newsroom directly those have been 
universally positive foster said one guy said brilliant 
show terrific journalism 
mary catherine kilday enforcement chief of the federal 
communications commission in washington said the agency does not 
monitor tv or radio programming and has no authority to enforce 
indecency complaints after 8 pm 
a mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in june 1989 at the corcoran 
gallery of art in washington was canceled after helms the 
archconservative republican from north carolina branded the work 
obscene 
helms objections prompted congress to limit national endowment 
for the arts grants before those limits the mapplethorpe tour had 
received about 30000 from the nea about 10 percent of the cost 
a showing in cincinnati led to obscenity charges against the 
director of the contemporary arts center but a federal judge 
barred police from confiscating photos from the exhibit 
the show in boston was expected to draw at least 50000 people 
it runs through oct 4

nrc handelsblad rotterdam netherlands on david souter 
the nine judges of the american supreme court are the final 
guardians of morals habits and the spirit of the time of the 
american nation every time when one of them drops out due to old 
age illness or death a president will grab his chance to extend 
his political signature with an appointment 
what would president bush do nervousness about this was big 
because on the one hand the candidacy of a judge is sort of a 
presidents confession of faith towards the ideologically tinted 
part of the supporters on the other hand the relations arent 
such that one could become a lot wiser on this terrain of 
polarisation 
from a moral point of view the nation finds itself in a foggy 
zone the preeminent litmus test is the abortion issue 
with the departure of a supreme court justice and the 
inevitable discussion about a new candidate the embarrassment about 
this litmus test was threatening to escalate therefore the fearful 
question that many had what would bush do 
the president has done something genial at least that is 
what it looks like now with the candidacy of david souter he has 
pushed forward a judge who is generally known as very capable and 
possessing great integrity and who after 20 years of legal 
practice has not left a trace from which something could be 
deducted the bachelor from new hampshire has no political or 
ideological past and that for the time being contents all 
parties 
but up to now the choice of souter is a find his knowledge is 
not doubted and the power of his nomination lies in the continuous 
question who is souter

the changes in the us vietnamese policy represent an

the times london on the attempted coup in trinidad and tobago 
the seizure of the prime minister and other members of the 
government of trinidad and tobago by a violent fringe group of 
black moslem radicals underlines the chronic vulnerability of very 
small states to extremist movements small communities are easily 
ignited by strange sparks 
the calm response of the trinidadian military political and 
religious establishments to the militants blackmail is a tribute 
to the maturity of the countrys democratic institutions 
the unpopularity of the government led by arthur robinson only 
30 months after winning a landslide victory with the promise of 
rescuing the countrys tottering economy is such that the rebels 
demand for his resignation and for elections within 90 days may be 
so widely supported as to be irresistible 
the economic woes would have been more readily borne had the 
government kept an important part of its bargain with the 
electorate the promise to eliminate trinidads endemic corruption 
in public life

bangkok thailand post on aid to terrorism given by the former 
eastern european governments 
hollywood novelists and even the rightwing propagandists it 
turns out were right all along for the past 40 years the soviets 
and their satellite states in eastern europe aided terrorism 
hatched outlandish plots to expand power and routinely pitted 
families and neighbors against each other to maintain secret police 
files 
since the fall of the communist dictatorships in europe last 
year files have been uncovered with tales of intrigue so 
outlandish and devious a fiction writer would have been hard 
pressed to imagine them 
the new regime in czechoslovakia has discovered its communist 
predecessor was the worlds major illegal supplier of the most 
powerful and difficulttodetect explosive semtex in effect the 
former czech leaders helped blow up several planes in terrorist 
attacks which killed hundreds 
hungary czechoslovakia and east germany not only provided a 
safe haven for the infamous carlos but showered the notorious 
terrorist with luxuries including call girls 
what next will details emerge from bulgaria providing the 
longsuspected assassination attempts on the pope will proof come 
from romania that nicolae ceausescu and his clique did indeed help 
narcotics dealing by north korean diplomats 
the supreme power of the former dictatorships of eastern europe 
proved irresistible to the men who held it whether the power 
warped the men or vice versa hardly matters as story after story 
from eastern europe proves total power corrupts totally 
convinced by their own constant propaganda of the infallibility 
of the dictator of the proletariat the old men who ran eastern 
europe for so long proved as politically perverted by power as any

le figaro paris on the iraqkuwait dispute 
apparently iraq which has an enormous need for money wants 
each opec member to respect its production quota but is this 
sufficient reason to mass 30000 armed men in the southern sector 
of the country 
or is this a good opportunity seized by saddam hussein to 
establish himself as the zealous defender of the oil producing 
states interests and at the same time as the policeman of the 
gulf even while american warships cruise nearby in maneuvers with 
those of the emirates

el mercurio santiago chile on cubans seeking asylum at 
embassies in havana 
the stubborness with which fidel castro rows against the current 
of perestroika is worsening living conditions in cuba and 
encourages people to seek political asylum to leave their country 
it is useless for castro to insult the asylumseekers calling 
them bums with fat criminal records because as the tyrant 
gets more annoyed the population shows a greater desire of 
emigrating 
the first seven asylum seekers picked the czechoslovak embassy 
creating for castro a serious problem with his former allies 
others entered the spanish embassy and foreign minister francisco 
hernandez ordonez of spain has said there is a situation of 
nervousness in havana resulting from the isolation of cuba from 
the international community and from its extremely serious 
economic situation

zhelyu zhelev who led the democratic 
opposition in junes free elections became president today the 
first noncommunist to gain any leading post in the balkan country 
in more than 40 years 
zhelevs election by parliament ended almost a month of 
political stalemate following the resignation july 6 of president 
petar mladenov a member of the ruling former communist party now 
known as the socialists 
mladenov stepped down after it was confirmed he had called for 
the use of tanks against antigovernment demonstrators last 
december 
zhelev 55 was a compromise candidate backed by all parties 
including socialist leaders after five unsuccessful attempts to 
get a president elected by the 400member parliament 
zhelev won 284 of the 389 votes cast today 
in a surprise move he immediately made a proposed former 
socialist interior minister atanas semerdzhiev as vice president 
deputies greeted the suggestion with applause and voted 
overwhelmingly for semerdzhiev in a show of hands only two 
deputies opposed the choice while seven abstained 
semerdzhiev had resigned as interior minister last week when a 
furor erupted over the proposed parliamentary appearance of todor 
zhivkov the stalinist leader ousted last fall after 35 years in 
power 
zhelev triumphed in the presidential race after none of the 
three original candidates proved able to secure the twothirds 
majority needed to win election in parliament 
although the socialists won junes free elections with 211 
parliamentary seats their incumbent premier andrei lukanov 
repeatedly has said he does not want to head a oneparty government 
spreading street protests against the socialists since the 
elections also have made clear that the ruling partys support is 
dwindling rapidly necessitating some sort of cooperation with the 
opposition union of democratic forces 
zhelev led the udf in the june elections in which the 16party 
coalition won 144 parliamentary seats 
before todays vote both zhelev and lukanov indicated that the 
socialists and opposition are willing to work together to ease 
bulgarias social tensions and rapidly deepening economic crisis 
answering questions from the floor zhelev said he wants to see 
bulgaria make a peaceful evolution to democracy with the direct 
participation of the political opposition 
while he did not directly retract previous opposition rejection 
of participation in a lukanovled coalition government he stressed 
the most important task of any president is now to work for the 
creation of a strong active and competent government 
observers in sofia took the remark as a sign the opposition is 
no longer excluding participation in government with the socialists 
for his part lukanov said his party had agreed to zhelevs 
candidacy as president in the interests of national welfare and 
noted this marked the effective end to oneparty monopoly of power 
in bulgaria 
the balkan nation was dominated by the communists since just 
after world war ii when the communists executed imprisoned and 
repressed their political opponents

a major womens rights organization announced 
wednesday a drive to enlist 1 million young women on college and 
high school campuses to fight restrictive state abortion laws 
particularly those requiring parental consent 
the feminist majoritys becky bell campaign named for a 
17yearold indianapolis girl who died in 1988 from complications 
suffered in a backalley abortion will be concentrated in indiana 
massachusetts minnesota ohio california pennsylvania and rhode 
island sponsors said 
the parents of the dead girl bill and karen bell endorsed the 
project in an emotional appearance at a news conference with 
eleanor smeal president of the feminist majority 
our daughter died because she happened to live in the wrong 
state she died because of a parental consent law that i had 
never even heard of said the father a 47yearold office 
products salesman in indianapolis 
as the parents explained it their daughter who normally shared 
her problems freely with them was afraid to tell them about her 
pregnancy for fear of disappointing them and she heard from 
friends that the indiana courts rarely granted an exception to the 
parental consent requirement so in desperation she went to an 
unqualified practitioner 
when becky died i died with her said karen bell becky 
didnt want an abortion but she wanted to save dad and i the shame 
of knowing she had fallen in love had sex and became pregnant 
this could happen to anybody kids are going to do these things 
now all i have is the graveyard 
dont you think we wanted to know becky was in trouble that 
we wanted to help her asked the father but becky confided to 
her friends i cant tell mom and dad i love them too much our 
hope is that in speaking out we can spare other families the 
nightmare we now live these laws are punitive they are deadly 
the campaign will feature the distribution of memorial bracelets 
carrying the names of becky bell or rosie jimenez a 27yearold 
mcallen texas woman said by the feminist majority to be the first 
to die as a consequence of the hyde amendment named for rep henry 
hyde rill which bars medicaid abortion funding for poor women 
jimenez died oct 3 1977 the same year the hyde amendment was 
passed 
smeal formerly head of the national organization for women 
said the campaign will move this fall into oregon michigan and 
texas where parental consent laws are pending in all states she 
said the drive will focus on voter registration and 
getoutthevote projects in behalf of sympathetic state 
legislators it also will promote bringing the european abortion 
pill ru486 to the united states 
the feminist majority is not a membership organization but 
currently has more than 50000 contributors and more than 100000 
active supporters according to press secretary tamar raphael

so far 1990 is just an average year for 
earthquakes the government said wednesday although the iranian 
quake in june was the deadliest in 14 years 
the us geological survey said the death toll in iran 
estimated at 50000 or more is the highest since a 1976 quake in 
china killed more than 250000 people 
overall there were 34 significant quakes in the first six 
months of 1990 that would be close to normal since there are on 
average 60 significant quakes in a typical year the agency said 
a significant quake is defined as one reaching 65 or higher on 
the richter scale or a lesser temblor causing significant 
casualties or damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released in an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
every increase of one whole number say from 55 to 65 
indicates a tenfold increase in ground motion 
the quake that struck iran measured 77 on the scale according 
to waverly person chief of the agencys national earthquake 
information service in golden colo 
that was the same magnitude as the deadly quake that hit the 
philippines on july 16 the death toll in that quake is still being 
calculated 
on feb 8 a quake measured at 66 injured at least 15 people in 
the philippines 1 died there in a quake on march 26 and a tremor 
on june 14 killed 4 people 
only one significant quake was recorded in the united states 
from january through june a magnitude 55 tremor that injured 38 
people and caused 10 million in damage in southern california on 
feb 28 
after iran the next deadliest quake in the first half of 1990 
was a magnitude 64 tremor in peru on may 30 which claimed 135 
lives 
on april 26 126 people were killed in a quake in china that 
measured 69 on the richter scale 
a tremor measured at 72 occurred may 20 in southern sudan 
because of the remoteness of the area casualty figures have not 
been confirmed survey officials said that is believed to be the 
strongest quake ever recorded in that country 
there were nine deaths reported in a may 30 quake in romania 
two people died in a may 5 quake in italy 
no injuries were reported but buildings were damaged when a 
quake shook parts of southern england on april 2

a small airliner carrying 30 people from armenia 
to the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh crashed in azerbaijan 
today soviet media reported no casualty report was immediately 
available 
the accident occurred in an area blanketed by dense fog but the 
cause of the crash was not known 
the wreckage of the aeroflot yakovlev40 was found in the agdam 
region of azerbaijan just east of nagornokarabakh and its 
capital stepanakert said the interfax news agency quoting a 
report to the armenian parliament 
the area is not on the planes route from the armenian capital 
yerevan to stepanakert but it could have been circling to enter 
its landing pattern 
air controllers lost contact with the plane this morning as it 
entered airspace controlled by stepanakert tass quoted the soviet 
state committee for air safety as saying stepanakert is 120 miles 
east of yerevan 
armenia and azerbaijan are locked in a bitter dispute over 
nagornokarabakh a remote mountainous area of azerbaijan 
populated largely by armenians hundreds of people have died in 
ethnic clashes in the past two years and thousands of armenians 
have organized into armed paramilitary units 
in this volatile atmosphere accidental deaths have spawned 
unfounded rumors of sabotage 
for example an explosion in a bus station in azerbaijan caused 
by leaking natural gas was reported widely as the result of a 
terrorist bomb 
the armenian parliament formed a fiveperson commission to 
investigate the catastrophe interfax said 
the search for the plane was hampered by thick fog the civil 
aviation ministry in moscow told tass civilian helicopters from 
azerbaijan were being used in the search the news agency said

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge failed to budge in june the commerce department said 
wednesday in a report analysts said portended a listless economy in 
the months ahead 
the departments index of leading economic indicators designed 
to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance was 
unchanged for the second month this year it had risen in march and 
may and fallen in february and april 
many economists had expected a small increase in june if the 
index were to fall for three straight months it could signal a 
forthcoming recession 
this meandering is consistent with what is happening in the 
economy said economist darryl delano of cahners economics in 
newton mass it all nets out to basically nothing 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association agreed 
basically what weve seen over this year is small increases 
small decreases with everything averaging around zero berson 
said the economy is going to continue in its slowgrowth path 
but other analysts such as david jones an economist with the 
new york securities dealer aubrey g lanston amp co expressed 
deeper concern 
what we have got is an economy that is slowly sinking into 
possibly a mild recession by either late this year or early next 
jones contended 
the bush administration predicted earlier this month the 
nations economy would grow 2 percent this year 
but the growth rate as measured by the gross national product 
was just 17 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the 
second meaning the economy would have to expand at an annual rate 
of 29 percent during the second half of the year to meet the 
administrations prediction 
few economists expect that amount of growth 
indeed the national association of purchasing management 
released its latest survey on wednesday showing the manufacturing 
economy slumped in july for the first time in three months 
and the commerce department in another report wednesday said 
construction spending in june was flat after falling during the 
previous two months 
both the building and manufacturing sectors have borne the brunt 
of high interest rates as the federal reserve attempted to stem 
inflation by slowing the economy 
the june leading indicators report dashes almost all hope that 
the economy will pick up steam later this year said richard w 
rahn chief economist with the us chamber of commerce 
the weak industrial sector will get even weaker by years end 
as manufacturers new orders fall and growth in unfilled orders 
wanes rahn added it would take only a mild amount of order 
cancellations to stop growth in industrial production and turn a 
weak economy into recession 
both manufacturers new orders for consumer goods and unfilled 
orders were among the negative statistics in the june report 
others were a decline in the money supply a drop in an index 
measuring consumer confidence a decrease in orders for new plants 
and equipment and an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
the consumer confidence index also was negative in may leading 
some analysts to fear consumers were retrenching consumers account 
for twothirds of the nations economic activity 
however commerce eased these fears monday when it reported that 
personal consumption jumped 10 percent in june suggesting 
consumers would keep the weak economy alive 
nevertheless only four of junes leading indicators were 
positive an increase in the price of raw materials higher stock 
prices an increase in building permits and slower business 
delivery times the length of the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1460 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and up 14 percent from its level a year ago

israels mossad spy agency ordered an analysis 
of saddam husseins handwriting and got back a recommendation that 
the iraqi president needed psychiatric care a newspaper reported 
wednesday 
the report in the daily yediot ahronot said the graphologist who 
examined saddams handwriting several months ago did not know the 
identity of his subject 
the report gave no further details of the handwriting analysis 
israeli officials routinely refuse to comment on activities of the 
mossad 
the newspaper said the results of the handwriting analysis were 
shown to israeli leaders to help them assess the degree of 
severity and importance that should be attributed to saddams 
threats and declarations 
in april saddam threatened to respond with binary chemical 
weapons if israel staged a nuclear attack on an arab country 
the newspaper quoted the handwriting experts report as saying 
the subject should be hospitalized immediately 
he is a hasty decision maker and has a tendency for radical 
mood swings is ready to take extreme decisions and carry them out 
has violent tendencies and is dangerous to his environment it 
said

the senate voted today to ban outside speaking 
fees a custom sen robert c byrd said puts lawmakers at the 
level of used car salesmen in the publics esteem 
the 7723 vote on an amendment by sen christopher dodd 
dconn attached the honoraria ban to a campaign finance reform 
bill the ban would take effect next january at present senators 
are allowed to accept up to 27337 a year in honoraria 
when a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling 
and thats what it amounts to we denigrate ourselves dodd said 
as public servants our salaries should come from the public 
alone 
the house voted last year to give up honoraria effective jan 1 
1991 but also boosted the salaries of its members from 98400 to 
124000 then reluctant to vote themselves a 25 percent pay boost 
the senate had skirted the honoraria issue up until today 
the scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on 
public service and raised public cynicism to an alltime high 
byrd said citing 9 million in honoraria senators have accepted 
over the past decade were about at the level of used car 
salesmen in the publics esteem 
the senate voted last week to denounce sen david durenberger 
rminn for violating several ethics standards including skirting 
the limits on honoraria in a bookpublishing deal six other 
senators are under investigation by the senate ethics committee for 
alleged actions involving savings and loan institutions and 
department of housing and urban development programs 
dodds amendment won the support of 53 of the senates 55 
democrats and 24 of it 45 republicans 
in 1989 senators accepted nearly 3 million in honoraria and 
kept more than 21 milion with the balance donated to charity 
according to their financial disclosure forms dodd the sponsor of 
the ban reported accepting 15000 in 1989 
gop leader bob dole of kansas one of the largest recipients of 
honoraria said he agreed with dodd on the need to eliminate 
senators honoraria income but not on the strategy of doing it 
without a pay raise 
in january house members will be getting paid about 22000 
more than senators and we could be getting about 22000 less 
for years to come he said 
dole said he had considered trying to amend dodds measure to 
include a raise that would return senate and house salaries to 
parity but acknowledged he lacked the votes to win its passage this 
close to the november election 
despite the vote several lawmakers doubted that the honoraria 
ban will be enacted because of its attachment to what republicans 
claim has become a highly democratic partisan campaign finance 
reform bill 
sen mitch mcconnell rky said white house chief of staff 
john sununu told him wednesday morning that president bush would 
veto the current version with its democraticproposed ceilings on 
how much candidates can spend in an election 
byrd said members of the senate himself among them have 
supplemented their salaries with a total of more than 9 million in 
honoraria from special interest groups over the past decade 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he said it would be hypocritical for the senate to leave the 
back door open for its members to supplement their 98400 
salaries with up to 27300 in speaking fees while claiming to 
remove special interest money from campaigns 
the pay system that has evolved with the public paying the 
bulk of a senators salary and a handful of interest groups picking 
up the rest is untenable dodd said our salaries should come 
from the public alone 
meanwhile outnumbered republicans are complaining that it is 
only their traditional sources of political money that are being 
singled out for reform in the bill to clean up the way 
elections are financed 
all of the bipartisanship has completely broken down sen 
john mccain rariz said after losing a 4949 tie vote on his 
measure to make candidates turn surpluses in their campaign 
accounts over to the government instead of keeping them for use in 
future elections 
on largely partyline votes tuesday democrats defeated 
amendments to strip unions of their taxexempt status if they 
engage in politics and to allow union members to demand refunds of 
any dues spent on elections or lobbying 
republicans claimed the votes demonstrate that the democrats 
campaign finance reform bill and its spending ceilings is a 
partisan charade that will assure a veto by president bush 
democrats contended they did their compromising last week 
agreeing to bushs proposal to abolish labor corporate and trade 
association political action committees in an effort to get 
republicans to accept some form of aggregate lid on how much 
candidates can spend 
the populationbased democratic spending ceilings would range 
from 2 million for senate candidates in small states to slightly 
over 10 million in the largest one california

future leadership prospects 
youngsters also face the problems of drug abuse infant 
mortality and teenage pregnancies but nonetheless wilder said 
he remains optimistic 
the governor said conference members must instill black children 
with the attitude i was not delivered into this world in 
defeat 
we must insist upon excellence in education and a willingness 
to prepare our youngsters not only to make passing grades but to 
be acceptable to institutions of higher learning at graduate 
levels he said 
the nations first black elected governor recalled that when he 
decided to run for the state senate he was told that hasnt 
been done then 16 years later he wanted to become lieutenant 
governor and was told youve got to understand this is 
virginia 
he ignored the naysayers 
the declaration of independence was written by a virginian 
said wilder and when it endowed citizens with certain 
inalienable rights i knew it meant me 
now wilder said when boys and girls visit the governors 
office he tells them why dont you sit in my chair a while

a man charged with murder was acquitted by a 
jury persuaded in part by the discovery of a 2yearold burrito in 
the defendants jacket pocket 
the burrito was hurriedly introduced as evidence at the trials 
close to support edward vasquez alibi that he was buying the 
burrito at a canteen truck when security guard israel martinez was 
shot to death in 1988 
vasquez was freed after his arrest on 10000 bail but his 
jacket was seized as evidence and held in police custody until the 
trial 
then vasquez 23 put it on to display it for the jury and told 
his attorney it felt like there was something heavy in the right 
pocket 
the jury had already begun deliberations last week when defense 
attorney jay jaffe asked to reexamine the jacket and discovered 
the foilwrapped burrito 
superior court judge stanley weisberg allowed jaffe to reopen 
his final arguments citing the new evidence 
he didnt shoot the security guard and this proves it 
jaffe told jurors as he unwrapped the wellpreserved burrito 
jurors acquitted vasquez on tuesday they said they had been 
split 84 for acquittal before the burrito defense came into play 
vasquez insisted he was across a parking lot when martinez 42 
was killed in a september 1988 gun battle at the california state 
university los angeles campus 
im just happy that the jury saw through what never should 
have been a prosecution he endured a nightmare for two years just 
because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time said jaffe

five european countries meeting for the 
first time as a new regional alliance agreed wednesday to step up 
political and economic cooperation to promote stability on the 
changing continent 
the leaders of italy czechoslovakia austria hungary and 
yugoslavia reached a wide range of accords aimed at strengthening 
democracy and spurring economic development in eastern and central 
europe 
the agreements came at the first summit of the socalled 
pentagonal initiative a regional alliance founded in budapest in 
november 1989 
all the delegations except italys were led by heads of 
government the host country was represented by deputy premier 
claudio martelli because premier giulio andreotti was forced to 
stay in rome to ensure passage of a bill in the chamber of deputies 
the leaders said the initiative should play a vital role in 
consolidating the political upheavals that have swept away 
communist regimes across eastern europe including in hungary and 
czechoslovakia 
shifting from ideological rivalry to the implementation of 
joint programs in the economic field and other sectors will be the 
most effective way of avoiding any temptation to revert to the 
past they said in a joint declaration 
the leaders said the new europe should be based on parliamentary 
and pluralistic democracy and a free market economy 
the choice is no longer the continuation of the classic game 
of balances but the construction of new forms of collaboration and 
integration martelli said in a speech in a period of such 
tumultuous change it is necessary to strengthen dialogue and 
reciprocal consultation 
officials said the alliance could help bring east european 
countries closer to the european community and act as a possible 
counterweight to the political and economic strength of a unified 
germany 
the bulk of the accords involved projects for improving 
transportation links between the countries the leaders agreed to 
establish four main road corridors and six railway lines and to 
expand air and maritime networks 
it is not yet known however where the funds for these projects 
will come among the observers at the summit were officials of the 
world bank and the european investment bank 
other agreements were reached in the fields of 
telecommunications the environment small and mediumsize 
enterprises scientific and technical research culture tourism 
and information 
a point of contention appeared to be the question of admitting 
poland to the group 
at a news conference hungarian premier jozsef antall said he 
supported the idea of including poland martelli however said no 
such request has been made and there were no immediate plans to 
expand the alliance 
austrian chancellor franz vranitsky said he proposed that the 
group study the possibility of abolishing nuclear power as his 
country has done 
this must be accepted by the majority he said it cant 
be implemented in a fortnight 
the leaders also took up the question of minorities a 
potentially explosive issue in several countries especially 
yugoslavia no specific decisions were made although hungary will 
chair a technical committee studying the problem

the internal revenue service is losing its 
battle against overdue taxes which are growing faster than tax 
collections government auditors said wednesday 
each year irs falls farther and farther behind in its efforts 
to reduce the accountsreceivable balance paul l posner 
associate director of the general accounting office told the 
senate governmental affairs committee unless the problem is 
reduced he said it could have a serious negative impact on 
voluntary taxpayer compliance 
accounts receivable which the irs estimates grew from 30 
billion in 1984 to 66 billion last year represent taxes that 
have been assessed but not paid such as when a taxpayer files a 
return but fails to remit what is owed the irs says 13 million 
couples individuals and businesses are involved 
the irs the gao and other experts agree that accounts 
receivable may be exaggerated by as much as 50 percent accounts 
receivable are the total of unpaid income payroll and other taxes 
due over the last six years generally the legal maximum the irs 
can go back to in collecting taxes 
over the last six years posner said accounts receivable grew 
three times faster than collections of delinquent taxes and twice 
as fast as total net tax receipts he said it is especially 
disturbing that the average age of accounts is getting older 
meaning the debts are less likely to be collected 
this rapid outofcontrol growth in unpaid taxes threatens to 
overwhelm the irs and is absolutely unacceptable at a time when the 
administration and congress are grappling with painful revenue and 
spending choices said sen john glenn dohio chairman of the 
committee 
accounts receivable are different from the tax gap which is 
the difference in income taxes that are collected and what would be 
collected if individuals and businesses correctly reported their 
income and deductions the gap is expected to be about 100 billion 
this year alone 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr acknowledged that accounts 
receivable are a worrisome problem but said the agency is making 
progress 
for example he said the irs this year is collecting 472000 
in delinquencies for each staff member in the collections division 
up from 388000 two years ago the division is expected to collect 
265 billion this year compared with 233 billion in 1988 
goldberg said there has been a slow but steady increase in 
accounts the irs believes will never be collected because of death 
bankruptcy or inability to locate the debtor that 27 billion is 
in addition to the 66 billion 
goldberg said there will be dramatic reductions in accounts 
receivables only when irss 30yearold computer system is 
modernized when the agencys budget is stabilized so that staffer 
hiring and training can be improved and when tax laws are 
simplified 
president bushs budget for the irs for next year would allow 
hiring 1050 new collection personnel this represents the growth 
we can prudently manage and absorb during 1991 no more no less 
he said 
goldberg said that in february the irs had nearly 800000 
accounts totaling 18 billion that could not be worked because of 
lack of personnel that shortage was a result of a twoyear hiring 
freeze that was imposed on the irs he said 
john pepping an irs collections officer in the laguna niguel 
calif district said the personnel shortage there is so severe 
that as a rule no account under 50000 is sent to the field for 
collection he testified on behalf of the national treasury 
employees union which represents most irs workers 
robert m tobias president of the union urged congress to 
boost the irs budget sufficiently to hire 5000 new collectors over 
the next three years that would boost collections by 61 billion 
over five years he said

plo chairman yasser arafats guerrillas 
attacked the main base of a proiranian palestinian faction 
wednesday and then clashed with its fighters barricaded inside a 
mosque in a refugee camp 
fifteen people were killed and 95 wounded in clashes between the 
two palestinian forces 
the confrontations were an offshoot of a threeweek battle 
between iranianbacked fundamentalists and their more secular 
rivals for control of iqlim altuffah or apple province which is 
next to the border strip israel occupies in south lebanon 
the interpalestinian fighting rekindled the battles between the 
iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god and the 
syrianbacked amal militia in the apple province 
police said three combatants were killed and 10 wounded in that 
fighting raising the overall toll in the threeweek battle to 189 
dead and 570 injured 
the interpalestinian fighting started when guerrillas from 
arafats fatah faction of the palestine liberation organization 
launched an assault on the main base of maj jamal suleiman a 
fatah renegade 
fatah fighters have fought alongside the amal militiamen while 
suleiman supports hezbollah on monday suleimans fighters fired 
40 rockets at fatah positions in the apple province wounding at 
least seven guerrillas plo officials said 
the interpalestinian fighting spread to the ein elhilweh 
refuge camp after arafats guerrillas crushed suleimans base in 
jabal alhaleeb or the milk mountain on the camps eastern edge 
suleiman and about 30 of his 150 followers escaped the first 
attack and barricaded themselves inside the nour mosque in ein 
elhilweh 
other moslem fundamentalist palestinians soon joined them there 
col wajih abu ali commander of the plos military police in 
the sidon region where the camp is located said the 
fundamentalists opened fire at fatah forces from the mosque and a 
nearby alley 
arafats men ringed the mosque and were responding to the 
shooting abu ali said 
witnesses in ein elhilweh said about a dozen clergymen were 
using the mosques loudspeakers to blare calls for a jihad or holy 
war against arafat 
its a sensitive situation fatah cannot easily attack a 
mosque to evict them other antiarafat groups might suppport them 
too the situation in the camp is very tense abu ali said 
at nightfall guerrillas from terrorist mastermind abu nidals 
fatah revolutionary council joined suleimans fighters around the 
mosque and mounted a counterattack on milk mountain police said 
they have managed to recapture many of their positions in the 
mountain the police spokesman said 
arafat has at least 5000 hardcore fighters in the sidon region 
also wednesday police said intermittent exchanges of machine 
gun and rocketpropelled grenade fire between amal and hezbollah 
fighters in the apple province prevented rescuers from the 
international committee of the red cross from evacuating dozens of 
decomposing bodies

efforts to develop drugs for aidsrelated 
diseases are hindered by federal rules which bar hospital insurance 
coverage for people receiving novel treatments the governments 
chief aids researcher said wednesday 
dr anthony s fauci and other witnesses told a house government 
operations subcommittee that the lack of public and private 
insurance for hospital care in clinical trials prevents thousands 
of people from receiving potentially lifeprolonging treatment 
insurers including the public medicare and medicaid programs 
do not regularly reimburse for treatments that are considered to be 
experimental a person with an aidsrelated infection who does not 
receive experimental treatment would be reimbursed according to 
fauci and others 
both aids research and the healthcare reimbursement programs 
fall under the jurisdiction of the department of health and human 
services 
aids and the particularly virulent opportunistic infections 
that follow it strike largely at people least able to afford 
hospital care witnesses said 
the infections strike all organs including the eyes lungs and 
intestines and along with tumors cause most aids deaths aids 
weakens the bodys ability to resist ordinary bacteria fungi 
parasites and viruses 
fauci told the subcommittee on human resources and 
intergovernmental relations that he has brought up the gap in 
biweekly meetings of the interagency hiv leadership group 
the response within the department is that they were very 
sympathetic with the difficulties this is posing for us in the 
conduct of our trials but a solution is not readily at hand 
fauci said 
he said the problem is an unwillingness to spend more money on 
reimbursements that are already stretching the government for 
nonexperimental hospitalizations 
we do not agree from the biomedical research and health care 
delivery standpoint with that philosophy said fauci director of 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the 
national institutes of health 
hospitalization is required for aids patients with opportunistic 
infections because the infection is usually acute and patients must 
be monitored around the clock said dr fred r sattler of the 
university of southern californias school of medicine 
the hearing was called to examine the status of research into 
drugs used to prevent or treat opportunistic infections and the 
priority given by the nih to research into those drugs rather than 
an overall cure for aids 
the institutes have recently indicated they would spend a larger 
share on the drugs against opportunistic infections and on tuesday 
evening the nih announced it would give 28 million to six teams 
of scientists for research on such drugs

injuries after receiving bills up to 200 for ambulance services 
it just hasnt set right with some of the people said the 
rev jeffrey stratton petersburgs volunteer coordinator 
more than a dozen people have received the bills stratton said 
what i have told the people is that an ambulance service is 
still a business stratton said although i doubt if that 
billing was the first thing on their minds it still cost them 
money 
jess roberts director of alexander ambulance services in 
evansville said 23 ambulances from throughout southern indiana 
helped with disaster relief following the tornadoes june 2 that 
killed seven residents 
roberts said alexander billed four tornado victims and later 
regretted it the company sent letters on july 17 to people who had 
received the bills advising that no collection would be attempted 
because the service was voluntary 
we had discussed it but decided it was just a cost of doing 
business he said tuesday 
it cost alexander 6000 to 7000 to send five ambulances two 
wheelchair vans and 20 workers to petersburg roberts said much of 
the equipment was used to transport 99 residents of the petersburg 
health care center to other area nursing homes

one out of every five businesses seeking 
credit in the last six months had trouble borrowing funds 
according to a survey released wednesday by the us chamber of 
commerce 
the credit crunch on business is more serious and more 
widespread than previously has been acknowledged said chamber 
vice president richard w rahn in releasing the poll of 8190 
responding businesses 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan noted july 12 that 
credit had become tight and said the central bank would lower 
shortterm interest rates to ease the situation 
the federal funds rate which is what banks charge each other 
for overnight loans subsequently dropped from 825 per cent to 8 
percent 
the fed had kept the rate relatively high for more than a year 
in an attempt to slow the economy and thus lessen inflationary 
pressures 
rahn attributed the credit situation to the economic slowdown 
increased bank regulation and the effects of the thriftindustry 
bailout 
small businesses especially are feeling the impact he said of 
firms with sales of less than 1 million 274 percent seeking 
credit reported trouble 
only 192 percent of firms with sales between 1 million and 
99 million reported problems while just 123 percent of 
businesses with sales of more than 10 million expressed complaints 
hardest hit were real estate firms with 333 percent of those 
seeking credit having trouble obtaining it but at least one in 
four construction communications and transportation companies and 
small servicesoriented businesses also reported trouble in the 
survey 
least affected the poll showed were businesses in the finance 
or banking fields 
by region the worst crunch appeared to be in the northeast 
where 262 percent of the respondents reported having trouble 
obtaining credit trouble also was experienced by 246 percent of 
the businesses in the west 231 percent in the south and 156 
percent in the midwest

federal officials today approved the use 
of oileating microbes to help clean up a 17mile oil slick in 
galveston bay that has stained beaches and threatened wildlife in 
delicate marshlands 
crews in galveston bay used booms to hold the 500000gallon 
spill in check as the coast guard opened an inquiry in houston 
today into the cause of saturdays bargetanker collision 
coast guard lt cmdr robert douville chief of investigations 
for the marine safety office at new orleans said officials had 
subpoenaed four tanker crewmen for questioning 
douville said the hearings will take up to three days 
thousands of feet of booms five skimmers and a vacuum truck 
were used tuesday in the cleanup the vessels were to return at 
daylight 
the oil is significantly disappearing and is being picked 
up said coast guard petty officer dennis schaefer salvage crews 
had retrieved about 48400 gallons of the spill by tuesday night 
he said 
heavy black oil was reported on bathing beaches near san leon 
oil also washed up at texas city bolivar peninsula and pelican 
island off galveston and two sea bird deaths have been blamed on 
the spill the coast guard said 
environmentalists feared more damage because the oil is thick 
and unlikely to dissipate in the bay which is protected from the 
gulf of mexico by barrier islands that contain nesting grounds for 
birds and other wildlife 
the worst kind of spill you can have is one behind these 
barrier islands which is what weve got said larry mckinney 
director of resource protection for the texas parks and wildlife 
department 
with the quantity of the oil reported the location of the 
spill and the sheen that is 17 miles long thats setting us up for 
a worstcase scenario 
at least 100 species of birds including the endangered brown 
pelican and at least 75 types of fish inhabit the bay area 
mckinney said 
the spill occurred after a greek tanker collided with two barges 
in the houston ship channel sinking one barge and damaging the 
other both leaked oil the doublehull tanker did not lose any of 
its 29400 metric tons of jet fuel 
coast guard rear adm jim loy who flew over the slick tuesday 
said he recommended contractors bring in about five more skimmers 
but he added i think we have a pretty good handle on the 
environmentally sensitive areas 
the coast guard said today that surface oil has dissipated but 
the crude may have sunk 
after a twohour meeting a 14member federal and state team 
overseeing the cleanup approved using oileating microbes on parts 
of the spill said texas general land office spokesman blanton 
moore 
he expected the microbes to be spread over sensitive marshlands 
and shallow areas that skimmers cant reach the organisms convert 
the oil into a fatty substance fish can eat and die when the oil 
runs out 
the process was first tested on open waters after the 
supertanker mega borg spilled 39 million gallons of oil into the 
gulf of mexico in june and state officials had pronounced the 
experiment a success 
our concern is not to introduce something into the water that 
were not very sure about loy said tuesday 
but texas land commissioner garry mauro said the microorganisms 
used in june already are epaapproved if there were questions 
about the side effects of this procedure they should have been 
answered at that time he said 
the busy houston ship channel closed after the accident but 
reopened to incoming barge traffic tuesday 
about 100 barges were waiting to enter and as many as 60 ships 
were waiting to get in and about the same number were waiting to 
leave the coast guard said 
the disruption costs shippers a total of about 15 million a 
day said ted thorjunssen president of the west gulf maritime 
association

secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister dnadze discussed 
conventional arms control and ussoviet coopeduard a shevareration in 
a marathon 
meeting wednesday soviet sources said 
but in talks that lasted into the night in a remote fishing 
lodge the envoys did not discuss the 12yearold civil war in 
afghanistan expected to mark the highlight of the twoday talks 
there has been speculation of a settlement in the conflict since 
baker arrived in irkutsk wednesday expectations were heightened 
after a sudden visit by afghan president najibullah to moscow on 
sunday 
but on wednesday a source close to the negotiations said no 
breakthrough was expected to end the war which has claimed more 
than 15 million lives and left afghanistan in ruins 
exaggerated expectations were created he said on condition 
of anonymissed a busy schedule 
of meetings for the rest of this year 
baker will meet shevardnadze again when he travels to moscow 
sept 12 for talks on german unification among the two germanys and 
the four world war ii allies france england the united states 
and the soviet union the two meet in new york oct 12 during 
international talks on conventional arms 
during a threehour talk wednesday morning shevardnadze gave 
baker a 15page outline of areas for economic and scientific 
cooperation the source said 
the outline mentioned capital investment ussoviet space 
projects and joint work on ecology and medical research the source 
said tass said one space project would be a joint flight to mars 
the document was a response to bakers july 18 offer at a 
meeting with shevardnadze in paris of us technical advice on the 
failing soviet economy 
another soviet source quoting a draft of a fourpage 
ussoviet communique said that under an economic cooperation 
package secretary of commerce robert mosbacher and leading 
american businessmen will join baker in moscow in september to meet 
with soviet counterparts 
resolution of the afghan conflict appears hung up on the role to 
be played in afghanistan by najibullah the 43yearold former 
security chief who uses only one name 
the united states has reportedly softened its demand that 
najibullah step down before elections can be held but the 
usbacked afghan resistance wants najibullah to relinquish power 
before it comes to the negotiating table 
a compromise in which najibullah would remain president but give 
up control over his countrys military and security forces is being 
considered the first soviet source said 
wednesdays talks occurred against a backdrop of water sports 
and sightseeing baker and shevardnadze rode a hydrofoil on the 
angara river and fished for an hour shevardnadze caught a trout 
but baker came away empty handed 
at one point as the two envoys walked among a crowd of 200 
wellwishers baker mussed the hair of a sullen 6yearold siberian 
boy and said i love siberia i love siberia 
they dont recognize their own minister but they certainly 
recognize you sir shevardnadze mused to baker 
shevardnadze and baker were interviewed as they returned from 
the fishing lodge tucked into a forest on the banks of the angara 
river to irkutsk a treelined city filled with log cabins and 
known as the paris of siberia

portofspain trinidad ap moslem militants surrendered 
today and began freeing their 42 hostages ending a sixday coup 
attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly 
left at least 20 people dead 
the 25 people who had been held hostage since friday at the 
government television station left the building one by one were 
searched in the middle of the street by soldiers then taken away 
on an army bus state radio said 
a short time later the leader of the coup attempt abu bakr 
and about 50 rebels left the building dropped their weapons in the 
street put their hands behind their heads and surrendered to 
soldiers witnesses said 
government spokesman gregory shaw said another group of soldiers 
was heading over to the parliament building about a mile away to 
take the remaining rebels into custody and evacuate their 17 
hostages who included seven cabinet ministers and other officials 
shaw said it was his understanding that bakr and his group of 
about 100 moslem extremists had surrendered unconditionally 
the hostages initially included the prime minister arthur nr 
robinson but he was freed on tuesday after offering to step down 
call new elections and grant the rebels amnesty it was not 
immediately clear whether the government would fulfill that pledge 
since it was made while robinson was held captive 
details of the final negotiations that produced the rebel 
agreement to surrender and free all their hostages were not 
immediately available 
earlier today bakr had described the coup attempt as a small 
family squabble and said that an accord had been reached to end 
the standoff 
speaking in an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
from the caribbean nation bakr had indicated that the hostages 
would be freed soon 
the negotiations are over we already have a signed 
agreement he told the bbc we are making preparations now for 
the evacuation of all the people all the people at the television 
house and the people who are at the parliament building 
at least 20 people were reportedly killed in fighting and 
looting associated with the coup attempt the capital was reported 
quiet today but a government spokesman said there were explosions 
overnight 
its very calm said the spokesman bernard pantin he said 
he did not know the cause of the explosions but said they were not 
near the parliament or the television station where the captives 
were being held 
bakr had blamed robinson for widespread poverty in the once 
oilrich nation of 13 million people near venezuela he said in 
todays interview he was seeking a new beginning in trinidad 
bakrs jamaat almuslimeen group which means the moslem group 
in arabic was founded in 1984 and is believed to have 250 to 300 
members it is also believed to have received financing from libya 
the us ambassador charles gargano said no sign of popular 
support surfaced for bakrs extremist sect 
this is not a revolution he said it is a hostage 
situation 
although bakr said in the bbc interview that everyone being held 
by his followers would be freed he also denied that the people 
were in fact hostages 
we dont have any hostages sir we never had any hostages 
he told the bbc interviewer youll have to rephrase that 
question 
asked whether the people in question were then free to leave 
bakr responded theres a curfew they cant walk about in a 
curfew 
a 6 pmtonoon curfew remained in effect throughout most of 
trinidad following earlier widespread looting 
when the interviewer expressed disbelief that only the curfew 
was stopping the prisoners from leaving bakr also mentioned that 
bus service had been disrupted 
he said of the coup attempt it was a small family squabble 
im saying that emphatically 
robinson was allowed tuesday to leave the besieged parliament 
building it was not clear whether he would continue as prime 
minister 
fifteen government officials were held hostage in the parliament 
building and 25 others in the government tv station 
at least nine people were killed when bakr and his followers 
took over both buildings on friday robinson 63 was hospitalized 
for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover as well as 
for exhaustion and glaucoma 
the government had said earlier that robinson was shot in both 
feet there was no explanation for the discrepancy 
smart would not discuss the conditions under which robinson was 
freed or say whether his health was a factor bakr said in todays 
interview that robinson was freed as a humanitarian gesture 
gargano interviewed before robinsons release said the 
government remained united and in control he said robinsons 
deputy winston dookeran and eight other ministers who escaped 
rebel capture were running trinidad 
smart said the government continued to enjoy the complete 
loyalty of the 1500member military and 5000member police 
force 
in a joint telephone call monday night from inside parliament 
robinson bakrs chief negotiator bilal abdullah and minister of 
justice and national security selwyn richardson all said a 
settlement had been reached 
richardson said the agreement called for robinson to resign and 
for elections to be held within 90 days but government spokesman 
gregory shaw said there was no agreement these are statements of 
people being held at gunpoint people are made to make statements

a rushhour passenger train smashed 
headon into a stationary commuter train at a station west of 
london wednesday injuring 29 people 
british rail said a threecar train entering reading station 
from tonbridge at 20 mph was switched to the wrong platform and hit 
the front of a stationary eightcar commuter train from reading to 
london 
the driver of the tonbridge train was in critical condition at 
royal berkshire hospital with leg head and back injuries one 
passenger with leg injuries was also hospitalized the others were 
released after treatment 
investigators said they were puzzled by the crash automatic 
equipment should have prevented a train from running into an 
occupied platform 
they said human error or faults with signals or points were 
believed to have caused the morning crash at the station 35 miles 
from london the tonbridge train should have stopped alongside the 
londonbound train 
both trains were crowded but all injuries were on the tonbridge 
train whose passengers were standing ready to get off and were 
thrown forward most suffering bruises and cuts 
bernadette currie said she had just stood up preparing to leave 
the train when she was jolted forward and hit the wood of the 
sliding door some of my teeth were knocked out 
the tonbridge driver was trapped by his legs in the crushed cab 
for more than two hours while firefighters cut him free he was 
conscious throughout and talked to his rescuers as he received 
painkillers and blood transfusions 
his feet were twisted so it was impossible to free him 
immediately we used hydraulic equipment to bend back the metal 
like opening a tin said senior fire officer lyn ashfield 
he had lost a lot of blood but we kept talking to him to take 
his mind off the pain he said 
debra whitehead 23 a passenger on the tonbridge train who 
suffered a sprained neck said everyone was thrown forward and 
we were all just sitting there wondering what had happened 
i was in the third carriage from the front but there was no 
panic just confusion she said 
british rail has had two serious crashes in the past two years 
faulty wiring in a signal led to 35 people being killed and more 
than 100 injured in a threetrain crash at clapham junction in 
south london during rush hour on dec 12 1988 
driver error was blamed for a twotrain crash in march 1989 near 
purley station on londons southern outskirts in which five people 
died and 94 were injured

a woman subjected to two years of obscene 
phone calls vandalism and threats from a telephone terrorist 
urged a senate panel wednesday not to restrict the new caller id 
devices that display the phone numbers of incoming calls 
mrs stacey blazer of olney md said she opposed a bill by 
sen herbert kohl dwis that would require phone companies to 
offer selective blocking of caller id for those customers who 
dont want to reveal their phone numbers 
in the case of harassing calls she said blocking would 
protect the perpetrator of the crime at the expense of their 
victims 
telephone companies such as philadelphiabased bell atlantic are 
promoting caller id which displays incoming numbers on a small 
video device as a way to thwart unwanted callers they cite 
statistics in new jersey showing a dramatic decline in the number 
of obscene phone calls after caller id began there two years ago 
but privacy advocates say callers should not be required to give 
away their phone numbers to car salesmen mail order houses and the 
like whenever they make a phone inquiry law enforcement officials 
and operators of battered women centers say blocking is essential 
six areas of the country now have caller id and as many as 22 
states are debating whether to allow it california requires 
blocking while a pennsylvania court has outlawed it as a violation 
of wiretaps laws american telephone amp telegraph co has offered a 
similar longdistance service to businesses for several years 
wednesdays hearing before the senate judiciary subcommittee on 
technology and the law primarily focused on the issue of whose 
privacy should be paramount the caller or the called 
we should not sacrifice everyones privacy to catch a small 
minority of phone terrorists kohl told the hearing 
but mrs blazer who said caller id worked for her after 
repeated cries for help to the police did not was equally adamant 
my right to privacy is more important than a potential harassers 
right to violate my privacy 
she said caller id is more effective than services such as 
call trace which allows a victim of a harassing call by pushing 
three numbers on the telephone to tell phone company computers to 
record the callers phone number only police can gain access to 
those numbers however 
i wanted to know if he lived next door or if he was one of my 
husbands business associates mrs blazer said of a man who 
called her repeatedly threatened to rape her banged on her door 
and windows and vandalized her house call trace wouldnt reveal 
that 
phone company wiretaps eventually led to the mans arrest and 
conviction she said but only after repeated delays and red tape 
his calls resumed while he was on probation and stopped only when 
she signed up for caller id earlier this year 
if i had caller id two years ago i could have prevented all 
this before it began she said 
she agreed with a new jersey bell president james g cullen who 
testified that caller id would not be as effective if blocking 
were allowed particularly for harassing calls cullen also said 
customers prefer caller id to call trace 
customers say they want to deal with the situation 
themselves cullen said 
but janlori goldman an attorney with the american civil 
liberties union said it could be dangerous for women to call back 
an obscene caller and confront him

senators warned the state departments 
designated legal adviser wednesday about a looming confrontation 
with the bush administration over the parliamentary form of the 
recent ussoviet agreement banning chemical weapons 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev signed the 
accord at their summit in june the measure calls for the two 
countries to destroy most of existing stockpiles and end the 
production of new weapons 
at issue is whether the proposal should be an executive 
agreement which the bush administration wants or a treaty which 
the senate wants 
a treaty must be ratified by the president with the approval of 
twothirds of the senate an executive agreement such as the one on 
chemical weapons requires a majority vote in the house and senate 
sen joseph biden dny said 18 of the 19 members of the 
senate foreign relations committee think it should be a treaty 
he told edwin d williamson who has been nominated as the 
departments legal adviser that at a minimum i would hope to 
elicit the constitutional basis for the administrations current 
view that this accord should be an executive agreement not a 
treaty 
williamson said he needed to study the issue further because his 
initial impression was that the measure should be a treaty 
if approved by the senate williamson will succeed abraham 
sofaer a south carolina native williamson 50 has spent most of 
his career with the new york law firm of sullivan and cromwell

bicycles now add jet skis 
the metropolitan police on wednesday showed off their new 
vehicle which looks like a waterbound snowmobile for tracking 
down hoodlums at sea police touted the jet skis as unique weapons 
against crime allowing officers to nab boaters and other jet 
skiers who endanger swimmers or break other rules 
theyre interesting and good for morale but theyre also very 
effective said kathleen otoole superintendent of the 
metropolitan police 
officer jim cullinane said he needed only about five minutes of 
instruction before he was ready to skim along the water if 
youve got the touch youve got the touch he said with a laugh 
cullinane and two other officers were eager to try out their new 
crafts which will patrol the charles river and beaches along the 
atlantic ocean under a warm sun they treated onlookers to a brief 
water show making hairpin turns and weaving between other boats in 
the river 
besides boston floridas broward county has jet ski police 
broward county began its own jet ski patrols to catch reckless jet 
ski operators los angeles county police experimented with a jet 
skis several years ago but decided they werent very effective for 
rescues 
metropolitan police officers who monitor waterways around 
boston said their primary targets would be jet ski menaces but in 
addition they would use the departments three craft to catch

lawmakers on wednesday elected democratic 
opposition leader zhelyu zhelev as bulgarias first noncommunist 
president in more than four decades thousands poured into the 
streets in a spontaneous celebration 
the election of zhelev a 55yearold philosopher turned 
politician ended a nearly 4weekold political standoff after the 
july 6 resignation of president petar mladenov a member of the 
ruling communist party now known as the socialists 
mladenov had been popular for steering bulgaria toward junes 
free elections but resigned after it was proved he had urged the 
use of tanks in december against antigovernment demonstrators 
thousands of supporters of zhelevs opposition alliance the 
union of democratic forces celebrated in the streets of sofia a 
udf stronghold they chanted victory udf and zhelyu 
it is a great day today said one supporter nadia 
mihailova 55 the balance of power has been achieved and 
hopefully things will quiet down 
zhelev who led the udf in the june elections that the 
socialists won became president after the 400seat legislature 
failed in five previous attempts to elect a new head of state he 
is the first noncommunist to gain any leading post in the balkan 
nation in more than 40 years 
zhelev was a compromise candidate backed by all parties 
including socialist leaders and won 284 of the 389 votes cast he 
ran uncontested after all parties withdrew their initial candidates 
incumbent socialist premier andrei lukanov told the house before 
the vote that zhelevs election would mean a final rejection of 
the factual monopoly over power 
his remarks indicated a commitment to pluralism in the socialist 
party the only former communist party in eastern europe to win 
free elections the socialists won 211 seats in the june elections 
while the udf took 144 
lukanov had repeatedly said that despite his partys victory in 
the june elections he did not want to lead a oneparty government 
spreading street protests against the socialists have also made 
clear that the ruling partys support is dwindling rapidly 
necessitating some sort of cooperation with the opposition 
students and intellectuals have staged protests and strikes 
since the june elections to demand democratic reforms 
before wednesdays vote both zheev and lukanov indicated that 
the socialists and opposition were willing to work together to ease 
bulgarias social tensions and rapidly deepening economic crisis 
in his comments before the vote zhelev said he wanted to see 
bulgaria make a peaceful evolution to democracy with the direct 
participation of the political opposition 
immediately following his victory zhelev made a surprise move 
and proposed former socialist interior minister atanas semerdzhiev 
as vice president 
deputies greeted the suggestion with applause and voted 
overwhelmingly for semerdzhiev in a show of hands only two 
deputies opposed the choice and seven abstained 
semerdzhiev resigned as interior minister last friday when a 
furor erupted over the proposed appearance in parliament of todor 
zhivkov the stalinist leader ousted last fall after 35 years in 
power 
the appointment of semerdzhiev was seen as a move to narrow the 
widening rift between the socialists and the opposition

an 81yearold man convicted in the 
mercy killing of his wife will be freed from prison thursday 
for humanitarian reasons gov bob martinez said wednesday 
roswell gilbert whose case focused national attention on the 
killing of an ailing loved one suffers from lung and heart disease 
and physicians say he could die at any time 
i think its in the best interest of all parties concerned 
said martinez a lawandorder republican who has signed more than 
120 death warrants since taking office in 1987 and previously 
opposed clemency for gilbert 
the retired engineer was the subject of a 1987 television movie 
that dramatized his decision in 1985 to kill his wife of 51 years 
who suffered from alzheimers disease and osteoporosis 
mr gilberts declining health and the likelihood that his 
condition will continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison 
leads me to the conclusion that he should be granted clemency 
martinez said 
three of the six cabinet members comptroller gerald lewis 
education commissioner betty castor and attorney general bob 
butterworth signed the governors petition clearing the way for 
gilberts freedom 
oh lord its just such wonderful news said gilberts 
daughter martha moran in baltimore its just wonderful 
mrs moran said she would return to florida immediately to help 
her father resettle probably back at a fort lauderdale condominium 
where many of his friends reside 
i think the first thing were going to do is go out and have a 
good meal and then let daddy have a little bourbon and branch 
water which he hasnt had in fiveandahalf years she said 
gilbert was examined in january and a medical report showed he 
suffered from heart and lung disease and was considered at high 
risk of death at any time because of his age and physical 
condition 
daddy has very bad emphysema and one of the main things im 
going to do is really insist he quit smoking said mrs moran 
the gilberts only child 
gilbert who was held at the north florida reception center in 
lake butler was sentenced to a mandatory minimum prison term of 25 
years to life after being convicted of firstdegree murder in the 
march 1985 shooting death of his wife emily 
the prosecution claimed gilbert killed his 72yearold wife 
because she had become a burden to him 
kelly hancock the former prosecutor who put gilbert behind 
bars visited him in prison recently and then called for his early 
release his change of heart set off a chain reaction of comment 
from cabinet members followed by martinezs call for clemency 
wednesday 
former gov bob graham and the cabinet rejected gilberts 
clemency request in 1985 and martinez repeated that action as late 
as january 1987 following the nbc television movie mercy or 
murder 
gilbert had hoped the movie would gain him support in his bid 
for clemency 
i would like to be vindicated he said after watching the 
movie in prison im not the kind of bastard that deserves a life 
sentence thats about the same sentence that the most miserable 
guy in the world would get

got a hankering for some exxon valdez 
halibut a craving for beach crew chili 
if baked alaska sounds oldfashioned perhaps alaska crude 
chocolate cake will satisfy 
these and other culinary concoctions were submitted by exxon 
corp workers elected officials and others involved in the cleanup 
of the nations biggest oil spill the recipes are collected in 
the two billion dollar cookbook 
the title refers to the amount exxon reported spending to clean 
up nearly 11 million gallons of crude spilled from the exxon valdez 
in march 1989 
a few fanciful names aside there is little in the cookbook to 
remind readers it was an oil spill that brought the contributors of 
the recipes to prince william sound 
we wanted to show some of the good story and the good news of 
whats happened with all of those people that got together to work 
on the cleanup said kay harrington one of four women who put 
together the cookbook while their exxonemployed husbands worked on 
the spill 
the oil spill was the proverbial lemon and this was an effort 
to make some lemonade 
according to its foreword the cookbook aims to celebrate the 
richness of friendships and the priceless feeling of accomplishment 
of a job well done 
but perhaps more importantly it adds our hope is that 
you will find our book a recipe for healing 
healing and humor are welcome in the aftermath of the spill 
said alaska environmental commissioner dennis kelso who hadnt 
seen the cookbook 
he cautioned against treating the cleanup as if it were over and 
done with or forgetting the damage the spill did 
the cookbook financed by 31 corporations and individuals 
including exxon went on the shelves of stores in alaska and 
houston last week exxon also has the book on sale at its anchorage 
offices 
the books pages are sprinkled with upbeat bits of information 
it includes photos of a clean prince william sound there are 
anecdotes about people who met married or had babies while working 
on the spill 
first lady barbara bush sent a recipe for allamerican clam 
chowder gov steve cowper added one for buttermilk pie sen ted 
stevens ralaska contributed one for salmonburgers 
exxon valdez halibut a mix of halibut mayonnaise mustard and 
seasoning invented in an exxon trailer in valdez was submitted 
by mona cadoret of lafayette la 
texas and cajun cuisine are well represented reflecting exxons 
houston roots 
the last recipe in the book is for soap 
proceeds from the 1695 book will be donated to an anchorage 
shelter 
kelso said he was sorry he didnt contribute a recipe 
blackened redfish comes to mind he said with a laugh 
i dont begrudge this kind of thing theres no reason we 
cant acknowledge each others humanity and a sense that we 
each experienced this in a way thats appropriate to acknowledge 
he said

merchant ships plucked 20 sailors from heavy 
waves wednesday after their cargo ship began to break up under the 
battering of hurricane bertha 350 miles off cape cod 
three crew members died and four were missing 
the crew of 27 abandoned the 593foot malteseregistered 
freighter corazon at 420 am 11 hours after reporting the ship 
was breaking up thirtyfoot waves whipped by wind gusting to 90 
mph had snapped its keel the equivalent of breaking its back 
soviet hong kong and norwegian merchant ships steamed to the 
stricken vessel to rescue crew members crowded in a lifeboat and a 
life raft us military aircraft coordinated from above 
she had fairly calm passage coming across the atlantic and 
bertha just swung right into her said charles aitcheson 
president of asca marine inc the ships new york agent 
obviously theyve tried to save as many as they could theyre 
all out there working hard to do it 
authorities did not know if the ship was leaking fuel or how 
much fuel was aboard 
hurricane bertha churned on toward canadas maritime provinces 
carrying 75 mph wind but was expected to weaken a swimmer in 
florida drowned tuesday in rough water attributed to the hurricane 
the corazon was carrying more than 25000 tons of cement bound 
from greece to new york and the load likely contributed to its 
damage said coast guard lt jg rodney gadsden 
we know it came apart in heavy seas he said we dont 
know if it was a structural problem or not it just happened 
because of the weather conditions 
by midmorning the corazons bow was submerged and its stern was 
standing clear of the water 350 miles southsouthwest of cape cod 
said coast guard petty officer anthony l whitehead 
one crew member apparently fell into the water when the crew 
members boarded the lifeboat and life raft whitehead said that 
sailor was pulled from the water dead by the russian trawler vympel 
four hours after they left their ship the 13 crew members on 
the lifeboat were taken aboard the soviet merchant ship leonid 
leonidov whitehead said 
but efforts to save the life rafts occupants went less 
smoothly the vympel attempted to rescue what was reported to be 12 
sailors aboard the raft whitehead said but the raft was pulled 
into the trawlers screw propeller and rudder area and six or 
seven sailors were pitched into the ocean 
the five remaining aboard the life raft were later pulled to 
safety two more life rafts were put out and three people were 
seen apparently in one of them gadsden said 
more precise accounting was unavailable but by afternoon the 
coast guard reported 20 sailors recovered alive three dead and 
four unaccounted for one survivor was reported injured 
the hong kong vessel nova europa assisted and the norwegian 
vessel hual angelita stood by an air force c130 flew overhead to 
direct communications and a coast guard c130 flew in to help 
aitcheson the ships agent said the crew included greek 
filipino polish and maldivian sailors he identified its captain 
as georgios tsibirlos of chios greece 
the corazon displacing 15892 gross tons was built in japan in 
1972 and previously was operated under the philippine flag as the 
dona corazon ii aitcheson said he identified the owner as good 
faith shipping in piraeus greece

an outlawed protestant 
extremist group claimed responsibility wednesday for slaying a 
roman catholic man during his sons fifth birthday party 
the ulster freedom fighters said in a message to belfast media 
that they killed john judge a 34yearold father of three as he 
chatted to friends at his garden gate tuesday night while the party 
was underway inside his house 
the freedom fighters claimed judge was a member of the irish 
republican army but the iras political wing sinn fein said he 
had no connection to the organization or other paramilitary groups 
two gunmen riding in a taxi drove up to judges house in the 
springfield road area a west belfast catholic stronghold opened 
fire and escaped the stolen taxi was later found abandoned near 
the staunchly protestant shankill road area of west belfast 
the killing was the second this year by the freedom fighters 
the banned group claimed it shot to death another catholic on july 
15 in lisburn 
judge was the 37th person to die in political and sectarian 
violence in northern ireland this year and the 2811th since the 
start of the socalled troubles in 1969 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the mainly protestant province with the overwhelmingly roman 
catholic irish republic under a socialist government

the owners of the crippled three mile island 
nuclear reactor will seek to have customers pay costs associated 
with the 1979 accident until the year 2014 according to plant 
officials 
the unit operated only about four months before it was 
permanently disabled in the nations worst commercial nuclear 
accident on march 31 1979 its twin unit 1 was unharmed and was 
given permission to resume operations in 1985 the owners hope to 
operate the healthy unit until 2014 
its wrong to ask our children to pay for a nuclear reactor 
that only was in operation for four months eric epstein 
spokesman for three mile island alert an antinuclear group said 
in an interview wednesday 
the costs are the result of the reactors unique 
postaccident condition plant officials said in a july 26 report 
filed with the nuclear regulatory commission 
because of the accident the report says it will cost 1956 
million to safely get rid of the damaged unit about 70 million 
more than for a comparable reactor that did not suffer an accident 
the plants pennsylvania owners intend to ask state utility 
regulators to permit them to start billing customers for the full 
amount when they make their next rate filings probably in 1992 or 
1993 said mary wells a spokeswoman for general public utilities 
nuclear the plant operator 
it is standard practice for utilities to ask ratepayers to fund 
decommissioning the formal term for mothballing or dismantling a 
plant at the end of its energyproducing life 
but three mile island poses a more difficult question 
pennsylvania consumer advocate irwin popowsky said in an interview 
wednesday 
we have not opposed reasonable decommissioning costs for other 
units on the theory that ratepayers who receive service ought to be 
accumulating money to decommission it later popowski said 
but tmi2 is unique because it only provided service for a 
short time its certainly going to be an issue he said 
rates for the 426000 customers of metropolitan edison co 
which owns 50 percent of the plant could increase as much as 4 
percent plant officials said last month meanwhile rates for 
customers of pennsylvania electric co and jersey central power amp 
light co which each own 25 percent of both units could see rates 
rise 1 percent to 2 percent the officials said 
in the accident unit 2 was allowed to lose vital cooling water 
that normally covers the nuclear fuel rods 
financed partly by ratepayers the subsequent 1 billion cleanup 
has focused on removal of fuel from the damaged radioactive core 
waste shipment and water decontamination 
plant officials hope to finish the cleanup by the end of 1991 
then place unit 2 in storage for anywhere between 20 years and 60 
years while radiation decays inside the decommissioning money 
would then be recalled and the plant could either be dismantled or 
sealed

zhelyu zhelev the new bulgarian 
president was a man of letters rather than politics before last 
years politburo coup that toppled the hardline communist 
leadership 
as in other east european countries abandoning stalinism 
bulgarias parliament on wednesday chose for the presidency an 
intellectual untainted by a communist past 
zhelev an opposition leader was the first noncommunist to 
gain a top post in bulgaria where the former communists now 
called socialists still hold an absolute majority in the grand 
national assembly 
but his election to the highest office illustrated the swift and 
unrelenting decline of the socialists who now admit that despite 
their june election victory they are not strong enough to govern 
alone 
zhelev practically unknown in bulgaria just over a year ago 
gained prominence as chairman of the union of democratic forces 
the main opposition alliance comprising 16 diverse political 
parties 
he was the only candidate in wednesdays presidential balloting 
the ruling socialists the mainstream agrarians and the union had 
withdrawn their candidates in an effort to break a deadlock in 
parliament 
last spring zhelev led the opposition in talks with the former 
communists that forced the ruling party to move toward a multiparty 
system and bulgarias first free elections in 58 years 
while lacking charisma and political experience at the outset 
zhelev became a respected leader and gained considerable popularity 
in sofia and other urban centers mainly among intellectuals and 
the countrys youth 
it was the slightly built zhelev who stepped into an angry crowd 
of students and other protesters who had blocked traffic in 
downtown sofia to demonstrate against alleged manipulations in the 
june parliamentary elections 
days earlier on june 7 zhelev was the main speaker at a rally 
of 500000 union supporters in downtown sofia the biggest such 
event ever in modern bulgarian times 
before last years changes zhelev was known only to a small 
group of intellectuals who managed to get a copy of his book 
fascism published in 1981 a searching analysis of 
totalitarianism the book was soon banned and has become a 
bestseller only with its republication this year 
in other east european nations democratic changes that began 
last fall are also being led by dissident intellectuals 
in czechoslovakia vaclav havel rose to the presidency as a 
dissident playwright who had been jailed and harassed for years 
his ideas and plays had won acclaim abroad but were banned at home 
similarly hungarys interim president arpad goencz spent 
seven years in jail after the 1956 revolution and then was active 
as a writer and translater of english and french literature 
born march 3 1935 zhelev studied philosophy at sofia 
university from 195861 he worked in the house of culture in 
veselinovo near shumen in northern bulgaria 
in 196164 he engaged in postgraduate studies but failed to 
complete them with a dissertation because he had criticized lenins 
theory of matter he was expelled from the communist party in 1964 
for the next eight years zhelev was either jobless or worked in 
casual jobs in agriculture in his wifes hometown 
starting in 1972 he worked for two years as a sociologist and 
joined the institute of culture in sofia in 1975 where he has been 
active since except for a period when he was expelled 
also in 1975 zhelevs thesis was finally accepted and he 
graduated as a doctor of philosophy

the senate told its public esteem is at the 
level of usedcar salesmen voted 7723 on wednesday to bar its 
members from accepting fees for speeches to specialinterest 
groups but immediate skepticism was raised as to whether the 
decision will hold 
the vote approved an amendment by sen christopher dodd 
dconn to a campaign finance overhaul bill it requires senators 
to quit giving speeches for profit as of next jan 1 
but later action by the senate and a renewed veto threat by the 
bush administration regarding the overall bill raised doubts that 
the honoraria ban will make its way into the books anytime soon 
this bill clearly will not become law said sen mitch 
mcconnell rky he said white house chief of staff john sununu had 
told him earlier wednesday that bush would veto it 
the measures chances also were complicated as the senate began 
piling other amendments onto it some of them likely to virtually 
eliminate any chance of twothirds vetoproof support for the 
package 
for example the senate barely approved 5149 new york sen 
daniel moynihans proposal requiring members to forgo unearned 
income of more than 15 percent of their regular salaries that 
would be a hard blow to the senates many millionaires whose stock 
and interest incomes far exceed their government paychecks 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas one of those millionaires said 
it looks like a little bit of class warfare going on he said 
he wouldnt stay in the senate if the moynihan provision became law 
also approved was on a 5941 vote was an amendment by sen pete 
wilson rcalif that would prohibit senate candidates from 
tapping earmarked funds to help pay for television ads until 
congress first sets aside 100 million for drug prevention centers 
i dont know whether this bill is going anywhere said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas unless theres some 
changes thats not going to be possible 
senators can now pocket up to 27337 in outside speaking fees 
to supplement their annual salary of 98400 
when a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling 
and thats what it amounts to we denigrate ourselves said dodd 
as public servants our salaries should come from the public 
alone 
sen robert c byrd dwva said members of the senate 
himself among them had supplemented their salaries with more than 
9 million in honoraria over the past decade 
the scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on 
public service and raised public cynicism to an alltime high 
byrd said were about at the level of used car salesmen in the 
publics esteem 
the senate voted last week to denounce sen david durenberger 
rminn for violating several ethics standards including skirting 
the limits on honoraria in a bookpublishing deal 
six other senators are under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee for alleged actions involving savings and loan 
institutions and department of housing and urban development 
programs 
the house voted last year to give up honoraria effective jan 1 
1991 but also boosted the salaries of its members to 124000 
reluctant to vote itself the same 25 percent pay boost the senate 
instead retained the opportunity for its members to accept 
specialinterest fees 
republicans who particularly oppose the campaign bills 
provisions for aggregate spending ceilings and government vouchers 
for buying tv advertising have lost several partyline votes in 
their attempts to amend it 
dodd who reported 15000 in honoraria income in 1989 called 
the vote on his amendment significant regardless of bushs veto 
threat saying it puts the senate on record for the first time in 
favor of abolishing honoraria he said he will add it to other 
legislation if the campaign finance bill falters 
in 1989 senators accepted nearly 3 million in honoraria and 
kept more than 21 million with the balance donated to charity 
according to their financial disclosure forms 
dole who kept 35750 in honoraria in 1989 said he agreed with 
dodd on the need to eliminate such income but not on the strategy 
of doing it without a pay raise 
in january house members will be getting paid about 22000 
more than senators and we could be getting about 22000 less 
for years to come he said 
dole said he had considered trying to amend dodds measure to 
include a raise that would return senate and house salaries to 
parity but acknowledged he lacked the votes to win its passage 
this close to the november election 
dodds amendment also would limit senate members earned outside 
income to 15 percent of their salaries a policy that the house 
also adopted a year ago

trial testified wednesday he never admitted to police that he took 
part in a gangrape and nearfatal beating 
testifying for the second day yusef salaam 16 admitted he was 
in the park april 19 1989 the night the female jogger was nearly 
killed but he said he never saw her 
his testimony contradicted that of detective thomas mckenna 
mckenna last week said he tricked salaam into admitting he had 
attacked the jogger and others in the park mckenna said he made 
notes of those admissions 
salaam also denied that he saw his two codefendants antron 
mccray 16 and raymond santana 15 in the park that night and 
denied he told mckenna most of the things in his notes 
salaam said he did tell mckenna that on the day after the 
rampage through the park others told him people had been attacked 
there the night before 
salaam mccray and santana are on trial on charges of attempted 
murder rape sexual abuse assault robbery and riot for allegedly 
attacking the woman and two male joggers mccray and santana 
admitted taking part in the attack in videotape statements shown to 
the jury there is no videotape of salaam 
the defendants are being tried in an adult court but if 
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 
years in prison 
the jogger nearly dead when found and suffering brain injuries 
underwent rehabilitation and has returned to salomon brothers inc 
where she is a vice president in corporate finance she still has 
difficulty walking and does not remember the attack 
three other youths steven lopez and kevin richardson both 15 
and kharey wise 17 are to stand trial on the same charges later 
this year 
on tuesday salaam testified that he told detectives that he was 
15 almost immediately when they came to his home to pick him up it 
is illegal for police to question anyone under 16 without a parent 
present 
defense attorney robert burns says police knowingly questioned 
salaam illegally and therefore any alleged incriminating statements 
by him should be discounted 
on crossexamination assistant district attorney elizabeth 
lederer suggested salaam was lying when he said he told police he 
was 15 
she suggested he knew he could be questioned alone if police 
thought he was 16 and that he thought he could submit to 
interrogation and return home without his mother finding out 
he admitted he knew other teenagers had been questioned by 
police about the previous nights events and released but he 
denied telling police he was 16 and hoping to be questioned without 
his mother knowing

a stockbroker who killed a client he 
had defrauded and then fabricated clues to throw off police has 
been sentenced to 40 years in prison 
frank a vandever 36 fatally shot ronald w hiiri in his 
stonington home in 1988 then created phony clues suggesting the 
killing was connected to drugs and sex 
vandever who pleaded guilty may 25 murdered hiiri to prevent 
him from reporting that vandever had embezzled money from him the 
prosecution said 
i am really and sincerely sorry your honor vandever said 
tuesday before being sentenced by superior court judge joseph 
koletsky 
four days before the slaying vandever was fired from a new 
haven brokerage firm after company officials discovered he had 
taken 43000 from a womans account and deposited it in his own 
savings account prosecutors said 
vandever had promised to make restitution and assured company 
officials he had not embezzled money from any other clients he 
decided to kill hiiri because he was worried hiiri would report 
that he too was missing money said assistant states attorney 
kevin t kane 
he said vandever once told a traveling companion he was writing 
a book on the perfect murder 
in some ways this murder could have been perfect kane said 
after shooting hiiri first in the back and then at pointblank 
range in the heart vandever left newspapers and books around 
hiiris house to make police believe he was a transvestite or 
homosexual hiiris wallet showed up in an area of bridgeport known 
for drug trafficking 
despite vandevers efforts he was immediately a suspect 
hiiris family knew he was to meet with his stockbroker the day he 
was killed and vandever was videotaped by a suspicious jeweler 
while trying to buy a ring with hiiris credit card

president fw de klerk on 
wednesday accused nelson mandelas african national congress of a 
breach of trust that has jeopardized blackwhite talks on 
ending apartheid 
de klerk met mandela for three hours in pretoria and then issued 
a strongly worded statement criticizing the anc and its close ally 
the south african communist party 
a dispute over official assertions that militants in both groups 
are planning for an insurrection has eroded good will developed in 
recent months between the government and the anc mandelas group 
is the leading black opposition movement 
earlier wednesday mandela issued a conciliatory statement after 
the talks with de klerk but de klerks remarks showed that deep 
divisions persist over the alliance between the anc and the 
communists 
statements and actions by prominent anc members as well as by 
communist party members seriously jeopardize the continuation 
of discussions aimed at the creation of a climate for 
negotiation de klerk said in his statement wednesday 
the president said his meeting with mandela took place in a 
constructive spirit he said aug 6 talks between the 
government and the anc on ending whiteminority rule would proceed 
as planned 
however in accusing the anc and communists of a breach of 
trust he apparently referred to the recent police allegations 
that militants from those organizations have been plotting to seize 
power by force if negotiations break down 
de klerk said law and order minister adriaan vlok would issue 
statements about important information obtained by police and 
the recent arrests of dozens of anc and communist party members 
in his earlier remarks wednesday mandela had said i am 
positive that the talks on the 6th of august will go ahead in good 
spirit 
mandela said he told de klerk that the anc and the communist 
party were committed to peaceful negotiations not violent 
revolution 
he also indicated the two men had cleared up a 
misunderstanding about the presence of communist party leader 
joe slovo on the anc negotiating team 
after a de klerkmandela meeting last week the anc said the 
government wanted slovo dropped from the anc delegation 
i thought that the state president had demanded that joe slovo 
be excluded from the delegation of the anc mandela said 
the correct position is that the state president was disturbed 
by evidence placed before him mandela said in a reference to the 
police allegations 
the statement gave no indication that slovo would be dropped 
from the negotiating team 
slovo is one of several communists who also hold top posts in 
the anc mandela is not a member of the communist party and says 
the anc is not a communist organization despite the 
crossmembership 
mandela and slovo appeared together at a communist party rally 
on sunday and again denied the existence of a plot to seize power 
however anc leaders have said that guerrillas will continue to 
infiltrate the country until a ceasefire is negotiated with the 
government 
the anc and the government held their first talks in may three 
months after de klerk legalized the group and freed mandela from a 
life prison term for plotting against the government mandela 
deputy president of the anc had spent 27 years in prison 
the talks aug 6 will be aimed at eliminating obstacles to 
fullscale negotiations on a new constitution to give the black 
majority a voice in national affairs 
before the anc enters negotiations it wants the government to 
release prisoners convicted of political crimes and allow the 
return without punishment of about 20000 south african exiles 
under apartheid the 5 million whites dominate politics and the 
economy and the 30million black majority has no voice in national 
affairs 
the ancs guerrilla campaign launched in 1961 has never posed 
a serious threat to the governments powerful security forces the 
anc has not carried out any major attacks in recent months

president bush and congressional budget 
negotiators appeared to abandon hope wednesday of reaching a 
deficitcutting agreement before fall setting the stage for 
electionseason fingerpointing over which side is to blame 
republicans suggested bush would make a political issue of 
democratic refusal to offer detailed proposals for tax increases 
and spending cuts 
but house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
countered we didnt pledge that every time the republicans slit 
their wrists that we would slit ours 
he referred to an administration plan criticized even by 
republicans that includes higher taxes on alcohol and a limit on 
deductibility of state tax payments 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said bush in 
a meeting with house and senate republicans expressed his 
concerns frustration that the democrats have not been able to 
come up with a plan details that meet the ones that the 
republicans have already put together and are willing to put on the 
table 
bush plans to verbally attack democrats during congress august 
recess and to veto spending bills he considers too expensive thus 
leaving potentially huge automatic spending cuts in place this fall 
until a budget deal is reached according to white house officials 
and republican lawmakers who met with the president wednesday 
bush is certainly not going to keep his trap shut all during 
august said house minority leader robert michel rill 
but rep john dingell dmich said republican plans to bash 
democrats for not offering a deficitcutting plan would backfire 
he said the public realizes it is the presidents responsibility to 
offer a budget 
the republicans are going to look like a congregation of 
jackasses dingell told reporters 
with the start of the new fiscal year exactly two months away 
the white house adopted a carrotandstick approach to the 
deadlocked 12weekold budget talks 
administration officials expressed optimism that the bargaining 
aimed at paring next years expected 169 billion budget gap 
will succeed after congress monthlong recess 
white house spokesman popadiuk said that at a morning white 
house meeting with 150 gop house and senate members bush stated 
his expectation that the talks will intensify in september 
and house speaker thomas s foley dwash said democrats and 
white house officials have an agreement in principle to work 
out a schedule for completing an agreement in september 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said negotiators were considering 
that when talks resume they would be in seclusion where we can 
work together without interruption one location mentioned was a 
plantation on marylands eastern shore he said 
but at the same time bush appeared ready to adopt tougher 
tactics the grammrudman law will trigger more than 100 billion 
in spending cuts on oct 1 a process known as sequester unless 
a deal emerges 
the sequester is a reality he will enforce if no agreement is 
reached popadiuk said of bush 
even so the administration emitted different signals about just 
how tough bush planned to be white house officials initially said 
bush was giving democrats until friday to make a budget offer a 
statement that was echoed by rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 
house republican 
but shortly afterward popadiuk said the president didnt 
impose any deadlines 
republican lawmakers clearly remained angry over the political 
embarrassment they have faced ever since details of the 
administrations 54 billion package of spending cuts and tax 
increases emerged last week 
included in the plan are higher taxes on alcohol and a reduction 
in the deductibility of state and local income taxes both of 
which have drawn gop fire 
you can assume that when the gop lawmakers go home they wont 
be shy about the footdragging weve seen by the democrats about 
finding a credible solution to the budget deficit said white 
house spokeswoman alixe glen 
but democrats argued that a month of partisan warfare would 
accomplish little 
if we want to beat each other around politically were not 
going to come to an agreement and the public will take it out on 
both of us said panetta 
panetta expressed a willingness to give the republicans a 
democratic budget plan as soon as the gop produced a complete 
proposal of its own the republicans have never formally submitted 
their plan to democrats though details have been described in 
published reports 
but other democrats expressed no willingness to publicize their 
own deficitcutting ideas shortly before the august break their 
fear is that it would make them a target of the same pummeling the 
gop plan is now taking 
i dont think its generally helpful foley said of 
immediately producing a democratic package 
the maneuvering of the negotiators has begun to wear thin on at 
least some rankandfile members of congress 
i have news for you summiteers both republican and 
democrat rep robin tallon dsc said on the house floor 
the rest of america thinks youre acting like a bunch of 
children

two cosmonauts soared into space wednesday on a 
mission to continue the manufacture of ultrapure crystals for 
profit in what has become the centerpiece of the soviet space 
program 
a soyuz tm10 capsule carrying flight commander gennady manakov 
and engineer gennady strekalov rose into a hazy sky atop a column 
of orange and white flames from the baikonur space center in 
kazakhstan 
the capsule blasted off as scheduled at 132 pm 
watching the launch in the 109degree heat were two japanese 
broadcasters one of whom will be a paying passenger on a dec 2 
mission that could bring the soviet space program an estimated 16 
million 
on friday manakov and strekalov will rendezvous with the mir 
space station to replace anatoly solovyev and alexander balandin 
cosmonauts who have been working in orbit since feb 11 
during their 4month mission manakov and strekalov will 
continue the work solovyev and balandin began growing 
superpure crystals for use in semiconductors and computer chips 
the program is designed to bring profits of more than 40 
million 
solovyev and balandin who return to earth on aug 9 grew 23 
such crystals in the weightlessness of space using the special 
kristall module attached to the mir complex each is worth about 1 
million the tass news agency reported 
producing such crystals and other space manufacturing is 
clearly the centerpiece of the soviet space program said james 
oberg author of several books on the soviet space program in an 
interview from his texas home 
its the key to their commercialization of space he said 
such importance is given to the crystals oberg said that the 
past two soyuz flights to the mir have had only two cosmonauts 
aboard so the canister of crystals could ride home in the capsules 
empty third seat 
starting in december and continuing into 1992 however the 
third seat will be occupied by foreign passengers paying the 
soviets hard currency perhaps as much as 16 million oberg said 
sitting in the soyuz capsules third seat in december will be 
either tokyo broadcasting system camerawoman ryoko kikuchi 26 or 
toyohiro akiyama 48 the former washington bureau chief for the 
network the japanese chosen will spend eight days in space tass 
said 
the launch of the seventh main mission to the mir was not 
broadcast live on soviet television as previous launches have 
been a taped report was shown two hours later 
before the cosmonauts got into a bus that took them to the 
launch pad manakov saluted vladimir ivanov chairman of the state 
commission on spaceflight and said the crew of the spaceship is 
ready for the flight 
i wish you a successful flight and happy return to the native 
land replied ivanov 
when the cosmonauts reached the launch pad each was kissed on 
the cheek by an unidentified man wearing a military uniform in a 
brief exchange with journalists manakov 40 wisecracked that 
the older one meaning 49yearold strekalov would be 
filling them in on the missions progress in space 
a journalist shouted a traditional russian colloquial expression 
for luck before a risky venture neither feathers nor fluff 
and a smiling manakov gave the appropriate response to hell with 
you 
manakov a test pilot is making his first space flight 
strekalov is a veteran cosmonaut on his fourth flight having 
worked aboard the salyut space station 
tass said they are expected to make at least two spacewalks 
during which they will conduct further unspecified repairs to a 
hatch on the kvant2 module attached to the mir complex 
during a july 17 excursion outside the space station to repair 
torn thermal insulation on their soyuz tm9 capsule solovyev and 
balandin discovered they could not close a hatch at the end of 
their space walk they were however able to close it on a 
subsequent july 26 space walk

the house foreign affairs committee approved 
on wednesday new restrictions on trade with iraq as democrats on 
the panel chastised president bush for not taking such action on 
his own 
the legislation approved on a voice vote without dissent calls 
for an end to the 200 million line of credit iraq now enjoys 
through the exportimport bank and for us opposition to loans 
from international institutions like the world bank 
it also would require that any us exporter wishing to sell 
items to iraq first prove that they will not be used for any 
program to develop chemical or biological weapons or ballistic 
missiles or enhance iraqs ability to support terrorism 
the bills author rep howard berman dcalif said the united 
states must register its disapproval of human rights violations by 
iraq and the belligerent rhetoric of its president saddam hussein 
iraq has massed 100000 troops on its border with kuwait in a 
dispute over oil production 
the lesson of iraq is clear berman said you win nothing 
by appeasing a bully he merely becomes a bolder and more dangerous 
bully 
a day earlier assistant secretary of state john kelly testified 
before a house subcommittee that the administration is developing 
new curbs on socalled dual use exports goods like computers 
and aircraft parts that can have either a civilian or military 
purpose 
but berman said his legislation goes farther because it puts the 
burden on exporters to show that their products will not be used in 
weapons programs 
i regret that the administration has long been unwilling to 
take a stance and consider sanctions berman said 
and rep william broomfield of michigan the panels senior 
republican said he hoped the committee action would spur the 
administration to complete its review of policy toward iraq and 
recommend a policy we all can support 
the action came after the nearsale to iraq last month of 
industrial furnaces that could be used to make nuclear weapons 
material the sale was aborted by the white house at the last 
minute 
documents obtained by the associated press show that officials 
at the commerce department who had previously approved the sale 
knew that the furnaces had a potential nuclear use 
the documents are the minutes of the departments discussions in 
1989 with consarc corp the rancocas njbased furnace 
manufacturer 
they show that officials of the company that made the furnaces 
consarc corp of rancocas nj held a meeting on feb 22 1989 
with alan c stoddart a special agent from commerces office of 
export enforcement 
mr stoddart said the departments main concern is nuclear 
nonproliferation according to the minutes of the meeting with 
consarcs president raymond roberts and tina olnick a company 
employee 
the minutes continued mr roberts again stated that the 
customer tells us they will be making titanium castings for making 
medical prostheses 
however the equipment can be used without modification on 
zirconium for which the principal end use is nuclear 
in an earlier feb 15 1989 conversation roberts told jeff 
tripp of the commerce department that there is nothing to stop 
them the iraqis from melting zirconium the main use of which is 
cladding material for nuclear fuel 
gary milhollin executive director of the wisconsin project on 
nuclear arms control said the highperformance furnaces such as 
the ones iraq sought can be used for a number of purposes 
including melting plutonium for bomb cores and titanium for missile 
nose cones 
the iraqis said the titanium a lightweight metal would be used 
for artificial hip and knee joints for victims of the persian gulf 
war with iran 
on march 15 1989 ms olnick consarcs contract administrator 
asked the commerce department whether the company needed a 
validated export license to ship the furnaces 
such a license is generally needed to export items that would 
appear to have a direct nuclear capability 
in the letter ms olnick said consarc did not believe a 
validated license was necessary but we would appreciate an 
assessment of the department of commerce 
she added we have informed the customer that we will not 
proceed with the project until we have received approval to export 
the equipment in either the form of an assessment that an export 
license is not required or an approved export license 
roberts did not return a telephone call wednesday to discuss the 
documents but he said earlier his company had received permission 
to ship furnaces to iraq ms olnick said she could not talk about 
the matter 
commerce department officials have refused to talk about the 
consarc case 
but after a furnace was seized by the customs service on a dock 
in philadelphia last month us officials said consarc would be 
required to obtain a validated license it is unlikely such a 
license will be granted they said

marguerite martin like a lot of other 
business executives has a passion for golf 
but she has a problem she works during the week and her club 
the longmeadow country club has a rule banning women from the 
course on weekend mornings 
so ms martin filed a complaint with the massachusetts 
commission against discrimination 
most country clubs discriminate against women and restrict 
when they can play ms martin said wednesday as hard as it is 
to understand its really very simple to many men golf isnt a 
game its a disease that doesnt incorporate women 
ms martin who launched her own financial management firm after 
retiring from the insurance business said she smarted under the 
longmeadow country clubs restrictions for 25 years she filed the 
complaint only after trying unsuccessfully for six years to get the 
clubs board of governors to ease its restrictions on women 
as a younger woman you rationalize that making a squawk could 
hurt your business and back off she said im 65 ive lived a 
good life and gotten though a lot of different types of 
discrimination at this time in my life i have to face up to facts 
and the fact is that i cant stand this any longer 
donald r dupre president of the 350member club was on 
vacation and could not be reached for comment on the complaint 
which was filed last month two other officers vice president john 
m naughton and secretary norman j van tassel declined comment on 
the action 
ms martin suggested that the rules stemmed from the country 
clubs beginnings in 1922 when most women did not work outside the 
home and could more easily golf on weekdays 
most of the women in the longmeadow club still fall into that 
category she said and in truth when you get beyond the 
hysteria there would probably be only a couple of women who would 
play on saturday mornings and it wouldnt bother anybody 
alan cassella a compliance officer for the discrimination 
commission said her complaint was filed under a section of the law 
covering private organizations that solicit the patronage of the 
general public 
earlier this year in hermitage pa protests led officials at 
the hickory vfw golf course to roll back a rule requiring women to 
wait until 11 am to tee off

chairman john e frohnmayer of the national 
endowment for the arts says he might appoint local panels to help 
determine whether federally financed works of art violate community 
antiobscenity standards 
frohnmayer said the need for such a move had never arisen 
because an nea grant had never been denied or challenged under the 
congressional ban on federal support for works that might be 
considered obscene 
if we were required to at some point determine local 
standards thats how we would go about it or that is one of the 
ways one might go about it he said 
the nea chairman expressed his views during a threehour 
deposition taken tuesday by new york lawyer floyd abrams who is 
representing the new school for social research in a lawsuit 
against the endowment a transcript of the 100page deposition was 
released wednesday 
the new school is challenging the endowments requirement that 
grant recipients sign a pledge they will not use federal funds to 
create obscene art the lawsuit charges that the pledge is 
unconstitutionally vague and violates guarantees of free speech and 
due process 
the new schools application for a 45000 grant to redesign its 
main courtyard in new york was approved by the endowment last march 
but when informed of the neas antiobscenity restrictions new 
school president jonathan f fanton wrote frohnmayer that the 
university could not accept the endowment grant under a condition 
that undermines our societys deep commitment to intellectual and 
artistic freedom 
frohnmayer responded in a may 2 letter to fanton which expressed 
severe questions about the constitutionality of the law 
frohnmayers deposition will be used by abrams a noted first 
amendment lawyer when the case is heard before us district judge 
louis stanton in manhattan on aug 13 
the nea chairmans proposal to appoint local panels to judge 
whether endowmentsupported works might be obscene follows a 
formula prescribed by the supreme court in its landmark 1973 
obscenity ruling 
the high court said determinations of obscenity must take into 
account contemporary community standards the court said works 
may be considered obscene if they depict sex in a patently 
offensive way appeal to the prurient interest and lack serious 
literary artistic political or scientific value 
under questioning by abrams frohnmayer said he might find it 
necessary to consider impaneling a group within a locality in 
which that grant was going to take place to advise the endowment on 
community standards 
but so far he said we have not been confronted with that 
issue because there has been no grant that has been denied or 
challenged under this statute 
he denied that the endowment had rejected any grant application 
on the grounds that it was considered too controversial or 
troublesome since the antiobscenity ban was imposed by congress 
last october 
the nea was plunged into controversy more than a year ago when 
sen jesse helms rnc and other political and religious 
conservatives criticized endowment support for exhibitions of 
controversial works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano 
at helms urging congress amended the endowments current 171 
million budget to include a ban on using federal funds for artworks 
that include depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the 
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
and which when taken as a whole do not have serious literary 
artistic political or scientific works

the drug enforcement administration suggested 
wednesday that murder charges filed in the philippines against 
three us agents could have been intended to prevent them from 
testifying about drug trafficking by filipino military officials 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said the agency had been 
invited to testify before a commission formed by philippines 
president corazon aquino to investigate allegations of drug 
trafficking by members of her armed forces 
andrew fenrich the head of the deas twoman office in the 
philippines had planned to testify until the charges were filed 
wednesday dougherty said 
the charges rather effectively put the kibosh on any testimony 
about the facts concerning the armed forces dougherty said 
im suggesting theres probably a causeandeffect situation 
there he added 
fenrich was one of three dea agents and 13 filipino policemen 
charged wednesday by the philippines military in the july 10 
killings of two officers and a soldier during what police said was 
a shootout during a drug bust last month 
according to the national bureau of investigation the soldiers 
tried to sell 10 million worth of heroin to needham who was 
posing as a buyer shooting broke out when the three resisted 
arrest the bureau claims 
but brig gen gerardo flores chief of staff of the philippine 
constabulary said his investigation showed the three were shot in 
the head at close range 
were cooperating with the philippine government on this 
situation said joe keefe another dea spokesman however he 
noted that there are no plans to return the three dea agents to 
that country to face the murder charges the united states and the 
philippines do not have an extradition treaty 
the dea is deciding whether to submit testimony to the 
commission in writing or whether depositions will be taken outside 
the philippines and sent to the panel dougherty said 
acting dea administrator terrence burke rejected the allegations 
of murder saying in a statement these charges have no merit 
the philippines government allows dea agents to carry firearms 
keefe said but he added none of the weapons was fired on that 
day 
two dea agents are normally assigned to the philippines but 
fenrich and his colleague jake fernandez were taken out of the 
country because of the july 10 events and no agents have been 
assigned to replace them keefe said the third agent philip 
needham was from the deas bangkok office 
we would like to emphasize that the dea agents were working at 
the request of the philippines government in cooperation with the 
national bureau of investigation keefe said 
the dea is in the philippines as guests of the host 
government we work under the conditions of that government that 
allows what we can do and cant do keefe said 
the philippines is considered a transshipment point for heroin 
as well as a new form of methamphetamine called ice and it is a 
source country for marijuana he said

the price of the best bargain in town doubled 
wednesday the roundtrip fare on the staten island ferry jumped to 
50 cents 
its worth 50 cents i think its a romantic ride said 
staten island resident stanley harrington one of the ferrys

transit operations in new york 
the halfhour excursion across busy new york harbor connects 
staten island and the southern tip of manhattan passing in front 
of the statue of liberty 
it was only the second time the city has raised the fare since 
taking the ferry over from the baltimore amp ohio railroad in 1905 
when the trip cost five cents each way in 1975 the fare went up 
to a quarter for a round trip paid in manhattan 
the city estimates the fare increase will bring in an extra 26 
million in revenues each round trip costs the city 348 per 
passenger said department of transportation spokesman joe deplasco 
the cost of ferrying a car remains 175 each way the driver 
and any passengers each pay the 50cent round trip fare

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday proposed to make it easier for handicapped people to gain 
advanced amateur radio licenses 
the commission by a 50 vote proposed that examiners be able 
to exempt mentally or physically impaired individuals who have 
extraordinary difficulty in passing highspeed morse code 
telegraphy proficiency tests 
currently amateur licensees must pass a written exam and 
demonstrate proficiency of five words per minute in morse code in 
order to gain a novice or technicians license 13 wpm for the 
general or advanced classes and 20 wpm for the amateur extra class 
the fcc proposed that applicants for higher classes could be 
exempted from the 13 wpm or 20 wpm exams if they have a doctors 
certificate stating they cannot pass the telegraphy exams and if 
they hold a current or renewable novice technician general or 
advanced class operators license 
international radio rules require a proficiency of 5 wpm or more 
in other 50 votes wednesday the fcc 
proposed establishing standards for conducting comparative 
renewal proceedings between cellular radio licensees and license 
challengers when existing lotteryawarded licenses begin to expire 
in 1993 the commission proposed weighting the process in favor of 
incumbents in the booming 3 billion cellular business 
opened an inquiry into setting standards for the possible 
introduction of digital audio radio services which would provide a 
compact disc quality sound better than todays am and fm 
broadcasts three applications are pending for such service 
extended its inquiry into possible changes in rules governing 
socalled television satellite stations which rebroadcast to small 
communities all or most of the programming of a parent station

security forces wednesday blocked about 
90 albanian refugees who wanted to march on the us embassy in 
paris to demand permission to go to the united states 
carrying personal belongings in plastic bags the albanians 
marched from the military camp at mourmelon where they have been 
staying since arriving in france two weeks ago 
we never had the intention of staying here said one 
refugee a 32yearold who identified himself only as arden 
weve already been in france too long weve asked in vain 
that a representative of the united states come see us he said 
now were going to paris 
the refugees were among 543 albanians who arrived in france by 
ferry july 15 after occupying embassies in the albanian capital of 
tirana thousands more went to italy west germany and other 
nations 
the refugees who marched wednesday included about 20 women and a 
handful of children they had hoped to walk 12 miles to the town of 
chalonssurmarne 90 miles east of paris and board a train to the 
capital 
but they were stopped after about four miles by soldiers from 
the military camp and about 15 police officers 
the soldiers passed out mineral water to the refugees under the 
crushing midafternoon sun as daniel rouhier a local official 
explained that the albanians could not expect to emigrate just by 
marching to the us embassy off the champselysees 
the refugees eventually boarded military buses and returned to 
the camp rouhier said they will be moved from the camp by aug 15 
to other shelters around france 
about 230 refugees are staying at the mourmelon camp 
to my knowledge none of these particular albanians has 
applied for a visa said us embassy spokesman paul kozelka in 
paris if they marched up to the gates i guess wed hand out 
application forms 
he said us officials have received no request through french 
officials to meet with the albanians 
washington would likely grant visas to albanians with immediate 
family members in the united states or to those who have studied 
there or worked for the us government kozelka said 
the refugees who arrived in france last month have been housed 
at three camps near paris and two in the southwest there they are 
supposed to learn french undergo medical tests and adjust to 
western life

twiceconvicted mass murderer juan 
coronas third bid for freedom was rejected wednesday after he told 
a parole board he doesnt remember committing 25 brutal machete 
slayings almost 20 years ago 
few crimes in the history of the united states have been as 
shocking to the public conscience said ron koenig chairman of 
the state board of prison terms panel in announcing the decision 
a psychological report prepared for the board said corona 56 
didnt appear to understand the motive for his crimes and 
therefore remains a danger to society 
the report said koenig indicates corona seems to be living 
in a world of his own and is extremely dangerous in an unstructured 
environment 
sutter county district attorney carl adams told the panel the 
report makes clear that mr corona is unpredictable and presents 
an unknown threat if released 
coronas lawyer had previously suggested the corona would use 
the hearing to take responsibility for the killings for the first 
time 
he was convicted of 25 murder counts for hacking slashing and 
clubbing farm laborers to death in 1971 and burying their bodies in 
sutter county orchards about 125 miles northeast of san francisco 
last week attorney don condren told the associated press his 
client might be planning to admit his role in the case corona has 
been criticized at past hearings for declining to speak in his own 
behalf 
lately corona has indicated he is going to be willing to talk 
about it condren said in an interview from his home while 
warning his client still might change his mind 
on wednesday when asked if he planned to confess corona said 
simply no i dont remember 
koenig asked corona how it felt to be convicted of something 
you say you did not do 
very bad corona said 
when the murders occurred they were the worst mass slaying in 
us history 
john wayne gacy jr on death row in illinois was convicted of 
more murders than anyone in the nations history he was sentenced 
to death for the murder of 33 young men and boys in 1980 
all but one of the corpses had the heads chopped open a search 
of coronas home turned up a machete with an 18inch blade a meat 
cleaver a doublebladed ax and a wooden club 
corona a farm labor contractor who preyed on itinerant workers 
and derelicts was first convicted in 1973 the conviction was 
overturned five years later when an appellate court ruled his 
defense had been inadequate 
the second trial in 1982 also ended in conviction at a cost of 
5 million his defense was based on a denial of his guilt and an 
attempt to blame the killings on a halfbrother now dead corona 
is serving 25 years to life on each murder count

convicted spy jonathan pollard as she arrived wednesday on a 
10week parole from a us prison to seek medical treatment in 
israel 
anne henderson pollard wearing a brown checked suit and 
clutching a bouquet of flowers at ben gurion airport appeared pale 
and tired as she thanked israelis who supported her while she was 
serving 2 years in a us prison 
authorities told her to maintain a low profile while in israel 
but the plight of the pollards has touched some israelis who have 
established the public committee for the pollards to work for their 
release 
committee chairman amnon dror said wednesday we think that a 
state which endangered a man who had helped them cannot abandon him 
when he gets caught

edna solodar a legislator from the leftofcenter labor party 
were among those welcoming her

of spying for israel

guilty to providing israel with documents about the military 
strengths of countries in the middle east 
ms pollard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to receive embezzled 
government property and being an accessory to possession of 
national defense doucments she was sentenced to five years in 
prison and was released this year 
israeli leaders said the pollards were part of an unauthorized 
renegade spy ring and refused to help them despite their pleas 
jonathan pollard who is in solitary confinement in a maximum 
security federal prison in marion ill filed for divorce last 
month citing irreconcilable differences 
ms pollard who is suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder 
said she hoped her marriage would be salvaged 
she was taken to hadassah hospital in jerusalem where she will 
receive treatment at no cost 
i am glad to be here in my natural homeland i thank you from 
the bottom of my heart for your emotional support over all these 
years ms pollard said in a short statement at the airport 
our history teaches us to learn from tragedy and to look for a 
brighter future i hope the day will come when both my husband and 
i will be free and back here in israel

the israeli communist party nearly toppled 
israels governing coalition wednesday on a technicality of 
parliamentary rules 
it took an impromptu filibuster and a scurry by hall messengers 
to save prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing governing 
coalition 
the vote was called unexpectedly by the communists to protest 
budget cuts that slashed basic food subsidies 
once the motion was read and the house speaker stood up to begin

room and liable to lose 
the 6weekold coalition commands only a narrow majority in the 
120member parliament and many of its supporters were absent 
they simply didnt notice that a vote was going to be taken so 
early one parliamentary aide said on condition of anonymity 
hall monitors were sent running to get absent legislators from 
the parliament dining rooms then to delay the vote finance 
minister yitzhak modai of likud got up to make an unscheduled 
speech in defense of his budget witnesses said 
when the vote was taken 10 minutes later shamir survived 
comfortably by a 63 to 48 showing with seven absent and two 
abstentions 
shamirs coalition government also easily defeated four other 
noconfidence motions that came to a vote later wednesday 
those leftwing motions were to protest the governments 
handling of a housing shortage fueled by an influx of soviet 
immigrants more than 2000 israeli families many evicted from 
apartments after rents were raised have pitched tent camps in 
parks around the country in the past month 
it is the second time shamir has faced noconfidence measures 
since his cabinet was installed on june 11

the social security administration said 
wednesday it has obtained the money needed to permit a full 
schedule of hearings on disability benefit appeals this fall and 
has cancelled plans to curtail some of them 
the agency said the office of management and budget has agreed 
to release about 5 million from a contingency fund to pay for all 
of the approximately 20000 appeals hearings conducted each month 
the hearings are held for people appealing decisions to deny or 
reduce social security disability benefits 
the social security administration had said tuesday it would 
schedule no new hearings involving expenses for travel or for 
medical or occupational experts for the rest of the fiscal year 
which ends september 30 
gwendolyn s king the commissioner of social security said no 
hearings would have been cancelled 
but she said she was disturbed at the unnecessary alarm that 
has been generated among some of the nations most vulnerable 
citizens because of incorrect reports that all appeals hearings 
had been suspended 
todays action should serve to once again assure the nearly 40 
million americans who receive social security benefits that this 
agency will continue to serve the public with great measures of 
both responsibility and compassion she said

dismissal along with his sister peggy ann both women were former 
defendants

when the first trial ended jan 18 buckeys mother was

tuesdays rerun of a roseanne episode the 
first since roseanne barrs screeched version of the national 
anthem had an 11 percent smaller audience than the show did the 
previous week 
an abc executive blamed the drop of nearly 15 million homes 
more on strong cbs competition than to viewer reaction to the 
stars national anthem antics at a san diego padres game last week 
i think it has more to do with the cbs movie doing a 22 
audience share share than a backlash against roseanne 
larry hyams abcs director of primetime audience research said 
after the ratings were released wednesday 
the national nielsen ratings for nbcs competing in the heat 
of the night also were down from the previous tuesday he said 
barrs antics in which she also grabbed at her crotch and spit 
on the ground drew the wrath of baseball fans and president bush 
alike 
her tuesday show averaged a 130 rating down from last 
tuesdays 146 still that was enough for the show to win its 
halfhour time period against other reruns on secondplace cbs and 
thirdplace nbc 
cbs repeat of a the second part of its 1987 miniseries 
murder ordained averaged an 114 rating against roseanne

marion barry has occasionally used cocaine 
his lawyer admitted wednesday during dramatic closing arguments in 
the mayors drug and perjury trial but he argued against 
conviction saying prosecutors had not proved barry used drugs at 
the specific times charged 
the prosecution portrayed a far different barry calling him a 
general in the war on drugs who betrayed the cause and was 
working with the other side 
the evidence is overwhelming that barry relied on friends 
who brought him cocaine because they wanted city jobs city 
contracts and the power that comes with knowing the mayor said 
assistant us attorney judith retchin 
barrys lawyer accused federal authorities of usin the 
equivalent of an illegal war weapon to catch him in the act of 
smoking crack cocaine in an fbi operation at a downtown hotel 
the danger of mustard gas which was the sting at the vista 
is that it cuts at the very fabric of our society said lawyer r 
kenneth mundy it might be mr barry today someone else 
tomorrow 
we do not intend to give you the impression for one moment 
that there was not occasional drug use by mr barry mundy said 
but he added that thats not what the case is about hes 
being tried for specific instances of alleged misconduct 
after court adjourned for the day mundy said he made the 
admission to show jurors the honesty of the defense the 
intelligence of the defense mundy will continue his closing 
argument thursday 
prosecutor retchin summarizing six weeks of trial testimony 
told the jury that barry used drugs in every quadrant of this 
city for years and wrapped himself in a web of deception to 
cover it up 
retchin said the fbi sting operation at the vista hotel was 
necessary in order to expose barrys drug use it resulted in the 
mayors arrest jan 18 after he was videotaped smoking fbisupplied 
crack cocaine in a hotel room 
some of you might question why there was an undercover 
operation like this retchin said to the jury she told them to 
imagine you were at war and heard allegations that the 
general was helping the other side 
barry denied he was involved with drugs in grand jury testimony 
and in public statements but the sting operation breaks the 
shield of secrecy said retchin 
the general was working with the other side that is what it 
comes down to she told the jury 
defense attorney mundy told the jurors i will start right 
from the beginning by telling you that mr barry used cocaine 
but he said the governments case was built around imprecise 
uncorroborated statements from witnesses persuaded to testify in 
order to ease their own legal difficulties 
the defense doesnt carry immunity in its briefcase said 
mundy we cant forgive people for things they have done only 
the government has that prerogative so were not playing on a 
level field 
retchin recounted testimony from 10 friends and associates of 
the mayor who said they saw barry use cocaine some 200 times from 
1983 through jan 18 
barry sat at the defense table looking pensive as retchin argued 
that he should be convicted on all 14 of the criminal charges 
against him his wife effi and his mother watched from the first 
row of spectators 
the jurors could look at three oversized prosecution charts 
displayed in the courtroom listing occasions places and times 
that witnesses said they sold or used drugs with barry 
barrys web of deception began to unravel when police 
investigated the mayors visits in december 1988 to the hotel room 
of barry associate charles lewis said retchin 
barry and lewis conspired to conceal their use of crack cocaine 
in lewiss hotel room and the mayor then waged the ultimate 
coverup by denying in front of a federal grand jury that he and 
lewis had exchanged drugs she said 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine 
possession three felony charges of lying to the grand jury and one

a controversial exhibit including explicit 
photographs by robert mapplethorpe opened wednesday as scores of 
placardtoting supporters and a handful of vastly outnumbered 
opponents staged competing demonstrations 
about 200 supporters chanting and carrying signs with such 
messages as no censorship began gathering at the institute for 
contemporary art around 830 am 
as dozens of patrons lined up to buy tickets an angry crowd of 
supporters surrounded one of six protesters opposing the exhibit 
that helped spark a nationwide debate on freedom of expression 
these people are trying to force their morality on the rest of 
us jim edgerley of the conservative american freedom coalition 
said as he stood among demonstrators patrons police and reporters 
on te museum steps 
while edgerley spoke two men deliberately stood in front of him 
locked in a deep passionate kiss 
see this is the kind of behavior this is promoting 
edgerley said 
beside them stood a man who identified himself as abe rybeck of 
the united fruit co theater group dressed in a black beehive wig 
leopard striped tights red tap shoes garter and short black 
camisole dress 
brandishing a fake microphone of tinsel and silver rybeck told 
the crowd robert mapplethorpe is exhibiting what is really going 
on in his community he is celebrating his life his friends his 
sex 
later the crowd drove edgerley away by surrounding him and 
chanting so loud reporters couldnt hear him 
less than an hour after the museum doors opened an estimated 
200 visitors were lined up outside said museum marketing assistant 
denise spencer 
some held tickets purchased in advance the small museum allowed 
just 75 people every half hour to view the 124 photographs taken by 
mapplethorpe from 1969 until shortly before he died of aids last 
year in boston at age 42 
eleanor bleakie 70 of cohasset and her friend margaret 
mooney 41 of chicago were among the first to get a look at the 
show 
id read a lot about it and i was curious said bleakie i 
went to see what was objectionable but i didnt find it 
objectionable i thought it was interesting 
i knew he was a good photographer but i didnt know he was 
that good said mooney i wanted to see how his talent measured 
up against all the hype 
she said she didnt mind the sexually explicit homoerotic 
pictures included in the exhibition they were off to the side so 
if you didnt want to look at them you didnt have to she said 
theyre part of life 
public television station wgbh which telecast the most 
explicit photographs on its newscast tuesday night said wednesday 
morning it had received 100 calls about the broadcast most of them 
supportive however several people said they were swearing off 
public television forever 
a coalition of 13 promapplethorpe groups promised not to 
demonstrate at the museum on tuesday but gay rights groups and 
individual activists were out in force wednesday 
the demonstrators included about 100 people from the gay rights 
group actup and the group freedom of expression who walked a 
picket line across from the museum 
many carried elaborate creations protesting sen jesse helms 
nc who has led the fight to restrict federal funds for art he 
branded obscene 
the creations included a twin bed with the faces of helms and 
adolf hitler nestled on the pillows and a fake coffin labeled 
casualties of censorship which contained such books as 
lolita by vladimir nabokov 
museum director david ross stood at the entrance wearing a 
button reading fear no art ross said he was unafraid of the 
controversy surrounding the show the show which runs through oct 
4 and is expected to draw at least 50000 people is the last of a 
sixcity tour 
a mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in june 1989 at the corcoran 
gallery of art in washington was canceled after helms objected 
helms protests prompted congress to limit national endowment 
for the arts grants before those limits the mapplethorpe tour had 
received about 30000 from the nea about 10 percent of the cost 
a showing in cincinnati led to obscenity charges against the 
director of the contemporary arts center but a federal judge 
barred police from confiscating photos from the exhibit

the two germanys on wednesday settled 
a fight on how to elect a united parliament but continued 
squabbling over whether east germany has enough money to pull its 
moribund economy into the capitalist arena 
west german government spokesman hans klein said the opposition 
social democrats agreed to an election plan allowing small east 
german parties to run on tickets with larger parties with which 
they are allied 
for example the german social union which is allied with the 
larger christian democrats could run on the same ticket 
this could improve the small parties chances of winning 
representation in parliament because each ticket will have to win 
at least 5 percent of the total vote to be represented in the 
united parliament 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere told reporters 
late wednesday that his coalition parties had also approved the 
plan 
the issue at one point threatened to derail the timetable of 
german unification as parties jockeyed for the most favorable 
conditions to improve their chances in the allgerman election dec 
2 
de maiziere said he expected the election law to be signed 
friday 
meanwhile east german finance minister walter romberg said 
wednesday his country needs a supplementary budget of 625 billion 
to 75 billion plus increased unemployment insurance 
more than 250000 east germans are unemployed and experts say 
that number could climb as high as 3 million as companies and 
factories succumb in the transition to a free market 
west germany has budgeted nearly 156 billion this year to 
cover east germanys deficit 
manfred carstens a top west german finance ministry official 
criticized east germanys request for more money as unserious and 
politically dishonest 
on tuesday east german labor minister regine hildebrandt said 
the country is burning and called for billions more in west 
german marks to help prop up the economy 
de maiziere went to austria on tuesday to meet with chancellor 
helmut kohl at his vacation retreat and discuss the economic crisis 
the masscirculation bild newspaper reported thursday that kohl 
pressed de maiziere to find more savings in his budget

threatens them with bankruptcy 
the chateauguay chamber of commerce sent a letter to mulroney 
and bourassa telling them to get personally involved in a speedy 
solution to the 3weekold impasse or face serious problems 
neither leader has taken a public role in dealing with the 
confrontation that arose from a land dispute leaving matters in 
the hands of aides 
does it take monster demonstrations effigy burnings or social 
unrest to get you to intervene the letter asked if it takes 
threats to get you to do your job consider this

following a municipal request for police to enforce a court order 
blame has not been established in the death mohawks say oka wants 
to expand a golf course onto ancestral land 
oka village council scuttled a federal plan to ease tensions 
when it decided tuesday night not to sell the federl government 
part of the disputed property the land would have become part of a 
new mohawk reserve 
we wont sign until the blockades come down mayor jean 
ouellette said after the conclusion of a stormy town meeting called 
to discuss the deal 
the federal government offered to pay for land that was slated 
for the golf course expansion and to pay compensation to the town 
for economic loss it earlier bought from a frenchman land marked 
for residential development 
ouellette initially recommended that the deal be accepted 
several residents at the meeting objected however when told that 
removal of the barricades would not be part of the deal 
if were ready to make a concession by selling the land why 
dont the mohawks put down the barricades and the guns said 
businessman bernard boivin 51 who led the attack on the proposal 
another local man guy dube added the people from oka are 
standing together and saying that to let the natives have the land 
without any concession on their part is something nobody will agree 
to 
in montreal a human rights expert said violations have been 
committed on both sides during the standoff 
jeanclaude fouque general secretary of the international 
federation of human rights said he wont lay blame in his 
preliminary report for the united nations a final report is 
expected in a month or two 
the federation based in paris is an independent coalition of 
human rights groups which investigates allegations of human rights 
abuses 
fouque said tuesday that the federation is mobilizing a task 
force of 24 international observers to help end the dispute

archeologists have unearthed a 2000yearold 
burial site containing 40000 pottery figurines in the ancient 
capital of xian said a report seen wednesday in beijing 
the site is estimated to contain more than five times the number 
of terracotta figurines found buried with the first chinese 
emperor qin shi huang di whose tomb is also in xian the xinmin 
evening news of shanghai reported tuesday 
the discovery of the ancient army of terracotta warriors 
guarding qins tomb was one of the great archaeological finds of 
modern times it has turned xian in western china into one of the 
countrys major tourist attractions

between 206 ad and 220 bc 
archaeologists have uncovered 11 pits the past two months the 
newspaper said each pit measures an average of 13 feet wide 23 
feet deep and dozens of yards long the newspaper said 
the more than 300 figurines excavated so far are all male naked 
and about 24 inches tall it said each was exquisitely crafted 
with smooth flowing lines and attention paid to such details as 
eyes eyebrows nose lips ears hairstyle and muscles it said 
experts believe that bits of silk cloth that were also found at 
the site indicate the figurines originally were clothed in silk 
but their costumes have disintegrated over 2000 years the 
newspaper said 
qins terracotta army was discovered by peasants from a local 
commune who were digging a new well to irrigate their parched soil 
in march 1974 following a winter drought 
hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit xian each year 
to see the museum built around the pits containing the colorfully

said wednesday he will remain at his post for at least two more 
years 
however he pledged loyalty to president violeta barrios de 
chamorro and vowed to depoliticize the army 
some conservatives have claimed mrs chamorros failure to 
replace the general brother of former president daniel ortega 
signals that the usbacked government has entered into a secret 
powersharing pact with the leftist sandinistas

now that she is supreme head of the army and acts within the 
frame of the constitution she will have the support of the 
military

professionalization of the armed forces and to make sure it becomes 
an institution independent of any party

position as head of the army

government took office after winning popular elections the new 
government then reached an accord to end the countrys 9yearold 
civil war with usbacked contra rebels

general who was the defense minister under the sandinistas would 
serve only temporarily

country they control key labor unions and the police in addition 
to the army sandinistainspired labor unrest has been one of the 
new governments biggest problems 
mrs chamorros own forces has been hobbled by defections many

president bushs son neil continues to 
disagree with regulators on key points in his savings and loan 
case in which he has been accused of conflict of interest 
documents released wednesday show 
bush 35 was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association a denverbased thrift which failed in december 1988 at 
a cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
in the two documents made public by the office of thrift 
supervision bush and the regulators said they disagreed on a 
number of significant points the key point of contention is 
whether bush adequately disclosed to silverado his business 
relationships with kenneth m good and bill l walters two big 
borrowers from the thrift 
on monday the ots released a document setting out the areas of 
agreement between bush and the regulators 
all of the documents contain information that was previously 
made public they have been submitted to administrative law judge 
daniel j davidson as part of the proceeding in the bush case bush 
has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on sept 25 in 
denver before davidson who will then make a recommendation to ots 
director timothy ryan 
in addition to the ots case the federal deposit insurance corp 
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against bush and other 
silverado directors 
bushs attorneys and the ots each submitted one of the two 
latest documents called statements of contested facts in his 
sevenpage paper bush contends that before he joined the silverado 
board he disclosed his relationships with good and walters to 
former silverado chairman michael wise other silverado managers 
the board of directors and the thrifts attorneys 
good and walters invested millions of dollars in bushs oil 
partnership jnb exploration co which drilled a number of dry 
holes in wyoming over two years and failed to become profitable as 
a director bush voted to approve some loans by silverado to good 
and walters but did not vote on others 
bush also asserts in his document that he made no agreement to 
abstain from votes involving loans to good or walters 
in its ninepage submission the ots says there is no 
evidence that a letter prepared by wise about bushs business 
dealings with the two men was actually sent the letter was 
addressed to silverados preferred shareholders and was accompanied 
by a cover memo to the directors the ots notes 
the document alleges that bush breached his duty to silverado 
shareholders when he voted to approve certain loans to good and 
walters five of those loans resulted in a combined loss to 
silverado of at least 46 million the ots says 
generally accepted standards of prudent operation require the 
disclosure of a thrift directors relationships with major 
customers of the institution when further transactions are under 
consideration the agencys document says

a generation ago the children of migrant 
farm workers rarely finished high school now many are part of an 
education program aimed at getting them to college 
we saw some of these kids that are talented they have the 
desire but college for them is another planet sai paula stoup 
a research specialist with the states migrant education program 
thirtytwo migrant students gathered for four days of workshops 
at allegheny college in northwestern pennsylvania this week to 
discuss career goals brush up on their writing and computer skills 
and improve their study habits 
the program reaches about 6000 migrant students in about 800 
schools across the state said director manuel recio it helps 
children who switch from school to school as their parents travel 
looking for work in the agriculture and fishing industries 
the students receive tutoring to help them catch up and can get 
help with language problems and cultural differences he said 
marilyn agosto 16 attended the program last year and returned 
this year to help other students for the past four years she has 
lived in toughkenamon a town about 20 miles west of philadelphia 
but before that she moved 14 times because her mother works in 
health care for migrants 
you get in a school and stay there a couple months and then 
you move to another school she said you get behind and your 
grades drop its hard to get caught up 
when the program began in the 1960s more than 95 percent of 
migrant students dropped out of high school recio said now about 
60 percent fail to graduate 
thats still very high but we never would have thought so 
many of them would get near to college he said 
state lawmakers heard from migrant students during an education 
hearing wednesday at the college to discuss increasing the 
programs budget 
when my father was growing up he had no hope in life he was 
on his own and there was no one to push him on to do anything 
said sandra ramos 16 from toughkenamon when i started four 
months ago to talk about college it shocked my family

a gene that may be carried by one out of 10 
people could make them more susceptible to lung cancer according 
to a study published wednesday 
theres only a suggestion that this gene exists said joan 
baileywilson if it does and a person with this gene smoked the 
risk of getting lung cancer would be increased tremendously 
it doesnt mean a person with this gene would automatically 
get lung cancer baileywilson said it would mean they are 
much more susceptible to environmental factors 
the scientists at louisiana state university medical center in 
new orleans have yet to confirm the genes existence but their 
survey of 4357 people strongly supported their theory the gene 
exists baileywilson said 
its not a wild theory or a guess pulled out of the air 
said the associate professor of biometry and genetics at this 
point its an educated hunch 
the findings were published in wednesdays journal of the 
national cancer institute 
the lsu research team was investigating why louisianas 
lungcancer death rates are among the highest in the nation and why 
lung cancer appears to cluster in some families 
the findings dont lessen the role environmental factors such 
as smoking are believed to play baileywilson said 
lifestyle is still a major factor she said if the gene 
is found it would still mean that 80 percent of the people who get 
lung cancer do so because of environmental factors 
the study predicts that most people who get cancer whether they 
have the gene or not are smokers baileywilson said gene 
carriers are more susceptible but it doesnt say at all that those 
who are carriers will get it or all of those who arent wont get 
it she said 
among the people interviewed who had lung cancer by the age of 
50 22 percent appeared to carry the gene baileywilson said 
the figure dropped to 10 percent among people who developed lung 
cancer before age 70 she said but by that time other cancer 
causers would have had more time to play a part 
once further research tracks down the gene to its spot on the 
chromosomes that determine heredity and determines how it works 
scientists should be able to develop tests to determine who carries 
it said robert c elston a professor of biometry and genetics who 
took part in the study 
if the research pans out physicians would be able to identify 
people at extremely high risk of developing lung cancer advise 
them and monitor them more closely baileywilson said 
success could also lead to more information on cancers and 
treating them she said 
positive identification of the gene is still years away she 
said the researchers are seeking federal funding to continue their 
work 
the scientists in 1976 began going over autopsies and death 
certificates in 10 south louisiana parishes to find lungcancer 
victims they then interviewed the 337 families of victims and 
found patterns of lung cancer said dr henry rothschild professor 
of medicine 
such clusters of cancer could be explained on the basis of a 
gene being passed down elston said 
the scientists have not gone beyond louisiana to determine how 
widespread the gene might be but there is no reason to think the 
figures would not be about the same nationally baileywilson said 
louisiana has a lungcancer rate 25 percent rate higher than the 
rest of the united states according to the louisiana cancer and 
lung trust fund 
about 3000 cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in louisiana 
this year and 2700 louisianians will die of it the american 
cancer society estimates nationally about 157000 cases will be 
diagnosed in 1990 and about 142000 americans will die 
lung cancer is the top killer among men and women the 
organization says with only a 5 percent survival rate

a man convicted of murdering his four children by 
driving the family station wagon into a river was sentenced to life 
in prison wednesday by a judge who suggested he might have 
preferred conviction on lesser charges 
lawrence delisle was convicted by a jury of four counts of 
firstdegree murder and one count of attempted murder the last 
because his wife suzanne also was in the car 
wayne county circuit judge robert colombo jr said he had no 
choice but to impose five life terms to be served concurrently he 
said the evidence proved beyond doubt the act was premeditated but 
suggested he would have preferred conviction of lesser charges 
i dont know if the defendant is guilty of the crimes of which 
he was convicted the judge said the jury could have convicted 
delisle of seconddegree murder negligent homicide or involuntary 
manslaughter 
witnesses testified delisle had complained that his family was a 
financial burden and once several years ago left the house with a 
candle burning by a leaky gas dryer 
frank eaman delisles courtappointed lawyer said he would 
seek a new trial and if that motion was rejected would ask the 
michigan court of appeals to overturn the convictions 
delisle was accused of deliberately driving his station wagon 
into the detroit river on aug 3 a989 supported by testimony from 
his wife delisle claimed a leg cramp and a faulty accelerator left 
him unable to control the car as it raced down a deadend street 
and through a barricade at the rivers edge 
jurors deliberated three days before convicting delisle on june 
21 of four counts of firstdegree murder and one of attempted 
murder 
delisle read a brief statement again proclaiming his innocence 
a fathers job is to protect his children and i failed he 
told colombo i panicked i froze that is my guilt not murder 
suzanne delisle told colombo she believed her husband was 
innocent as the survivor of an attempted murder she was allowed 
to address the judge under michigans victimsrights law 
the police werent there i was said mrs delisle who 
along with her husband was rescued by passing boaters after their 
car plunged into the river i know larry is innocent we will 
be together again 
judge colombo said he questioned his earlier rulings denying a 
change of venue in the highly publicized case the jury may have 
been subconsciously influenced by what they already knew about the 
case through the media he said 
deputies returned delisle to the wayne county jail where he 
would stay until being transferred probably thursday to the state 
prison of southern michigan near jackson sheriffs spokeswoman 
nancy mouradian said 
mrs delisle confronted outside the frank murphy hall of 
justice by a swarm of reporters and photographers shouted leave 
me alone enough is enough as two companions led her to a 
waiting car 
eaman told reporters he would ask for a new trial within six 
weeks he said he was surprised by the candor expressed by colombo 
before the sentencing and was encouraged by the doubts raised by 
the judge 
i dont think this case is over by a long shot eaman said 
wayne county prosecutor john ohair said he couldnt fault 
colombo for expressing anxiety over the case but he also said that 
most key rulings on evidence and the juryscreening process were 
heavily weighted in delisles favor 
from all reports ive had on the trial i believe the record 
made in the case is virtually unimpeachable ohair said i 
believe we have had as fair a trial as is possible in the criminal 
justice system 
the children bryan 8 melissa 4 kathryn 2 and emily 8 
months drowned as the family station wagon sank in 27 feet of

a un conference to promote 
breastfeeding denounced on wednesday the practice of distributing 
baby formula free to new mothers particularly those in developing 
nations 
the conference urged closer regulation of the marketing of baby 
formula to encourage breastfeeding which is considered a key to 
lowering infant mortality doctors said even mothers who have 
tested positive for the aids virus should breastfeed 
attainment of the goal demands vigorously defending 
against a bottlefeeding culture said a declaration on the third 
and final day of the conference the conference was led by the 
world health organization and unicef 
mothers milk helps boost a babys immunity and eliminates the 
need to use possibly contaminated water to prepare formula or other 
food 
un officials estimate that 4 million to 5 million children 
could be saved each year if they had been breastfed many deaths 
are caused by severe diarrhea infections 
an assistant directorgeneral of who hu chingli decried the 
situation in some poor countries in which companies provide baby 
formula free to new mothers who are capable of breastfeeding 
after beginning to bottlefeed her child in the hospital or clinic 
the mother continues to do so after going home but often does not 
have the money to buy the proper formula hu said 
such marketing violates a marketing code adopted by who in 1979 
un officials say only a few countries adhere to the code 
unicefs executive director james p grant said he hopes more 
nations will pledge to adopt the code when their leaders attend the 
world summit for children at the united nations in new york in 
september 
two formula makers carnation co a subsidiary of nestle and 
gerber which is producing a formula with bristolmyers have 
marketed their products directly to the public despite the 
objections of the academy which represents 39000 pediatricians 
however a spokesman said carnations marketing campaign which 
involved a few weeks of general consumer ads in the united 
states had been discontinued about 18 months ago 
he said the company did not consider that campaign to be direct 
marketing because the company was not identified in publicity 
promoting the use of infant formula we do not now nor have we 
directmarketed said dick curd a spokesman at carnation 
headquarters in los angeles 
nestle has been the target of a us consumer boycott for a 
decade because of its marketing of infant formulas in developing 
nations american home products another formulamaker marketing in 
developing nations also is being boycotted said howard bozich 
executive director of action for corporate accountability which 
monitors infantformula abuses 
eighteen other companies some from western europe and japan 
also sell formula in poor nations in violation of the who code he 
said 
the boycott against nestle ended after the company agreed in 
1984 to follow un marketing guidelines but it was renewed in 
1988 when consumer activists accused nestle of skirting the intent 
of the guidelines by encouraging some new mothers in developing 
countries to use formula even if they could breastfeed the 
company denied that charge 
who officials said the benefits of breastfeeding are so great 
that even mothers who tested positive during pregnancy for the hiv 
virus should nurse their children 
hu a chinese physician said the recommendation was based on 
research in many countries including those where there is a very 
high prevalence of aids when pressed he declined to elaborate 
saying the research included unpublished studies 
there have been cases of mothers apparently transmitting the hiv 
virus which causes aids to children through breast milk but it 
is rare and has not been used as a reason to discourage 
breastfeeding 
a study in june 1989 in the new england journal of medicine 
presented circumstantial evidence that breastfeeding may increase 
the aids risk for newborns the study directed by dr stephane 
blanche of necker hospital in paris found that among infected 
mothers aids infections were found in five of six infants who were 
breastfed compared with 25 of 99 who were not 
it cautioned that further studies are necessary before infants 
at risk in developing countries are deprived of the advantages of 
breastfeeding 
in the united states breastfeeding has declined about 1 
percent a year the past decade said dr antoinette eaton vice 
president of the american academy of pediatrics she said 
statistics show less than half of all mothers are still nursing 
their babies one month after birth

president bush prepared wednesday to defend 
his 1991 defense budget as house democrats savored the cuts they 
inflicted on the b2 bomber program and the strategic defense 
initiative 
i was out running at six this morning just because i was 
exhilarated rep ron dellums dcalif told reporters a few 
hours after the house armed services committee cut 24 billion from 
the 307 billion the president had requested for defense spending 
in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the administration began lobbying senate republicans to restore 
the cuts as the white house said bush would speak thursday on how 
he perceives the us defense budget 
the president is expected to call for a 25 percent reduction in 
military forces by the mid 1990s but wants to maintain support for 
the b2 and the strategic defense initiative according to 
administration and pentagon sources 
the president wants a rational builddown one source said 
bush was to make his remarks thursday in a speech in aspen colo 
on tuesday the house armed services committee voted to halt 
production of the b2 stealth bomber at the 15 planes under 
construction not the 75 bush had asked for at nearly 865 million 
each it is the costliest airplane ever built 
the committee on a bipartisan vote of 4012 also stripped 
nearly 2 billion from bushs request of 47 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars cut military personnel 
by 129500 and scaled back on two nuclear missile programs 
the vote left democrats on the panel with a heady feeling 
there was an image that we never met a weapons system we 
didnt like and that we would fund anything that they would bring 
over from the pentagon rep patricia schroeder dcolo said 
bush meanwhile went on the offensive 
spokesman roman popadiuk said the president will speak thursday 
in aspen colo where he will be meeting with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
bush will address how he perceives the us defense budget and 
us force structure in meeting the changing demands popadiuk 
said 
the speech to be delivered at the aspen institute will deal 
with defense aspects of us foreign policy the spokesman said 
meanwhile the senate appropriations subcommittee on military 
construction approved an 8 billion spending bill for fiscal 1991 
that slashes 210 million from bushs request for 420 million for 
the nato infrastructure fund 
the panel following the lead of the house on monday and the 
house armed services committee on tuesday also prohibited the use 
of us money from the fund for building a new base at crotone 
italy for the 401st tactical wing unless authorized by congress 
the wing of 72 f16 jet fighters must leave their current base 
in torrejon de ardoz spain 
acknowledging the house tradition of wholesale cuts in the 
defense budget the administration looked to the senate to salvage 
its major weapons programs 
the senate has approved a higher pentagon budget target for the 
new fiscal year 289 billion as compared to the houses 283 
billion the chamber moved late wednesday to bring to the floor the 
bill that emerged from its armed services committee 
the air force chief of staff gen michael dugan told a 
television interviewer i think that thoughtful men and women 
will come to the conclusion that if you want peace you have to 
prepare for war 
he predicted that congress will not stop the b2 program at the 
15 planes 
support for the plane is higher in the senate than in the house 
one staunch backer is the armed services chairman sen sam nunn 
dga 
in anticipation of senate action defense secretary dick cheney 
met with the chambers republicans on tuesday 
at the same time a july 26 letter from cheney began circulating 
on capitol hill in the letter to the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee john warner of virginia the 
secretary said the senate bill provides substantial resources for 
the b2 stealth bomber trident ballistic missile submarine small 
intercontinental ballistic missile and peacekeeperrail garrison 
programs 
his comments amounted to an endorsement of the committees 
decision to slash 16 billion the administration had sought to 
move the mx missile arsenal from silos to rail cars 
the panel left intact the 548 million the pentagon had 
requested for research and development on the multiplewarhead mx 
missile as well as 202 million for the singlewarhead midgetman 
missile 
in its bill the house panel eliminated all of the request for 
the mx and midgetman missiles and instead set up a 610 million 
strategic pot for the two weapons the panel also called on bush to 
decide in 90 days which missile he wants 
at the same time cheney noted the major shortcomings in 
the senate bill including a 1 billion cut in bushs request for 
sdi elimination of all funds for the milstar program of 
communications in the event of a nuclear war and cuts in the navys 
a12 aircraft 
i urge the senate to amend the bill to remove these concerns 
so that the final bill advances substantially the national 
interest cheney said

said nothing frowning slightly as a deputy sheriff led her away 
no one was prepared for that verdict gibson said he said 
he would appeal the decision 
assistant lake county prosecutor karen lawson said the verdict

eight people remain to be tried including mrs lundgrens 
40yearold husband jeffrey and their son damon 19 four others

portrayed her husband to others as a prophet who must be obeyed

because hed come up with these wildhaired plans all the time 
and he didnt carry through 
she said she wasnt at the farm during the killings she had 
been told by her husband to take her three other children shopping 
and that she was told about the slayings afterward by other cult 
members 
mrs lundgren also said her husband sometimes hit her and 
threatened her with a gun when she argued with him 
she said testified that she was afraid of her husband who based 
his ideas on his interpretation of scriptures

a judges ruling that forbade a woman 
from changing her last name without her husbands permission has 
been overturned 
however the superior court decision stopped short of barring 
the probate judge who issued the original ruling from doing so in 
the future 
the reversal is not surprising said steve brown 
executive director of rhode islands american civil liberties 
union superior court judge antonio almeida has simply recognized 
the very basic if obvious principle that women are no longer the 
chattel of their husbands 
im happy in one way but im uphappy because if another 
woman goes into his courtroom its possible that he could do 
this again lucille ann riccitelli said wednesday 
riccitelli 41 decided to resume using her maiden name when her 
father died suddenly with no sons her sister uses a hyphenated 
name she said 
she changed the name on her drivers license social security 
card and a bank account 
but fleet national bank refused to change the name on the bank 
account riccitelli held jointly with her mother without a court 
document substantiating the name change she said 
when probate court judge anthony b sciarretta learned 
riccitelli was married he told her to get her husbands consent 
she refused and he denied the namechange petition 
in march riccitelli represented by an aclu attorney appealed 
the ruling and also asked that sciarretta be forbidden from 
requiring a husbands permission in any future cases 
almeida in a brief opinion written friday and released 
wednesday formally changed riccitellis name 
under common law individuals have a right to change their 
name provided they do so with a nonfraudulent purpose almeida 
wrote since no fraudulent purpose exists on the part of the 
appellant the probate courts denial of said petition was in error 
and is hereby reversed 
he denied the motion preventing sciarretta from requiring a 
husbands consent in the future 
we are disappointed the judge did not go further brown 
said however i am hopeful that this will prompt judge 
sciarretta to rethink his anachronistic ways otherwise we will 
find ourselves back in court seeking future remedies 
sciarretta could not be reached for comment wednesday he was 
not at his home or office 
he said previously that he has a firm policy when there are 
family situations 
he said he feels spousal consent is needed if there is to be 
any integrity in the family unit 
riccitelli said the experience in which she was made to feel 
like a little girl has made her more aware of discrimination 
against women 
its a form of harassment that happened that opened my eyes in 
some ways she said i am really definitely more aware of 
things like that and i am willing to stand up for things much more 
easily 
riccitelli said she has started volunteering at the womens 
center of rhode island a shelter for abused women and their 
children

the senate warned that its public esteem had 
fallen to the level of used car dealers voted wednesday to 
hobble the money chase for campaign funds and to ban outside 
speaking fees 
democrats overrode longstanding republican objections to 
limiting how much candidates can spend to win office to pass by a 
5940 vote largely along party lines the first wholesale 
revamping of election laws since the watergate era 16 years ago 
the public is rapidly losing confidence in the federal 
election process said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine it is clear we have gotten to the point that the worst 
alternative is to do nothing 
south carolina sen ernest hollings who maintains a 
constitutional amendment is needed to address campaign reform was 
the only democrat to vote against the bill five republicans 
sens john mccain of arizona james jeffords of vermont william 
cohen of maine david durenberger of minnesota and larry pressler 
of south dakota supported the bill sen william armstrong 
rcolo absent with a heart ailment did not vote 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
immediate skepticism was raised as to whether the campaign 
reforms or the accompanying elimination of honoraria that now 
allows senators to keep thousands of dollars in speaking fees each 
year will clear several remaining hurdles including the renewed 
promise of a veto by president bush 
this bill clearly will not become law said sen mitch 
mcconnell rky mcconnell said he was told by white house chief of 
staff john sununu earlier wednedsday that bush would veto it it 
will be vetoed theres no doubt about it added sen don 
nickles rokla 
by a 7723 vote earlier wednesday the senate had voted to 
include in the bill sen christopher dodds amendment to ban 
pocketing of honoraria after jan 1 1990 and limit any other 
outside earned income to 15 percent of senate salaries the house 
voted a similar ban for its members last year 
when a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling 
and thats what it amounts to we denigrate ourselves said dodd 
dconn as public servants our salaries should come from the 
public alone 
in addition to the spending caps the reforms in the bill would 
abolish union corporate and trade association political action 
committees that accounted for onefourth of the 185 million spent 
on senate elections in 1988 
house leaders said they hoped to vote friday before lawmakers 
begin a fiveweek vacation on campaign finance reforms but they 
acknowledged that it might not happen because of widespread discord 
among democrats over its measures 
unlike their party colleagues in the senate house democrasts 
rejected calls to ban pacs which have overwhelmingly favored them 
over republicans in recent elections many also have voiced 
opposition that the proposed 550000 spending cap for house races 
is to low to cover both primary and general election challenges 
the senate bill would establish populationbased spending caps 
ranging from just under 2 million for senate candidates in the 
smallest states up to nearly 10 million for the largest 
california 
republicans called it a partisan charade to prevent 
republican challengers from raising enough money to overcome 
democratic incumbents name recognition advantage and deny the gop 
a chance to gain control of congress 
in my view the die is cast on this bill said senate gop 
leader bob dole of kansas expressing only scant optimism that 
maybe something will come out of all this unless theres some 
changes thats not going to be possible 
the bill would represent the first major change in election laws 
since congress passed the 1974 federal election campaign act in 
response to the watergate scandal and the resignation of president 
nixon because of it 
that law established both a taxpayer checkoff public financing 
mechanism and voluntary spending ceilings for presidential 
elections it also set spending ceilings on congressional races but 
they were overturned two years later by the supreme court as 
unconstitutional 
the senate bill would close loopholes in the 1974 law that 
allowed millionaires to make contributions in blocks of 100000 
through unregulated state party organizations to the campaigns of 
both bush and democrat michael dukakis in the last presidential 
election 
republicans after losing partyline votes to stop the practice 
said it still allows unions to spend millions of dollars of their 
members dues on voter registration and turnout 90 percent of it 
on behalf of democrats 
this campaign reform bill only reforms republicans 
complained dole we like reform but we dont want all of it 
its got to be shared

the measures chances also were complicated as the senate began 
piling other amendments onto it some of them likely to virtually 
eliminate any chance of twothirds vetoproof support 
for example after voting to give up the 27337 in honoraria 
they can now pocket the senate barely approved 5149 new york 
sen daniel moynihans proposal requiring members to forgo unearned 
income of more than 15 percent of their regular salaries 
that would be a hard blow to the senates many millionaires 
whose stock and interest incomes far exceed their government 
paychecks and had little problem voting to ban honoraria 
sen robert c byrd dwva said members of the senate 
himself among them had supplemented their salaries with more than 
9 million in honoraria over the past decade 
the scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on 
public service and raised public cynicism to an alltime high 
byrd said were about at the level of used car salesmen in the 
publics esteem 
the senate voted last week to denounce sen david durenberger 
rminn for violating several ethics standards including skirting 
the limits on honoraria in a bookpublishing deal 
the house vote last year to give up its members honoraria also 
boosted their salaries to 124000 reluctant to vote itself the 
same 25 percent pay boost the senate instead retained the 
opportunity for its members to accept specialinterest fees 
in 1989 senators accepted nearly 3 million in honoraria and 
kept more than 21 million with the balance donated to charity 
according to their financial disclosure forms

the ruling was issued by us district judge david kenyon who 
previously ruled that the layout of districts for the board of 
supervisors improperly deprived hispanics of political power in the 
nations most populous county 
kenyon ruled the board of supervisors conservative majority 
failed to redraw district boundaries 
he said the plan constitutes a nonsensical distortion of 
existing supervisorial districts a calloused interpretation of the 
voting rights act and is insensitive to the needs of hispanic and 
black residents 
the judge set a hearing for thursday to consider alternative 
plans proposed by civil rights groups and the us justice 
department the winners in a voting rights case against the county 
kenyon ruled june 7 the supervisors violated the federal voting 
rights act by conspiring in 1981 to draw district lines that 
preserved their incumbencies while diluting hispanic voting 
strength 
the lawsuit filed in august 1988 accused the supervisors of 
deliberately spreading the countys hispanic population across 
several districts when they changed voting boundaries after the 
1980 federal census 
though hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the countys 
87 million residents the fivemember board has not had an elected 
hispanic member in 115 years 
the boards conservatives responded to the ruling by drafting a 
plan that created a hispanic majority in one of the liberal board 
members districts while also preserving the conservative majority 
it was this plan that kenyon rejected wednesday 
attorney marc rosenbaum of the american civil liberties union 
one of the plaintiffs said the judges ruling sends a strong 
message to governments that think they can gerrymander away 
minority political clout 
their day is over said rosenbaum but those 
governmental bodies that respect the law adhere to the 
constitution and to the rights of minorities have nothing to 
fear 
the next redistricting plans to be submitted by the aclu the 
government and the mexican american legal defense and educational 
fund are aimed at creating a hispanic majority district but 
without an incumbent 
the plans could greatly increase hispanic political clout and 
overturn the conservative majority with possibly profound 
implications on future funding for such areas as health and social 
services programs 
conservative supervisor mike antonovich denounced the judges 
decision and vowed to fight it on appeal antonovich said the 
plaintiffs were simply trying to use the courts to upset the 
boards ideological complexion 
theyre doing that outside of the electoral process he said 
in defense of the current district boundaries antonovich 
pointed to the june election 
sarah flores a hispanic backed by conservative supervisors got 
the most votes for a seat opened by outgoing conservative 
supervisor peter schabarum and forced a runoff with superior court 
judge gregory obrien 
but plaintiffs have rejected antonovichs reasoning saying the 
ethnicity of a supervisor is not as important as who elects the 
supervisor kenyons decisions have put the outcome of the election 
in doubt

some editors are taking a close look at 
a doonesbury comic strip due out next week in which a character 
clad in nothing but rope utters provocative language 
frankly it didnt offend me but im thinking of all the 
people out there said jim hughes executive editor of the baton 
rouge morning advocate and state times 
the strip by gb trudeau features the character jj giving her 
rendition of performance art with a bucket over her head and 
nothing but rope covering her privates 
she speaks in fragmented sentences laced with words with sexual 
connotations such as lubricate and hot juices but doesnt 
make any direct reference to sex acts 
the way i read it its an attempt to show the lengths that 
the art community will go to thumb their noses at government 
grants said jack morrissey an associate editor at universal 
press syndicate the kansas city areabased company distributes the 
doonesbury strip to about 1000 newspapers 
trudeau appeared to be referring to controversy over national 
endowment of the arts funding some conservative politicians have 
tried to block government money going to artwork they consider 
obscene and several performance artists have lost their grants 
morrissey said several editors had called with questions about 
taste and the reason behind releasing the strip but no paper 
indicated that it would pull the comic next week he said 
hughes said he had his staff call other papers around the 
country wednesday to see whether they would run the strip which 
papers received this week and is scheduled for release from aug 6 
to aug 11 
hughes said his paper had yet to make a decision 
three of the papers contacted by hughes staff the kansas city 
star the los angeles times and the philadelphia inquirer said 
they examined the strip closely and decided to run it without 
alteration 
if you held it out the doonesbury people would get mad and 
if you run it i imagine some other people will get mad said joe 
mcguff vice president and editor of the star i just take that 
as a given 
bob duffy vice president of universal press said newspapers 
could choose to withhold the strip but he strongly discouraged 
editors from altering it for reasons of taste as papers have done 
to trudeaus comics in the past 
wed rather have them drop the strip than alter it he said 
thats always been our position but you cant police 1000 
newspapers

us factory productivity lagged behind all 
but one of the worlds major industrial countries last year and 
analysts blame the poor showing largely on the nations weak 
savings and investment rate that in turn holds down plant 
investment 
a labor department survey on the 11 richest industrial countries 
is a worrisome sign that americans standard of living wont 
increase dramatically any time soon private economists said 
tuesday 
in addition they said it shows that the nations economic 
clout may be slipping compared with such nations as japan and west 
germany 
it isnt the worst thing in the world if someone else is 
richer than you but since power tends to go with wealth this 
hurts our standing on the power curve said robert dederick

to amend the bill today to ban senators from accepting up to

winds of independence blown from the 
north by an 800yearold ghost incarnate are giving rome a few 
shivers 
northern politicians have revived the lombard league a 12th 
century alliance of autonomyloving cities that fought the 
oppression of the holy roman empire 
they want to remove lombardy the most productive part of italy 
from the grasp of a slowmoving taxeating notoriously 
inefficient central government 
rome was stunned this spring by the leagues strong showing in 
local elections it became the secondranked party in the region 
behind premier giulio andreottis christian democrats 
part of the lombard leagues popularity stems from northern 
resentment of rome for sending workers from the underdeveloped 
south for the past 40 years to deliver their mail teach their 
children and police their streets 
northerners have disdained some of those jobs particularly 
police work because of the low pay and high risk others jobs 
such as teaching are based on national competitions the 
northerners claim are weighted in favor of people from the south 
in addition many bureaucratic posts are political appointments 
and northerners say southerners get most of them 
the league wants to end a virtual opendoor policy that is 
bringing a tide of poor immigrants to italy most of the latest 
arrivals are poor from north africa and asia 
on a wall of the league headquarters in a workingclass 
district of milan is a poster showing a plump chicken whose golden 
eggs tumble into a basket held by a fat farmers wife as the 
league sees it the chicken is productive lombardy and the peasant 
woman a parasitic south 
lombard league newspapers denounce rome for they say using 
money from the north for wasteful development programs in the south 
hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into construction 
projects in the naples area after the 1980 earthquake there for 
example but thousands of people made homeless by the disaster 
still live in makeshift housing 
sen umberto bossi said in an interview the party wants italy to 
become a federalist state with the central governments role 
limited to defense foreign policy taxes and some judicial matters 
bossi league president and its only member of parliament looks 
to switzerland lombardys neighbor across the alps as a model 
many lombards say they identify more with the rest of europe 
than with italy whose international image often is that of the 
south 
soccer may well be countrys strongest bond but northsouth 
bitterness emerged even during the world cup competition italy 
hosted this summer 
argentine soccer star diego maradona who plays for naples 
during the regular season was booed for trying to get his fans to 
root for argentina when it played the italian national team in 
naples he was accused of exploiting northsouth hatreds 
i never said that the neapolitans should root for argentina 
he said later i just made a few observations like the 
banners in verona when naples played there that said wash 
yourselves and welcome to italy 
charges that the league is racist make some northerners cautious 
in expressing sympathy for the party bossi rejects the racist 
label 
i didnt vote for the league but some of my friends did 
said claudio tarini on the train ride home to milan from rome 
where he had spent two days dealing with the bureaucracy to obtain 
the necessary permits for a business trip to nigeria 
while racism undoubtedly motivated some to vote for the league 
tarini said public disgust with rome was the principal reason for 
the election success 
as a newspaper columnist wrote in describing the average 
citizens entanglements with clerks and paperwork to meet ordinary 
requirements of daily life will i have to vote for the league to 
get a drivers license 
the column appeared in la stampa a national daily based in 
turin capital of the piedmont which borders lombardy and has its 
own regional party 
bossi says the league will begin collecting signatures in 
september to force a referendum on a law that allowed tens of 
thousands of third world immigrants to stay in italy 
after his election to the senate in 1987 bossi sponsored a bill 
that stopped the practice of sending convicted mafiosi from the 
south to internal exile in northern towns

at a park that was twice the worlds fair 
grounds amid softball games and bicycles under the vapor trails 
of thundering airliners hundreds convene each week to seek the 
virgin mary 
they are certain she is here in flushing meadows park they 
have assembled for 20 years since june 18 1970 when veronica 
lueken a housewife and mother of five first said she saw mary at 
a church in bayside queens 
the roman catholic church is not convinced but believers insist 
they are witnesses to a continuing miracle 
it increases our faith said kathy anderson a long island 
mother of four who attends with her husband a computer consultant 
we truly believe that jesus and the blessed mother are here this 
is the most important marian shrine of our day 
linda bonas 30 a brooklyn teacher looked around at the 500 or 
so worshippers reciting the rosary on a recent sunday and said 
if everything was happy and was doing well around the world you 
wouldnt have too many people here most of them realize theres 
something missing 
mrs lueken claims the apparitions tell her that unless we mend 
our sinning ways the world will be destroyed by comets 
earthquakes world war iii and other disasters 
but she rarely attends services she has had heart and 
gallbladder surgery and suffers from high blood pressure back pain 
and ringing in the ears her followers call her a victim soul 
one who suffers in exchange for blessings 
word of her first vision at st robert bellarmine roman catholic 
church spread quickly in 1975 she was barred from holding vigils 
there the crowds were too big 
police offered to let them meet at flushing meadows where the 
vatican pavilion stood during the 196465 worlds fair pope paul 
vi had blessed the site marked by a stone wall on a grassy field 
mrs lueken says the visions moved there from the church 
it seems an unlikely place for a miracle amid soccer and 
softball games joggers and bicyclists traffic drones from nearby 
expressways and jets roar overhead to and from la guardia airport 
sometimes drowning out the prayers 
worshippers bring a statue of the madonna each week and adorn it 
with roses the flowers believed blessed by the virgin during 
services are then given to the crowd 
frank derosa spokesman for the roman catholic diocese of 
brooklyn which oversees queens said no credibility can be given 
to the claims of apparitions at the site of the vigils the diocese 
does not believe that anything of an incredible or miraculous 
nature is happening there we discourage people from coming to 
attend the vigils 
michael mangan director of our lady of the roses mary help of 
mothers the official name for mrs luekens followers says the 
dioceses failure to certify the miracle is par for the course 
when it comes to the church and their involvement and assessment of 
apparitions 
he said the groups name came to mrs lueken in a message from 
mary 
roses as our lady explained is natures purest flower a 
symbol of perfection said mangan mary help of mothers is 
because many mothers are worried about their children today 
the group claims 60000 believers worldwide 
on a recent sunday peter livsack 63 came on a chartered bus 
from philadelphia like many others he brought a polaroid camera 
and snapped pictures of the madonna he said would become 
miraculous photos livsack says he often notices squiggles 
shadows and patches of light on the pictures when he gets home 
he believes these are messages from god resembling doves 
initials and faces of saints see the mouth see the eye right 
in the branches of the trees he asks 
many of the messages mrs lueken receives are predictions of 
doom gods punishment for mans rejection of him mangan 
says civilization has always been punished or ended when the 
moral decadence and sins has reached its peak 
but he added the virgin mary like a true mother has love 
for her children and shes coming to warn us to mend our ways and 
turn back to pray the holy rosary and practice the roman catholic 
faith 
mangan one of 15 fulltime employees says bills are paid 
through unsolicited donations requests for money are never 
made at the services and are not common in the groups literature 
our lady just gives enough to provide for her work he said 
the organization describes its history and mrs luekens 
messages in booklets videotapes radio and cable television shows 
aired around the country and even in advertisements on the subway 
were using the latest technology and modern means to 
propagate this message said mangan anything to inform these 
desperate souls out there

it used to be an article of republican faith 
the more taxing and spending that can be shifted out of washington 
to local and state governments the better 
that tenet now seems subject to revision to fit the federal 
deficit crunch as governors and local officials see it the new 
version shifts spending all right but then proposes tax changes 
that would undercut their ability to raise their own revenues 
at the long lagging negotiations on an elusive deal to trim the 
169 projected budget deficit republicans produced a plan that 
included a new ceiling on federal tax deductions for state and 
local income taxes it also would sharply increase the federal tax 
on beer and wine as part of a package of 54 billion in spending 
cuts and revenue increases 
the federal tax deduction for state income taxes would be 
limited to 10000 a year and most of the estimated 3 billion it 
would produce would come from taxpayers making 100000 a year or 
more 
so some congressional republicans said the plan the 
administration floated but never really disclosed should 
satisfy democrats who insist that upper income americans pay most 
of the tax cost of deficit control 
it didnt and it ran headon into the opposition of governors 
of both political parties in mobile ala for their annual 
conference which ended tuesday after raising the volume of their 
usually scattered protests 
the governors already are facing tax woes of their own 36 
states are electing governors this year and where incumbents are in 
jeopardy its usually over increased taxes 
state taxes generally have increased during the past decade 
under a conservative republican administration that has trimmed 
federal aid that worked in boom times but it is a worsening 
problem in a slowing economy 
democratic governors circulated a letter demanding that 
president bush drop the tax idea they said it would impose a 
double tax in the states that have done the most to deal with their 
own financial problems and would make it tougher for the states to 
increase their own revenues 
there are income taxes in 44 states and local income taxes are 
levied in 11 of them 
along with the impact governors feared the precedent 
gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina a republican 
usually allied with the administration said the idea of a 
deduction limit was ominous 
once that ceiling was in place lowering it would be a tempting 
way to come up with future federal tax increases about onethird 
of all the itemized deductions on federal tax returns are for state 
and local income taxes 
deductions for state sales taxes were phased out as part of the 
1986 tax overhaul 
bush has not acknowledged administration authorship of the tax 
plan the refrain at the white house is that everything is still on 
the table thats what john h sununu the chief of staff told the 
governors on sunday he also said the proposal wasnt what the 
president would prefer 
but it was put together by bushs budget director and it 
appears that the president would prefer it to a straight increase 
in the federal income tax rate for the wealthiest taxpayers under 
current law middle and upper income taxpayers pay 33 percent on 
family incomes over about 186000 the rate dips back to 28 
percent 
despite that white house wariness senate republican leader bob 
dole said weve laid out a specific plan and were still 
waiting to hear from the democrats 
but the democrats were in no hurry to talk taxes they always 
wanted the republicans to go first 
and congressional republicans looking toward the nov 6 
elections complained they were taking a beating

in just nine months the roman 
catholic bishop has excommunicated two abortion clinic employees 
the sheriff has prayed on the sidewalk while police pulled his wife 
and other antiabortion protesters from a clinic doorway and 
petitioners succeeded in forcing a vote on a city charter amendment 
that would declare human life begins at conception 
the holy spirit is doing something in corpus christi says 
rex moses the man inspiring much of the antiabortion activity 
i think its happening because god has picked corpus christi as a 
beachhead 
his opponents say its moses not god who picked corpus 
christi which is latin for body of christ 
i think rex moses targeted the city said amanda stukenberg 
president of south texans for choice an abortion rights group i 
think the name itself helped make it a battleground 
moses might agree all names are significant he said 
noting that reporters often ask him if moses really is his name 
because it all seems to improbable 
god matched this person with that name he said 
it was in november that moses 35 brought his antiabortion 
crusade from austin to this gulf coast city of nearly 300000 
which is predominantly catholic and hispanic 
moses said he formed body of christ rescue after losing the 
support of religious leaders in austin he was convicted three 
times there of criminal trespassing for blocking access to womens 
services clinics with his austin rescue group 
moses has appealed a years worth of jail sentences but said he 
expects hell eventually have to serve the time he asserts that 
trespassing is not illegal if the trespasser is trying to save the 
unborn from imminent harm 
one of moses first actions upon arriving in corpus christi was 
a rescue twelve people were arrested for trying to keep 
patients and staff out of one of the citys two clinics where a 
total of about 3000 abortions were performed last year 
but moses wasnt arrested then nor in the other 18 local clinic 
blockades in which he has participated and police have arrested 
only a handful of his protesters 
police chief henry garrett said only those who assault police 
officers or force their way into the clinics will be taken into 
custody mass arrests would only give the protesters more 
publicity he said 
the police chief said he does not foresee having to arrest 
sheriff jim hickey or hickeys wife jan two staunch moses allies 
hickey surprised visitors to the sheriffs department earlier 
this year with moses posters featuring a photograph of a 
decapitated fetus and the caption legal abortion kills baby 
boy 
hickey wont send deputies to help police clear access to the 
clinics saying i would be aiding in murder of babies if i did 
the catholic sheriff credits moses with inspiring him and others 
in the city to get more involved in the antiabortion movement 
tracy cassidy chairwoman of the human family committee which 
sponsored the petition drive to force the vote next jan 19 on the 
city charter amendment is another moses ally she said she knows 
adding a preamble to the charter would have no legal weight but 
we will be making a statement as a community that we respect 
human life in all stages 
the declaration states in part that human life begins at 
conception and extends to the moment of natural death 
south texans for choice will fight it 
statements about ones philosophies or religious beliefs do 
not belong in the city charter ms stukenberg said 
moses helped promote a religious coalition that is directing 
its congregations how to vote on a secular political document 
she said 
rachel vargas one of the corpus christi residents 
excommunicated by bishop rene gracida also blames moses for the 
steppedup antiabortion activism 
ms vargas links her excommunication to a statement she gave 
last december during a mosesorganized rescue when she told a 
local catholic newspaper that she was a prochoice catholic 
she said she believes more contraception would reduce the number 
of abortions and that god breathes life into a baby at the moment 
of birth moses and many of his followers oppose all forms of 
artificial birth control 
gracida certainly had to make an example out of me since i 
publicly stated that i am a prochoice catholic said ms vargas 
who cried during an interview six weeks after her june 
excommunication which deprives her of church sacraments including 
communion 
someone had to be a scapegoat she said 
dr eduardo aquino an obstetrician also received an 
excommunication decree from the bishop earlier this year 
elva bustamante director of the new womens clinic where aquino 
performs abortions twice a week has received two warning letters 
from the bishop but no final decree she sent the bishop a letter 
last month telling him she would not quit her job as he had 
demanded 
church law states that those participating in abortions 
automatically excommunicate themselves with or without an official 
decree from a bishop 
moses devoted his life to the antiabortion cause shortly after 
converting from what he calls fundamentalist quasipentecostal 
beliefs to catholicism in 1988 
he gave away most of his possessions he said quit his 
200000ayear job designing pension plans and sold his share of 
the company for 1 he got rid of his assets in anticipation of the 
lawsuits he believed would follow his protests he said 
he now owes more than 1 million in judgments to an austin 
clinic and an austin police officer injured while trying to lift a 
300pound protester 
he said he his wife and their four children survive on 
occasional cash and food donations and his office space and duplex 
are leased from former city councilman cliff zarsky a longtime 
abortion foe 
moses contends his activities here have left the city with far 
fewer doctors willing to perform abortions and ms vargas also 
believes that many local prominent prochoice figures now are 
afraid to speak out 
but not all members of the religious community even those 
opposed to abortion support his tactics moses concedes they cite 
the biblical instruction to obey the laws of the land 
the guy who wrote that was in jail when he wrote that moses 
responds referring to apostle paul if a lot of people agreed 
with what i am doing i wouldnt have to be doing it

philip jones griffiths a photographer who spent 
three years covering the vietnam war took a trip down memory lane 
last year but he did it the hard way on remnants of the ho chi 
minh trail 
when he first saw what once had been north vietnams famous 
muchbombed main supply route south he suffered a bit of 
photographers regret 
i suppose what i was thinking is that i should have been here 
20 years ago the photographers instinct is to say ive been 
cheated i should have been here 
his ho chi minh trail expedition filmed for the bbcs 
great journeys series bought by 61 public tv stations will 
start airing later this month aug 11 here and from aug 13 to 16 
in other cities 
the ho chi minh trail was far more than a trail it was a 
network of trails dirt roads and river crossings mostly covered 
by jungle that stretched south for 200 to 300 miles into laos 
cambodia and south vietnam 
it was heavily bombed by us warplanes and periodically 
infiltrated by us army special forces troops but few western 
journalists ever traveled it during the war 
no doubt puzzled officials in hanoi last year gave griffiths 
and his camera crew permission to film what it looks like now at 
least those portions still passable in the sovietmade jeep they 
loaned him along with a guide 
as youd expect it was tough trip says the 54yearold 
photographer 
large chunks of the oncebustling trail have been reclaimed by 
the jungle and once you stop upkeeping a road like that it 
disappears very quickly so our biggest task was actually finding 
it 
occasionally youd find what looked like a hopeful bit of 
road but after half a mile there would be so many old bomb 
craters that no vehicle on earth could traverse them they were too 
close together 
griffiths got to travel only the trails vietnam side his 
attempt to follow it through laos starting at what once was a 
major wartime entry point called the mu gia pass was blocked by 
guards 
it wasnt just because the trail was washed out he says 
the laotians wouldnt let us go in they try to maintain a 
little independence from the vietnamese so they were anxious that 
it wouldnt seem they were being ordered to let us in 
but he doubts that the trail network through laos exists 
anymore although he concedes theres no real way of finding 
out without laotian permission 
the welshborn griffiths whose documentary is liberally filled 
with north vietnamese wartime footage of the trail only got as far 
as vietnams central highlands before his expedition ended 
the reason the continuing war in cambodia in which soldiers who 
include the khmer rouge are fighting those of the vietnambacked 
government 
we couldnt get too close to the border at times because when 
you start coming around the edge of cambodia the vietnamese began 
getting worried about the khmer rouge he says 
griffiths took a philosophical attitude about the possibility 
that the cambodian communist forces might have crossed the border 
and mined parts of the road on which he was able to travel 
my feeling is that the bits the vietnamese kept in repair were 
pretty welltraveled and if the khmer rouge had ever boobytrapped 
them they certainly werent going to tell me about it he says 
the early part of his tour took him through what once was the 
socalled demilitarized zone between north and south vietnam then 
past two famous battlefields khe sanh and the a shau valley 
he spent one night in the latter which in may 1969 was the 
scene of the bloody controversial battle for what us troops 
called hamburger hill 
theres sort of a peoples committee building on the valley 
floor right opposite hamburger hill griffiths says you sit on 
the balcony in the evening and you look at hamburger hill 
it just looks so peaceful and green now thats one of the 
disappointing things about old battlefields they dont look like 
old battlefields

in much of rural america a boost in monthly 
social security checks is more important than an increase in 
soybean prices or a few new jobs at the local broom factory 
transfer payments such as social security are a large and 
growing source of income in nonmetro areas says a report by the 
agriculture department from 1969 to 1987 transfers grew from 
116 percent to 187 percent of nonmetro income 
transfer payments also include retirement and disability 
benefits medical benefits welfare food stamps unemployment 
insurance veterans benefits and various other benefits 
such transfers have a stabilizing effect on rural economies 
the report said recipients continue to receive income from the 
programs even when employment and earnings fall during 
recessions 
in 1987 when transfer payments made up 187 percent or 1870 
of every 100 in rural income the urban rate was only 137 percent 
the report was written by robert a hoppe and linda m ghelfi of 
the departments economic research service and was included in a 
recent issue of rural development perspectives magazine 
big development programs to boost business and industrial 
enterprises have had a lot of attention over the years federal 
grants loan guarantees and similar aid are staple fare when 
congress talks about rural development 
a financially healthy agricultural sector also is looked upon as 
one way of enhancing the rural economy 
while all of these are important the study by hoppe and ghelfi 
shows that social security and the other transfer payments are 
making a valuable imprint of their own 
since 1969 the report said wider eligibility and increased 
payment levels occurred in a number of programs in 1973 for 
example medicare began to cover disabled people under the social 
security and railroad retirement programs 
food stamps existed in less than half the nations 3000 
counties in 1969 by july 1974 all counties were required to offer 
them to lowincome families 
finally people 65 and older are a growing proportion of the 
total population particularly in nonmetro areas the report 
said 
the report said 475 rural counties have a high share of 
their incomes from transfer payments those range from 123 percent 
in clay county ill to 258 percent in mcdowell county wva 
highshare counties were said to be concentrated in 
appalachia including west virginia virginia kentucky and 
tennessee 
ozarkouachita area of missouri arkansas and oklahoma 
other scattered areas of the south 
upper great lakes region of northern michigan wisconsin and 
minnesota 
various areas scattered throughout the west 
these counties are highly dependent upon retirement and 
disability income because earnings per job are generally low or 
because elderly residents constitute a high proportion of total 
population the report said 
in 1986 for example earnings per job averaged 13668 in the 
highshare counties compared with 15188 in all the nonmetro 
counties 
not only do transfer payments help buffer against the effects of 
recession on local economies the elderly and welfare recipients 
tend to spend their money at home 
this spending provides local retailers with a stable consumer 
base that helps them survive recessions when the newly unemployed 
reduce their purchases the report said 
some rural development specialists even advocate attracting 
older people because retirees can bring large amounts of transfer 
income with them and tend to spend their income locally 
there are practical limits to all this however building a 
local economy on social security checks and other benefits can have 
some pitfalls 
local business and government leaders in areas heavily 
dependent on transfers should try to keep abreast of proposed 
program changes that could alter transfer payments the report 
said retirement and disability programs in particular should 
be monitored closely 
the analysis said a continued commitment by society to support 
social security will be especially important since it alone pays 
about threequarters of all retirement and disability benefits 
relying on the transfer income of the elderly then can be a 
viable shortrun development strategy the report said but in 
the longrun the transfer income of the elderly may not be a rural 
development panacea

rocky flats makes plutonium triggers for 
nuclear warheads but for years it also has produced nightmares 
there have been breaches of security there have been radiation 
leaks alarms meant to warn of impending nuclear accidents have 
failed to work 
for now plutonium production has been halted at the plant 
which is 16 miles west of denver and one study says it will take 
five years and 150 million to fix only the more pressing of rocky 
flats problems critics say it could take billions of dollars and 
20 years to completely clean up hazardous residues 
i think people should be concerned that were operating 
safely said phil warner the plants new general manager this 
plant is no more dangerous than any other large manufacturing 
operation but the materials are dangerous stuff unless you do a 
good job 
people ought to make sure were doing a good job he said 
i would 
federal officials ordered the halt in plutonium processing last 
november after being shocked by the unsafe conditions they found 
egampg inc was named the new manager of the governmentowned plant 
at the beginning of the year and its executives say things were 
even worse than they expected 
among the most serious problems cited 
many alarms do not work and wiring of the system was not 
documented properly the alarm system is tied to the public address 
system which often does not work the problem is so serious that 
in the event of a runaway nuclear reaction the proper emergency 
teams might not be alerted 
crucial equipment especially pipes and holding tanks is more 
than 30 years old and workers fear gaskets will leak when 
production resumes dams are being built inside the plant to 
contain any leaks 
glove boxes in which the warhead triggers are fabricated have 
cracked glass that could release plutonium into the air other 
glove boxes lack drains for water if water builds up over a few 
inches it could cause an uncontrolled fission reaction the 
resulting flash of radiation would kill anyone within 15 feet 
instantly and injure people up to 70 feet away 
monitoring devices have failed allowing plutonium to be 
tracked from the plant on workers shoes decontamination teams had 
to trace workers routes off the grounds including into denver to 
determine where they tracked the toxic metal 
other problems included the lack of a single onsite 
environmental executive and the need for paving a parking lot 
apparently to reduce windblown dust that potentially could carry 
radioactivity off the grounds 
in addition investigators said soil groundwater and a sewage 
treatment plant are contaminated with hazardous waste residents of 
the area fear contaminated water has seeped into their groundwater 
supplies 
then this summer federal investigators found they could breach 
part of the security system intended to prevent theft of highly 
radioactive plutonium the government suspended the handling of all 
radioactive materials although officials said other security 
measures prevented any plutonium being smuggled off the grounds 
in late july the department of energy announced the 150 
million price tag for the partial cleanup at the 130building 
complex in the foothills of the rockies officials said it will be 
at least several months before egampg can meet conditions for 
resuming plutonium production 
the plant which was hit by near disastrous fires in 1957 and 
1969 and blamed for radioactive contamination outside the site 
because of improper dumping is the nations sole producer of 
plutonium triggers without the triggers the deployment of missile 
submarines and landbased missiles could be affected because 
warheads have to be replaced periodically 
executives government officials and plant workers say the 
problems of the facility which opened in 1951 are serious 
however they say egampg and energy secretary james watkins are 
serious about cleaning them up 
dave simonson deputy plant manager for the energy department 
says 60 percent of the production problems should be fixed by the 
end of the year and the rest within five years 
critics say they welcome egampg as manager but they are 
withholding judgment on its promises to devote more effort to 
safety 
weve had these changes of heart repeatedly i take it with a 
grain of salt said dr edward a martell a scientist 
specializing in cell radiation damage at the national center for 
atmospheric research in boulder colo 
rockwell international corp which operated the plant from 1975 
through last year defends its stewardship jeff charney a 
rockwell spokesman blamed the federal government for not providing 
enough money to deal with the problems 
but rep david skaggs dcolo who represents the district in 
which rocky flats is located said more than 100 safety problems 
were identified before plutonium processing was halted including 
some so serious they had a potential for causing a severe injury 
or fatality potentially fatal occupational illness or loss of the 
facility 
safety inspectors called in by the federal government said the 
plant had been lucky no major nuclear accident occurred 
its pretty sad when were reduced to relying on luck while 
running a major nuclear facility skaggs said 
gov roy romer who often had a stormy relationship with the 
plant over safety and nuclear waste storage praises egampg but says 
the plant should be moved from the populous denver region 
i have to believe there is no way you can allow something to 
exist on the metropolitan borders that will endanger its 
citizens he said 
warner thinks the plant will be here 20 to 30 years more and 
says the important thing is to get it working safely 
egampg launched an extensive effort to retrain all 5990 employees 
at the plant gary francis director of performance based training 
said many of the workers handling plutonium didnt even know what 
they were working with 
what we found was a variety of training he said we had 
to go back to some of the basics to give them an understanding of 
radiation and the principles involved a lot of basic things they 
were not presented they were taught what but not why 
ted tegler who helped clean up after a 1969 fire that nearly 
resulted in a runaway nuclear reaction and whose body now is 
contaminated with 13 percent of the lifetime allowable dose of 
plutonium said production often took precedence over safety at the 
plant but the attitude of managers has changed he said and 
workers are pleased 
theyre taking a strong line on safety they want to know 
about problems he said before people were harassed and 
labeled a troublemaker but that has changed significantly 
as a result employees flooded a hot line set up for workers 
safety complaints alerting officials to the vast array of problems 
when egampg moved in we werent pleased with what we saw minor 
levels of contamination were accepted as routine said joe 
majestic director of health and safety at the plant 
that has all changed he said if we find contamination from a 
routine survey above the level allowed for free access by anyone to 
that area we now report that as an occurrence and we work to find 
it and fix it 
we need to learn from our past and do a better job in the 
future he said

the products of the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant are euphemistically called triggers or pits 
but actually theyre the components for softballsize atomic 
bombs used to jumpstart the fusion reaction in a nuclear warhead 
rocky flats triggers go into the 25000 nuclear warheads in the 
united states arsenal the warheads which must be replaced 
periodically because plutonium decays are assembled at the pantex 
nuclear weapons plant in amarillo texas 
some of the plutonium used at rocky flats comes from aging 
nuclear warheads other plutonium comes from nuclear reactors 
at rocky flats high amounts of electricity or acid baths are 
used to melt or separate the plutonium from other elements the 
metal is packaged into disks which then are machined and formed 
into balls that become the heart of a nuclear weapon 
the actual shape of the trigger is a secret because some 
geometric shapes produce better explosions than others 
the triggers are shipped to texas where pantex workers attach 
highspeed explosives designed to detonate instantaneously causing 
an inward blast without simultaneous detonation the plutonium 
would simply explode scattering radiation but causing no atomic 
reaction 
the plutonium and explosives are placed near a core of hydrogen 
in an atomic explosion the plutonium undergoes fission its atoms 
splitting in a chain reaction that creates extremely high 
temperatures which ignite a source of neturons such as 
plutoniumberyllium the neutron source then sets off a combination 
of deuterium and tritium fusing hydrogen and setting off a 
reaction similar to that which powers the sun 
the power of a hydrogen warhead is measured in megatons the 
explosive force of a million tons of tnt 
the most modern us missiles carry several warheads of about a 
quarter to a half megaton each and some b52 bombs range up to 9 
megatons by contrast the total power of the bombs dropped on 
germany during world war ii totaled 13 megatons

since it opened in 1951 the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons plant has been the scene of two major fires that 
allowed radioactivity to escape into the surrounding region 
no one knows how much but officials say they dont think the 
contamination was serious 
the most recent fire was on mothers day in 1969 
it began in a glove box used to handle highly radioactive 
plutonium and quickly spread to plutonium in other boxes 
firefighters contained the blaze but damage totaled 70 million 
the building in which it occurred is contaminated to 
infinity meaning radiation levels inside the building could not 
be calculated 
contamination outside the building was small officials say but 
the threat of widespread contamination was immense federal 
investigators concluded that only the heroic efforts of the 
firefighters prevented a complete loss of the building and its 
contents and a major release of plutonium into the environment 
with the city of denver only 16 miles away 
the investigation found heat detectors had been mistakenly 
insulated during remodeling and did not detect the fire until it 
was out of control 
a similar problem had occurred 12 years earlier when plant 
workers covered up heat detectors because they were frustrated by 
too many false alarms 
according to a report compiled by plant managers that fire on 
sept 11 1957 began in molds used to make plutonium detonators 
an explosion blew out 620 air filters allowing a cloud of 
radioactive waste to escape and drift toward denver 
the report said the radiation released was minimal although no 
determination ever was made on how much plutonium was missing 
officials say documentation on both fires is skimpy and they 
have no idea how much radiation was released the plants new 
manager egampg inc has set up teams to study records and try to 
determine how much radioactive material escaped

resources committee 
the downeystark proposal would cost more than 5 billion over 
five years and would provide extra unemployment and health benefits 
to about 200000 workers far fewer downey noted than the number 
expected to be displaced 
i think its inadequate it should cover more people downey 
said but we dont have the votes 
sen brock adams dwash called the measure to a domestic 
marshall plan akin to the postwar european reconstruction 
program financed by the united states 
republicans even some from states that would benefit from the 
proposal immediately criticized the legislation as unfair to 
unemployed workers who lose their jobs for reasons unrelated to 
federal policy but who are no less needy 
republican rep rod chandler whose home state of washington 
faces job losses due to the new spotted owl policy called the 
legislation an illconceived hastily slapped together proposal 
that would burden the medicaid system with the extra health 
benefits 
it leaves out those who have lost their jobs due to other 
causes chandler said are they not worthy too 
republicans on the subcommittee also made clear their concern 
that the program would drain scarce federal revenue downey and 
stark proposed financing the measure through continuance of a 02 
percent federal unemployment tax which is due to expire this year 
the bush administration also piled on saying that existing 
programs already provide adequate job retraining and jobless 
benefits 
labor department administrator james van erden said the bush 
administration believes that singling out certain groups of 
workers for special treatment based on the cause of their 
dislocation is inequitable and inappropriate 
despite the gop criticism the idea of helping workers hurt by 
government policies has gained considerable support on capitol hill 
since last march when the senate narrowly rejected a proposal by 
sen robert byrd dwva byrds plan would have provided hefty 
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off if tougher clean air 
standards led to reduced coal burning 
since then new and increasingly elaborate measures have been 
proposed to provide extra jobless benefits but to a larger pool of 
workers than west virginias coal miners 
the byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much 
smaller population which was the problem said william 
cunningham a lobbyist for the aflcio and a supporter of the 
downeystark proposal this is not geographic it is actually 
governmental actions that are causing these job dislocations the 
number of regions involved have to be taken into account 
sens joseph lieberman and christopher dodd both connecticut 
democrats proposed legislation last week that would cost about 1 
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laidoff 
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former 
salaries while unemployed 
a separate house proposal designed to ease the burden of defense 
cuts would cost an estimated 200 million a year

sales of new homes surged 8 percent in june 
the sharpest increase since november the government said many 
analysts said the government report indicates the sluggish housing 
industry has bottomed out 
the commerce department said tuesday new home sales totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 581000 units after posting a 
revised 23 percent gain in may may sales first were reported last 
month to have risen just 04 percent the first advance in five 
months

as the federal reserves antiinflation policy 
slows the economy to a crawl even a standstill and maybe a 
reversal the questions are becoming more numerous 
why for example do supporters of the feds goslow policy 
believe that growth beyond 25 percent a year is inflationary when 
it averaged nearly 4 percent a year with only 25 percent inflation 
in the 1950s and 1960s 
and when more recently japans economy has consistently grown 
by 45 percent to 5 percent a year without severe inflationary side 
effects 
why do they believe that inflation threatens when the factory 
operating rate approaches 84 percent of capacity when that was the 
norm in that same 20 year period 
why shouldnt growth be seen as the solution to economic 
problems rather than a creator of them doesnt experience show 
that sustained growth would reduce indebtedness at all levels 
raise exports increase income 
john wright has been among those questioners not just of recent 
policy but of the feds policies over many years he has written 
and lectured on the subject and has personally carried his views 
directly to the fed officials 
growth he says is not a dirty word this nations policy 
makers need to realize that growth is not only good it is also 
inherently noninflationary he says adding but one 
qualification 
so long as a reasonable share of it can be and is reinvested 
at reasonable capital costs in productive capacity 
that is so long as we the producers dont become just greedy 
consumers and eat up everything we grow but instead like good 
potato farmers put away some of the crop to continue seeding the 
farm 
wright is the founder of wright investors service a 
bridgeport conn firm operating internationally in money 
management financial advice and corporate and financial 
information 
in an address prepared for the american banker and bond buyer 
publications wright stated that again and again in the 1970s and 
80s the fed misread the causes of inflation and then tried 
remedies that badly damaged the economy 
inflation during those years was largely costpush wright 
said it was imported inflation pricefactors such as opec oil 
were its cause but the fed he said misread it as domestic 
demandpull inflation 
the latter inflation caused by demand that exceeded the 
economys capacity to produce is correctible by restricting the 
domestic money supply the fed did that for an inflation that 
simply didnt exist 
the result of these restrictions said wright were soaring 
interest rates and reduced production which further exacerbated 
rising product costs 
during this period the federal reserve boards failure to 
recognize the noninflationary growth potential of the us economy 
caused three significant recessions in the space of the 10 years 
19731982 he stated 
and with this result the lost national income and foregone 
federal tax revenues which resulted produced the 100 billion 
federal budget deficits which have plagued the us annually since 
1982 
wrights message to the fed please recognize that recession 
not inflation is the greater risk to the us economy ease 
monetary policy do so quickly and significantly breaking with the 
toolittletoolate fed tradition 
my prescription for the ailing us economy is much lower 
interest rates wright said lower rates he said would spur 
growth particularly for capital investments in plants and 
equipment 
the fed fears lower rates would spur inflationary demand wright 
says they underestimate the economys potential 
increased investment he reminds the fed could mean expanded 
supply as well as expanded demand the productionconsumption 
balance could be maintained and inflation restrained 
the economy could grow jobs could be created exports spurred 
the balance of payments improved tax revenues enhanced and debts 
repaid

the computer industrys shift away from midsized 
machines to more powerful and popular small machines has led to 
dismal financial reports from computer companies here and cost 
thousands of jobs analysts say 
nationally computer sales have been in a slump and the 
downturn has particularly damaged sales of companies that make 
midsize computers 
massachusetts has suffered heavily by the new industry trends 
especially several large manufacturers that focused on midsize 
computers each company has tried to make adjustments but the news 
of the last week reflects how difficult this transition can be 
digital equipment corp announced its firstever quarterly loss 
last wednesday and said it plans to cut up to 6000 jobs in 
addition to a previous cutback of 3000 
data general corp reported its fifth consecutive quarterly 
loss thursday the company already has cut its workforce from a 
high of 18000 employees several years ago to 11710 a company 
spokesman said more reductions cannot be ruled out although there 
are no such immediate plans 
wang laboratories inc which has been bleeding red ink for 
months announced another losing quarter on monday and said it 
expects to cut about 1000 jobs overall the company will have cut 
its payroll by more than 8000 jobs since july 1 1989 when wang 
employed more than 28000 people 
overall massachusetts has lost more than 23000 hightech 
manufacturing jobs since may 1988 according to state figures as 
of may 1990 there were 215300 hightech jobs 
marc schulman a stock analyst at ubs phillips amp drew said the 
underlying cause of each companys trouble is the same the shift 
away from midsize computers 
but the position of the various companies is quite 
different he said 
for example digital has a strong presence as the worlds second 
largest computer company and has come out with many new products 
to be more consistent with the market 
but wang which has slashed its costs and does not have as 
strong a presence needs to boost its revenues analysts said 
once you get behind the eight ball its hard to get out in 
front of it schulman said of wangs future adding that the 
company needs to find new markets 
wang is betting part of its future on image processing a system 
allowing computers to store the actual images of documents this 
technology can be used for example by insurance companies that 
want to keep copies of police reports on record 
we view it as an emerging technology said frank ryan a 
wang spokesman we would hope it would explode but im not sure 
it will in actuality it will build 
wang officials believe they have turned the corner and hope 
to show profits in the new fiscal year that began july 1 
at data general officials have moved aggressively to shrink the 
company and market products to conform with industry standards a 
growing segment of the computer industry said spokesman ray thomas 
in a world of standards you can achieve differentiation by 
being most attuned to the standards by being the most standard 
among standards thomas said 
we believe weve taken the right steps toward structuring the 
company for the long term he said 
digital has had a multifaceted strategy with a big push on 
making products that link together computers from other companies 
all of our product lines have been refreshed said mark 
steinkrauss a digital spokesman 
yet aside from adapting to changes within the computer market 
companies must also contend with a soft national economy which has 
made customers more apprehensive about making expensive purchases 
steinkrauss said 
eventually the result of this transformation should be further 
consolidation within the industry he said 
invariably as there is growth it attracts more players he 
said but demand is satisfied and then a shakeout occurs

watch people play in the sand get your picture 
taken with minnie mouse knock the eight ball into the pocket with 
a billiards champ 
in the frantic competition to lure convention business the 
pitches are anything but conventional 
everything from a 9ton sand castle to women in harem costumes 
from the trump taj mahal are on display through today at the 70th 
annual meeting of the american society of association executives 
the people who decide where associations hold their annual meetings 
at stake is 30 billion a year in business 
hundreds of convention bureaus hotels airlines and tourist 
attractions from around the world are wooing the meeting planners 
at chicagos mccormick place 
san diegos exhibit drew a small crowd of executives who watched 
two people mold 9 tons of sand into a huge castle with a koala 
bear and elephant sculpted on one side to represent the san diego 
zoo 
the exhibit succeeds at what seems to be the main point of many 
of the exhibits keeping a captive audience 
we have people coming back four five and six times to see how 
the sand sculpture is progressing its a real draw said kelly 
nelson national sales manager for the san diego convention and 
visitors bureau 
at the miami exhibit meeting planners were drawn by eels and 
rays and colorful fish in two huge aquariums the fish tanks were 
set amid lush tropical greenery and posh furniture in a small 
building set up within the convention center a tuxedoclad piano 
player performed in a corner while executives relaxed on couches or 
wandered to the fish tanks 
the building alone cost 180000 said merret stierheim 
president of the miami convention and visitors bureau 
it is not an inexpensive sales method stierheim said but 
given that visitors spend 57 billion in miami each year he said 
this is worth it 
a few rows over the lobby of a hilton hotel was partly 
recreated in a twostory exhibit complete with two curved 
staircases a uniformed maid rushed out periodically to wipe 
fingerprints off the brass handrails 
we wanted to make a statement said bob moore senior vice 
president of sales at hilton hotels corp which has been toting 
the 125000 display around the country for four years 
the milwaukee convention and visitors bureau lured executives 
with the chance to challenge steve mizerak billiard hall of fame 
member and former world pocket billiards champion 
crowds gathered as one executive after another challenged 
mizerak and lost only to be replaced by another 
then while the customers are waiting we start talking to 
them said dave nolan milwaukee bureau president 
many meeting planners said they decided their convention sites 
before seeing the exhibits and few of the exhibitors were sure how 
many gawkers would actually sign up for a meeting 
but that didnt cool the warmth of their welcomes 
executives visiting the birmingham england booth were invited 
to sit down for tea and scones 
at the walt disney co exhibit conventiongoers stopped and 
smiled for souvenir pictures with minnie and mickey mouse 
and there were smiles too at the pittsburgh booth as meeting 
planners were handed 2ounce bottles of heinz ketchup 
debra smucker national sales director for the greater 
pittsburgh convention and visitors bureau said she touts the 
citys compact downtown and central location 
but first she warms up her audience with gifts of ketchup and 
tiny green pickleshaped pins bearing the logo of pittsburghbased 
hj heinz co 
its a good opportunity to stop people as they go by she

scientists say they have taken another 
step toward designer pigs for healthconscious consumers by 
creating lean pork with less saturated fat than todays cuts 
the key is the diet of hogs who are fed whole soybeans cooked 
in a special processor known as an extruder said scientists at the 
university of illinois and the harlan e moore heart research 
foundation 
the unusual feed ingredient produced pork with a significantly 
higher ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat a 50 percent 
improvement in pork chops and a 100 percent improvement in bacon 
we can produce healthier pork and do it in an economical 
way said dennis leszczynski a dietician and food scientist at 
the heart foundation in champaign and there are no important 
differences in animal performance meat taste texture processing 
or storage 
peter bechtel a university of illinois meat scientist who 
worked with leszczynski on the project prepared a report on the 
findings for todays meeting of the american society of animal 
science in ames iowa 
pigs are like humans were all a product of the kind of fat 
we eat bechtel said so we change the ratio of 
polyunsaturated fat in the pork by altering the fat that goes in 
the hogs 
because the final product may cost more to produce the 
researchers said farmers must sell processors and consumers on the 
health value of their new pork to justify a higher price 
leszczynski said farmers have had few incentives to deliver a 
leaner hog to market the price often has been based only on live 
weight bechtel said some processors now are paying a premium to 
farmers who deliver lean pigs 
the key is testing the market to see how much the consumer is 
willing to pay for healthier pork said leszczynski 
the american heart association says the ratio of polyunsaturated 
fat to saturated fat should be 1to1 said leszczynski he said 
feeding extruded soybeans improved the ratio from 28to1 to 
43to1 in pork chops and from 25to1 to 50to1 in bacon 
though the pork ration improved it still is not the 83to1 
ratio found in a lean chicken breast 
were getting closer leszczynski said the challenge now 
is to see how much higher we can go without adversely affecting the 
meat quality or the economics 
the study involved 160 pigs some had a diet that included 20 
percent extruded soubeans for the six weeks before slaughter 
conventional hog rations contain corn and soybean meal the 
scientists substituted the extruded whole soybeans for the meal in 
an effort to retain soy oil which is relatively high in 
polyunsaturated fat 
research at the international soybean program at the university 
of illinois has shown that extrusion not only leaves the oil in the 
final product but that it also destroys the natural digestive 
inhibitors in soybeans 
bechtel said most illinois farmers already have soybeans an 
extruder could cost about 8000 and could be shared by a group of 
farmers 
why couldnt a farmer take his soybeans have a little 
extruder and feed them directly to his pigs instead of selling the 
beans to a processor and buying back the meal bechtel said 
producing this kind of pork is an economic possibility 
some pork producers already deliver leaner animals to market by 
selecting breeds with less fat and by slaughtering them before they 
get too heavy that process has created pork cuts that are 97 
percent lean 
bechtel said his project indicated the composition of the 
remaining fat could be improved 
now were talking about custommade pork designer pigs he 
said they wont all be alike anymore

federal safety officials insist that the exxon 
valdez captain was drunk at the time of the alaskan oil spill they 
also blame his third mate the company that hired them the coast 
guard and port authorities for the disaster 
despite capt joseph hazelwoods acquittal by an alaskan jury 
and the coast guards dismissal last week of drunkenness charges 
against him the national transportation safety board said tuesday 
that his drinking was part of the probable cause of the nations 
worst oil spill 
board members said the coast guard needs to develop a more 
efficient system to monitor and control boat traffic in critical 
areas 
one of the lessons of this accident is that if we had a good 
vessel traffic system it probably would not have happened said 
board member jim burnett the same or worse results are possible 
in one of our other ports i think its a tragedy that weve had 
this wholesale neglect of the vessel traffic system 
but the board also cited exxon corp for failing to provide its 
biggest oil tanker with a fit master and a rested and sufficient 
crew 
and it said third mate gregory cousins failed to properly 
maneuver the vessel after he was left at the helm the coast guard 
failed to control traffic in the iceclogged sound and the state of 
alaska failed to provide an effective pilots service to guide 
ships out of the sound 
the board voted 40 to adopt the fivepart probable cause and a 
long list of conclusions and recommendations resulting from the 
march 29 1989 spill of 11 million gallons into prince william 
sound 
the probable cause reflects the decision of the board that in 
addition to the alcohol impairment of the ships master there are 
safety issues of equal importance said burnett 
board chairman james kolstad said the ntsb hopes its report 
which included 36 safety recommendations will help prevent future 
spills 
the boards analyses carry no force of law and by statute 
cannot be used in court cases but they often serves as guidelines 
for congressional administrative and private action 
hazelwoods lawyer thomas russo said the safety board members 
acted like they dropped off the moon in again accusing 
hazelwood of being drunk twentyone witnesses at hazelwoods trial 
testified that he was sober russo said and authorities botched 
the blood tests showing alcohol in his system more than 10 hours 
after the accident 
their conclusions are not founded in the evidence russo 
said 
the board said eyewitnesses medical tests and an unusual study 
of hazelwoods speech indicated he was drunk when the ship ran 
aground 
medical investigator merritt birky said calculations based on 
blood tests of hazelwood show that he would have had a blood 
alcohol content of 2 percent at the time of the grounding which 
is five times the legal intoxication level under coast guard rules 
birky said he believes hazelwoods alcohol level shows he 
probably was drinking on board which is against exxon rules 
hazelwood denies drinking on board although he has admitted 
drinking prior to boarding the vessel 
he is appealing a conviction in alaska of one misdemeanor charge 
of negligent discharge of oil for which he was fined 50000 and 
ordered to spend 1000 hours cleaning alaskan beaches 
last week the coast guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and 
misconduct against hazelwood but suspended his license as a ships 
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking 
rules involving drinking alcohol prior to duty and leaving the 
bridge 
this is the largest and costliest accident the safety board 
has ever investigated kolstad said in opening the meeting he 
said 2 billion had been spent cleaning up the spill 
investigators also raised concerns about hazelwoods attempts to 
move the vessel off the reef as it was spilling oil saying it 
could have caused greater problems 
he was going into an unknown area where he couldnt have known 
whether it would remain upright or capsize said chief 
investigator william woody

park in long beach with everything from five luxury hotels to the 
worlds biggest aquarium 
the port disney resort would also lure travelers to a pair of 
transportation relics owned by the entertainment giant the queen 
mary and the spruce goose museum pieces 
burbankbased disney wants to build another theme park either in 
long beach or adjacent to disneyland in anaheim 
disney is committed to building a second major theme park in 
southern california alan epstein vice president of disney 
development co said tuesday 
the 70page preliminary plan was submitted to long beach 
officials in compliance with existing agreements there are also 
discussions with the city of anaheim and a location decision isnt 
expected until next year 
epstein said a final decision will be based on community 
support government approvals public sector participation and 
theme park and resort economics 
some long beach residents expressed unhappiness over the 
proposal citing transportation woes and the potential for 
overbearing political and economic clout on the part of disney 
they also object to spending taxpayer dollars to help disney 
why in the world would we want to give money to a company that 
has more money than they know what to do with said karen 
pilcher president of the rose park neighborhood group 
but city officials say long beach needs the money disney will 
bring the residents should take an active part and i applaud 
their concern but we should be careful to keep our eye on the 
bullseye said councilman wallace edgerton to solve problems 
like crime traffic or the needs of the poor it takes money and 
thats the bottom line disney will bring money to this city

in these days of sluggish real estate markets 
the alwaysdicey process of selling one home and buying another can 
be especially hard on ones peace of mind 
even under the best of circumstances this kind of deal takes 
fast footwork a bit like trying to step from one moving boat to 
the other without falling into the water 
now thanks to gluts in many local markets around the country 
it may be easier than ever to get stuck with two properties and two 
mortgage commitments the new one you just acquired and the old one 
you cant unload 
the risk is compounded by the tax laws which let you defer 
capital gains tax on any profit from your old home only if you 
reinvest the money in your new place within a specified time 
the rule as summed up by the accounting firm of ernst amp young 
in the 1990 arthur young tax guide you must buy or build and 
live in another house within two years before or two years after 
the date of sale of your old home to postpone the tax 
as they are wont to do in such matters the authorities have 
construed this language strictly rejecting virtually all pleas for 
exceptions no matter how good the excuse 
was construction of the new home unavoidably delayed by fire 
bad weather zoning dispute or other circumstance beyond your 
control sorry 
what is more the house must be substantially complete when 
you move in points out the personal tax adviser published by 
another big accounting firm price waterhouse you cannot pitch a 
tent on the foundation and claim you occupy your new home 
in view of this price waterhouse recommends include a clause 
in your construction contract that calls for your contractor to pay 
any taxes you owe if construction is delayed beyond the 24month 
limit 
on the other hand if the new house is bought and occupied but 
the old one wont sell it may be hard to find anybody to take the 
tax burden off your shoulders 
as deloitte amp touche accountants put it in a current report on 
the subject in a slow real estate market a timing problem may 
develop 
one way to try to forestall this problem is to get a solid buyer 
signed up for the old home before you commit yourself to buy a new 
one if its possible to manage the sequence that way 
if you cant follow that script the experts say you still may 
have a couple of fallback positions when an old home goes begging 
for buyers 
maybe suggests deloitte amp touche you can sell it to a friendly 
but separate entity such as an incorporated business you own or an 
employer that is transferring you 
the sale must be bona fide and entered into on an armslength 
basis the firm cautions 
alternatively suppose you must rent your old house for a while 
until you sell it in order to keep your cash flow from running 
dry have you converted the home into a rental property that isnt 
eligible for tax deferral when you sell it 
no you may still get the break the experts say as long as you 
meet the other requirements 
says price waterhouse the courts have ruled that temporarily 
renting out your old house because of a depressed real estate 
market will not prevent you from deferring your gain

vacationers bound for summer getaways will notice something has 
happened to outoftheway tourist spots many have become 
miniature shopping meccas catering to devoted bargain seekers 
clusters of shops carrying discounted designer duds have 
sprouted up all over the country more manufacturers whose wares 
are normally peddled by mainstream retailers are striking out on 
their own 
outlet complexes are thriving in areas frequented by tourists 
who have the time to browse for good buys busloads of pricewise 
shoppers regularly pour in elsewhere outlets grouped near major 
thoroughfares are catching the attention of passersby 
the trend has ominous implications for traditional retailing it 
wont run all regular stores out of business but it does mean more 
competition in a saturated industry already fraught with fierce 
battling for market share 
sales at outlets are growing faster than general retail 
revenues although they still account for a small portion of 
retailing 
outlets generated nearly 6 billion in sales last year 
according to value retail news a clearwater flabased 
publication that tracks the industry by contrast a single 
retailer industry biggie sears roebuck and co alone had 1989 
sales of over 30 billion 
people like the excitement of shopping in a factory outlet 
they like the prices says lynn ellsworth president of company 
stores development corp a brentwood tennbased builder of 
outlet malls and a pioneer in the field 
manufacturers have several incentives to sell directly to 
consumers it allows them to control the process of getting rid of 
leftovers rather than risk problems that can crop up when they 
unload merchandise on liquidators 
closeout chains and offprice merchants which absorb excess 
apparel and sell it at discount often compete for customers with 
nearby department stores and other regular retailers 
manufacturers usually make sure their own outlets are far away 
from major shopping hubs so they dont jeopardize sales of their 
labels selling at fullprice stores or upset relations with 
retailers their primary customers 
we purposely stay away from traditional retailers notes 
benard holtzman president of apparel designer harve benard ltd 
clothing companies accessory makers and others that go into 
retailing must tred carefully the last thing they want is for 
outlet customers to return home gloating to their local retailer 
about the great deal they got 
womens apparel powerhouse liz claiborne inc has located its 22 
outlet stores 45 minutes to an hour away from regular retailers 
selling its label 
ritzy ralph laurens lines are sold at discount outlets 
deliberately situated 90 miles to 120 miles away from places where 
the polo collection is sold in fullprice companyowned boutiques 
and department stores 
nevertheless the issue is so touchy that manufacturers dont 
exactly go out of their way to publicize their involvement in the 
outlet business some even disguise their name meaning customers 
cant tell who owns an outlet pricy izodlacoste sportswear is 
sold at outlets called fashion flair for instance 
irked by the trend the national shoe retailers association 
recently adopted a resolution expressing disapproval of the 
proliferation of companyowned factory outlets independent shoe 
retailers are up in arms because they say manufacturers are 
bypassing them in channeling merchandise to outlets 
association president bill boettge said the group believes 
independent shoe sellers are being treated unfairly he said the 
group isnt trying to start a national boycott but some association 
members are refusing to carry merchandise of manufacturers that 
operate their own outlets 
from a manufacturers point of view it makes good business 
sense to look for new channels of distribution upheaval in the 
retail industry intensifed by the bankruptcy filings of big name 
chains including the parent companies of bloomingdales the bon 
marche lazarus and others has made manufacturers nervous about 
depending on department stores to market merchandise 
no longer mere havens for fashion hasbeens manufacturers 
increasingly use their factory outlets to showcase merchandise 
phillipsvan heusen corp reportedly does half its business in 
its own outlets marketing van heusen shirts and shoes from its 
gh bass amp co division 
commercial developers say projects involving outlets tend to get 
financial backing more easily in these tight money days than 
construction of traditional retail centers 
although lenders have tightened up their practices after the 
savings and loan debacle theyre still willing to support sound 
deals conventional retailers may be on the ropes but factory 
outlets look like theyre on stable ground according to richard 
echikson chairman of millburn njbased retail consultants inc 
which helps clients assess potential retail investments 
there is an increasing interest in the financial community and 
development community in true factory outlet malls says echikson 
with financial backing an increasing number of outlets has gone 
upscale offering entertainment and other amenities the woodbury 
common in central valley ny for instance recreates a village 
setting 
malls are growing bigger too benderson development co out of 
buffalo ny plans to open what it claims will be the worlds 
largest manufacturers outlet mall late next year in downtown 
niagara falls 
not all outlets are in the middle of nowhere or even near prime 
tourist attractions many outlets have been moving closer to 
metropolitan areas as more manufacturers get into the act 
according to value retail news the number of outlet chains has 
mushroomed and last year more were opened than ever before in a 
single year by the middle of this year there were about 350 
chains in operation up from 264 at the start of 1989 
the popularity is expected to continue as consumers save more of 
their incomes than they did during the freespending 80s aging 
baby boomers are keen on bargains now that they are tucking away 
spare dollars for their tots educations 
charles bloom chairman of the chelsea group a new jerseybased 
developer owner and operator of factory outlet shopping centers 
says the concept complements traditional retailing and will never 
supplant it 
without retail there is no wholesale he notes you 
couldnt buy a bargain if it wasnt selling for a higher price 
somewhere else

they call him mr turnaround a 
wonderboy who rescues sinking retailers then moves on to the next 
hopeless case 
but as the new chief executive officer of ames department stores 
inc stephen l pistner faces his most formidable challenge yet 
leading the nations fourth largest retailer out of a chapter 11 
bankruptcy filing 
if he pulls it off his reward could amount to a tidy 9 million 
15 million a year in salary for three years plus incentives 
worth 45 million 
pistner pronounced pizener a man known as much for his 
robust ego as for his retail savvy says hes worth every penny 
i know that im highly paid and i know people cant really 
relate to that but for those of us who can save a 5 billion 
company for those stockholders and banks this is a bargain 
said the 58yearold pistner his voice and face becoming animated 
pistner already has engineered remarkable recoveries at both 
target stores and montgomery ward amp co analysts said theres 
also the mccrory corp of new york operator of a large chain of 
variety stores where hes credited with interjecting new 
merchandising ideas into an already successful formula 
pistners taste for adventure extends to offhour hobbies like 
flying sailing and whitewater canoeing his more refined 
interests include collecting art ancient glass and antique cars 
he took the helm at ames april 30 five days after the retailer 
listing 14 billion in liabilities and cut off by its major 
suppliers filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws much of the chains troubles have been 
blamed on its 778 million acquisition of 392 zayre stores in 1988 
pistners first three months on the job have shown a 
truetoform pistner doing what he does best mercilessly shedding 
unprofitable operations and replacing top managers with new blood 
he is now in the process of closing 221 stores about onethird 
of the chains 679 stores a move that will cut 18000 workers and 
streamline the nowrambling ames into a northeast corridor chain 
pistner pioneered the concept of power departments stores 
within stores that specialize in specific kinds of merchandise 
like clothing or major appliances 
for all of his salesmanship finesse pistner also has a 
reputation for a brash impersonal management style that has 
alienated both top brass and sales clerks 
at ames he already has named a chairmans shopper to rove 
around ames stores incognito and snitch on employees who are not 
treating customers well 
hes in a hurry he doesnt have time or much tolerance for 
ignorance said norman mcmillan a chicago retail consultant who 
worked with pistner at both target and montgomery ward 
another consultant who has known pistner for years said his 
attitude is if youre not with him youre against him and hell 
trample right over you 
pistners roots in retailing go back to 1953 when he started as 
a salesman in st paul minn for a small electronics company he 
worked his way up and eventually bought the company 
in 1970 pistner sold the business to daytonhudson corp the 
minneapolisbased retailer three years later daytonhudson picked 
pistner to take over the helm at its target stores which had been 
a big moneyloser for years 
under pistner targets profits soared within a few years as the 
chain became the first socalled upscale discounter stores 
with wellknown brand names and trendy interior designs to compete 
with department stores target is now the nations thirdlargest 
discounter after k mart and walmart 
after his success with the target chain pistner was named 
president and chief operating officer of daytonhudson in 1977 he 
left four years later to take on another daunting task rescuing 
montgomery ward a struggling unit of mobil oil corp mobil had 
lost about 600 million on the retailer in its 10 years as owner 
under pistner montgomery ward closed 50 stores upgraded the 
quality of the remaining 375 outlets and focused on its 
moresuccessful products 
within two years mobil turned a 40 million profit its first 
since 1979 
pistner left montgomery ward in 1985 to become chairman of 
mccrory he left the company in 1988 for undisclosed reasons some 
analysts say he and owner meshulam riklis both forceful men with 
powerful egos were unable to work together well 
pistner has never tackled a company in bankruptcy proceedings 
and some analysts give him only a 5050 chance of saving ames 
hes highly regarded in the field but the question is is the 
situation so far gone that it would be impossible for any human 
being to fix this scrambled egg said alan millstein a new york 
publisher of a monthly newsletter for retailers 
pistner doesnt share such doubts 
i have rebuilt reconstructed and redefined almost every 
retail business he said when theres a problem i know how to 
repair it

computer giant ibm today said it will form a new 
subsidiary for its us typewriter keyboard and some printer 
businesses and intends the buyout firm clayton amp dubilier inc to 
become the units majority owner 
an announcement released from the armonk ny headquarters of 
international business machines corp said a plan is being studied 
to include the remainder of its worldwide information products 
business in the alliance with clayton amp dubilier 
the announcement didnt contain any financial details of the 
planned arrangements with clayton amp dubilier published reports 
have estimated that a buyout of the ibm businesses could cost about 
25 billion 
ibm spokesman glenn rossman said negotiations on a final 
agreement are expected to conclude by the end of the year until 
then no information will be disclosed on how much clayton amp 
dubilier will pay ibm or what size stake it will acquire he said 
wall street took the announcement in stride because there has 
been widespread publicity about ibms possible intention to 
reconfigure itself ibm stock gained 12 cents to 11187 in early 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
the new us company made up mainly of ibms information 
products business operations in lexington ky and boulder colo 
is expected to reduce the current work force by 1200 by the end 
of the year the company will have 3500 to 4000 employees ibm 
said 
ibm vice president marvin l mann will become the chief 
executive officer of the new company 
mann said making the information products operation a 
standalone business will enable it to concentrate its resources on 
expanding sales 
we intend to increase our investment on advertising and 
promotion greatly improve our dealer support programs and 
incorporate a sales force with information products as its only 
priority he said 
steps are being taken to assure that employees are treated 
fairly he said 
clayton amp dubilier chairman martin h dubilier said our 
intention would be to build on ibms reputation for quality and 
performance while developing more aggressive longterm growth 
strategies for new business 
clayton amp dubilier has had experience in businesses at the low 
end of technology since the firm was formed in 1978 it has made 
15 acquisitions with combined sales of 75 billion 
the new yorkbased buyout firm has made it a policy to avoid 
unfriendly maneuvers preferring to work in partnership with the 
management of the businesses it acquires 
ibm said it will maintain an equity holding in the new company 
the corporation will continue to market selected printer products 
made by the new company under the ibm name and will provide service 
for all printers 
the new company will provide typewriters intermediate and 
personal printers and supplies with the ibm logo through authorized 
dealers and other channels in the united states 
the work force reductions envisioned for the new company will be 
accomplished through a program of voluntary resignation and early 
retirement 
eligible employees in lexington will be offered the opportunity 
to resign retire or begin a fiveyear preretirement leave with 
incentive payments ibm said 
rossman said the program will be consistent with ibms 
longstanding policies regarding work force reduction 
the formation of the new company is part of ibms strategy to 
sharpen its focus to concentrate on its computer and software 
business 
ibm chairman john f akers said the action further advances 
ibms transformation and puts the information products division 
into a better position to grow in the future 
the new company will enable us to reduce overhead and more 
efficiently allocate our resources to strengthen both the 
subsidiary and ibm as a whole akers said

karsten mahlmann chairman of the chicago board 
of trade said today he has resigned as head of a financially 
battered commodities firm that operates a subsidiary accused of 
violating the commodity exchange act 
in a letter to members of the board of trade mahlmann said his 
resignation as chairman of stotler group and stotler and co was 
effective at noon tuesday 
mahlmann said he has no plans to step down as chairman of the 
board of trade 
in the letter he said he simply was not a party to the 
financial decisions at stotler which are now being scrutinized by 
the exchange and the regulators 
i have had no daytoday management responsibilities at 
stotler since early 1988 and my position at stotler was 
constantly eroded mahlmann said 
mahlmann said had he been aware of stotlers recent financial 
decisions i would not have condoned them and i would have taken 
action to reverse them 
he said he remains stotler groups largest shareholder 
his resignation comes a day after federal regulators filed a 
civil complaint accusing a stotler subsidiary of violating the 
commodity exchange act 
filed in us district court by the commodity futures trading 
commission the complaint names stotler funds inc a commodity 
pool operator owned by stotler group 
stotler and co a futures brokerage and the groups principal 
subsidiary has withdrawn from the futures business because of 
shaky finances 
in its complaint the government said stotler funds improperly 
used pools of clients money which had been set up for investing in 
commodity futures contracts 
the cftc said stotler funds instead used about 80 percent of one 
pools assets about 455 million to invest in stotler group 
in addition stotler funds lent 1 million from another pool to its 
parent company 
stotler funds use of pool assets in this way operated as a 
fraud or deceit on clients or participants in violation of the 
commodity exchange act the regulators contended 
the complaint seeks a court order to stop these practices and 
the appointment of a temporary equity receiver 
the chicago tribune reported that hundreds of investors in the 
pools called compass and advanced portfolio management were 
notified monday in a letter from stotler that the holding company 
had defaulted on the two deals and that henceforth the two pools 
no longer would do business with the parent 
in a letter from thomas kolter stotler groups general counsel 
participants in apm and compass also were told that because of the 
defaults the investors wouldnt be allowed to redeem their shares 
in the pools for the time being the tribune reported 
mahlmann and stotler officials did not return telephone calls 
today 
meanwhile the board of trade announced that its board of 
directors had voted to give mahlmann a vote of confidence as 
chairman of the exchange despite the problems with his futures 
brokerage 
in recognition of his commitment to the board of trade the 
board of directors fully and unanimously expressed its confidence 
in karsten mahlmann as chairman the exchange said in a statement 
outlining action take at a special meeting monday 
it said the special session was called so that the board could 
be briefed by the exchanges business conduct committee which has 
been reviewing the situation with stotler

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge was unchanged in june the commerce department reported 
today suggesting sluggish growth but no recession for the 
remainder of the year 
the index of leading economic indicators designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance had risen a 
revised 07 percent in may not quite as strong as the 08 percent 
gain first reported last month 
but while the index did not advance in june it escaped a 
decline in the past three consecutive declines sometimes but 
not always have signaled a forthcoming recession 
in another economic report the government said today that 
construction spending was flat in june after two consecutive 
monthly declines the report pointed to further evidence of 
weakness in the building industry 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4475 billion 
if the economy continues to grow through november it will reach 
its eighth year of expansion following the last recession it 
already is in the longest peacetime expansion in us history but 
has slowed noticeably in recent quarters 
in advance of todays report a consensus of economists had 
expected a 02 percent gain in june 
only four of the forwardlooking components were positive they 
were an increase in the price of raw materials higher stock 
prices an increase in building permits and slower business 
delivery times 
on the other hand six were negative a drop in manufacturers 
unfilled orders a smaller amount of orders for consumer goods a 
decline in the money supply a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence a decrease in orders for new plants and equipment and 
an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
one indicator the length of the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1460 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and up 14 percent from its level a year ago 
the index was unchanged in january and then fell twice and rose 
twice in subsequent months 
many economists contend that such a choppy performance is 
characteristic of continuing economic weakness 
the commerce department reported last friday that the gross 
national product which measures the nations total output of goods 
and services inched ahead 12 percent at an annual rate in the 
second quarter 
it revised economic growth from january through march down to 
17 percent from 19 percent and said the gnp edged up a barely 
perceptible 03 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1989 
that was far below the 11 percent previous estimate 
in fact the department said growth in all of 1989 rose just 25 
percent the weakest performance since a decline of 25 percent in 
the recession year of 1982 
the economy is as close to recession as possible without 
formally being in one economists at merrill lynch capital 
markets wrote in their current weekly economic amp financial 
commentary following the gnp report 
virtually every segment of the gnp showed weakness in the second 
quarter including consumer spending which has fueled much of the 
nearly eight years of economic expansion since the 198182 
recession 
but commerce reported on monday that personal consumption which 
accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic activity 
rose 10 percent in june after being flat in may and showing weak 
growth in earlier months 
this led some analysts to say consumers were continuing to keep 
the economy out of recession usually defined as two consecutive 
quarters of negative growth 
drimcgraw hill a massachusetts forecasting firm said in its 
current summary that consumers shifted to a lower gear this 
winter but not into reverse 
samuel d kahan chief economist for fuji securities inc noted 
in the current issue of the securities dealers perspectives that 
the leading index has slipped at the modest pace of 01 percent 
per month since early 1989 
its performance foreshadows further sluggish economic growth 
but it does not portend recession he wrote 
the bush administration revised its gnp forecast last week to 2 
percent growth for the year this would require growth to 
accelerate to a 29 percent rate in the last half of 1990 a feat 
some analysts doubt will occur 
economic growth has been less than 2 percent for five 
consecutive quarters the merrill lynch economists noted our 
forecast calls for three more quarters of gnp growth under 2 
percent

eastman kodak co said wednesday its 
earnings rose nearly fivefold in the second quarter from results 
that were depressed by a large restructuring charge a year ago 
the photographic giant earned 384 million or 119 per share 
for the second quarter compared with 77 million or 24 cents per 
share in the same quarter last year 
the 1989 results were reduced by 227 million due to 
restructuring costs the company said excluding the charge its 
profit was up 26 percent from 304 million or 94 cents per share 
in 1989 
it was the first quarterly earnings increase for the company 
since 1988 
sales for the quarter were up 2 percent to 487 billion from 
477 billion in 1989 
the 1989 results were restated to reflect kodaks conversion 
from a 13week to a 12month calendar effective jan 1 
despite the sluggish us economy revenues continued at high 
levels and prices held firm overall kodak chairman and chief 
executive kay r whitmore said 
costs are being carefully controlled especially in 
photosensitive manufacturing in addition we saw somewhat sooner 
than expected the benefits of actions initiated in 1989 to sharpen 
our focus on valueadding parts of the business 
as part of the restructuring kodak sold or consolidated about 
20 businesses and eliminated 7500 jobs worldwide most through 
voluntary separation and attrition 
whitmore said operations ran ahead of predictions for the 
quarter and half year 
barring unexpected developments in the general economy or 
dramatic changes in currency valuations we look forward to 
continued recovery in kodak earnings and to a strong secondhalf 
performance he said 
industry analyst brenda landry of morgan stanley in new york 
said the results were better than wall street had expected 
landry said she was revising her estimate for kodaks 1990 
earnings to 395 per share from 375 
the numbers came in nearly 20 percent better on the bottom 
line than we forecast said david nelson of shearson lehman 
hutton we believe that the fundamentals look better and the 
margins will be higher throughout the course of the year 
earnings rose in the imaging information and health segments of 
the company and dropped in the chemicals segment whitmore said the 
chemicals earnings were considerably better than expected 
earnings for the first half of 1990 were 583 million or 180 
per share up from 289 million or 89 cents per share after 
restructing costs without the restructuring charge firsthalf 
earnings last year were 516 million or 159 per share 
firsthalf revenue edged up to 8983 billion from 8977 
billion a year earlier

the government should give special help to 
workers who lost their jobs because of policies on clean air 
protecting the spotted owl and cutting defense lawmakers said 
today 
as important as it is to reduce defense expenditures and to 
increase our drive to protect the natural environment it is also 
important that we make every effort not to do so at the expense of 
american workers and their families said rep pete stark 
dcalif 
stark who spoke before the house ways and means human resources 
subcommittee is cosponsor with rep thomas downey dny of a 
proposal to provide cash benefits to workers who lost their jobs 
due to new environmental or military spending policies 
the bush administration opposes the legislation saying that 
unemployment benefits should be the same for everyone 
it is unnecessary would duplicate existing adjustment 
programs and would be inequitable in its treatment of workers 
said james van erden a labor department official 
the legislation is only the latest in a deepening pile of 
proposals to help workers displaced by government actions and the 
ideas are gaining supporters from across the country 
what we need is a bold new initiative on the level of a 
domestic marshall plan for american workers and industries in 
transition sen brock adams dwash told the subcommittee 
whether it is a timber community in western washington state 
a coal mining community in the hills of west virginia or a town or 
city located near a military base or defense facility adams 
said the federal response should adequately reflect the degree 
of federal responsibility for the change being inflicted on local 
jobs and local workers 
adams comments came in response to one of the broadest of 
several proposals designed to cushion the blow of federal policy 
changes on workers 
the downeystark proposal would provide cash and health 
insurance benefits to workers displaced because of military base 
closings defense procurement cuts changes in the clean air act or 
enforcement of the endangered species act 
the measure would affect everyone from decommissioned military 
officers to b2 bomber technicians and from coal miners to loggers 
estimates are that the socalled downeystark amendment could 
cost more than 5 billion over five years 
sens joseph lieberman and christopher dodd both connecticut 
democrats proposed legislation last week that would cost about 1 
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laidoff 
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former 
salaries while unemployed 
a house proposal designed to ease the burden of defense cuts 
would cost an estimated 200 million a year 
the political momentum of such bills has increased considerably 
since march when the senate narrowly rejected a proposal by sen 
robert byrd dwva that plan would have provided hefty 
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off due to declining 
demand for coal amid rising factory emission requirements 
the byrd bill would have benefited a narrow pocket of workers 
largely in west virginia but now with new measures to protect 
timber country inhabited by the rare spotted owl and with defense 
spending declining under congressional pressure the number of 
workers affected by federal action and the regions involved have 
grown dramatically 
the byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much 
smaller population which was the problem said william 
cunningham a lobbyist for the aflcio this is not geographic 
it is actually governmental actions that are causing these job 
dislocations the number of regions involved have to be taken into 
account

that americans are aging should have 
marketers racing to attract a huge maturing generation but theyre 
slow to catch on an author said 
youve got young creators and theyre working from their own 
value systems said david wolfe who wrote serving the ageless 
market strategies for selling to the fiftyplus market 
ions recorded by ray charles placido domingo elvis 
presley merle haggard lawrence welk the supremes frank sinatra 
and about 100 others 
and its not just on radio stations but every time the song is 
performed at trade shows in shopping malls on elevators and even 
on airplanes preston said 
back when bmi was formed in 1939 ascap had a virtual monopoly 
on song publishing broadcasters angered with the royalty rates 
demanded by ascap and the limited number of licensed composers they 
could play on the air started the company eliot described in his 
book 
the new company had an opendoor policy for all sorts of 
musicians that were essentially ignored by ascap including country 
music rhythm and blues and eventually rock n roll preston 
said 
they just became a house organ a scab union in order to gain 
representation for what ascap considered the garbage of the pile 
eliot said it turned out to be the cream of the crop 
bmi signed artists who werent part of the traditional tin pan 
alley such as leadbelly woody guthrie and hank williams in the 
early years when rock n roll started it gave bmi access to a 
goldmine of hits from chuck berry the everly brothers bb king 
the beatles and the rolling stones 
by the late 1950s bmi was jokingly referred to in the industry 
as big money incorporated eliot said in rockonomics 
today the two companies compete on almost an even keel eliot 
said bmi because its still more willing to take a chance on 
unknown artists still has an advantage in rock and pop music 
while ascap has the lead in such areas as broadway and television 
he said 
theyve become more conservative theyve become less 
embattled he said of the two companies they realize theres 
room at the table for both plates its better to exist without a 
cold war 
preston said the constant advance of new technology keeps bmi 
royalty hunters busy for instance the use of music as a 
motivational tool at trade shows and corporate meetings is a 
lucrative part of the business that was hardly thought of a decade 
ago 
the increased use of sampling old riffs in new songs 
particularly by rap artists presents a fascinating new challenge 
for the publishing companies eliot said 
in some cases older artists whose work is being appropriated 
dont appreciate what the new musicians have done he said 
its still an open question that may have to be decided by 
courts former members of the 60s rock band the turtles were 
furious with rappers de la soul for using part of their music 
without permission mc hammer recently cut rick james in on part of 
the royalties for u cant touch this which borrows the melody 
from james hit superfreak 
bmi has planned several events to celebrate its anniversary 
including giving a special achievement award to michael jackson 
but one anniversary commemoration may make music fans envious 
the company has produced a threecd set of some of its best 
music including the pop charts and television themes its 
virtually an encyclopedic look at whats been popular for the last 
50 years from the tommy dorsey bands opus no 1 to the miami 
sound machines rhythm is gonna get you 
dont look for it in stores however the company is just 
distributing it to people in the industry politicians and the 
media 
ive had so many calls from people asking if they could buy it 
somewhere she said but its not for sale

the stong headwind from wouldbe lenders 
confronting the employeeled group trying to buy united airlines 
parent for 438 billion is apparently blowing away investors 
confidence in the deal 
the price of ual corp stock tumbled more than 13 percent on the 
new york stock exchange in the two days since reports surfaced that 
banks were balking at lending money for the buyout 
stock prices retreated 612 a share monday and 1687 
tuesday closing at 140 they had tumbled another 850 by late 
morning today to 13150 
the united employee acquisition corp the group formed to 
accomplish the buyout said tuesday night that it was still trying 
to work out the financing but the groups statement lacked any 
expression of hope of success 
while there remain a number of significant issues to be 
resolved the statement said we expect to continue to work 
toward solutions 
it said the employees also are continuing discussions with 
airframe and engine suppliers and with institutions interested in 
saleleaseback transactions 
with an aug 9 deadline for arranging its financing the 
employee group could be forced to ask ual directors for an 
extension and may have to lower its offer analysts said 
stephen dexter an industry analyst with kemper financial 
services inc said he believes it is highly likely the deadline 
would be extended 
dexter also said the employee group might have to lower its 
offer to get banks to lend the employees need to borrow about 4 
billion to complete the deal as proposed 
the very best odds you can give this deal at this point is 
5050 and thats being pretty generous he said 
an earlier proposed 675 billion buyout of ual by the companys 
pilots management and british airways plc collapsed last october 
for lack of bank financing 
the employee group has asked uals aircraft and engine 
suppliers including boeing co and general electric co to invest 
in the proposed deal the group said monday it was close to getting 
help from its suppliers but the banks reportedly are unhappy that 
no agreement has been reached 
the trade publication american banker said tuesday that citicorp 
and chase manhattan corp representatives did not attend a meeting 
friday on possible bank financing 
the newspaper also quoted unidentified sources as saying 
citicorp had withdrawn for the time being from a bank group 
negotiating with the employees over financing 
the article followed reports monday from various sources that 
chemical banking corp had withdrawn temporarily as a possible 
lender 
the banks and the employee group refused to comment on the 
report 
chemical citicorp and chase were among five banks that 
expressed interest early in july in becoming lead lenders for the 
buyout 
the other banks in the group are bankers trust new york corp 
and manufacturers hanover corp

a french industrial group chargeurs sa on 
wednesday purchased pathecinema sa the film company which italian 
financier giancarlo parretti tried in vain to buy earlier this year 
the acquisition costing an estimated 1 billion francs or 180 
million was announced in two stages 
first french stock exchange officials announced that chargeurs 
had bought 523 percent of pathecinema for 517 million francs or 
93 million from four companies within the rivaud investment group 
later parrettis pathe france holding which owned 465 percent 
of pathecinema announced it also was selling its shares to 
chargeurs the sale price was not disclosed but was believed to at 
the same price per share as the transaction with rivaud 
trading in pathecinema shares was suspended following the 
transaction with rivaud there was no indication when trading would 
resume 
the was no immediate indication whether the sale of pathecinema 
would affect parrettis efforts to buy mgmunited artists in the 
united states 
the chargeurs deal follows economics minister pierre beregovoys 
decision in june to block parrettis acquisition of pathe saying 
it would be of a nature to disrupt public order 
specifically beregovoy questioned the source of parrettis 
funds which were linked to a swiss company sasea if this were 
the case he argued parrettis group should have sought prior 
approval from the french government because switzerland isnt a 
member of the european community 
the case was viewed as an example of the governments desire to 
keep a french cultural asset in french hands 
parrettis pathe france holding complained that french 
authorities wanted to combat foreign ownership even though such an 
attitude contradicted their avowed support for increased economic 
integration in western europe 
pathecinema owns about 150 movie theaters in france and is one 
of western europes major film distributors 
chargeurs a diversified industrial group already had interests 
in film production and distribution

construction spending which had fallen for 
two straight months was flat in june the government reported 
wednesday 
the commerce department said spending on residential 
nonresidential and government projects totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4475 billion after dropping 19 percent 
in april and 03 percent in may 
the april and may declines were not as severe as first reported 
the april figure was revised from 22 percent while the may number 
improved slightly from 04 percent 
residential spending was down 22 percent for the second 
consecutive month to 1961 billion at an annual rate in june 
singlefamily building was off 35 percent following a 40 
percent drop in may spending on apartment projects was unchanged 
after rising 15 percent the previous month 
some analysts said they expect a slight pickup in residential 
building but suggested other areas of the construction industry 
would remain sluggish 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said residential spending still was feeling the 
effects of higher mortgage rates earlier this year 
the rates he said caused sales to drop and builders to put off 
projects until inventories fell 
the average 30year fixedrate mortgage which had been in the 
double digits for most of the year dropped to the 998 percent 
level by last friday 
and the commerce department reported on tuesday that new home 
sales had jumped 8 percent in june their second straight increase 
after five months of declines 
nonresidential spending surged 39 percent to 1071 billion at 
an annual rate paced by a huge 102 percent gain in construction 
of office buildings the nonresidential segment had fallen 09 
percent in the previous month 
both berson and darryl delano an economist with cahners 
economics in newton mass expressed surprise at the spending on 
office buildings and suggested the pace could not be sustained 
because of widespread vacancies throughout much of the nation 
the federal reserve estimated earlier this year that the 
national vacancy rate of downtown office buildings was 16 percent 
the oftenvolatile government sector was off 01 percent to 
1084 billion following a 38 percent advance in may 
given the fiscal situation we expect this to trend down over 
the second half of the year berson said

his contribution to building the value of the company has been 
immense everyone at fort howard will miss him he said

grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as the markets focus 
returned to bearish factors such as slack export demand and 
favorable us growing weather 
the wheat market led the way down on indications that foreign 
demand remains weak soybean futures also fell steeply erasing the 
modest gains posted in the two previous sessions 
strength in the cash soybean market which recently provided 
support to futures continued on wednesday but that indicator of 
domestic demand was overshadowed by a lack of export interest 
im not saying theres no demand but theres not enough to 
hold beans at 6 or so said gerald zusel manager of floor 
operations at the exchange for balfour maclaine corp 
weather forecasts projected a continuation of beneficial 
conditions for corn and soybean development in the midwest

workers at two paper mills in quebec remained on 
strike wednesday with no signs that the walkouts would end soon 
about 1200 workers walked off the job saturday at quebec and 
ontario paper co in baiecomeau que while 420 workers struck 
thursday at james maclaren industries in masson que after the 
companies rejected a union request for 20 percent more vacation pay 
and a reduction in work hours 
the two companies belong to the fourmember eastern canada 
newsprint group which has bargained jointly for more than three 
decades but has become splintered lately 
the two other companies in the 3300employee group daishowa 
paper mfg co ltd in quebec city and domtar inc in dolbeau 
have accepted the demands of locals of the canadian paperworkers 
union 
however maclaren has said it wants to bargain separately with 
its workers while the union has said it will only bargain with the 
company as part of the group maclaren spokesman normand chenail 
said 
the unions are striking over local issues central bargaining by 
the group was expected to begin later this month on the basis of a 
model settlement reached by the union with another company 
stoneconsolidated inc 
the agreement which won only 564 percent approval from 2300 
stone workers in eastern quebec calls for annual wage increases of 
55 per cent over three years i return the union agreed to let 
mills operate on two holidays and allow repairmen perform a variety 
of tasks on night shifts 
many workers were angry that the contract broke little new 
ground in areas including job security and overtime 
the two strikebound companies and the union said they will pay 
close attention to what happens during negotiations involving 4000 
workers at the larger canadian pacific ltd which begin this week 
neither maclaren which produces 180000 tons of newsprint 
annually nor quebec and ontario paper which produces 450000 tons 
annually said they have any stockpiles 
both companies supply american newspapers but it was not 
immediately known what publications might be affected by the

acting to free resources to focus on its main 
high technology businesses ibm on wednesday announced it will 
place its typewriter keyboard and certain printer operations into 
a new company in which it will retain a minority interest 
a firm specializing in buyouts clayton amp dubilier inc will 
acquire the majority stake in the new firm 
executives of international business machines corp and clayton 
amp dubilier said in interviews that negotiations on a final 
agreement are expected to conclude by the end of the year until 
then they said no information will be disclosed on how much 
clayton amp dubilier will pay ibm or what size stake it will acquire 
industry analysts have estimated that the businesses would be 
worth 25 billion to 3 billion 
the preliminary agreement calls for the new company to include 
the us portions of ibms information products business 
eventually the rest of the worldwide operation will be melded into 
the alliance with clayton amp dubilier said ibm vice president 
marvin l mann who will become the companys chief executive 
officer 
mann said in an interview that the companys businesses made up 
largely of ibm facilities in lexington ky and boulder colo 
will do better on their own than they would remaining within ibm 
under ibm this business has not had the highest of 
priorities he said ibm is less in the business of selling 
products and more in the business of selling solutions and total 
systems 
traditional typewriters have been elbowed out of offices by 
fancier machines capable of a broader range of functions noted 
barbara otto spokeswoman for the clevelandbased group 9 to 5 
national association of working women 
but mann said there still is money to be made in typewriters 
supplying products like typing elements for the vast number of ibm 
selectric and other machines already in offices is lucrative 
the typewriter business is not a growing business but its a 
profitable business and its still quite a substantial business in 
size he said 
and the new company will go beyond typewriters it will 
manufacture and supply keyboards for ibm and other companies 
workstations it will develop and market intermediate and personal 
printers and supplies mann said the printer and keyboard business 
is expanding rapidly 
the ibm offspring would rank within the top 200 of the fortune 
500 list of the countrys largest corporations based on annual 
revenue mann said 
wall street took the announcement in stride because there has 
been widespread publicity about ibms intention to reconfigure 
itself ibm stock added 12 cents closing at 11162 a share on 
the new york stock exchange 
steps are being taken to assure that employees are treated 
fairly mann said 
the new company is expected to reduce its work force by 1200 
with 3500 to 4000 employees by the end of the year including 
operations outside the united states the company would have 5000 
employees 
the anticipated job cuts will be accomplished through a program 
of voluntary resignation and early retirement eligible employees 
in lexington will be offered the opportunity to resign retire or 
begin a fiveyear preretirement leave with incentive payments 
ibm said the program will be consistent with its longstanding 
full employment policy of no layoffs since the mid1980s when 
growth in the computer industry began to slow ibm has pared its 
payroll through plant consolidations and voluntary early 
retirements 
the buyout firm figuring in ibms plans has had experience in 
lowerend technology businesses since it was formed in 1978 
clayton amp dubelier has acquired 15 businesses with combined sales 
of 75 billion 
the new yorkbased firm has made it a practice to avoid 
unfriendly maneuvers preferring to work in partnership with the 
management of the businesses it acquires 
chairman martin h dubilier said substantial investments will be 
made in the ibm company to broaden its product line bolster 
marketing efforts and strengthen the distribution network 
ibm will maintain an equity holding in the new company for an 
indefinite period of time said james j forese ibm vice president 
of finance 
he said the deal will not have a material impact on ibms 
earnings 
forese said the new company will continue to use the ibm logo 
for about three to five years before gradually making a transition 
to its own in seven to 10 years its products will carry a new 
logo 
formation of the new subsidiary is a key element of ibms 
strategy to stay on the cutting edge of the computer and software 
industry the company said 
it will fundamentally let us focus on our core business 
forese said when we looked at whats on our plate from a 
competitive standpoint we thought the information services 
business would be better off on its own

the dollar regained some ground in foreign 
exchange wednesday but traders warned that the us currency 
remained weak 
gold prices also moved higher 
analysts said the dollars advance appeared to be a technical 
correction as traders took profits on foreign currencies that have 
surged higher against the dollar during the past week 
the dollar has fallen sharply amid increasing signs that the 
us economy is weakening and amid speculation that the federal 
reserve will be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate 
business activity the dollar is supported by higher rates so a 
move by the fed to push rates down would also bring the us 
currency lower 
further evidence of an economic slowdown came wednesday from the 
monthly index issued by the national association of purchasing 
management which fell to 474 in july from 511 in june the 
decline indicated a slowing of the manufacturing sector 
analysts said currencies with higher interest rates especially 
those in europe remain strong against the dollar and they are 
not expected to decline in the near future 
the dollar recovered some ground against the british pound 
wednesday sterling fell to 18552 in new york from 18635 late 
tuesday in earlier london trading one british pound cost 18550 
down from 18595 late tuesday other late dollar rates in new 
york compared with late tuesdays prices included 158885 west

congressional democrats proposed a 5 billion 
program wednesday to help workers who lose their jobs because of 
defense cuts or environmental rules designed to clean the air and 
protect the spotted owl 
touching off an immediate and heated debate with republicans and 
bush administration officials reps thomas downey dny and 
pete stark dcalif unveiled legislation to provide extra 
unemployment and health benefits to families affected by the policy 
changes 
the proposal is specifically aimed at defense workers including 
military people laid off because of pentagon spending cuts along 
with loggers idled by the effort to preserve the spotted owl and 
its forest habitat and coal miners left above ground by tougher 
cleanair laws 
we owe it to them to provide the assistance they need said 
downey as he convened a hearing of the house ways and means human 
resources committee 
the downeystark proposal would cost more than 5 billion over 
five years and would provide extra unemployment and health benefits 
to about 200000 workers far fewer downey noted than the number 
expected to be displaced 
i think its inadequate it should cover more people downey 
said but we dont have the votes 
sen brock adams dwash called the measure to a domestic 
marshall plan akin to the postwar european reconstruction 
program financed by the united states 
republicans even some from states that would benefit from the 
proposal immediately criticized the legislation as unfair to 
unemployed workers who lose their jobs for reasons unrelated to 
federal policy but who are no less needy 
republican rep rod chandler whose home state of washington 
faces job losses due to the new spotted owl policy called the 
legislation an illconceived hastily slapped together proposal 
that would burden the medicaid system with the extra health 
benefits 
it leaves out those who have lost their jobs due to other 
causes chandler said are they not worthy too 
republicans on the subcommittee also made clear their concern 
that the program would drain scarce federal revenue downey and 
stark proposed financing the measure through continuance of a 02 
percent federal unemployment tax which is due to expire this year 
the bush administration also piled on saying that existing 
programs already provide adequate job retraining and jobless 
benefits 
labor department administrator james van erden said the bush 
administration believes that singling out certain groups of 
workers for special treatment based on the cause of their 
dislocation is inequitable and inappropriate 
despite the gop criticism the idea of helping workers hurt by 
government policies has gained considerable support on capitol hill 
since last march when the senate narrowly rejected a proposal by 
sen robert byrd dwva byrds plan would have provided hefty 
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off if tougher clean air 
standards led to reduced coal burning 
since then new and increasingly elaborate measures have been 
proposed to provide extra jobless benefits but to a larger pool of 
workers than west virginias coal miners 
the byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much 
smaller population which was the problem said william 
cunningham a lobbyist for the aflcio and a supporter of the 
downeystark proposal this is not geographic it is actually 
governmental actions that are causing these job dislocations the 
number of regions involved have to be taken into account 
sens joseph lieberman and christopher dodd both connecticut 
democrats proposed legislation last week that would cost about 1 
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laidoff 
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former 
salaries while unemployed 
a separate house proposal designed to ease the burden of defense 
cuts would cost an estimated 200 million a year

ual corp stock continued dropping wednesday as 
investors showed more skepticism that a 438 billion employeeled 
buyout would succeed 
ual which fell a total of 23 on monday and tuesday finished 
down another 4 at 136 a share wednesday on the new york stock 
exchange the stock traded at 131 a share at one point during the 
session 
the stock has dropped in the wake of reports that banks were 
balking at loaning money for the 201 a share buyout offer with an 
aug 9 deadline approaching the employee group to arrange financing 
several airline analysts said they expected the stock price to 
stay in the 130 to 140 range until there was concrete information 
that the deal had fallen through that financing had been arranged 
or that the acquisition group had requested an extension of the 
deadline 
once it seems to find a bottom the price will bounce back 
somewhat said robert decker an analyst with duff amp phelps in 
chicago theres always investors willing to step up to the plate 
and pick it up at what appears to be a low price that will rise 
the acquisition group stated tuesday that it was trying to 
secure financing but gave no indication of how the process was 
going officials for the group did not immediately return a 
telephone call on wednesday 
citicorp chase manhattan corp and chemical banking corp 
members of a group that had expressed interest in being the lead 
bank lenders for the deal reportedly have balked at providing 
money because of concerns that the buyout relies too heavily on 
debt 
the other banks in the group are bankers trust new york corp 
and manufacturers hanover corp 
the banks and the employee group have refused to comment on the 
report spokespeople for citibank and bankers trust again refused 
to comment on wednesday while the other banks did not immediately 
return telephone calls 
several analysts said it appeared the acquisition group would 
not be able to meet the aug 9 deadline given the apparent 
reluctance of banks and concerns about the use of leveraged buyouts 
the timing is not right said mark daugherty an analyst for 
dean witter reynolds inc in new york theyre trying to jam 
something through that the market is not ready to let through 
a proposed 675 billion buyout of ual by the companys pilots 
management and british airways plc collapsed last october when 
banks refused to finance the deal

in another sign of sluggishness in the nations 
economy businesses in july slashed orders for manufactured goods 
and reduced inventories the national association of purchasing 
management said wednesday 
it was the first drop in the groups measurement of the 
manufacturing sector in three months and gave further weight to a 
belief the nations economy may be slipping into a recession 
a measurement of activity by chief purchasing executives at more 
than 300 industrial companies tumbled in july to its lowest rate 
since january in its sharpest monthly decline since january 1984 
it reflects a weakening manufacturing sector so the cutting 
edge is getting dull said robert brusca chief economist for 
nikko securities international inc businessmen are going to 
become even more cautious 
the associations purchasing managers index fell to 474 percent 
in july from 511 percent the previous month ending three months 
of increases a reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing 
economy generally is declining 
the index a composite of survey results on order levels 
prices inventory and other areas had been below 50 for 11 
straight months it averaged 488 percent in the first seven months 
of 1990 julys reading was the lowest since 452 percent in 
january 
the decline was the sharpest since the index fell about nine 
percentage points in early 1984 economists said 
orders from manufacturers tumbled to 462 percent from 549 
percent in june the rate was the lowest since january and will 
undoubtedly weaken if not decrease the recent modest growth in 
production the association said 
the groups production index was above 50 for the sixth straight 
month but fell to 521 percent from 539 percent it was the 
lowest level in five months 
inventories declined for the 20th straight month at a pace 
sharper than the previous month the groups inventories index fell 
to 393 percent from 429 percent in june as purchasers cut the 
volume of july orders and used existing inventories 
the sharp decline in new orders apparently caused purchasers 
to reduce the quantity of purchases and work off existing 
inventories said robert j bretz chairman of the associations 
business survey committee 
the weakness of new orders in july now casts a shadow over the 
previous expectations for continued growth in the economy in the 
third quarter he said 
bond prices which improve on news of economic softening surged 
after the report was issued 
the bellwether 30year treasury bond finished up more than 650 
per 1000 in face value with its yield tumbling to 835 percent 
from 841 percent late tuesday 
some economists play down the significance of the purchasing 
managers report because manufacturing accounts for only about 20 
percent of economic activity but others said manufacturing is a 
leading indicator of overall business activity and that even the 
service sector has shown signs of weakness 
i think its telling us the economy is weak again and 
businesses are making an effort to reduce inventories said 
robert chandross chief economist with lloyds bank plc in new york 
in other segments the report said export orders increased while 
imports declined for the third consecutive month 
prices for manufacturing products which include metals 
textiles sulfur lumber and fuels held steady indicating no 
movement in inflation employment decreased for the 17th straight 
month at a slightly lesser rate than in june

karsten mahlmann resigned wednesday as chairman 
of the chicago board of trade the worlds largest commodity 
futures exchange amid charges of wrongdoing at the trading company 
he headed 
mahlmann who is midway through an unprecedented fourth term as 
the cbots chief said he was stepping down in the overwhelming 
interest of the board of trade and because of my deep love and 
respect for the institution according to a statement issued by 
the exchanges board of directors 
the board said it regretfully accepted the resignation which 
was effective immediately in respect for his wishes and out of 
the respect and love he has for the board of trade 
the board said it had elected cbot vice chairman william f 
oconnor to serve the remainder of mahlmanns oneyear term which 
ends dec 31 
earlier wednesday mahlmann announced his resignation as head of 
stotler group inc a beleaguered commodities firm that operates a 
subsidiary accused of violating the commodity exchange act 
mahlmann stressed in that announcement his noninvolvement in 
the daytoday affairs of stotler group and its affiliates 
i have had no daytoday management responsibilities since 
early 1988 and my position at stotler was constantly eroded 
mahlmann said 
i simply was not a party to the financial decisions which are 
now being scrutinized by the exchange and the regulators 
mahlmann said 
mahlmanns resignation comes a day after federal regulators 
filed a civil complaint in us district court against a stotler 
subsidiary stotler funds inc a commodity pool operator owned by 
stotler group 
the commodity futures trading commission alleges that stotler 
funds improperly used pools of clients money that had been set up 
for investing in commodity futures contracts 
stotler funds instead used about 80 percent of one pools assets 
about 455 million to invest in stotler group the government 
said stotler funds also lent 1 million from another pool to its 
parent company 
the complaint seeks a court order to stop these practices and 
seeks the appointment of a temporary equity receiver 
the complaint comes on the heels of other problems for stotler 
group last week it announced that its principal subsidiary the 
stotler and co futures brokerage firm would be shut down after 
failing to meet minimum capital requirements 
mahlmann who said he remains stotler groups largest 
shareholder said had he been aware of stotlers recent financial 
decisions i would not have condoned them and i would have taken 
action to reverse them 
mahlmann and other stotler officials did not return phone calls 
wednesday for further comment 
mahlmann was serving his fourth oneyear term as chairman his 
term would have expired in january 
some cbot members believed stotlers woes had damaged his 
leadership abilities at the exchange and they called for him to 
resign said john frazier director of the agricultural division at 
chicagobased gerald inc an exchange member 
frazier said the members concern was that the stotler 
predicament had hurt mahlmanns ability to lead the cbots battle 
over regulation of the futures industry 
the exchange wants the cftc to maintain control over stockindex 
futures but the bush adminstration is seeking to transfer that 
authority to the securities and exchange commission which oversees 
the stock market 
rep john d dingell dmich said wednesday the house energy 
and commerce committee would look into the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the recent collapse of stotler amp co 
dingell the committees chairman said these events raise 
serious questions about the adequacy of regulation and oversight in 
the futures industry 
dingells comments came in a letter to the heads of the sec and 
the cftc 
mahlmann began working as a runner at the exchange in 1957 
shortly after graduation from high school in his native germany he 
became a member of the cbot in 1963 after work in its cash grains 
department had earned him the nickname cash 
he became director of the exchange in 1983 vice chairman in 
1986 and was first elected chairman in 1987 he beat leslie 
rosenthal a former cbot chairman in a close election in january 
oconnor has been a member of the cbt since 1955 and is a 
partner in oconnor and co which he founded in 1957 elected cbot 
vice chairman in 1990 oconnor is also vice chairman of the 
midamerica commodity exchange an affiliate of the cbot

the caribbean tourism industry 
watched developments in trinidad carefully this week aware that 
violence on one island can hurt business throughout the region 
i hope they get this resolved quickly the longer it goes on 
the worse it will look to the traveling public said clive 
banfield delta air lines marketing manager 
the caribbean tourism organization has sent telegrams to travel 
agencies saying other caribbean countries were safe 
barbara leblanc a writer for the daily san juan star newspaper 
observed that even the hint of danger drives away tourists looking 
for a fantasy island 
the international tourists knowledge of democracy is awfully 
small there is very little doubt that problems like this hurt the 
region said john bell executive vice president of the caribbean 
hotel association 
bell said it was fortunate the moslem uprising and looting in 
trinidad happened during the summer slow period the prime winter 
season is five months away 
hotelier jag mehta manager of san juans radisson normandie 
hotel said puerto rico will escape the fallout from the negative 
publicity and could benefit from tourists looking for safer places 
to visit 
its too far from us fortunately the new york times and 
other newspapers showed maps so people know where the problem 
was he said 
airports were closed friday evening on the twin islands of 
trinidad and tobago and did not reopen until sunday and then only 
during daylight hours some airlines canceled flights to the 
islands until conditions returned to normal 
trinidads 22hour curfew 6 pm to 12 noon daily tied up 
traffic between the piarco international airport and tobagos crown 
point airport said noel sweeney director of the trinidad and 
tobago tourism development authority 
interviewed by telephone sweeney said a flight was leaving 
wednesday with about 100 tourists who were stranded on tobago after 
their vacations ended 
dallas vonortengren of kawana travel in new york said the 
disruptions in flight schedules made it difficult to get tourists 
out of the area 
the situation is much too unstable to advise travelers to go 
there she said 
the violence is likely to set back trinidad and tobagos efforts 
to develop tourism particularly on the island of tobago 
the countrys economy dominated by the oil industry is in a 
slump because of low world oil prices the government has earmarked 
increased tourism as one new source of employment and foreign 
exchange earnings 
sweeney said 218000 people visited trinidad and tobago in 1989 
including about 29000 cruise ship visitors 
the major tourist attraction in trinidad is the annual carnival 
which the caribbean islands handbook says some consider safer 
more welcoming to visitors and artistically more stimulating than 
its nearest rival in rio de janeiro 
neighboring tobago has a world famous reef buccoo reef known 
for its spectacular fish diving and clear warm waters
