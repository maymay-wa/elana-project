work to start at once on two forks reservoir 
proclaimed a headline in the denver post 61 years ago touting a 
project that would free the city from worry about future water 
supplies 
that 1928 report proved to be a bit optimistic not an ounce of 
concrete has been poured at the proposed dam site on the south 
platte river 25 miles southwest of denver 
and now the federal environmental protection agency may be about 
to scuttle the dam whose cost has ballooned from 6 million in 
1928 to current estimates of 500 million to 1 billion 
in an unusual move epa administrator william reilly began the 
veto process on the 11 million acrefoot dam project march 24 he 
said it simply was too costly environmentally it would inundate a 
goldmedal trout stream and possibly damage a nebraska wildlife 
habitat 
dam supporters can make a final appeal to save the project epa 
spokesman rich lathrop said the review process could continue 
through december 
although the city has adequate supplies at least through the 
next quarter century its leaders havent decided where to turn for 
water beyond that if two forks is defeated 
we planned well and theres no crisis said monte pascoe 
president of the denver water board which spent decades developing 
the proposalwere trying to plan equally well for the next 25 
years and were being told we cant do that 
the city currently diverts mountain water across the continental 
divide from the rockies western slope 
the dam has been touted by supporters as the best solution to 
the areas future water needs 
opponents such as national audubon society president peter 
berle have called the dam an environmental and economic 
monstrosity that would destroy scenic cheesman canyon in colorado 
they also say it would alter the south plattes flow downstream 
into nebraska and affect fragile habitat for 240 species of 
migrating birds including the endangered whooping crane and the 
sandhill crane 
two forks just downstream from the confluence of the south 
platte and its north fork would stand 615 feet about half the 
height of the empire state building and would be 1700 feet long 
and from 160 to 467 feet thick by comparison hoover dam one of 
the highest concrete dams in the world is 726 feet tall astride 
the colorado river and 1244 feet long with a 660foot thick 
concrete base 
hoover dams reservoir lake mead on the arizonanevada border 
stores about 297 million acrefeet of water one acrefoot is 
enough water to cover one acre to a depth of one foot and covers 
about 255 square miles 
two forks however would store only 11 million acrefeet it 
would cover 1328 square miles and the small community of deckers 
denver leaders have considered a dam on the river since 1896 and 
the city began acquiring land for the project in 1923 
the most recent attempt to build a dam intensified in 1981 when 
the denver water board asked the army corps of engineers to study 
the dams potential environmental impact 
in 1986 the board and the metropolitan water providers a group 
of 42 suburban water suppliers formally applied for a construction 
permit 
the corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment in 1987 
that identified two forks as the most environmentally damaging of 
seven proposed dams on the river but it also said two forks was 
the most costeffective way to meet the areas water needs into the 
21st century 
metropolitan officials are making contingency plans in addition 
to continuing the fight for two forks and the denver water board 
last week formalized water restrictions under the new policy 
denver may decide each september whether to restrict additional 
water connections outside city limits and may implement rate 
increases in denver and the suburbs to which it sells water 
most of the cities in the metropolitan area purchase water from 
denver 
pascoe said the board has an adequate supply to meet needs in 
denver in the immediate future but theres no room for error 
we honestly dont think other supplies for water will be very 
easy to find he said

in a padlocked shed near the old royal 
palace the limousine of the last afghan king waits in the dust 
the black daimlers tires are flat but the silver royal crest 
on the door is untarnished 
the car is an apt symbol for zahir shah the 74yearold exile 
whose return is talked about by afghans across the political 
spectrum as a way of ending the decadeold civil war between an 
authoritarian government and moslem fundamentalists 
sixteen years after he was deposed the exking remains a symbol 
of better days of a time when afghans were not slaughtering each 
other in horrific numbers 
the problem is finding a way for him to return 
the car is ready for him it would be good if he came back 
said a man who knew the whereabouts of zahir shahs daimler 
then looking around even though no one else was within hearing 
distance the slender university graduate added please dont 
write my name 
others are less fearful 
if king zahir shah wants to work for his country he can have 
a positive role in bringing peace said wadir safi dean of law 
and political science at kabul university 
even if he didnt do much for the progress of our country he 
didnt kill anybody said safi who studied at czechoslovakias 
charles university 
about a month ago safis views were published in a new weekly 
newspaper the akbarehafta the article was accompanied by the 
first photograph of the former king that kabul residents can 
remember seeing published in the governmentsupervised media since 
zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 
the issue quickly sold out although its price of 20 cents is 
four or five times that of other newspapers even illiterate people 
scrambled for copies 
all the people like zahir shah a shopkeeper said on 
condition of anonymity in zahir shahs time there was not 
killing of people the father of 10 added 
even president najib a former secret police chief has said 
talks with the exking could be useful in midfebruary najib said 
he had sent emissaries to zahir shahs exile home in italy a 
spokesman for the aging exmonarch promptly denied any contacts 
with najibs sovietstyle regime 
usbacked moslem fundamentalist guerrillas operating from 
headquarters across the border in pakistan are divided about 
reinstating the monarchy 
any future role in afghanistan for zahir shah has been rejected 
by hardliners among the rebels such as rasul sayyaf leader of 
one of the seven parties in the pakistanbased guerrilla alliance 
some moderate leaders such as ahmad gailani who once served as the 
kings religious adviser say they would accept his return as a 
constitutional monarch a sort of living flag to help unite the 
afghan people 
the king himself seems amenable 
in early february as the soviet union was withdrawing its last 
soldiers from afghanistan and ending nine years of combat support 
for the kabul government zahir shah said 
i am prepared to render without any claim or precondition any 
service to my country which would reflect the will of the majority 
of my compatriots 
the sticky question is how to reconcile the polesapart politics 
of najibs peoples democratic party of afghanistan the rebels 
islamic fundamentalism and a monarchy 
the rebels refuse to deal with the party whose communist 
beginnings never took root among the fervently capitalist afghans 
the party whose leadership changes have come only through coup 
assassination or purge says it is willing to share power but 
will never step aside completely 
in four decades on the throne zahir shah himself proved a less 
than dynamic leader 
he was only 19 in 1933 when he became king upon the 
assassination of his father nadir shah for the next 20 years his 
uncles ran the country 
in 1953 his cousin mohammad daoud became prime minister and 
tried to push a feudalistic tribal nation toward the 20th century 
by such means as freeing women of their allenveloping robes 
in 1963 zahir shah finally exerted himself daoud resigned 
waited a decade and overthrew his cousin the king 
five years later in 1978 daoud was assassinated in a coup that 
brought the peoples democratic party of afghanistan to power with 
a succession of leaders 
since then about 1 million afghans have been killed in the war 
another 5 million have fled to neighboring paistan and iran 
leaving afghanistan with a population of 10 million 
throughout the war zahir shahs daimler a car that is somehow 
sleek and bulky at the same time has been unscathed 
periodically it is dusted by a man with only childhood memories 
of the monarchy a man who does not want to give his name and hopes 
the car remains safe until the king returns 
the daimler waits along with five other royal automobiles in a 
simple whitewashed structure behind the national museum abou 300 
yards from the early 20th century darulaman palace which now houses 
the defense ministry

opposition politicians and us officials 
praised mexican authorities for the capture of a drug czar believed 
to control more than half of the cocaine shipped through mexico to 
the united states 
authorities seized some of miguel angel felix gallardos assets 
monday including a hotel pharmacy realestate company bank 
accounts and various properties felix gallardo 43 was arrested 
saturday night in guadalajara 
no value was placed on the assets confiscated monday but felix 
gallardos net worth is estimated to exceed 500 million including 
at least 50 houses and 200 ranches 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo at a news 
conference monday called felix gallardo the no 1 drug 
trafficker in mexico 
he said that others arrested in the weekend raids included three 
of felix gallardos aides as well as the chief federal antidrug 
official and five other ranking police officers in sinaloa felix 
gallardos home state 
we congratulate the judicial police for the apprehension of 
the drug czar and we praise the role of the military in sinaloa 
where they detained police involved in drug trafficking alberto 
noyola spokesman for the conservative national action party told 
the government news agency notimex 
cesar yanez a leader of the leftist democratic revolutionary 
party told notimex we hope that this not only affects the 
circulation of drugs but that it attacks the problem starting with 
production 
alvarez noted that president carlos salinas de gortari who took 
office in january has vowed to stop drug dealing and corruption 
the raids were the third dramatic example of salinas 
determination in january he put the corrupt leader of the oil 
workers union behind bars and in february a leading stockbroker 
went to jail 
ed heath head of the us drug enforcement administration in 
mexico told reporters the message is that president salinas 
de gortari means business 
to pull this thing off the way it was done is a tribute to 
mexican authorities he added the impact it has on the drug 
market we can say is extremely significant 
felix gallardo thought to head a ring that smuggled up to 4 
tons of cocaine a month into the united states had been sought for 
years but obtained protection from diverse authorities alvarez 
said 
heath said felix gallardo was as important as any major 
trafficker in south america and has been operating almost with 
impunity in mexico because of the protection he received 
us authorities believe felix gallardo was involved in the 1985 
slaying of american drug agent enrique camarena salazar but 
alvarez said felix gallardo opposed killing camarena and that his 
office had no evidence linking him directly to the killing 
alvarez added however that felix gallardo was the 
intellectual author of the organization that killed camarena 
camarena was kidnapped outside the us consulate in guadalajara 
in 1985 and tortured and killed 
while federal judicial police were arresting felix gallardo in 
the western state of jalisco soldiers detained every police officer 
on the 80member force in culiacan felix gallards hometown and 
the capital of sinaloa state in northwest mexico 
alvarez said federal authorities did not trust the police in 
sinaloa and wanted to avoid a shootout most of the officers were 
quickly released he said 
felix gallardo purportedly had an alliance with colombias 
medellin cartel to move cocaine into the united states

the threat to legalized abortion has infused 
the womens movement with a passion and purpose unmatched since the 
determined but losing campaign to ratify the equal rights amendment 
women are turning out joining up and writing checks in what one 
organizer called a torrent of activity provoked by the supreme 
courts decision to reexamine roe vs wade its 1973 ruling that 
legalized abortion 
its like spontaneous combustion or a prairie fire said 
rep pat schroeder dcolo cochairman of the congressional 
caucus on womens issues 
the throngs that turned out for sundays abortion rights march 
were only the most visible aspect of an energized movement 
march organizers report their contributions have risen 50 
percent in recent months one group the national abortion rights 
action league raised 600000 in march 1989 five times as much 
as the previous march new members in february and march amounted 
to double the entire number of people who joined naral throughout 
1988 
another major beneficiary has been the national organization for 
women once the undisputed leader of the womens movement now 
after the 1982 era defeat was just one of many groups with separate 
interests its membership fell its finances suffered and its 
activist grassroots tactics were spurned in favor of an insiders 
strategy of playing the game 
but now has gained 18000 members in the past few months said 
president molly yard its fiscal health has improved dramatically 
as a result of the abortion rights mobilization and the march 
initially scheduled to kick off a new now campaign for era has 
raised its profile considerably 
many feminists acknowledge their movement had been in a slump 
successful through the 1980s only in staving off threats to ground 
they had thought was secure for example womens groups were part 
of the broader coalition that helped defeat supreme court nominee 
robert bork and pass the civil rights restoration act over 
thenpresident reagans veto 
but for the most part womens groups in the postera movement 
went their separate ways some raised money for feminist 
candidates some lobbied for family or economic bills on capitol 
hill naral continued its abortion rights campaign now its pursuit 
of the era 
until the threat to abortion rights there wasnt that kind of 
eye on the prize that a movement needs said frances kissling 
president of catholics for a free choice 
while acknowledging the backhanded contribution the conservative 
reagan and bush administrations have made to their movement 
feminist leaders say they dont consider the roe vs wade threat a 
boon or a necessity 
it has mobilized both human resources and money its 
providing energy and fuel to the movement said judith lichtman 
president of the womens legal defense fund but it wasnt a 
dying movement its an extraordinarily diverse movement with quite 
powerful leadership we didnt need an attack on roe vs wade to be 
a strong movement 
nows moment in the spotlight cast by the massive abortion march 
may pass but feminist leaders say the energy activated by the 
abortion threat will continue on that front and spill over to 
others 
it will certainly revive the reproductive freedom movement and 
it will go well beyond where its been before said kate 
michelman executive director of naral noting the new involvement 
of labor unions doctors civil rights groups and religious groups 
she said the coalition to preserve this right is much bigger and 
broader than ever before in the 70s and 80s 
many leaders spoke optimistically of the college students from 
some 450 campuses who came to the march this is going to be the 
issue that brings them into the political process said 
michelman its going to galvanize them to care about public 
policy and legal rights and civil rights it will have a spinoff 
effect 
the women also cited a renewed resolve to hold politicians 
accountable on a wide range of womens concerns people were here 
for abortion because theres an immediate threat said lichtman 
but they lobbied on monday not just on abortion but on child 
care family leave and the minimum wage theyre going to use their 
political chits with congress 
most groups are likely to continue the present focus on abortion 
and family issues such as child care which concern women on an 
intensely personal level but now intends to renew its quest for 
the era despite the difficulties of building steam for what is 
perceived as a losing issue 
yard said now doesnt need a lot of people to build a solid 
legislative record at congressional hearings the first phase of 
what she sees as a 10year effort and she said congressional 
passage can wait until more women are elected to the state 
legislatures that must ratify the amendment 
while some women consider legal abortion the fundamental right 
women need to participate fully in society yard said now members 
believe the bottom line is the era were never going to let the 
era go she said were very concerned about other issues but 
at rock bottom you have to have the equal rights amendment to 
protect the rights you win

in a policy reversal the state department has 
agreed to let the us coast guard band perform this june at a 
leningrad concert commemorating last years ussoviet arms treaty 
earlier this year the leningrad city council invited the 
connecticutbased military band to play with the leningrad military 
district band in a joint concert june 22 in honor of the first 
anniversary of the treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles 
the us embassy in moscow embraced the idea according to rep 
sam gejdenson dconn but higherlevel officials in washington 
rejected it without explanation 
gejdenson and officials at the coast guard academy in new 
london conn protested the state department decision to scuttle 
the trip 
in a letter last month to janet g mullins the departments 
legislative liaison gejdenson said he could not understand what 
reason could possibly exist for refusing this gracious and generous 
invitation during this period of excellent relations 
the state department told gejdenson on monday that the trip was 
back on 
the band shows the best of america the congressman said 
the russian people will love it 
one source said state department officials feared the trip would 
interfere with a concurrent visit by us military officials and 
were uneasy about the idea of having an american military unit 
performing in the soviet union 
but gejdenson said he believes the reluctance stems from the 
problems americans have with responding to glasnost the soviets 
new policy of openness 
its just symbolic of the difficulty of the new opportunities 
in the relationship with the soviet union even the simplest and 
smallest symbol that theyre willing to try was a major hurdle 
to get across gejdenson said 
ms mullins and state department officials for soviet affairs 
could not be reached for comment following gejdensons 
announcement which came late monday afternoon 
leningrad officials are paying for the bands hotel meals and 
local transportation gejdenson said the us government has to 
supply air travel to the soviet union

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
us negotiators held the line during trade talks in geneva last 
week regardless of how the final agreement is worded 
moreover he said the us export subsidy program which 
provides reduced prices for selected commodities in certain 
overseas markets was a key factor in putting leverage into the 
negotiations particularly in getting approval from the european 
economic community 
the eec had balked at the earlier us insistence that all 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the long 
haul the agreement reached in geneva by more than 100 countries 
calls for a substantial progressive reduction in such subsidies 
yeutter in an interview monday with a group of reporters said 
the europeans objected to earlier language calling for the 
elimination of the subsidies and later to a modified 
ratcheting down of them 
asked if the final language represented backtracking on the part 
of the united states in its quest to do away with tradedistorting 
subsidies and other practices yeutter replied i dont consider 
it backtracking at all 
he maintained that there is no practical difference between 
elimination or ratcheting or the accepted substantial 
progressive reduction of subsidies regardless of what some 
european leaders may feel 
they may have their own reasons for articulating the outcome 
of the meeting as they have yeutter said obviously everyone 
will go home and to some degree at least articulate their own 
interpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs 
the accord reached in geneva provides a framework for further 
discussions under the general agreement on tariffs and trade a 
fouryear effort called the uruguay round of talks to liberalize 
global trade the current gatt round will conclude at the end of 
1990 
as part of the geneva agreement participants agreed to an 
overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990 
yeutter said the us goal is to gain longterm accord on the 
future of agricultural trade and that the shortterm agreement 
reached in geneva while acceptable was no big challenge for us 
negotiators 
some american farm leaders including dean kleckner of the 
american farm bureau federation had urged congress to proceed 
writing a new general farm bill on an assumption that little 
progress could be expected under the gatt talks 
yeutter said he had no objection to congress proceeding with a 
new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year 
and yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislation 
until it was clearer how the gatt talks would shape up 
somehow that got misinterpreted because thats not really 
what i meant at all yeutter said 
assuming that gatt negotiations are a success the 1990 farm 
legislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991 he 
said but i never meant to indicate that we shouldnt have 
fullscale farm legislation in 1990 
on the matter of us export subsidies used in the export 
enhancement program or eep yeutter said it is our view that we 
are not constrained on eep expenditures 
yeutter said further that he still favors congress removing the 
lid on eep spending so that the united states can match the 
unrestrained export subsidies of the europeans the program he 
said was a major factor in reaching the agreement in geneva last 
week along with aggressive negotiating and general leverage 
in the absence of this combination of leverage with the eep 
program providing a great deal of that leverage we very likely 
would not have an agreed framework in geneva today yeutter said 
in a written statement later yeutter repeated his earlier 
insistence that the united states will continue to aggressively 
seek elimination of tradedistorting measures during the 
remainder of the uruguay round 
a background sheet said that in the shortterm the united states 
in a general way is committed not to increase price support and 
protection for american farmers 
specifically it said we are committed not to intensify 
market access barriers or raise support prices to producers 
subject to the condition that the commitment be consistent with 
existing legislation 
the paper added our assessment is that this will not require 
us to do anything differently from what we are now doing for 1990 
our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices

housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp says his proposals to get drugs out of district of columbia 
housing projects can be followed in the rest of the nation too 
kemp on monday proposed actions against drugs in the federally 
supported housing projects of the nations capital including more 
police patrols installing security fences and guarded entrances 
and requiring photo identification cards for residents 
he announced the moves as part of the federal governments drug 
crackdown in the district of columbia but said the proposals are 
appropriate and will be suggested to every public housing 
authority in the nation 
im asking today the dc police chief and the public housing 
authority of dc along with public housing authorities around the 
country to engage in those type of operations that can clear out 
and secure public housing projects from drug users and abusers and 
dealers kemp said 
in the nations capital kemp said he would waive hud grievance 
hearing requirements that can delay evictions from public housing 
for months kemp took steps recently to remove those requirements 
in virginia 
kemp outlined his plan at a news conference where national drug 
policy director william j bennett and attorney general dick 
thornburgh announced a major new effort to combat drugs in the 
nations capital 
kemp said local police and public housing authorities should 
issue photo identification cards to residents of federally 
supported housing projects so that legitimate residents can be 
distinguished from outsiders 
he said security guards would be trained and a better presence 
of public housing and city police would be provided a part of 
the effort would be a general cleanup of projects including 
removal of graffiti 
kemp acknowledged that many of the steps are things hud should 
be doing anyway and said many of the proposals were based on 
successful tests by local housing authorities at projects in 
chicago omaha and elsewhere 
he said he would finance the antidrug effort with existing 
money appropriated for public housing rehabilitation and operating 
subsidies he put no price tag on the effort 
if its not enough ill ask congress for a supplemental 
appropriation he said 
lucy franklin spokeswoman for washington dcs department of 
public and assisted housing which operates the citys public 
housing projects said city housing officials were discussing 
kemps proposal and had no immediate response 
but she said the district is already issuing photo cards to 
residents of highrise projects for senior citizens most units for 
other residents are apartments or town houses she said and use of 
the cards is a much different issue for families 
she said the district already has asked hud for more money to 
pay for 100 additional housing guards and for more security fences 
kemp said hud also will 
ask us attorneys to seize the apartments of drug dealers and 
return them to the public housing authorities 
seek ways to terminate federal housing subsidies such as hud 
vouchers and housing certificates for anyone convicted of using or 
selling drugs 
attempt to reclaim vacant units sometimes used by drug dealers 
and abusers and enforce housing codes and standards 
encourage resident management of public housing projects 
establish an antidrug hotline to encourage residents to make 
confidential reports on drugrelated crimes 
encourage youth sports leagues in the projects to steer 
youngsters away from drugs

water fountains with excessive levels of lead 
because of tanks lined with the toxic metal are being used at 
elementary and secondary schools and more than 100 models have 
unhealthy levels the government says 
the exact number of coolers with the leadlined tanks is not 
known but the environmental protection agency did say that more 
than a million other coolers are in use that have lead soldering or 
lead in some other form 
although the epa lacks the authority to order lead testing in 
schools a law enacted last year requires states to begin a program 
to assist school districts in testing for lead in drinking water 
many such programs are under way 
epa officials also said monday they would soon issue a detailed 
guide for school officials on how to testfor unhealthy lead levels 
and the agency listed more than 100 manufacturers model numbers 
for fountains in which lead levels were found to be of concern 
the epa said monday it discovered the leadlined tanks while 
inspecting 22 coolers provided by the navy the nine with 
leadlined tanks were all models like those used in schools 
those coolers all made by halsey taylor co mostly had lead 
levels of more than several hundred parts per billion the epa 
said in some cases when longstanding water was tested the level 
was more than 1000 parts per billion the epa said 
the epa considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion in water 
to pose health risks especially if a child is exposed to lead 
poisoning from other sources as well 
lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low 
levels of exposure and poses increased risks to children it can 
cause damage to the brain and nervous system and lead to learning 
disabilities hearing impairment and interference in the formation 
of red blood cells according to the epa 
there are a few hundred thousand children who have enough lead 
from other sources so when lead from drinking water is added at 
levels of 20 parts per billion there will be some adverse health 
impact said mike cook head of the epa water contamination 
office in an interview 
the agency also said that three major manufacturers of school 
water coolers have acknowleged that more than a million coolers 
have some lead components usually lead soldering at joints two 
other companies did not reply to the inquiries and another said it 
manufactured no coolers with lead soldering 
the agency gave no specific levels of lead in water from all the 
coolers cited by model numbers but said the coolers were singled 
out only after levels were found to be in the unhealthy range 
after the epa issues a final list of coolers with leadlined 
tanks later this year the consumer products safety commission 
intends to seek their recall by the manufacturer said david 
schmeltzer director of compliance at the commission 
epa officials said that school water fountains likely account 
for only a very small part of the lead exposure that faces 
youngsters in some cases its uncertain whether the high lead 
levels in some model coolers was from the coolers or water pipes 
that feed the coolers 
in addition to the nine leadlined coolers from the navy the 
epa received two additional coolers with leadlined tanks from 
school officials in portland maine cook said 
the law that was passed last year also requires the epa to 
issued detailed guidelines on how to detect lead contamination in 
school water systems and sets a timetable for replacing or fixing 
coolers that pose a health hazard because of lead contamination 
the coolers cited by model number were manufactured by three 
companies halsey taylor ebco manufacturing co and sunroc corp 
the epa said two other companies have yet to reply to inquiries on 
lead content in their coolers and a third said it produced no 
coolers with lead components

president bush signed a bill to protect 
federal whistleblowers who report government waste and fraud 
calling it a significant improvement over a version vetoed by 
president reagan 
the bill signed by bush on monday gives more job protection to 
federal employees who disclose misdeeds and mismanagement in their 
agencies 
the true whistleblower is a public servant of the highest 
order bush said at a billsigning ceremony in the old executive 
office building attended by the measures congressional sponsors 
reagan vetoed a similar measure last fall 
stripped from the new version which was approved unanimously 
in the senate and by a voice vote in the house is a provision 
opposed by reagan that would have permitted the office of special 
counsel to go to court on behalf of whistleblowers 
reagan protested this would have resulted in federal agencies 
fighting court battles against each other 
the new version addresses the chief constitutional concerns 
raised by earlier versions of this legislation bush said the 
bill i am signing today is a significant improvement over 
legislation enacted by congress last year 
under the new act employees fighting for their jobs would face 
less stringent standards of proof that their firing or demotion 
came as the result of whistleblowing 
the office of the special counsel established eight years ago 
to investigate civil service abuses would become an independent 
agency

the plo has rejected an israeli proposal 
to hold elections among palestinians in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
wafa the plo news agency said the proposal by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir is nothing but a reactivation of the 
selfautonomy scheme of the camp david accord which the plo and 
our entire palestinian people already have rejected 
george habash head of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine said in a statement issued in damascus syria 
we will not allow the shamir plan to pass we will not allow 
elections to be held under enemy army bayonets we will not allow 
the creation of a substitute leadership whatever their name or 
color might be 
habashs marxist organization is the secondlargest group in the 
palestine liberation organization after yasser arafats fatah the 
main palestinian fighting force 
under shamirs plan proposed last week in washington 
palestinians would choose representatives for negotiations about an 
interim settlement in the territories 
an israeli government official in jerusalem quoted shamir on 
monday as saying he was willing to discuss participation in 
proposed elections by palestinians from outside the territories 
the official said those elected also might consult during 
negotiations with the plo with which shamir refuses to deal 
because no one can think the plo is an element you can totally 
ignore 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the plo should explore practical ways to advance the peace 
process he declined to say whether the united states was asking 
the plo to endorse shamirs plan which received president bushs 
qualified support 
the wafa report quoting a plo spokesman it did not identify 
said elections in the occupied lands should be held under 
international supervision after israel withdraws 
the idea of elections is totally unacceptable in the shadow of 
israeli occupation and this proposal is nothing but a maneuver 
aimed at undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to 
achieve a just settlement in the middle east the report said 
in the usmediated camp david accords that lead to the 1979 
peace treaty egypt and israel agreed to limited autonomy for 
palestinians in the territories that israel captured from jordan 
and egypt in 1967 
the plo spokesman said israel should turn over the territories 
to a un supervisory force for a transition period during which 
elections would be held 
on friday plo chairman arafat said shamirs proposal was 
inappropriate as usual 
mondays plo statement reiterated calls for an international 
peace conference on the middle east involving all parties 
concerned including the palestinian state proclaimed nov 15 
by the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature 
it is the first plo mention of the palestinian state as the 
representative of palestinians at an international forum previous 
references have been to the plo itself

cars could average 33 miles per gallon by 
1995 but automakers are unlikely to make the necessary engineering 
changes on their own the congressional office of technology 
assessment says 
the higher average about 5 mpg above the present one for new 
cars could be reached if automakers began immediately to move 
available fuelconservation technology into their cars at a more 
rapid pace an analyst with the office told a house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on monday 
those changes include better tires more aerodynamic body design 
and engine improvements said steven plotkin senior associate with 
the office 
we calculate that this level of efficiency could be obtained 
without a performance loss or the need to move to smaller vehicles 
at a cost that would be compensated for by fuel savings plotkin 
told the oversight and investigations subcommttee chaired by rep 
john dingell dmich 
but the office doubts that the industry will pursue this 
course without a further economic or regulatory incentive to do 
so plotkin said 
general motors corp and ford motor co have said high 
fueleconomy standards are difficult to reach because of the 
publics demand for larger highpowered cars 
the ota analysis struck a middle course between the positions of 
advocates of tighter fueleconomy standards and the major us 
automakers 
energy conservation groups have proposed a 45 mpg fueleconomy 
goal for cars by 2000 a level plotkin said was virtually 
impossible to reach 
neither gm nor ford could provide estimates of attainable fuel 
efficiency for 1995 
we havent gone out that far in our prognostications largely 
because there are just too many variables to deal with the largest 
of which is fuel cost said gm spokesman gray terry 
the offices analysis assumed a 110 per gallon price for 
gasoline plotkin said 
the corporate average fuel economy standard requires the mix of 
1989 cars sold by each automaker to average 265 mpg or better the 
average fuelefficiency for all new passenger cars in the united 
states in 1987 was 28 mpg and plotkin said the present level is 
about the same 
among the presently available technologies whose adoption could 
improve fuel efficiency are more aerodynamic styling improved tire 
composition and design and improved pumps and other components 
plotkin said 
greater use of frontwheel drive fourspeed automatic shift 
fourcylinder and fourvalve engines and lowfriction rings and 
pistons would also help increase the average fuel efficiency of 
cars in the united states plotkin said 
the goal likely couldnt be reached if present trends toward 
greater performance and luxury continued or if the industry had to 
comply with stricter pollutioncontrol standards that required 
technologies that reduce fuel efficiency plotkin said

people who called an expanded tollfree 
telephone service offered by the social security administration met 
with busy signals endless waits on hold and misinformation when 
they did get through witnesses told a senate panel 
judith price of akron ohio told the the senate special 
committee on aging that she was put on hold three times for 20 
minutes then told she would have to wait 30 days for the answer to 
a question on moving her mothers checks into a new account 
a phone representative neglected to tell kathryn lippert of 
pittsburgh that she needed to file a claim to get a widows 
benefit and she said it took five months to wade through red tape 
before the problem was solved 
i would like to point out that for the past five months i 
have only received my own social security check which is 70 less 
than my rent alone she told the panel on monday 
the administration began the 800number service last october 
hoping to improve convenience and accessibility to the public by 
making phone representatives available for 12 hours per day 
instead of eight the system in which calls to local social 
security offices are routed to any of 37 national teleservice 
centers has been implemented so far in 60 percent of the nation 
and received 22 million calls 
the service was touted in two mailings to a total of 36 million 
beneficiaries in december and february 
lawmakers began hearing about the system after national busy 
signal rates reached 43 percent in january followed by 35 percent 
in february 
the rate dipped to 9 percent in march but only after calls 
dropped from 48 million in march to 34 million in february and 
after ssa brought in staff members in from other offices to answer 
calls a general accounting office official testified 
while the reassignment of staff contributed to the reduction 
of this busy signal rate for march it raises questions about the 
impact on the operations of the field facilities joseph delfico 
of gaos human resources division said in a prepared statement 
john sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees told the panel that ssa commissioner dorcas 
hardy has created sweatshop conditions for teleservice 
employees 
she is pressuring employees to complete calls in an average of 
200 seconds he said adding that the employees are being denied 
sick leave 
ssa said it reduced the busy signal rate in march partly through 
the use of a system to reroute calls during peak calling times 
as we have identified problems and gained experience with the 
system we have been able to modify our procedures along the way in 
order to improve our performance hardy told the panel 
this will be the largest 800number in the world she said 
in a prepared text i want it to be the best 
a survey conducted by ssa in february found that 84 percent of 
callers interviewed were satisfied with the phone service and 98 
percent thought they had been treated courteously the 
administration said 
hardy said the latest survey placed the systemwide accuracy 
rate at 94 percent 
but gaos delfico said that an ssa study last december found 
that the number of incorrect 800number responses ranged from 25 
percent for a question on disability benefits to 229 percent for a 
question on the annual earnings test for people 70 years old and 
over 
the service handled 22 million calls during its first six months

it lacked the proper equipment and dawdled 
when it should have been racing against the clock but the 
oilsmeared response team promised to revise its contingency 
plan and do better next time 
the allyeskaexxxon response team was the last of the 103 teams 
to cross the finish line in the 14thannual skitosea relay near 
juneau 
we were wellprepared we had a good plan but darn the 
thing just wasnt adequate team member jim nordlund said monday 
nordlund said his team was neither sanctioned nor supported by 
alyeska pipeline service co nor exxon corp the companies blamed 
for the slow response to the valdez oil spill it was just 
coincidence that team members had crude oil on their faces and 
clothes he said 
in fact all but one of the team members work for the 
legislature which is no stranger to oil companies 
each team included a downhill skier who began the relay at the 
top of the eaglecrest ski area and passed the baton to a 
crosscountry skier two runners and a bicyclist 
nordlund a legislative aide noted his bicycle was not designed 
for the job 
we thought it was a stateoftheart bike it actually was a 
little small it wasnt large enough to deal with the size of the 
race he said 
well it basically was a little kids bike 
the downhill skier in nordlunds team missed all the gates 
and unfortunately theres a penalty each time you do that he 
said i think she skied part of the way backwards 
things got worse when the teams crosscountry skier took over 
hes our lawyer and he was dressed up in a suit and tie 
smoking a cigar nordlund recalled after the start he realized 
his cigar went out so he stopped and took the time to light it 
he figured there just wasnt much of a hurry things were 
under control he had the wall street journal with him and he read 
that 
wendie marriott who organized the weekend race as the citys 
recreation supervisor said she heard that the teams runners 
actually ran backward 
the team was purposely trying to come in last which it did 
she observed the idea was to clean up the mess at the end of the 
race 
nordlund said the team learned a lot from the experience 
well do it better next time he said you can trust us

former president richard nixon didnt like 
hearing that former president reagan was the object of criticism by 
some members of george bushs white house 
nixon fired off a letter to bushs chief of staff john sununu 
saying as much sununu issued a decree that any such badmouthing 
was to cease 
and the whole matter came to the attention of bush who wrote 
nixon a note on the subject according to nixons spokesman 
fitzwater said sununu sounded off during a recent senior staff 
meeting after a knightridder newspapers inc story quoted several 
current white house officials anonymously as comparing reagan 
unfavorably with bush 
the comparisons focused on bushs active work shedule and 
reagans reputation for leaving detail to aides and keeping short 
hours 
fitzwater would not say whether the nixon complaint caused 
sununus order that aides refrain from criticizing the former 
president 
he said that bush and reagan speak frequently on the phone and 
that bush has the highest respect for the man who made him vice 
president 
most of us owe our careers to the former president he said 
noting that he and others including secretary of state james a 
baker iii had worked in the reagan white house 
john taylor a spokesman for nixon in saddle river nj 
confirmed that nixon had written sununu complaining about the 
story as a matter of fact president bush dropped president 
nixon a note last week taylor said 
in a march 23 story knightridder white house correspondent 
owen ullmann quoted several toplevel aides to bush including some 
who had worked for reagan as saying such things as that reagan 
would still have been asleep at 7 am the hour bush usually 
arrives at the oval office 
fitzwater dressed down ullmann during mondays white house news 
briefing accusing the reporter of making up quotes later in the 
morning fitzwater apologized for the personal attack on ullmann 
but didnt discuss any further the merits of the story 
at the briefing fitzwater said that i dont know anybody who 
has been badmouthing former president reagan 
fitzwater said that sununu told staff aides dont get caught 
you know making jokes or being lighthearted or anything about the 
past he quoted sununu as saying i dont know whether this is 
true or not but if it is dont let it happen

the military has a multimilliondollar 
stockpile of useless spare parts because contractors fail to follow 
specifications and the government neglects to check the shipments 
a defense department auditor told congress 
a twoyear audit conducted at the warner robins air logistics 
center in georgia concluded an estimated 104 million worth of 
parts failed to conform to essential or critical operational 
characteristics according to a report released monday to the 
senate governmental affairs committee 
the report detailed problems both with the way government 
contractors ship out parts and the way the military accepts and 
pays for parts without making sure they meet rigidly drawn 
specifications 
obviously we have a lot of material out there that is not 
combatready sen john glenn dohio told a hearing of the 
committee which he chairs i want to know why we are accepting 
substandard parts 
maj gen richard smith of the air force logistics command told 
glenn he would order spot inspections of parts as theyre delivered 
and brig gen mj pepe of the us army defense logistics 
agency told glenn the army has started to equip its depots with 
equipment to test parts as they come in 
its obvious we need to do more checking pepe said we 
hadnt been doing enough checking 
in addition since july 1988 competitive contracts have included 
a oneyear warranty requiring replacement or refund of substandard 
parts smith said 
derek vander schaaf deputy inspector general for the defense 
department said the audit covered spare parts chosen randomly from 
the warner robins warehouse 
about 58 percent or 129 millon worth of the gun parts tested 
in the study were unusable only 8 percent of examined gun parts 
with such functions as feeding ammunition into 20mm and 30mm 
aircraftmounted guns conformed to specifications the audit 
report said 
tests of mounted bearings which are used in aircraft landing 
gears and wing flaps and on helicopter main rotor heads indicated 
38 percent conformed to specifications and 30 percent were unusable 
belowstandard parts routinely were accepted and used though 
the failure to conform to specifications meant they didnt last as 
long as they would have if they met the standards the report said 
vander schaaf said auditors found numerous examples of 
contractors who shipped defective parts to one branch of the 
service but other branches werent told of the problems and gave 
the same contractor orders for identical or similar parts 
in one case one part of the air logistics center gave new 
work to a contractor while another part of the same logistics 
center hauled 15 million worth of the same contractors parts to 
the scrap yard vander schaaf testified

a natural yeast found in a beetles stomach 
can neutralize deadly farm chemicals and natural toxins that 
sometimes are found in the nations food supply according two 
government scientists 
entomologists patrick f dowd and samuel k shen of the 
agriculture departments agricultural research service said that if 
preliminary tests are borne out in further experiments the yeast 
could be used to remove potentially harmful toxins from livestock 
feed and to clean up the environment 
although were not yet sure of its full range of detoxifying 
ability the implication we see here is for the environmental 
cleanup situations like toxic waste dumps shen said 
if the yeast can be developed properly it could be 
massproduced to detoxify a wide variety of plant and chemical 
toxins in the environment he said in a report issued by the usda

the coast guard is making permanent its 
decision not to seize vessels when only small quantities of drugs 
are found on board 
the agency announced monday a rulemaking that would subject the 
owners of commercial fishing vessels to a summons in cases when 
personaluse quantities of illegal drugs are found on their ships 
the issuing of summonses in such cases was instituted on an 
interim basis feb 16 and the rulemaking would make that permanent 
the coast guard said 
before that vessels had been subject to immediate seizure when 
any quantity of drugs was found

and fish tender vessels 
separate laws extend similar protection to ferry boats cruise 
ships and other commercial vessels in cases in which a passenger 
brings small quantities of drugs on board however these vessels

all fingerpointing and shouting but his behavior off the show is 
a shock hes polite 
showing little of the swagger that characterizes his syndicated 
talk show downey dueled a former lawyer for the federal 
communications commission on monday on government regulation of 
broadcasting 
the conclusion civilized minds may differ 
i might like filet mignon and you might like a hot dog 
downey said at a forum celebrating the bicentennial of the us 
constitution no one can dictate good taste 
the conservative television host said he found it amusing to be 
taking a more liberal viewpoint than his counterpart lawyer bruce 
fein fein argued that government should take a more active role in 
making sure television doesnt descend into bad taste 
downey said its dangerous for the government to decide what 
people should or shouldnt listen to 
despite their disagreements the two were quite civil during the 
45minute discussion fein was even kind about downeys show 
theres nothing indecent or obscene about being provocative 
being colorful or even about namecalling he said

archaeologists have discovered the ruins of an 
ancient mesopotamian city that flourished 4000 years ago and 
rivaled babylon 
the site of mashkanshapir 90 miles south of the iraqi capital 
baghdad has not been occupied since the city was sacked and burned 
about 1720 bc 
the city was identified during the first six weeks of 
preliminary surveys earlier this year after elizabeth c stone one 
of the archaeologists discovered a cuneiform inscription on a clay 
fragment with the name mashkan 
we have a whole city plan laid out there for us said stone 
who with her husband paul zimansky identified the site in 
january 
we know where the canals were the cemetery the palace and 
religious quarters the manufacturing area and the city wall a 
complete undisturbed city thats whats really exciting about it 
as an archaeological site stone said in an interview in the new 
york times today 
stone an associate professor of archaeology at the state 
university of new york at stony brook and zimansky an assistant 
professor of archaeology at boston university said the city may 
rank among the regions major archaeological finds of the past four 
decades 
other scholars cheered the news of the discovery 
its always a happy day in archaeology when somewone nails 
down the identity of an ancient city said william hallow 
professor of assyriology at yale university 
some said the find could be as significant as the 1985 discovery 
of tell leilan a northern mesopotamian center that had been the 
seat of a power king in the 18th century bc other archaeologists 
doubted that mashkanshapir would yield as much as ebla an ancient 
city in syria where voluminous archives were discovered in the 
1970s and revealed a previously unknown language 
stone and zimansky began exploring the site two years ago 
collecting artifacts on the surface and examining satellite images 
of the routes of ancient canals that served the city 
but they were barred from using aircraft to photograph the site 
by iraqi military restrictions so zimansky attached a camera to a 
kite to obtain pictures revealing features that were not 
immediately visible from the ground 
the city survived for 300 years as a major trading and 
manufacturing center with a population of 15000 evidence 
indicated that it had been built in honor of nergal the ancient 
babylonian god of death pestilence and other disasters 
stone and zimansky plan more detailed mapping and excavation at 
the site next year

in a state where two of the wild wests 
sharpest shooters left their marks judges cant decide whether a 
voterapproved constitutional amendment means that anyone can carry 
a gun 
the nebraska supreme court has been asked to step in and settle 
the dispute 
some judges in the western part of the state where buffalo bill 
cody had a ranch say the statutes limiting possession of firearms 
are now unconstitutional because of initiative 403 which was 
approved by voters last fall 
some judges in the eastern part of the state the site of wild 
bill hickoks first killing have read the new constitutional 
language to allow for reasonable state regulation of guns 
and attorneys for one man on death row have argued in federal 
court that the language of the amendment also outlawed the death 
penalty 
in coming weeks the high court will hear oral arguments in two 
cases that were dismissed by lincoln county district court judges 
because of the constitutional amendment one is against a felon 
accused of possessing a firearm the other involves a man accused 
of having a firearm on which the serial number had been defaced 
jw carlson of crofton spokesman for the national rifle 
association and a backer of the initiative petition that put the 
amendment before voters said the amendment was intended only to 
protect the lawful possession of guns 
in briefs filed monday lincoln county attorney kent turnbull 
said district judges john p murphy and donald e rowlands ii erred 
in tossing out the separate gun cases 
the judges ruled that the amendment invalidated existing 
statutes regulating guns 
but judges in douglas county which includes omaha have said 
the new language should be read to coexist with the regulatory 
statutes 
turnbull said in his brief that the intent of the amendment 
was to protect only lawful possession of firearms lawful 
possession of firearms is that which was lawful when the measure 
was adopted the state may regulate the right to bear arms as a 
reasonable exercise of the states police power 
turnbull argued that prohibiting possession of a defaced 
firearm and prohibiting a felon from possessing a firearm bears 
a reasonable relationship to promoting the public safety and is 
therefore a lawful exercise of the states police power 
before initiative 403 was adopted the state constitution said 
all persons are by nature free and independent and have 
certain inherent and inalienable rights among these are life 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
the amendment added a section so that the second part of the 
passage now reads among these are life liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness and the right to keep and bear arms for 
security or defense of self family home and others and for 
lawful common defense hunting recreational use and all other 
lawful purposes and such rights shall not be denied or infringed 
by the state or any subdivision thereof 
attorneys for convicted contract killer c michael anderson said 
they believe the language of the amendment repeals the death 
penalty because it cites life as an inalienable right 
they have filed a lawsuit in lancaster county district court 
asking that andersons death sentence be set aside

investigators dug through the wreckage of 
a twinengine fokker 27 aircraft today hoping to find the flight 
recorders that might shed light on why the plane crashed killing 
all 22 people aboard 
there was no immediate explanation for what caused the plane to 
smash into a 300foot cliff in the wooded mountainous area 15 
miles east of valence at about 910 pm monday 
within a few hours of the crash rescue workers had recovered 
the bodies of the 19 passengers and three crew members aboard the 
uniair plane chartered by europe aero service en route to 
valence from paris 
the plane broke apart from the impact spreading wreckage over 
several hundred yards police in valence said they said victims 
bodies were taken to a nearby chapel for identification 
valence is located on the rhone river 41 miles south of lyon 
investigators searched this morning for the flight data recorder 
and cockpit voice recorder that might reveal what happened in the 
final moments of the flight 
air controllers at the regional center near lyon said the pilot 
reported a routine approach to the airport and no particular 
problems during his last contact about eight minutes before the 
aircrafts scheduled arrival 
they said the plane was flying at an altitude of about 3000 
feet when it disappeared from radar 
there was a light fog a ceiling of about 5000 feet and fair 
visibility at the time of the crash 
the plane passed about a dozen meters above my house and right 
away i knew that it would not clear the cliff said a resident of 
the village of barbiere adjacent to the crash site 
then i heard a terrifying explosion and i called the fire 
department said the man who declined to provide his name 
on march 4 1988 another twinengine fokker 27 en route from 
nancy to paris crashed in the countryside killing 23 people the 
final report from that investigation provided no reason for the 
crash

the man described by prosecutors as one of 
the nations most powerful crime bosses pleaded guilty for the 
first time and cried before a federal judge as he admitted to 
extortion and racketeering 
anthony fat tony salerno the 78yearold reputed former 
boss of the genovese crime family told the judge monday he was 
guilty of trying to wrest control of a morris county sandpit 
business and trying to extort 500000 from its owner andrew 
giordano 
salerno already is serving a 100year sentence for his 1986 
conviction as a mob boss in the new york trial of the mafias 
ruling commission 
salerno could be sentenced to an additional five years in prison 
and fined up to 10000 in the new jersey case 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said the new jersey charges 
were warranted despite salernos long prison sentence 
the purpose of this indictment was not to increase his 
sentence but to demonstrate to the citizens of new jersey the 
dangers posed by la cosa nostra and the degree to which the 
highest levels of the mafia have infiltrated and affected their 
lives alito said 
salernos attorney john jacobs said the guilty pleas did not 
mean salerno participated in the offenses 
it was an accommodation to avoid trial said jacobs who 
pointed out that a medical condition caused by a 1981 stroke 
affects salernos emotional state and caused him to cry at mondays 
hearing 
special us attorney jeffrey a bronster said the reputed crime 
bosss plea shows he was involved in the allegations 
he has pleaded guilty to the charges id say thats admitting 
his guilt bronster said 
the gravelly voiced salerno walked into the courtroom with the 
aid of a cane 
he repeatedly answered yes when judge john w bissell asked 
him if he understood the charges and wished to plead guilty he 
cupped his hands over his face and cried several times

motorists who kill deer along 
massachusetts roads may keep the meat or donate it to their 
favorite charity under new state wildlife regulations 
it seems a shame to see it just wasted steve williams a 
wildlife biologist in charge of the states deer management 
program said monday before the state division of wildlife and 
fisheries board approved the change 
a deer can do thousands of dollars of damage to a car and the 
meat can provide some compensation he said 
williams said that 600 to 700 deer are reported killed on the 
states highways annually but officials suspect the toll is three 
times higher 
some go off into the woods to die and some just end up in the 
trunk of the car said walter bickford commissioner of fisheries 
and wildlife 
under the new rule the driver or a passenger could keep the 
venison only if they are residents of massachusetts 
we dont want to get involved in transporting road kills 
across state lines said ellie horowitz a spokeswoman for the 
division 
the change was sparked in part by the state environmental 
polices decision in october to stop picking up animal carcasses 
leaving the problem to municipalities bickford said budget cuts 
forced police to stop the service

earl peterson is just one of many worried 
fishermen in the kodiak cafe a popular coffee shop on the 
waterfront of the nations richest fishing port 
just off kodiaks coast is a gloppy mess that could end a way of 
life in kodiak which last year handled fish harvests worth more 
than 166 million the black ooze that smothered much of prince 
william sound headed this way 
and the fishermen here are not happy with exxons response to 
the spill that left them with a 10milliongallon nightmare 
they are holding their breath as tentacles of oil reach into 
fertile cod and halibut fishing grounds nearby 
hellfire man what did they do they didnt have any 
equipment to do anything with anyway this ought to wake somebody 
up peterson said as he puffed his cigarette down to the filter 
they have to pass some laws to have certain things and have 
somebody to ride herd on them 
peterson his face weatherlined and his hands dark and 
workhardened has depended on the sea for a living for 20 years 
in his 52foot boat the markayla dawn he harvests crab salmon 
and halibut 
yeah i worry about the longterm effects we all do i wonder 
what will happen 
another one worrying is jack hill partowner of two vessels now 
at sea fishing for black cod its just a tragedy he said a 
lot of the oil is on the halibut grounds and on the black cod 
grounds 
our problem is we have a big halibut season in a month its a 
24hour opening if we lay the gear and have to pull it six eight 
or 10 hours later because of oil it will cost 
and if we have one fish thats tainted you cant have one 
bad fish in your load said hill who has been a commercial 
fisherman 26 years 
everybody is worried what the longterm effect is depending 
on the longterm effects it can mean your way of life is gone as a 
fisherman 
it could be bad it really could then it might not be it 
could affect everybody here this is a fishing village and 
everything is tied to that 
bill eoff said he thinks cleanup officials should attack the oil 
before its coats kodiaks rocky coastline 
i feel they better do everything they can including hiring 
local boats and people and get them out there 
but he said that may not be enough 
in the long term who knows it could be years and years and 
years and years of dead areas

syrian gunners today shelled a christian 
army position outside beirut and tension rose about a possible 
violent moslem response to the expected arrival of two french ships 
with humanitarian aid 
police said no casualties were reported from the brief syrian 
howitzer barrage against the deserted town of souk elgharb about 
15 miles southeast of beirut 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said there was no response from the christian side to the 
barrage 
shells fired by army commander gen michel aouns mostly 
christian troops and by syrian army gunners exploded in christian 
and moslem districts on monday killing two people and wounding 15 
that raised the toll to 180 people killed and 619 wounded since 
the current round of civil war fighting erupted on march 8 
aoun had declared a war of liberation against syrian forces 
the syrians have responded by shelling the 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
syria is the countrys main power broker with 40000 troops 
deployed in predominantly moslem areas covering 70 percent of 
lebanese territory under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
france which ruled lebanon from the end of world war i until 
independence in 1943 has voiced concern about the fate of 
lebanons christian community and sent a special envoy in an effort 
to contain the crisis 
the french government has not specified an arrival date for two 
ships carrying humanitarian aid that set sail for lebanon last 
week but press reports in paris and beirut said they were due 
wednesday 
one vessel carries fuel and food the other is a hospital ship 
with beds surgical facilities and medical supplies 
there are fears the ships arrival could trigger heavier 
fighting 
lebanese moslem and leftist leaders have rejected their share of 
the french aid druse warlord walid jumblatt whose progressive 
socialist party militia is syrias main ally in the current 
confrontation with the christians also warned the french ships 
against docking at any christian port 
the french envoy jeanfrancois deniau accused syria of trying 
to block his mission by ordering its gunners last week to shell the 
french embassy in beiruts christian suburb of hazmiyeh where he 
was staying 
deniau vice president of the national assemblys foreign 
affairs committee warned today that opening fire at the french 
ships would be an act of war against france 
the present confrontation broke out after aoun ordered a 
blockade of militiarun ports that have been stripping the state 
treasury of about 100 million annually in taxes

south africa today said black 
nationalist guerrillas did not appear to be honoring an agreement 
to leave namibia so the territorys transition to independence can 
resume 
guerrillas were to congregate at designated points so they can 
be escorted to angola under an agreement by south africa angola 
and cuba 
the agreement was reached in an effort to end fighting between 
south africanled security forces and the guerrillas in northern 
namibia the bloodshed began april 1 the day a unsponsored 
truce was to begin as part of namibias transition to independence 
after 74 years of south african rule 
chief inspector kierie du rand of namibias paramilitary police 
reported a few skirmishes with southwest africa peoples 
organization guerrillas today and monday 
du rand put the latest death toll in the fighting at 265 
guerrillas and 28 security force members 
he said there was no sign that guerrillas were honoring an 
agreement to cross the border north to angola 
about 10 small groups of three to seven men each have crossed 
into angola since sunday but that could be to resupply themselves 
or to rest du rand said there is no indication of any major 
movement north to the assembly points 
south africa says about 1900 swapo fighters began entering 
namibia on april 1 violating the un agreement that calls for the 
guerrillas to remain at their angola bases until midmay 
it said the incursion might have been a deliberate attempt to 
take advantage of the late deployment of a un monitoring force 
and thus influence namibian elections later in the year 
some namibian observers said swapo units apparently did not know 
they were breaking the peace accord by entering the territory 
swapo leader sam nujoma contended in angola that some guerrillas 
had been in namibia all along and had a right to be there on 
sunday reportedly under pressure from his angolan and cuban 
allies nujoma ordered his fighters to leave namibia 
un representative martti ahtisaari said messages were being 
broadcast on radio advising guerrillas to go to churches in the 
north as a preliminary step before reporting to un assembly 
points 
nujoma said monday in a radio interview with the british 
broadcasting corp that there is confusion about how to spread word 
of the withdrawal to his fighters he said radio broadcasts were 
useless because the guerrillas had no radios 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i and until last 
year defied un resolutions demanding that it withdraw it has 
agreed to a unbrokered regional peace accord with cuba and 
angola 
under the agreement cuba is pulling 50000 troops out of 
angola where they had fought angolan rebels backed by south africa 
about 100 british and australian troops moved into northern 
namibia under the un flag monday to help monitor the swapo 
pullout the guerrillas had until saturday to leave but louis 
pienaar south african administrator general in namibia said the 
deadline might not be strictly enforced if swapo needed more time 
in oshakati a military stronghold in northern namibia police 
chief inspector derek brune said helicopter gunships were used 
monday in a skirmish at ruacana near the angolan border 
we are not going out to look for swapo at this stage we are 
giving them a chance to gather at the assembly points he said 
ahtisaari said no official ceasefire was in effect but that 
south africa would restrain its forces 
ahtisaari said each assembly point would be staffed by 10 un 
soldiers and five monitors and would fly blue and white un 
flags he said other un personnel monitoring the cuban 
withdrawal in angola would escort swapo fighters to angolan bases

the us military can legally attack 
terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential order that bans 
assassinations of individuals abroad the armys top uniformed 
lawyer contends 
maj gen hugh overholt the services judge advocate general 
argued in an eightpage draft memorandum that because of changes in 
the nature of the threat action against terrorists can be 
justified on grounds of national selfdefense 
the employment of military force against a terrorist or 
terrorist organization to protect us citizens or the national 
security of the united states is a legitimate exercise of the 
international legal right of selfdefense and does not constitute 
assassination overholt concluded 
under that legal reasoning a soldier who shot and killed a 
terrorist could not be accused of an illegal assassination 
overholts memorandum was disclosed monday by the newsletter 
defense week and confirmed by army officials 
lt col dick bridges an army spokesman said the service had 
been encouraging legal debate within the defense and state 
departments the cia and other agencies in hopes of producing a 
common definition of assassination 
the army is attempting to update it basic law of land 
warfare field manual which hasnt been revised since 1956 
bridges said 
the existing manual has a definition for assassination which 
doesnt mean anything that dates to the hague convention of 
1907 he said this is an attempt to define what is an 
assassination and what is prohibited and what is not 
on assassination the hague convention said simply it is 
especially forbidden to kill or wound treacherously individuals 
belonging to the hostile nation or army 
bridges said overholt circulated the memo for comment last 
october and that state department and cia attorneys are still 
considering it 
the document noted that a prohibition against assassination will 
mean different things in wartime and peacetime war in essence 
legalizes the killing of the enemy it said 
during peacetime it added the standards of conduct must be 
defined under the united nations charter which recognizes the 
inherent right of selfdefense of nations and domestic laws and 
regulations 
president ford in 1976 signed presidential order 12333 banning 
attempts to assassinate foreign public leaders 
in the intervening 13 years the nature of the threat has 
changed rather than the international legal right to respond to 
the threat overholts memo said 
it is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations 
envisaged as appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed 
response by us military forces are wellfinanced highly 
organized paramilitary structures engaged full time in the illegal 
use of force it continued 
the national right of selfdefense would be appropriate to 
the attack of terrorist leaders or terrorist infrastructure that 
through their actions pose a continuing threat to us citizens or 
the national security of the united states 
a national decision to employ military force in selfdefense 
against a legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that 
employed in response to an overt conventional threat

the captain of a nuclear submarine that caught 
fire and sank pulled one last sailor through its smokefilled hatch 
before plunging into icy waters and dying reports said today 
soviet media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members 42 of 
whom died when the submarine caught went down in the norwegian sea 
on friday 
the official tass news agency said capt first class yevgeny 
vanin was the last person to leave the submarine when it started to 
sink 
but prior to that he looked once again into the submarines 
exit hatch belching out smoke one of the seamen was there tass 
said the commander helped him to get out and only after that he 
dived into the icy water swimming towards the inflatable life 
rafts 
but too much energy was expended on the struggle for saving 
the submarine and on helping his comrades the commander died 
before the very eyes of his fellow seamen the agency said 
funeral services will be held wednesday for the 42 crewmen the 
government newspaper izvestia reported monday that only 19 bodies 
had been recovered 
izvestia said a short circuit likely caused the fire on board 
the stillunidentified submarine as it was heading to port after a 
long voyage 
sailors fought the blaze for hours but several explosions 
apparently cracked the hull and sank the vessel izvestia said 
soviet officials said two of the submarines 10 torpedoes were 
nucleartipped but there is no danger of a radioactive release 
from either the torpedoes or the submarines nuclear reactor 
in a report from the arctic port of murmansk the military 
newspaper red star said planes dropped lift rafts for the sailors 
the newspaper quoted maj g petrogradskikh as saying the planes 
could not help further and the crew had to wait for surface ships 
to arrive on the scene to save them 
the first ship on the scene was a fishing vessel the alexei 
khlobystov three sailors who were rescued died of exposure on the 
after they were on board tass said 
the 27 survivors are out of danger and will be sent next week to 
resorts in the southern soviet union tass said 
the norwegian sea temperature was 3637 degrees fahrenheit and 
exposure to water that temperature can be fatal after 10 minutes 
tass said some of the survivors were in the water for more than an 
hour

maldonado rivera 53 an attorney were convicted of conspiracy and 
transporting stolen money from connecticut to mexico camacho faces 
up to 15 years in prison and maldonado face up to five years 
norman ramirez talavera 32 an artist was convicted of 
conspiracy and faces up to five years in prison 
no sentencing date was set 
judge t emmet clarie also revoked the bond of camacho after 
the verdicts were read camacho raised a clenched fist and yelled 
in spanish the imperial power is showing how small it is 
ayes a 29yearold anthropology student was acquitted of 
conspiracy 
the 5month trial had been delayed by marathon hearings on the 
admissibility of fbi tape recordings and other evidence which in 
turn triggered a debate over record pretrial detentions of some 
defendants 
segarra was held without bail for 2 years before a judge 
ordered him released on 1 million bond in february 1988 
his attorney leonard weinglass called the verdict a sham 
because the jury convicted segarra of robbery while acquitting him 
of robbery with use of a weapon 
the jurors were divided and so they split it down the middle 
thats a compromise the verdict should be set aside he said 
the 12 jurors identities were kept secret and the panel was 
bused to the court from outside the city 
the other defendants claimed they were the victims of mistaken 
identity and were prosecuted for legitimate activities for los 
macheteros which means machete wielders 
there are a lot of errors and it was a slim case said 
camachos attorney linda backiel because he was a puerto rican 
patriot he never expected justice and he wont ask for mercy 
camachos wife rebecca and two other supporters were arrested 
later for blocking traffic outside the courthouse 
as long as puerto rico is still a colony we have a moral 
obligation to fight for the independence of our country by whatever 
means are available said ayes who said he would return to 
puerto rico 
all puerto ricans are macheteros 
victoria barrera a leader of the connecticut committee against 
repression considered the trial a victory because publicity 
surrounding the case made americans more aware of puerto ricans 
struggle to be free and determine their fate 
segarra acknowledged he knew about plans for the robbery and 
received the stolen money to finance los macheteros but he 
steadfastly denied helping plan or execute the robbery 
prosecutors contended that los macheteros recruited wells fargo 
guard victor gerena to carry out the robbery then helped him 
escape to cuba where he is believed to be living 
the government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces 
of evidence including taperecorded conversations and documents 
seized from los macheteros members prosecutors presented evidence 
that los macheteros was desperate for money in 1983 and put segarra 
in charge of getting funds 
about 80000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized 
by fbi agents in puerto rico and boston on aug 30 1985 when 13 
suspects were arrested the government contends that los macheteros 
spent about 1 million moved more than 2 million to cuba and 
squirreled away about 4 million in safety deposit boxes 
certificates of deposit savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in 
puerto rico 
two other defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges before 
the trial began nine others await trial

the container holding heavy water and an 
electrode resembled a high school chemistry experiment only the 
beeps of a neutron counter showed that nuclear fusion might really 
be happening at room temperature 
theres no question its fusion said bill livesay a 
metallurgist who worked on the project at georgia institute of 
technology here i still dont believe it even though i see it 
researchers at georgia tech and at texas aampm university in 
college station texas on monday announced the results of separate 
experiments that they said appeared to confirm a university of utah 
experiment that aroused tremendous skepticism when it was announced 
last month 
james mahaffey a senior researcher at georgia tech said the 
schools experiment began detecting the release of subatomic 
neutron particles last weekend a sure sign of fusion 
its open season on fusion mahaffey said 
b stanley pons the chairman of the utah chemistry department 
said he was elated and relieved by the announcements he and a 
colleague martin fleischmann of the university of southampton 
england sent scientists around the world scrambling with their 
march 23 announcement of a controlled fusion reaction 
this is just incredible pons said in salt lake city if 
they indeed have measured the neutron production thats a real 
breakthrough my sincere congratulations to georgia tech 
nuclear fusion the melding together of two atoms with an 
accompanying release of energy normally requires enormously high 
temperatures it is the energy source of the sun and hydrogen bombs 
scientists have sought for decades to harness fusions power 
because it holds the potential to provide an almost unlimited 
supply of relatively clean cheap energy 
unlike nuclear reactors that use fission the splitting of 
atoms to derive power fusion doesnt generate significant 
radioactive waste 
in the georgia experiment which was kept behind lead shielding 
probes that normally measure 40 neutrons an hour in background 
radiation were measuring 600 an hour 
mahaffey cautioned that his team had not confirmed whether the 
process produces more energy than it consumes 
texas aampm researchers said their experiment generated a net 
1144 watts of energy in the form of heat they didnt measure 
neutrons 
the texas researchers believed the output was the result of 
fusion but said they werent ready to rule out the possibility that 
a chemical reaction was the cause 
this is a very unusual result and we have not totally 
dismissed the possibility of some unusual chemical process which we 
might have not accounted for and we are currently exploring this 
possibility further said charles martin an electrochemist at 
texas aampm 
as in utah both the georgia and texas researchers used a 
palladium electrode to pass electric current through heavy water a 
form of water that contains a heavy isotope of hydrogen the 
georgia researchers said they cut the time needed for the palladium 
to soak in heavy water by first baking it in a vacuum 
there is a need for much more money for research in this area 
if it is going to get the attention it deserves said martin 
but thats not surprising since this didnt exist two weeks ago

the confederate home for women where eight 
elderly daughters of civil war soldiers were told they would be 
taken care of for life was doomed to close because of dwindling 
financial support its chairman said 
janet burhans president and chairman of the board of managers 
for needy confederate women said monday she was too embarrassed to 
say how much money remained in the trust fund that supports the 
home and women 
the women ages 84 to 98 will be moved to more modern quarters 
20 miles outside of richmond to make way for the virginia museum of 
fine arts 
the twostory building is nestled among the magnolias behind the 
museum once the women are moved the antiques filling the home 
will be sold and the museum will move in 
the women had signed over their belongings and any future 
inheritances in exchange for their support at the home they will 
lose dozens of worn but valuable antiques in use in the home 
in exchange for the home the state will pay the cost for the 
women to live at a suburban retirement center 
officials at the home declined requests to interview the 
residents on monday 
the home with its parquet floors arched doorways marble 
fireplace antique furniture and portraits of confederate heroes 
was built in 1931 and now needs extensive repairs ms burhans said 
she said replacing the roof cost 300000 the home also needs 
new plumbing and a new heating system which would cost four times 
that amount she said 
the state was not going to appropriate the money to repair the 
home as a residence for eight ladies she said as many as 79 
women once lived there 
not all the board members were in favor of moving the women 
the museum wants our home said board member faye oliff 
they want it so bad 
theyve been like damn vultures waiting for the ladies to die 
so they can get it 
ms oliff said she tried unsuccessfully to persuade other board 
members to open the home to paying descendants of confederate 
soldiers the board also denied her proposal that a smaller home 
for the women be opened about eight blocks away 
ms burhans said watching the women leave will be hard they 
will be taken to see a retirement home this week 
they are very welladjusted said holly c dejarnette the 
homes administrator 
the homes board is to meet thursday to decide where the women 
will go ms burhans said

community back to the days of the wild west and approve poker 
blackjack and slot machines 
under an amendment to the south dakota constitution last year 
gambling limited to 5 bets will be allowed if 60 percent of 
deadwood voters approve it 
mayor tom blair predicted gambling would attract at least 
200000 additional tourists a year he estimated gaming could 
generate 500000 to further promote tourism by restoring an old 
west look to the gold rush town 
while were trying to go forward economically were going to 
the past to give us that boost blair said 
a recent telephone survey of 900 of deadwoods 1200 registered 
voters confirmed widespread support for legalized gambling the 
mayor said 
a muted minority has opposed gambling as promoting lawlessness 
there is opposition here in town and its basically on moral 
grounds said the rev don hadrick of the united methodist church

a jury resumed deliberating today whether 
three executives with a california company took part in the bribery 
of a navy official in order to win a 24 million contract from the 
military 
the four women and eight men weighing the case against dale 
schnittjer eugene sullivan and george kaub began studying the 
evidence at midafternoon on monday exactly a week after the trial 
started 
us district judge richard williams allowed jurors to go home 
after they failed to reach a verdict in eight hours 
all three defendants are former vice presidents at teledyne 
electronics in newbury park calif all are charged with 
conspiracy bribery and wire fraud for a scheme the government says 
involved paying bribes to a navy engineer in exchange for his 
confidential information about a 24 million contract to build 
handheld radar equipment 
kaub is also charged with two counts of making false statements 
all the charges carry sentences of five years except for bribery 
which carries a 15year penalty the fine is 250000 on each count 
this was a case about bribery cheating and lying thats 
exactly what it was said assistant us attorney joseph aronica 
summing up the case in his closing argument 
the government tried to show in the trial that schnittjer kaub 
and sullivan knew a private consultant hired by teledyne 
electronics had paid bribes to stuart berlin the navy engineer 
but defense attorneys depicted their clients as victims of a 
conspiracy perpetrated by berlin private consultants william 
parkin and fred lackner and michael savaides teledynes marketing 
representative in washington 
stanley mortenson schnittjers attorney said his client had 
nothing to do in that decision to pay parkin he said dale 
schnittjer is innocent 
parkin berlin lackner and savaides have pleaded guilty and are 
cooperating with the government in the first trial arising from the 
operation ill wind investigation that began nearly three years 
ago the investigation which focused on the 150billionayear 
purchasing system at the defense department attracted national 
attention when search warrants were issued for offices 
coasttocoast last june 
teledyne industries the parent company of the electronics firm 
also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements the 
company paid a total of 43 million in fines penalties and 
damages 
mark tuohey kaubs lawyer said the executive was trapped 
without knowing it by the actions of parkin and his associates 
this was their own conspiracy their conspiracy to defraud 
teledyne and then hide the ball he said referring to parkin and 
his compatriots my client was kept in the dark said george 
oconnell sullivans attorney 
but aronica said the teledyne executives were part of the scheme 
to defraud the government they were responsible for agreeing to 
pay parkin 10000 in november 1985 to help win the radar contract 
once the contract was awarded parkins deal called for him to 
receive 150000 a portion of which he got before ill wind was 
made public 
but for these defendants the grease for the skids would not 
have flowed aronica said 
they aided and abetted in getting the money to parkin he 
said

the citys first black school superintendent may 
lose his job four years after many hailed his hiring as another 
step in healing racial bitterness that stemmed from courtordered 
busing 
the boston school committee is expected to vote whether to renew 
the contract of laval s wilson even though the committee voted 
85 in october to rehire him months of debate has changed some 
members minds 
a recent straw poll showed six opposing renewal five favoring 
it and two undecided 
wilsons detractors say he lacks leadership abilities and accuse 
him of not doing enough to lower the high dropout rate 
supporters of the 53yearold chicago native say he needs more 
time to develop his programs and begin new ones they also say 
wilson is dedicated and hardworking 
the city has been rocked by racial tension and violence in the 
years following the 1974 desegration order 
this isnt a racial issue its a competence and quality 
issue said peggy davismullen a white member of the board 
hes a diligent worker but his approach isnt meeting the needs 
of the children of boston 
although the school budget has increased in four years by about 
100 million to 361 million mrs davismullen said the dropout 
rate has gone up i dont think he has a firm grasp of the type 
of students we have here she said 
in 1972 enrollment was 96000 60 percent of them white today 
there are 59000 students 24 percent white 
school committee member jean mcguire who in 1985 voted against 
hiring wilson because of his conservative philosophies said the 
superintendent deserves more of a chance she is one of four black 
members on the board 
you really cant get anything done changing horses in 
midstream just changing who it is right now isnt going to change 
a thing she said the system has had eight superintendents in 
the last 19 years 
wilson also is backed by members of the vault the nickname for 
a group of 25 prominent bankers and business executives interested 
in education and urban issues 
vault chairman harold hestnes a lawyer said monday that 
wilsons difficulties were based on the size of the school 
committee and its competing constituencies 
working with a 13member school committee seems impossible to 
me hestnes said its a difficult system under the best of 
circumstances and he isnt in the best of circumstances 
two committee members met with wilson on monday night but 
declined to comment 
wilson also has declined to comment he did not return telephone 
messages on monday his attorney fletcher wiley said the 
committee was obligated to rehire him based on octobers vote 
recently at the request of the school committee wilson gave 
himself a report card he gave himself high marks for dedication 
for raising math and reading scores on national standardized tests 
and for lowering the dropout rate 
test scores have risen only marginally and the dropout rate is 
in dispute 
by wilsons figures fewer youngsters are quitting school other 
school system figures however show increasing attrition in class 
size between ninth grade and graduation day the class of 1983 was 
33 percent smaller than when it began the class of 87 eroded by 
40 percent 
he said he could do better at sharing power and consulting with 
community groups and parents but his bottom line was that he 
needed more time 
the boston public schools didnt develop problems overnight 
and neither laval wilson nor any other superintendent will solve 
them overnight wilson wrote in the assessment 
he said if he kept the job he would push his boston education 
plan which focuses on improving math and reading and giving 
principals and teachers more latitude 
one problem hes faced in the contract negotiations has been his 
timing 
last fall for example he asked for an 18000 housing 
allowance on top of his 95000 salary the request came at a time 
when school budget cuts loomed after much criticism he withdrew 
the allowance proposal he now is asking for a threeyear contract 
starting at 95000 with future raises linked to what is given to 
teachers and administrators 
shortly after he was hired he was granted his request for a 
15000 raise

swedens security police keep files on 
peoples political views and too often work in secret and on the 
margins of the law a government report said today 
the report followed the resignation monday of sune sandstrom 
head of the secret service since 1987 he said the government had 
lost confidence in him and apparently wanted a more political man 
in the job rather than only a policeman 
the secret service came under sharp attack after the 1986 
assassination of prime minister olof palme because some security 
officials took part in a private hunt for a suspect 
the new 215page report urged tighter supervision of the secret 
service and greater documentation of its work 
it was compiled over six months by carl lidbom swedens 
ambassador to france and submitted to the government today the 
government ordered the report independently of the palme scandal 
when the agency came under criticism for keeping political files 
and other issues 
lidbom confirmed that the sakerhetspolis or sapo as the 
security police are known kept files on political opinions of 
civil servants and citizens in most cases the practice is barred 
by the constitution 
the ambassador also said sapo may have used illegal wiretaps in 
some of its antiterrorist and counterespionage operations 
seemingly it has been characteristic for sapo to conduct its 
work in a gray zone between the legal and illegal the ethical and 
unethical the report said 
the disclosure of irregularities in the private operation to 
find palmes killer shadowed the government of prime minister 
ingvar carlsson for most of last year 
several sapo officers were enlisted in a private investigation 
they were uncovered smuggling eavesdropping equipment into the 
country 
the scandal led to the resignations of a national police chief 
and a justice minister 
a 42yearold man suspected in palmes killing was arrested dec 
14 officials have said the trial of the suspect christer 
pettersson will start may 29 pettersson has denied he shot palme 
at a news conference today lidbom recommended that sandstoms 
replacement have broader experience and not necessarily come 
from the ranks of the national police 
he also said the agency should be required to gain prior 
approval for wiretapping from the justice chancellor or another 
oversight body 
lidbom a senior member of the governing social democratic 
party was a controversial choice to investigate the secret 
service since he was sharply critical of sapo in the past 
he said sapo had followed the lead of other countries 
intelligence agencies in working in secret he did not name the 
other nations 
it has become the practice to leave as few tracks as 
possible he said of the agencys working methods

oliver north used his good offices in an 
attempt to help irancontra codefendant richard secord get a 
halfmillion dollars for renting a ship to the cia the prosecutor 
at norths trial said today 
north said that acting on behalf of secord he offered the 
danishregistered ship erria to the cia which eventually turned 
down the offer 
he could make for renting this ship as much as 500000 
prosecutor john keker said as north took the witness stand in us 
district court for a fourth day 
and that is totally separate from any situation involving 
me the former national security council aide responded 
north is accused of accepting a 13800 home security system 
from secord free of charge 
you are using your good offices to rent this ship said 
keker 
no responded north he pointed out that the cia decided not 
to rent the ship which was to have been used by the cia to 
broadcast into libya 
keker presented messages that secord had sent to north stating 
that the ship was worth more than 400000 keker said the ship had 
cost 300000 
one of the messages says secord would charge 50000 a month for 
risk for six months 
another word for risk is profit said keker north had 
enlisted secord a retired air force major general to run arms to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
on monday the prosecutor questioned whether secord had helped 
pay for a motor vehicle for north 
north said he paid for the vehicle and other possessions by 
dipping into a family fund created by insurance settlements and 
years of yard sales puppy sales and collecting spare change not 
the cash intended for irancontra activities 
north said the 15000 family fund got its start in 1967 with an 
insurance settlement from an auto crash and he tossed spare change 
into the metal box bolted to the closet floor when he came home at 
night 
we had a yard sale or two and i think my wife sold some 
puppies north added 
the change out of your pocket grew to 15000 in your house 
keker asked north said yes 
keker tried to show during crossexamination that north played 
loose with the 240000 to 300000 that north administered from an 
office safe to finance the iran arms initiative and aid the 
nicraguan rebels 
keker suggested that secord helped north pay for a used 
chevrolet suburban that cost 8038 
keker also tried to show that north arranged for 200000 in 
free life insurance allowed his colleagues to make huge profits on 
irancontra dealings and accepted a free security fence 
i got a lot of money from general secord on a lot of 
occasions north said when asked whether he had gotten money from 
secord on oct 5 1985 the day he bought the car 
north had enlisted secord to run arms and other supplies to the 
contras during a twoyear ban on military aid to the rebels 
the cash fund north operated out of his office safe was financed 
by contra leader adolfo calero and by secord whose office was a 
mile or two away from the car dealership 
this car has nothing to do with calero or secord but with the 
fund that ollie north set up in 1967 north said firmly 
the quarter of a million dollars or more he spent out of his 
office safe went to support the contras and the iran arms 
initiative and thats what it was used for north testified 
north said he destroyed the ledger which tracked the money in 
his office safe on orders from thencia director william casey the 
order came after a contra resupply plane was shot down in nicaragua 
on oct 5 1986 threatening to expose the covert operation he 
said north is accused of converting 4300 from the office safe 
fund to his own use 
you had gotten loose keker snapped 
i hadnt gotten loose north snapped back i was working 
my tail off 
you had loosened up the standards said keker 
you said that i hadnt insisted north

funeral march for the slain palestinian 
the three detainees are suspected of being linked to what 
happened yesterday but are not suspected of the actual shooting 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sanduri said 
he declined to identify the men beyond saying two were from 
jerusalem and one lived elsewhere in israel the suspects were 
detained monday night and were still in custody sanduri said 
mourners decried israel during the funeral procession through 
the temple mount compound some shouting we warn the jews 
mohammeds army will return 
police opened fire after one youth smashed a window with his 
fist and others broke two windows with rocks 
about 1000 relatives and friends took part in the funeral march 
for khaled shawish the 26yearold blacksmith killed monday when 
an attacker dressed in army fatigues and believed to be an 
israeli opened fire with an uzi submachine gun 
the gunman who escaped on foot also wounded three other 
palestinians in the attack outside the jaffa gate entrance to the 
old walled city of jerusalem 
a caller claiming to represent a jewish extremist group claimed 
responsibility for the shootings 
earlier today several dozen masked palestinian youths gathered 
at shawishs old city home waving palestinian flags and vowing 
revenge against jews police watched from nearby rooftops 
one youth masked with a kafiyyeh and hoisted on the shoulders 
of another shouted we should teach the jews a lesson 
everything jewish in this town should be burned we should prove 
that this is palestinian and teach them a lesson of what a 
palestinian state means 
other youths shouted revolution against the occupier and 
we want a palestinian state 
one associated press reporter taking notes was grabbed and 
threatened by masked youths another was hit in the stomach with a 
rock 
in arab east jerusalem today most merchants shuttered their 
shops in a general strike called to protest mondays shootings 
a general strike today virtually closed the occupied gaza strip 
where leaflets from the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement urged 
residents to protest the deportation of more than 40 palestinians 
by israel during the 16month palestinian uprising 
in the occupied west bank city of hebron merchants shut their 
shops today to mourn a 22yearold palestinian who was shot to 
death in a clash with soldiers on monday night 
the death raised to 423 the number of palestinians killed in the 
uprising eighteen israelis also have died 
arab reports said four palestinians were wounded by army gunfire 
during stonethrowing protests today in gaza including a 
90yearold woman who was hit by a bullet in the left leg in the 
shati refugee camp 
stoning protests were reported in ramallah and several 
neighboring west bank camps but there were no reported casualties 
in tel aviv today an israeli teenager stabbed and wounded two

palestinians and then stabbed them 
an anonymous caller telephoned reporters monday night to claim 
responsibility for the shootings in jerusalem for the sicarites a 
group named after jewish assassins who fought the roman forces 
nearly 2000 years ago 
the caller who spoke hebrew with a french or north african 
accent said the shootings were in retaliation for stonethrowing 
attacks on jews during the palestinian uprising 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandouri said police were quite 
sure the assailant was jewish but had not determined his motive 
sicarites members have asserted responsibility or been blamed 
for at least eight arson attacks against israeli moderates but 
they have not attacked arabs directly and there were no known 
casualties in the previous incidents 
mondays shootings came as tensions ran high in the old city

the house ethics committee has concluded that 
speaker jim wright probably violated the chambers rules by failing 
to report benefits from a texas business partner as gifts 
a source familiar with the investigation said late monday that 
the committee has found reason to believe that wright violated 
the giftreporting rules on benefits given to him and his wife by 
the business associate in fort worth 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to say 
how many instances of failure to report gifts had been identified 
by the panel 
but the number could easily be in the dozens because several 
benefits wright received continued over a period of years and would 
have had to be reported on each years financial disclosure form 
among the benefits under scrutiny are his virtually free use of a 
condominium in texas an 18000 salary for his wife betty and 
use of a 1979 cadillac 
cbs news reported monday that the committee had found about 30 
instances of possible rules violations by wright 
we think its an absurd report said mark johnson wrights 
press secretary we have absolutely no information along those 
lines 
the committee resumed deliberations today and senior members of 
the panel said they still hoped to reach some conclusions in the 
case this week but neither chairman julian dixon dcalif nor 
senior republican john myers of indiana would comment on votes 
taken so far 
im not going to judge whether the reports are premature or 
not premature dixon told reporters 
theres some truth and some misinformation about every 
statement weve read added myers 
the panels current deliberations are not unlike those of a 
grand jury 
finding reason to believe that rules have been violated 
would be equivalent to an indictment of wright the speaker would 
then have a chance to defend himself in a disciplinary hearing the 
equivalent of a trial 
wright reported his wifes employment with fort worth developer 
george mallick on his financial disclosure forms as salary for her 
work but the ethics panels outside counsel richard phelan 
argued that the salary amounted to a gift because mrs wright did 
little work in exchange for it 
wright mallick and their wives jointly formed a small 
investment company called mallightco and used it to make 
several investments mrs wright first drew her salary directly 
from mallicks development company and then from the partnership 
between 1981 and 1984 
wright made no mention on the disclosure forms of the car or the 
condominium which he now contends were simply fringe benefits from 
mrs wrights employment 
remaining to be resolved are a number of more serious charges 
against wright including whether mallick had direct interest in 
legislation before congress that would make any gift worth more 
than 100 improper under house rules 
also remaining to be decided is whether wright used his book 
reflections of a public man as a device to evade limits on 
outside income in several instances the speaker made bulk sales of 
the book to interest groups in lieu of accepting speaking fees 
honoraria for speeches are limited under the rules but book 
royalties are not 
the committee is struggling with the question of whether wright 
in the committees parlance recharacterized money that was 
intended as a speaking fee into book income or whether the book 
sales constitute an entirely separate and permissible business deal 
the ethics panel since last june has been conducting what it 
terms a preliminary inquiry and has spent upwards of 1 million 
on investigating wrights dealings over the past four decades 
if it finds reason to believe rules were violated in any of the 
dozens of instances cited by its outside counsel the panel would 
vote to include them in a statement of alleged violation 
wright would have up to 21 days to respond then the committee 
would vote on whether to proceed to a disciplinary hearing 
if the committee concludes that the allegations have been 
proven it can recommend that the full house impose punishment 
ranging from a reprimand or denial of privileges to expulsion 
if the committee finds the violations to be only technical 
it may recommend no punishment wright in recent weeks has argued 
that any violations he may have committed would fall into that 
category

royal aide timothy laurence whose letters to 
princess anne have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble 
was dropped from queen elizabeth iis entourage at the public 
premiere of a new london musical 
but buckingham palace stressed in a statement that laurence had 
remained on duty back at windsor castle 21 miles west of london 
the bachelor a royal navy commander had been scheduled to 
accompany the queen annes mother to a charity performance monday 
night of composer andrew lloyd webbers new show aspects of 
love in londons west end 
as scotland yard investigated the theft of four of laurences 
letters to anne from the palace speculation about her 15year 
marriage to mark phillips made frontpage news again today in 
londons royalmad tabloids 
phillips a farmer and equestrian is a former captain in the 
queens dragoon guards rumors his marriage to anne is in trouble 
have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six 
months a year apart 
they have two children peter 11 and zara 7 
dashing queens equerry aide tim laurence is besotted with 
princess anne and believes she loves him too the sun britains 
largest circulation newspaper reported today quoting unnamed 
friends of laurence 
the handsome 34yearold naval commander often speaks to her 
on the phone late at night sometimes for more than an hour and he 
meets her secretly whenever possible in london or at country 
homes 
annes fatherinlaw maj peter phillips denied monday that 
the marriage was on the rocks and said he spoke to his son as 
recently as sunday 
he would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the 
conversation was about horses phillips said 
its not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would 
understand at all they spend so much time away from one another 
if people are royal they dont necessarily spend lots of time 
together of course their marriage is very unusual 
the british domestic news agency press association said anne 
38 and her 40yearold husband were reunited for six hours 
overnight at their country mansion gatcombe park 90 miles west of 
london after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in 
northwest england 
the news agency said anne arrived home after midnight but left 
about 6 am to go horseback riding when she returned three hours 
later to prepare for engagements in london phillips had left the 
house his business agent taryn bennelick said today he was 
somewhere in spain but gave no details 
anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired member 
of britains royal family as president of the save the children 
fund charity she travels on behalf of children in povertystricken 
and wartorn third world countries phillips also travels widely on 
various business and equestrian interests 
the latest speculation about the couples marriage began after 
the sun reported thursday that it had been sent anonymously four 
letters stolen from annes desk at buckingham palace 
the sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had 
turned them over to scotland yard 
after a sunday newspaper told buckingham palace it was going to 
name the author the palace identified laurence 
royalty correspondent richard kay wrote today in the daily mail 
anne and mark no longer have a marriage in the conventional 
sense 
but kay predicted there wont be any announcement of a 
divorce for it is she who has brought back much 
respectability to the royal family at a time when popularity and 
support are on the wane certainly the old guard at the palace 
would be appalled at the thought of another divorce within the 
royal family 
princess margaret annes aunt and the queens only sister was 
divorced in 1978 from lord snowdon who has since remarried

eastern airlines unions agreed to big wage 
concessions with peter v ueberroth but added a demand that must be 
resolved if the former baseball commissioner is to take control of 
the airline by tonights deadline 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
must accept those changes in the 464 million deal if the purchase 
is to go forward said sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the unions demanded that the bankruptcy court appoint a trustee 
to operate eastern as the airline emerges from chapter 11 union 
sources said 
a union legal adviser told the associated press the demand was 
aimed at assuring speedy and orderly transition 
were more than a little concerned about what can happen while 
lorenzo is on his way out the source said 
an exhausted ueberroth told reporters outside the courthouse 
monday evening we have one more major bridge to cross and 
thats right here in this courthouse that bridge must be crossed 
theres no guarantee we will cross it 
ueberroths deal with texas air is scheduled to expire at 
midnight 
we have not yet seen a copy of the agreement we understand it 
is very complex and we will study it texas air spokesman art 
kent said late monday from the companys headquarters in houston 
theres no agreement as far as were concerned said bruce 
zirinsky a lawyer for eastern who attended the new york meetings 
after four days of intense negotiations ueberroth announced 
that his investor group had reached a historic labor 
partnership with leaders representing easterns machinists 
pilots and flight attendants unions 
sources said the fiveyear agreement gives the unions a 30 
percent share of miamibased eastern in exchange for 210 million 
in pay cuts and workrule concessions the accord must be ratified 
by rankandfile members 
ueberroth and other parties to the talks have declined to give 
details because of a gag order imposed by bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland ueberroth said talks would continue today in an effort 
to get eastern the nations seventhlargest airline back in the 
air 
eastern has been largely grounded since machinists struck march 
4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support the 
airline filed for bankruptcy protection five days later 
under the agreement the machinists union would give up about 
150 million in wage and benefit cuts or essentially what lorenzo 
wanted us to take before the strike a union source said the 
figures are smaller for other unions because after lorenzo bought 
eastern three years ago the pilots and flight attendants accepted 
pay cuts but the machinists did not 
the pact must be approved by easterns major creditors as well 
as texas air 
the agreement was reached early monday in washington and 
participants flew rival pan am corps shuttle to new york and 
continued talks at the bankruptcy courthouse in manhattan 
lawyers for eastern and some of its creditors were at the 
courthouse meetings 
former defense secretary frank carlucci also was present for 
some of the meetings but he declined to identify his role 
carlucci is a vice chairman of the carlyle group a washington 
investment firm 
union sources said carluccis name surfaced several weeks ago as 
a possible candidate for the trustee position 
courtappointed examiner david i shapiro was instrumental in 
forging the agreement with the unions sources said he had been in 
almost nonstop meetings with ueberroths representatives in 
washington since thursday night 
it wouldnt have happened without him said a participant in 
the talks shapiro gave the impression he would have thrown 
people in jail if they had walked out of the discussions the 
source said 
the agreement also would cover 11000 nonunion employees 
including reservation clerks ticket agents and clerical workers 
ueberroth said 
a representative of nonunion employees mary grace shore said 
her group objected to not being represented in the talks 
eastern has said it could resume 80 percent of its prestrike 
schedule within about 10 days after a final agreement is approved 
by all parties although some union officials have said it could 
take 45 days or longer

twelve longterm jewish refuseniks many 
of whom were denied exit visas on grounds they knew state secrets 
have received permission to leave the soviet union according to 
the national conference on soviet jewry 
they are the largest single group to be granted visas at one 
time since the summit meeting between former president reagan and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev last december in new york 
included in the list are aleksandr piatetsky of kiev who has 
waited 15 years for a visa mark berenfeld of moscow 12 years and 
inna gorenshrain of leningrad 12 years 
shoshana s cardin chairman of the soviet jewry group said in 
a statement monday while we are encouraged by the resolution of 
the cases of so many longterm refuseniks we regret that many who 
seek to emigrate are still denied their right to do so 
emigration from the soviet union last month was the highest 
since october 1979 
knowledge of sensitive information was given frequently in the 
past as a reason for denying visas to jewish scientists or others 
who had been involved in government work one of the reforms 
pledged by gorbachev was to ease the restriction

prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
emerged from talks with secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
today and said he sees no need for un assistance in arranging 
peace in the middle east 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc rejects the concept 
of an international peace conference under un auspices on the 
grounds that israel would be pressured to trade land for peace

readiness of the united nations to help when it is asked for it 
and is ready always to do something shamir told reporters after 
his 30minute meeting with perez de cuellar 
for the moment there is not any necessity for it if it will 
be necessary we will not hesitate to ask for it said shamir 
i dont think that we see at this moment any special role for 
the united nations if there would be any proposal connected with 
the united nations we will discuss it with the 
secretarygeneral he added 
shamir is promoting a peace plan based on holding elections in 
the israelioccupied territories so palestinians could choose 
representatives to negotiate with israel over the future status of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
most palestinians including the palestine liberation 
organization have rejected the concept of elections held under 
israeli rule and insist on an independent palestinian state

and nausea after being exposed to fumes from the blaze monday

downtown los angeles was evacuated overnight because of possibly 
toxic fumes

out rather than risk exposure to toxic chemicals the plant blends 
chemicals for pharmacies 
the company stocked acids cyanide explosive hydrogen and 
corrosives including some chemicals that react with water perry 
said 
because of the chemicals you cant use water on it the fire 
is burning through the roof with 75 to 100foot flames said 
denise beaumont another fire department spokeswoman 
firefighters hosed down an adjoining business and set up dikes 
to prevent the possibly contaminated water from reaching the santa

larger quanitities of chemicals than allowed on the premises the 
citation for violating county ordinances has yet to reach court he

foreign missions in nepal have urged 
india which has halted most exports and transit to this landlocked 
country in a border dispute to let their diplomats have more 
gasoline diplomats said tuesday 
india closed most border checkpoints after indonepalese trade 
and transport treaties expired march 23 effectively imposing an 
economic blockage that has caused fuel medicine and food shortages 
and led to rationing 
on monday news reports in bangladesh said the move completely 
shut down its nations exports to nepal which were transported 
through india 
at the united nations about 50 nepalese demonstrated monday to 
protest the border closings and appealed to india to reopen them 
india closed 13 of 15 checkpoints along the 1090mile border 
after the treaties expired nepal wants two new treaties while 
india demands a unified treaty combining transport and trade 
agreements 
in a statement tuesday to katmandus 19 diplomatic missions the 
foreign office said diplomatic personnel could approach india for 
supplies for their use since indias sanctions were aimed at the 
nepalese and not foreigners residing in nepal 
the diplomats made the request at a friday meeting at the indian 
embassy said an asian diplomat on condition of anonymity 
one western diplomat also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the weekly government gas ration for diplomats has been 
reduced from 53 gallons per car immediately after march 23 
closings to 4 gallons 
private motorists in katmandu can buy 16 gallons a week and 
taxi drivers are allowed 15 liters the rationing has led to long 
queues at filling stations 
for cooking fuel housewives have turned increasingly to nepals 
already dwindling forests because of a shortage of kerosene 
we just get a ration of three liters 07 gallons a week for 
a family of seven members do you think it would be enough to 
prepare the meals asked one woman maya devi sakya 
in dhaka the united news of bangladesh news agency said more 
than 20000 tons of fertilizer sold to nepal remains stockpiled in 
bangladesh for want of transit facilities through india

has developed friendly political and economic ties with china 
which it borders along the tibetan region the katmandu government 
recently bought chinese arms for its 30000strong military and 
said they were needed to defend against domestic terrorist threats

a grand jury will investigate whether a former 
detective committed perjury in testifying against randall dale 
adams who was freed from prison after his 1977 murder conviction 
was overturned a prosecutor says 
adams attorneys have accused gus rose of changing his version 
of adams reaction to being arrested for the 1976 slaying of police 
officer robert wood 
assistant district attorney hugh lucas said monday the 
allegation will be heard by a grand jury probably in two or three 
weeks 
rose now chief deputy constable in garland testified in 
december that adams never denied shooting wood and that adams 
claimied to have had a blackout about what happened 
but adams attorneys countered that rose stated in the 1988 
documentary the thin blue line that adams had almost 
overreacted his innocence 
there was no reason for him to lie on film said defense 
attorney george a preston who asked district attorney john vance 
for the grand jury review 
adams conviction was questioned in the thin blue line 
which pointed instead to adams accuser david ray harris as the 
killer 
the texas court of criminal appeals last month threw out 
adamsconviction ruling prosecutors suppressed evidence and 
allowed perjury at the 1977 trial vance later dropped the charges 
there was not enough evidence for a retrial

a judge has authorized the sheriff to 
seize public or private property for powstyle camps to relieve 
jail overcrowding 
district judge michael schattman issued the order monday in an 
attempt to get the state to pay for housing its prisoners in county 
jails 
the state is under a federal court order to keep its prisons 
below capacity and has refused to accept prisoners from most texas 
counties leaving local jails overcrowded with inmates who have 
been sentenced to state prison 
county officials want to be reimbursed for housing such 
prisoners 
schattman instructed sheriff don carpenter to requisition on 
the credit of the state of texas any property needed for 
temporary jails carpenter said he believes a warehouse in fort 
worth would be a good site for a prison camp 
the judge also instructed the sheriff to ask gov bill clements 
to send national guardsmen to patrol the compounds if the governor 
refuses the judge authorized the sheriff to deputize as many 
guards as he needs

the white house put some distance today 
between president bush and drug policy coordinator william 
bennetts criticism of district of columbia mayor marion barry jr 
and his handling of drugrelated crime 
we are in this to solve the drug problem not to pick 
fights said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater when asked if 
bush was ready to second bennetts criticism 
this is a very serious problem that has to be worked out with 
the authorities that were elected and charged with dealing with 
these problems said the presidential spokesman 
asked if the president supports bennett fitzwater replied 
absolutely he supports everything bennett says and does 
barry said he welcomed the federal governments planned major 
drive on drugrelated crime in the capital but rejected bennetts 
contention that his administrations poor performance made the 
intervention necessary 
bennetts plan announced monday calls for construction of 
pretrial detention and prison facilities expansion of a local law 
enforcement task force efforts to rid public housing of drug users 
and dealers expansion of drug treatment facilities and an increase 
in job training programs 
however the dc government will receive no direct funding 
instead bennett said the efforts 70 million to 80 million 
estimated cost will come from existing federal programs 
ive said this as frankly as possible the local government 
has not acted in as responsible a way as it should bennett said 
the plain fact is that for too long and in too many respects 
the dc government has failed to serve its citizens 
barry who is under federal investigation for his relationships 
with a suspected cocaine dealer refused to accept reporters 
questions monday but he went on nbctvs today show this 
morning to defend the local antidrug effort 
the dc government i think has been vigorous weve had 
more people arrested than any other city in america over 12000 
people in jail getting longer sentences barry said 
i think weve got to begin to attack the social causes of 
drug abuse he said noting cuts in federal education job and 
housing programs during the reagan administration and he said the 
federal government needed to do a better job of stopping the 
importation of drugs 
im like any other mayor barry said we welcome all the 
help we can we will fight as hard as we can were going to win 
this war 
washington became the nations per capita murder capital last 
year with 372 slayings most of them drugrelated this year there 
have been 135 homicides compared with 87 at the same time last 
year 
barry had said monday he was grateful for extra federal help in 
the drug war but abruptly left a news conference before reporters 
could ask him if he had been stung by bennetts comments 
we welcome the idea of washington being a model in the war on 
drugs barry said we look forward to a long working 
relationship 
we dont feel that the city has failed in its management in 
this area said city administrator carol thompson who fielded 
questions after the mayors sudden departure 
rick blake a barry spokesman said the mayor had staff meetings 
to attend and could not wait for the completion of the press 
conference 
barry said he had discussed the plans at length with bennett 
but bennett played down the mayors involvement 
i briefed mayor barry today by telephone bennett said i 
gave him a brief outline of the whole thing and we chatted for a 
few minutes 
bennett refused to elaborate on barrys role but congressional 
and district government sources said bennett had frozen the mayor 
out of his deliberations 
there are normal channels you go through and thats barry 
but bennett was going directly to agency heads said one district 
government source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
we were told that they were not dealing with barry added a 
congressional source who had been briefed on the plan by bennetts 
assistants they said the only person who had any credibility in 
this administration was police chief maurice t turner 
barry who has been questioned by a federal grand jury about his 
ties to accused crack cocaine dealer and former city employee 
charles lewis is under fire from democrats and republicans alike 
on capitol hill senate democrats criticized barry for his lack of 
coordinated plans for fighting the crime problem while rep stan 
parris rva has introduced legislation to give the federal 
government control of the citys public safety system 
bennetts effort includes housing 250 city inmates at federal 
prisons construction of a 500bed pretrial detention facility 
within one year and construction of a new 700bed federal prison 
for the washingtonbaltimore area within two years 
bennett faulted the district government for failing to construct 
the detention facility in the three years since cogress 
appropriated money for it saying that due to the lack of space 
thousands of people arrested for drug and other serious crimes in 
this city regularly go free 
meanwhile a washingtonarea drug task force will get an 
additional 57 investigators under the plan including 25 fbi agents 
and 11 drug enforcement administration agents 
five defense department intelligence analysts also will be 
assigned to the task force which will concentrate on identifying 
crack distributors 
on mrch 13 the day he was sworn into office bennett had said 
he viewed washington as a test case to determine what federal 
efforts will work as he compiles a national drug control strategy 
that plan is due 180 days after he took over the job 
barrys ties to lewis were called into question in december 
when undercover police on their way to lewis hotel room to make a 
drug buy were abruptly called back when it was learned that the 
mayor was in the room with the suspect barry has declined to 
discuss his dealings with lewis but has repeatedly denied using 
drugs 
lewis subsequently was arrested in early march in the virgin 
islands where he is charged with selling crack cocaine to 
undercover agents

voters went to the polls today with mayor tom 
bradley so heavily favored for an unprecedented fifth term that 
turnout was expected to hit an alltime low 
bradley 71 needed to capture at least 50 percent of the votes 
against nine opponents to avoid a june 6 runoff for the fouryear 
office none of the candidates runs on a party line 
the only serious challenger freshman city councilman nate 
holden has accused bradley of ignoring his roots and the citys 
impoverished south side and favoring big business and foreign trade 
hes been in office too long said holden who like bradley 
is black theyre not going to vote for him out of habit 
anymore 
on monday city clerk lee lee martinez predicted turnout of 25 
percent to 30 percent a historical low for a mayoral election 
turnout figures were not immediately available this morning 
but bradley the son of sharecroppers and grandson of slaves 
has managed to escape responsibility for many of the citys 
problems including drugs and gangs 
even a current investigation of bradley by the city attorneys 
office for performing consulting work with two banks that do 
business with the city seemed to have had little effect on the 
mayor bradley has returned the 18000 fees he was paid and called 
the charges politically motivated 
pollsters and wouldbe candidates conclude that bradley a 
congenial former city police lieutenant and councilman has managed 
to be associated with los angeles emergence as a pacific rim 
economic power and growth as a multiethnic cultural center 
the citys population is swelling past 3 million making it the 
nations secondlargest and more than 70 languages are spoken 
bradleys name has been carefully linked to projects such as the 
profitable 1984 summer olympics the development of a skyscraper 
skyline downtown the revamping of los angeles international 
airport where the international terminal bears his name and the 
construction of a multibilliondollar railline transit system 
metro rail 
his stewardship has been less linked in the public mind with 
criminal infestation illegal drug trafficking street congestion 
overbuilding pollution and a failing sewage system 
in a recent los angeles times poll 65 percent surveyed said 
their quality of life worsened during the bradley years to the 
point that half have recently considered moving 
however in another times poll 78 percent of hispanics 70 
percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable 
impression of the democratic mayor 
they the public are not holding him accountable for it the 
drugs and the gangs are causing it but they dont think tom 
bradley is causing it hes a lucky politician said joe cerrell 
a los angelesbased political consultant who has known bradley 
since he was a police lieutenant in the 1950s 
arnold steinberg a political pollster and consultant said a 
docile media and a perception that the citys problems are so huge 
that they appear unsolvable add to bradleys aura of immunity 
the other mayoral hopefuls were socialist joel britton an oil 
refinery worker singerdancer eileen anderson teachers raul reyes 
and maria elizabeth munoz consultant khushro ghandhi aerospace 
worker stewart alexander politician leonard earl miropol and 
political scientist gary passi 
other los angeles races included eight of the city councils 15 
seats city attorney controller and school board members

runaway everglades brushfires sent thick black 
smoke across the miami area today prompting health warnings and an 
order to evacuate 700 aliens from a detention camp 
i thought my garage was on fire this morning the smoke was so 
heavy said anna nasher who lives in suburban coral gables 
the national weather service advised people with asthma 
emphysema or other respiratory problems to stay indoors 
its very serious weve got an emergency said perry 
rivkind district director of the immigration and naturalization 
service 
rivkind this morning ordered the evacuation of aliens from the 
krome avenue detention center on the edge of the everglades as a 
brushfire advanced to within a mile but by early afternoon the 
aliens were still awaiting buses 
rivkind said the immigrants would be taken to the bobby maduro 
baseball stadium which recently was used as a home for nicaraguan 
refugees but city manager cesar odio suggested they might be 
transferred to a facility in texas 
smoke from fires some 20 miles away including 3000 burning 
acres of driedout sawgrass blocked the subtropical sun and slowed 
traffic 
this smoke has reached at or close to the ground in many areas 
and has reduced visibilities the weather service said in a 
statement 
forecasters said the thick smoke would hang over the area until 
an evening sea breeze blew it back into the everglades

larry marsman and harold christiansen live 
half a world apart but christiansen has given the younger man a 
link to the father he never knew an aviator shot down over 
indonesia in world war ii 
christiansen had carried a wedding band belonging to robert 
marsman an aviator in the dutch royal navy since the ring was 
given to him by natives on an indonesian island in 1945 
i kept that ring all these years thinking that some day 
somewhere we would find marsmans widow christiansen said in a 
telephone interview from his home in new south wales australia 
all we had to go on was the name dorothy that was on the inside 
of the ring 
with the help of members of marsmans old 18th squadron and a 
lot of luck christiansen finally made contact with the family in 
brandon in 1987 the retired major mailed the ring to the marsman 
family and later traveled to mississippi to visit the fliers widow 
and son 
completing this has been one of the highlights of my life 
said christiansen 
theres no way to tell you what this has meant to me 
marsman said i was two weeks old when his mitchell bomber went 
down and all i knew from childhood was that he was missing in 
action and thats all my mother ever knew 
christiansen said his unit was assigned to sweep through kai 
island in search of lingering japanese or australian and dutch 
soldiers 
i was given the ring by the head man of the island who told 
me about this flier whose body had washed up on the beach 
christiansen said 
the head man asked that i find dorothy the name enscribed 
on the ring and told him that name tags showed the fliers name 
was robert marsman christiansen said 
at the end of the war the dutch government did not yet have 
complete records and nobody i contacted seemed to know about 
dutchmen flying into those islands it was not until three or four 
years ago that i was able to get on the trail christiansen said 
he spotted the name robert marsman in a book written by gordon 
wallace and detailing the history of the 18th squadron and wrote 
wallace asking help 
wallace contacted dutch officials who were able to search their 
completed files and learned dorothys maiden name and that she 
lived in mississippi 
the elder marsman whose parents were in the dutch east indies 
and were captured by the japanese joined the dutch royal navy and 
was sent to mississippi to learn to fly b25 
at jackson robert marsman and 16yearold dorothy jean usry of 
brandon met fell in love and married 
it is a good feeling to know that this is finally settled 
said dorothy baker who later remarried and lives in jackson 
seeing that ring was a real surprise a shock all i ever knew 
was the fact that his plane had exploded in midair over those 
islands 
the family is trying to get marsmans remains buried in a war 
cemetery in indonesia returned to mississippi and buried in a 
small cemetery for dutch pilots who died in training 
he wanted to be buried back here if anything happened to 
him said mrs baker and it would mean a lot for larry 
however efforts to secure help from the american and dutch 
governments to exhume the body havent been successful so far 
the united states trained him and he fought for freedom 
larry marsman said he wanted to be buried here because he felt 
his family was here i know this sounds silly but i think thats 
why this ring has worked its way back through all these years hes 
telling me to do something and i pray that i can

us surgeon general c everett koop has 
praised sarasota for its support of a family driven from their 
hometown in an adjacent county because three brothers were exposed 
to the aids virus 
koop on monday presented the city a certificate praising its 
hospitality toward the ray family who settled here last year after 
battling town officals over an order banning the sons attendance 
at public schools in arcadia 
ricky 12 robert 11 and randy ray 9 are hemophiliacs who 
doctors suspect became exposed to the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated blood products 
the ray boys doctors say show no symptoms of aids and pose no 
threat to other children in a casual school environment 
the boys and their parents louise and clifford ray fled 
arcadia in 1987 when their home burned down months after the 
family won a federal court order returning their sons to school 
despite protest of other parents 
the preceding school year school officials banned the three 
youngsters from attending classes because they tested positive for 
the aids virus the family later received a 11 million settlement 
from the school district 
the family settled in sarasota in september and have attended 
school since without incident 
sarasota has demonstrated that its one of those good 
communities that does react to families in need and comes to 
their calling and provides opportunities for them koop told an 
audience of about 400 people

lawmakers have passed a requirement for a 
sevenday waiting period and criminal background checks for buyers 
of assault weapons 
gov william donald schaefer is expected to sign the bill 
passed late monday in the closing hours of the 1989 general 
assembly session 
under the measure state police would check the background of a 
prospective gun buyer for evidence the individual was a drug 
addict alcoholic convicted felon or was mentally deranged an 
individual with such a background can be denied a gun 
purchases of 24 semiautomatic handguns and rifles are affected 
earlier in the 90day session legislators considered banning 
the sale of semiautomatics altogether 
last year maryland banned cheap handguns known as saturday 
night specials 
lawmakers have been continued pressure from the national rifle 
association which is worried the state is stepping on citizens 
rights to own guns 
lawmakers around the nation turned their attention to 
semiautomatic weapons after a drifter opened fire on a stockton 
calif schoolyard in january with an ak47 rifle and killed five 
children before committing suicide

anxious parents pulled 10 to 20 children 
out of classes after a drawing of an assault rifle and the words 
youre dead were found on a school that received telephone 
death threats 10 days earlier 
police said the graffiti found monday appeared to be the work of 
juveniles and not of the anonymous woman who made the phone threats 
but officials of this rural communitys school system reinstated 
tight security imposed after the first threats including locked 
doors and police escorts for morning and afternoon bus runs 
the security was a drastic change at the brooklyn school which 
had an opendoor policy at its three buildings serving 850 pupils 
in kindergarten through ninth grade 
we have to face the fact its probably not wise to have such 
freedoms said schools superintendent louise berry its sad 
its really an end of an era 
she said officials would also look into different types of 
security including intercoms at doorways 
if your child forgot a book it used to be you could walk 
right in and hand it to him said mary beth leonard who came to 
pick up her 11yearold son monday 
nearly a third of all pupils were kept home april 3 but the 
rate of absenteeism dropped to about 15 percent the following day 
and returned to normal by the end of last week the usual rate is 5 
percent to 7 percent berry said

the united states urged skeptical arab 
governments on tuesday to withhold judgment on an israeli proposal 
for palestinian elections until it is developed into a more formal 
plan 
this is a stepbystep process state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said you have to crawl before you walk 
president bush endorsed the proposal last week when israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir presented it to him at the white 
house subsequently the palestine liberation organization and the 
arab league rejected it outright 
the bush administration declined to take that as a final answer 
it is not unusual in a process for different parties to stake 
out more extreme positions especially at the beginning of the 
process ms tutwiler said 
the us official said shamirs proposal had potential and 
there are lots of questions to explore we plan to do so in the 
days and weeks ahead 
for instance ms tutwiler said secretary of state james a 
baker iii would discuss the proposal with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze during a visit to moscow may 1011 
we are asking all those who are committed to peace to give us 
a chance to explore and develop these ideas the spokeswoman said 
shamirs proposal is to hold elections among the 14 million 
palestinian arabs who live under israeli control on the west bank 
and in gaza the leaders they chose would negotiate arrangements 
for five years of local selfrule 
afterward israel the palestinians jordan and egypt would 
negotiate an overall settlement for the territories the arabs lost 
in the 1967 sixday war 
clovis maksoud the arab league representative here denounced 
the israeli proposal on monday as a device to buy more time for 
israel and to diffuse the mounting pressure within the united 
states and throughout the world as well to thwart the palestinian 
uprising 
maksoud said shamir sought to find through elections a 
boneless or a toothless palestinian negotiator who ratifies his 
conquest

telephone interview 
under the legislation khoury and bonner would still hold the 
copyright to the song as its publishers but the state can use 
the song in any manner it sees fit khoury said 
during debate one lawmaker bellowed out a song he wrote about 
three years ago lamenting pennsylvanias songless state 
state rep james gallen launched into the nameless song a 
cappella to the cheers and applause of his fellow house members

slightly offkey baritone 
without a song pennsylvania is out of tune without a song

fish and even a state bug

the horror of the fighting in beirut has 
sent 150000 city residents fleeing for shelter in warravaged 
south lebanon 
many moved in with relatives but hundreds are living in the 
wilderness sleeping in their cars in orange groves or on the 
rough concrete gravel in unfinished buildings 
a ninemonthpregnant woman is staying with her three children 
and 45 other refugees at one of the incomplete structures they 
sleep on the ground without mattresses or blankets 
i need milk to feed my children and to give to my baby who is 
due any minute now said alliyeh khodor 24 she fled her house 
in southern beirut on march 14 a week after the latest round of 
fighting erupted between christian and allied syrian and druse 
forces around the capital 
police say at least 180 have been killed and more than 600 
injured the fighting 
un peacekeeping force in southern lebanon and the

marshals service which had assigned a special task force to him

weapon was found in a vehicle he had purchased pekarek said but 
it turned out to be a pellet gun

various parts of the kansas city area for a few days before he

the walled old city dotted with shrines sacred 
to moslems jews and christians is the major fault line of the 
arabisraeli conflict where tensions frequently burst to the 
surface 
on tuesday palestinians buried an arab resident of the old 
citys moslem quarter who was shot by an israeli dressed in army 
fatigues the angry palestinians shouted teach the jews a 
lesson everything jewish in this town should be burned 
we are living inside a powder keg said mohammed sublaban 
40 the owner of a souvenir shop in the citys moslem quarter 
the slightest provocation can make all the resentments erupt to 
the surface 
responsibility for the submachine gun attack monday was claimed 
by a jewish extremist group known as the sicarites the group 
which takes its name from ancient jewish assassins of biblical 
times said it was avenging palestinian stoning attacks on jews 
tension in the old city rose friday when rocks hurled by 
palestinian rioters during a clash in the al aqsa mosque compound 
fell on jews worshipping at the adjacent wailing wall the holiest 
site in judaism 
radicalism on both the arab and jewish sides have sharpened 
the situation police minister chaim bar lev said on israel 
radio arabs throw rocks at the temple mount and a jew kills 
arabs there is no solution it only heats up the conflict 
about 17000 moslems and 2000 jews live in separate enclaves 
inside ancient jerusalems crowded square mile of narrow 
cobblestone alleyways houses and shops enemies yet neighbors 
they carry separate passports and rarely interact 
these people will never integrate it is not their purpose 
mayor teddy kollek said recently to explain the historic divisions 
the most we can do is try to avoid clashes of interests 
clashes have however been a hallmark of jerusalems history 
the city has been conquered about 20 times from 587 bc when 
the babylonians exiled the jews to 1967 when israel captured arab 
east jerusalem and the walled old city from jordan and annexed it 
in addition to the jewish shrines moslems also have sacred 
places in the holy city including al aqsa mosque the mosque is in 
the haram al sharif or noble enclossure an area is called temple 
mount by the jews 
jerusalem is the capital of israel and the palestinians also 
claim jerusalem as the capital of a palestinian state 
for christians the old city is a goal of pilgrims as the scene 
of christs crucifixion and burial 
fridays riot at the al aqsa mosque compound prompted bar lev to 
ban some palestinians from the occupied territories from worshiping 
there 
the move elicited angry reactions from the waqf the islamic 
administrators of the haram al sharif or noble sancutary in 
arabic it is the third holiest site in islam after mecca and 
medina in saudi arabia 
this is categorically unacceptable it is an attack against 
freedom of religion said sheik mohammed jamal bar lev is 
pouring oil on the fire the result will only be more and more 
fire

federal investigators on tuesday blamed 
inadequate track inspection and maintenance procedures by the 
burlington northern railroad for the derailment last summer of an 
amtrak passenger train in montana 
the train which was bound from chicago to seattle derailed 
aug 5 near saco mon when it struck track that had been warped 
by temperatures near 100 degrees the accident injured 165 people 
about a dozen of them seriously 
the national transportation safety board in its report on the 
accident said tuesday it was caused by shifting of track just ahead 
of the amtrak train the board said the shifting was caused by the 
intense heat but that track conditions and the danger of such 
buckling should have been apparent to burlington northern 
the probable cause of the accident said the safety board in its 
final report was burlington northerns inadequate track 
inspection and maintenance procedures which resulted in a thermally 
induced lateral shift of the track structure in front of the 
amtrak train 
the board continued that the lateral shift occurred when the 
train was closer than the 2478 feet necessary to bring the train 
to a safe stop the train was traveling at an authorized speed of 
79 miles an hour 
there was nothing that the engine crew could have done to 
have avoided or decreased the severity of the accident after they 
observed the shifted track said the report 
the derailment caused five of the trains cars to topple after 
leaving the tracks the 12car train was carrying 375 passengers 
and about a dozen crewmembers 
the safety board blamed some of the injuries on the lack of 
effective restraint devices that caused some items to fly around 
inside the cars while the board did not fault amtrak for the 
accident the report called on the passenger railroad to improve 
its training and procedures for evacuating passengers in such 
circumstances 
the safety board also called on burlington northern to improve 
its track inspection procedures and make available to inspectors 
devices that could determine when excessive heat might cause track 
to warp

a fire aboard a tugboat early today 
briefly halted the columbia river barge trip of a mammoth 
decommissioned nuclear reactor bound for its burial site the us 
coast guard said 
the fire broke out in the tugs engine room about 330 am 
when the barge carrying the reactor was just above bonneville dam 
and delayed the trip for about seven hours 
there were no injuries and at no time was there any danger of 
the reactor vessel going aground said wenday anderson of the 
knapptown corp in portland which owns the tug 
coast guard lt cmdr guy nolan said a backup tug was hooked up 
to the barge carrying the reactor while a third tug was dispatched 
from portland 
nolan said he was unsure what caused the fire aboard the 
clarkston 
coast guard vessels escorted the barge as it made its way 
upriver toward a dump at the governments hanford nuclear 
reservation in washington 
about 50 demonstrators watched from the interstate bridge at the 
edge of portland as the barge passed by without incident just after 
midnight said petty officer david clarke 
the barge headed to the hood river for the final leg of an 
8000mile trip from shippingport pa through the panama canal 
and up the pacific coast 
the shippingport nuclear plant was shut down in 1982 and 
dismantled the barge carried its 1000ton reactor pressure vessel 
the vessel 45 feet high and 18 feet across was emptied of its 
uranium fuel and filled with concrete to keep residual 
radioactivity from escaping 
people are just concerned carolyn dunn said at an earlier 
demonstration by about 20 people at an astoria pier we just wish 
it werent happening 
the main fear is that radioactivity from the vessel will seep 
into the columbia from the dump site she said 
its not what goes up the river that we worry about at this 
point so much as whats going to come down the river in leakage 
later said dunn 
the us department of energy has said the barges cargo is no 
threat to the public

house members from washington and oregon urged 
president bush on tuesday to take trade action against nations 
refusing to regulate fishing fleets which use huge nets in the 
north pacific 
us fishermen claim the socalled driftnets are used to 
illegally snare millions of salmon while environmentalists contend 
the nets are responsible for killing thousands of porpoises seals 
seabirds and other marine life every year 
the nets which can stretch up to 35 miles have been used since 
the early 1980s by about 700 vessels from japan south korea and 
taiwan to catch squid 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash introduced a nonbinding 
resolution backed by her house colleagues in the washington 
delegation and oregons three democrats in the house urging bush 
to impose trade sanctions if nations with such fleets refuse to 
enter into and implement adequate driftnet monitoring and 
enforcement agreements 
this has been called biological stripmining of the sea and 
thats exactly what it is unsoeld said at a news conference 
the driftnet fleet can lay 30000 miles of net on any given day 
catching and suffocating virtually every porpoise seal fish or 
bird that comes into contact with it 
thats not fishing thats indiscriminate slaughter 
unsoeld said the resolution sends an unmistakable message that 
we want these pirates put out of business she said driftnet 
fleets are stealing an estimated 10000 metric tons of salmon 
worth an estimated 21 million annually 
american fishermen say the illegal salmon netting has already 
hurt fish runs in washington state oregon and alaska 
by international agreement driftnet fishing is limited to 
certain areas that are supposed to be well away from salmon 
grounds but unsoeld said the regulations are ignored 
talks with the japanese aimed at reaching an agreement to 
monitor the driftnet fleet and enforce various regulations broke 
down over the weekend 
the secretary of commerce under a 1987 law has until june 29 
to notify the president of any country failing to enter into such 
an agreement bush could then impose trade restrictions on imports 
of fish products from those countries 
unsoeld said that if bush fails to act she and other lawmakers 
were prepared to introduce legislation that would require trade 
sanctions

prime minister noboru takeshita reversed himself 
before parliament on tuesday acknowledging he accepted 1 million 
from a company at the hub of a political scandal that has prompted 
calls for his resignation 
though takeshita went before lawmakers seeking to clear his name 
in the nationally televised session opposition leaders and some 
conservative analysts said he only raised more doubts 
im not sure why takeshita agreed to speak today said 
keiichiro nakamura who served an an aide to former prime minister 
takeo miki but if it was to increase the peoples trust in the 
liberal democratic party he probably did more harm than good 
takeshita and his party have been battered by disclosures the 
recruit co a huge publishing conglomerate sold bargainpriced 
stock to prominent bureaucrats and businessmen in all 14 people 
have been arrested and three cabinet ministers have resigned in 
connection with the scandal 
the governments embarrassment heightened last week with several 
news reports that turned national attention to recruit political 
donations to takeshita before he became prime minister 
on tuesday takeshita told a special session of the lower house 
budget committee that between 1985 and 1987 he had received 1 
million from recruit and its subsidiaries 
he said they gave the money to his political support groups in 
the form of donations and purchases of fundraising party tickets 
takeshita was finance minister and secretarygeneral of the 
governing liberal democratic party at the time 
he earlier acknowledged that a former aide and a relative bought 
12000 recruit subsidiary shares for a profit of about 190000 
but he denied any personal involvement 
on tuesday he stressed the legality of the recruit donations 
which he called indispensible elements for vital political 
activities 
takeshita went on to reject opposition party assertions his 
administration no longer has the credibility to lead the nation 
vowing to stay in office takeshita said at a time when 
distrust of politics is growing among the people it is my 
responsibility to see that reform is carried out 
leaders of the governing party said his appearance would help 
put the recruit affair into perspective and allow the government to 
move on to other business 
i think takeshitas explanations should serve to distinguish 
that the donations were legal and should put a period on the 
criticism said chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi 
but nakamura said not all members of the governing conservative 
party were persuaded 
opinion within the ruling party is split but more and more 
people are realizing that the party just cant win elections with 
takeshita as its leader he said 
elections for half of the seats in the upper house of parliament 
will be held this summer 
political analysts say no clear successor is ready to take over 
takeshitas job and the opposition acknowledges it does not 
control the votes needed to oust him 
by acknowledging the donations takeshita reversed a statement 
he made before lawmakers last october when he denied receiving any 
recruit funds whatsoever 
takeshita attempted to clear his name kanji kawasaki a 
socialist legislator who questioned takeshita said but by 
admitting to the flow of such large amounts of money he has only 
deepened the suspicions which surround him 
takeshita simply lied until the truth was uncovered the 
people of japan will not be satisfied said kawasaki 
recruit sold unlisted shares in a realestate subsidiary to 
about 160 political business and government officials at low 
prices in 1986 buyers of the shares received handsome profits when 
the shares soared in value shortly after they were listed on the 
market 
prosecutors say recruit was trying to influence policies of the 
labor and education ministries regarding the companys major 
activity publishing job placement magazines 
no politicians have been arrested in the scandal but 
prosecutors have been reported to question several of them

un troops opened checkpoints tuesday 
in northern namibia but south africa said no guerrillas showed up 
to begin a withdrawal to salvage a un ceasefire and independence 
plan for namibia 
chief inspector kierie du rand a south african spokesman for 
the territorial police said groups of more than 50 black 
nationalist insurgents were seen heading south disobeying orders 
from their exiled leader to withdraw north to angola 
angola cuba and south africa negotiated the withdrawal at the 
weekend to get the independence plan back on track after heavy 
fighting last week 
guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization are to 
report to unsupervised assembly points or border posts and leave 
namibia by saturday 
du rand said police trackers found evidence that only a handful 
of guerrillas have crossed back into angola of an estimated 1900 
which south africa says entered namibia starting april 1 pretoria 
has won international backing for its assertion the incursion 
violates a regional peace accord calling for swapo fighters to stay 
at bases in angola until may 15 
the namibian council of churches said it received no reports of 
guerrillas appearing at churches and missions which have been 
suggested safe gathering places 
territorial officials said the united nations agreed that 
territorial police supervised by un peacekeepers could 
interrogate guerrillas who report whereabouts of other insurgents 
and possible arms caches du rand said police are concerned some 
guerrillas may hide their weapons don civilian clothes and try to 
stay in namibia 
swapo leader sam nujoma said monday in a radio interview with 
the british broadcasting corp that there is confusion about how to 
spread word of the withdrawal he said guerrillas would not trust 
appeals from territorial authorities and most do not have radios to 
hear broadcasts of the withdrawal agreement 
a contingent of 210 finnish soldiers flew tuesday into windhoek 
to join un forces monitoring the transition to independence 
including elections scheduled for november about 1400 of the 
4650member force has arrived 
youths in windhoeks black township katutura boycotted classes 
tuesday to show support for guerrillas killed last week five of 14 
schools were empty the education department said 
about 500 youths marched from school to school hailing the 
slain guerrillas as heroes and denouncing the paramilitary police 
unit responsible for many of the deaths swapo has been fighting 
south african rule since 1966 
du rand reported only a few skirmishes with guerrillas 
monday and tuesday 
he put the death toll at 263 guerrillas and 27 security force 
members swapo says its losses are much lower and charges at least 
a fifth of those killed were civilians 
the fighting broke out april 1 the first day of a yearlong 
process to make namibia independent of south africa which has 
ruled the mineralrich territory since world war i and in defiance 
of un demands it withdraw 
in northern namibia more than 130 australian british 
malaysian and nigerian soldiers drove out of military bases tuesday 
in convoys of white trucks and landrovers to set up assembly points 
in two remote villages and near seven border posts they hung the 
international organizations blue and white flag from trees 
aerials and poles 
south africa agreed to give namibia independence in exchange for 
cuba withdrawing its 50000 troops from angola where they 
supported the marxist governments forces in a civil war against 
rebels backed by south africa

the largest tamil militant group 
tuesday rejected a oneweek ceasefire offered by president 
ranasinghe premadasa who sought to end six years of ethnic 
violence that has claimed 12500 lives 
the government is only interested in getting our weapons and 
has not put forward anything worthwhile said a leader of the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters monday that 
while troops operations were suspended the militants should give 
themselves up at 228 centers across the country he said 104 
militants all sinhalese had surrendered before the centers were 
set up 
premadasa offered the oneweek truce beginning wednesday to both 
ethnic tamil and majority sinhalese militants he said the military 
would suspend offensives against the tamil rebels during that time 
the offer was part of a peace package that included general 
amnesty seats in parliament and jobs for the militants on this 
island off the southern coast of india 
we will not agree to any ceasefire so long as the indian arms 
remain in sri lanka the rebel leader told the associated press 
in new delhi india a foreign ministry spokesman said india had 
decided to withdraw some of its peacekeeping troops from sri lanka 
spokesman aftab seth did not give details saying only that a 
significant number would be pulled out 
india moved in 50000 troops to disarm the tamil militants under 
a july 1987 accord that aimed to end a tamil insurgency in the 
northern and northeastern provinces the liberation tigers group 
refused to accept the accord because it said the pact did not meet 
enough of its demands for selfrule 
in january india withdrew an estimated 3000 soldiers saying 
it did so out of respect for public wishes in sri lanka opponents 
of the 1987 accord had feared indian troops might remain on the 
island indefinitely 
tamil militants in sri lanka launched a campaign in 1983 for an 
independent homeland citing discrimination by the sinhalese in 
employment and education 
in a backlash sinhalese extremists of the marxist peoples 
liberation front have killed more than 2500 people since january 
they oppose the governments plan to grant tamils limited autonomy 
they have not reacted to the truce offer in addition the 
government had no immediate reaction to the rebels rejection 
also tuesday two gunmen from sinhalese group broke into a house 
outside colombo and killed sarat algama the twin brother of senior

a house committee on tuesday approved 
legislation to reimpose limits on commercials in childrens tv 
shows and require broadcasters to inform and educate their young 
audiences or lose their licenses 
the house energy and commerce committee on a voice vote sent 
the childrens television practices act to the full house where it 
was expected to pass easily 
congress passed the same bill last year but thenpresident 
reagan let it die without his signature a companion measure has 
been introduced in the senate by sens howard metzenbaum dohio 
and frank lautenberg dnj 
the bush administration has not taken a public position on the 
bill 
authors of the measure said it was designed to stop the 
overcommercialization of childrens tv shows in the wake of a 
1984 decision by the federal communications commission to lift 
limits on tv ads in shows aimed at youngsters 
the fcc rules established in 1974 had limited broadcasters to 
nine and a half minutes of commercials per hour in childrens shows 
rep edward markey dmass last week said some stations have 
increased their ads to as much as 12 minutes to 14 minutes per hour 
on such shows since 1984 at the same time the average amount of 
advertising on adult shows is only about eight minutes per hour 
said markey chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance 
the bill orders the fcc to limit ads on shows for children to 12 
minutes per hour on weekdays and 10 minutes per hour on weekends 
in addition the bill requires a tv station before the fcc can 
renew its license to demonstrate it has served the educational 
and informational needs of children in its overall programming 
markey under questioning by rep william dannemeyer rcalif 
acknowledged there were no hard definitions in the bill of what 
constituted childrens programming but he said there was a 
general understanding that such shows are shown on saturday 
mornings and in early mornings and afternoons during the week 
he also said programming such as the cosby show and 
disneytype programs could fall into the childrens arena 
rep matthew rinaldo rnj who coauthored the bill with 
reps john bryant dtexas and terry bruce dill said it was a 
carefully crafted bipartisan compromise 
rep norman lent of new york the committees ranking 
republican said the bill provides modest but needed correction 
to excesses in childrens tv advertising practices it also 
encourages tv stations to improve their childrens programming 
the bill would be effective jan 1 1990 it was adopted in 
cooperation with the national association of broadcasters and the 
association of independent television stations

a house panel approved legislation tuesday to 
end 35 years of federal control of natural gas prices a step 
cheered by the energy industry but criticized by some consumer 
groups even though decontrol could mean slightly cheaper gas for 
the nations consumers 
the house energy and commerce committee on a voice vote without 
dissent sent the measure to the full house where even its 
strongest critics say approval is likely 
a similar measure has been introduced but not yet act on in the 
senate 
the legislation would complete a price decontrol process that 
began in 1978 with the natural gas policy act which removed price 
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen 
categories of gas each with a ceiling price 
about onethird of us natural gas currently is subject to 
federal price controls 
the house bill sponsored by rep philip sharp dind would 
lift the remaining price controls as supply contracts expire or are 
renegotiated with all such limits to be removed by jan 1 1993 
controls would be ended immediately for gas not subject to a 
contract on the date of the legislations enactment 
past efforts by the gas industry to win pricecontrol 
legislation foundered on fears that prices paid by the 48 million 
households using natural gas would increase 
such concerns have faded the collapse of oil prices in 1986 
coupled with the effects of moves by the federal energy regulatory 
commission to liberalize the gas industry led to falling gas 
prices excess supplies and greatly increased competition 
i think gas prices are going to fall if full decontrol is 
enacted said rep billy tauzin dla any price movements are 
expected to be small because most of the controlled gas already 
sells at prices below the federally set ceilings 
industry officials contend that ending federal price regulation 
will stimulate production and use of natural gas without leading to 
higher consumer bills 
for consumers this will mean supply and demand not arcane 
government regulations will set natural gas prices with the least 
expensive gas being produced first nicholas j bush president 
of the natural gas supply association said after the house 
committee vote his group represents gas producers 
some consumer organizations oppose the house decontrol bill 
although they acknowledge that lifting the price limits is not 
likely to mean higher consumer bills their main objection is that 
the legislation ignores other more significant gas issues that 
are having the effect of inflating home heating bills 
this bill does nothing for consumers said edwin s 
rothschild assistant director of the citizenlabor energy 
coalition 
rothschild and other consumer advocates say congress should be 
tackling such related issues as the takeorpay problem that is 
forcing consumers to help pay the cost of voiding highpriced 
supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s when unlike 
today supplies were tight and prices were rising 
the bush administration strongly supports gas decontrol and 
watkins has said a liberalized gas industry is part of his overall 
strategy for strengthening the nations energy base and reversing 
the trend toward higher energy imports 
the decontrol move comes at a time of growing political and 
commercial support for expanding the use of natural gas which 
currently accounts for about onequarter of the countrys energy 
supply gas is gaining popularity in part because it is considered 
more environmentally benign than oil and other fossil fuels 
a senate bill for example calls for spending 100 million over 
three years to finance demonstration projects that use natural gas 
for mass transit and training programs for conversion of gasoline 
and dieselfueled vehicles to run on natural gas 
the house panel also approved legislation to create an 
independent 11member commission to recommend to president bush 
and the congress a comprehensive approach to cleaning up toxic and 
radioactive wastes at the energy departments nuclear weapons 
plants energy secretary james d watkins opposes that bill

an explosion and fire at in chevrons huge 
east san francisco bay refinery cut the plants gasoline and jet 
fuel production cut by 25 percent the company said 
mondays blast sent towering clouds of sooty smoke boiling into 
the sky from the 4squaremile richmond plant and injured eight 
workers and firefighters with burns smoke inhalation and shock 
firefighters decided to allow the blaze to burn itself out and 
residual pockets of fuel continued burning tuesday 
the burned unit a cracking column which separates crude oil 
into its various components from light fuels to heavy lubricants 
produced about 10 percent of the west coasts oil requirements the 
company said 
chevron spokesman glenn weaver could not say if the production 
shortfall would cause any retail increase at the pumps in the 
western states but that chevron planned to compensate by dipping 
into inventories and increasing production at other refineries 
its hard to isolate what the movement in prices might be 
one thing we know is our costs will go up he said 
the company said the stricken unit could be out of commission 
for at least two months but management would not speculate on 
repair and replacement costs 
the 87yearold plant handles 270000 barrels of oil a day 
weaver said company investigators were still trying to determine 
the cause of the lunchhour eruption the plant employs about 1800 
people 
the bay area air quality management district reported that 
although the smoke did not register on monitoring stations near the 
plant chevron might be liable for a 1000 fine for creating a 
public nuisance 
the smoke was not toxic said contra costa county health 
director mark finucane rating the smoke about as dangerous as that 
produced in a fireplace

christian territory and no casualties were reported they said the 
christians held their fire 
moslemchristian artillery duels began five weeks ago and

14yearold civil war police give the casualties nearly all 
civilians as 180 killed and 619 wounded

lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
bernard kouchner french minister for humanitarian assistance 
arrived ahead of the two ships carrying food fuel and medical 
supplies which have caused an argument between moslems and 
christians 
moslems claim france from which lebanon became independent in 
1943 favors the christians the french government has expressed 
concern over the fate of lebanons christians 
kouchner spent 45 minutes with acting premier salim hoss who 
heads a moslem cabinet that has competed with a christian 
government led by aoun since a political crisis began in september 
hoss convened his cabinet afterward then issued a statement 
saying the moslem government rejected the french donation until 
the french stand toward the lebanese crisis is clarified 
kouchner told reporters france was determined to deliver the aid 
to all the lebanese and would meet with several leaders to plan 
the distribution 
he said french policy supports a political settlement in 
lebanon

christian port

beds surgical facilities and medical supplies 
fear has been expressed that more fighting will accompany the 
ships arrival a french envoy who was in lebanon last week 
jeanfrancois deniau of the national assemblys foreign affairs 
committee was quoted tuesday as saying it would be an act of 
war against france to fire on the ships 
if they fire it is clear that they want to destroy lebanon 
he was quoted as saying in the tours france daily la nouvelle 
republique du centreouest 
youssef aridi a grocer in moslem west beirut said i think 
wednesday will be a bad day i wont leave home if they shell the 
french god knows what will happen

the soviet navy said tuesday it plans to retrieve 
a nuclear submarine that sank off norway to learn what caused the 
accident that killed 42 sailors 
we consider that we must raise it vice adm sergei p 
vargin said on the nightly television news program vremya 
vargin who is with the soviet baltic fleet said details of how 
to bring the submarine up from nearly 5000 feet below the surface 
had not been worked out 
the experts will deal with it he said adding that the hull 
was believed to be cracked but intact the sub caught fire and sank 
friday in the norwegian sea 
izvestia the government newspaper has said a short circuit 
probably caused the fire 
vargin repeated the soviet position that there is no danger of 
radiation leakage he said the reactors were shut down before the 
crew evacuated and neither of the two nucleartipped torpedoes was 
armed for combat 
in oslo norwegian officials said tests on water samples at the 
subs level showed no radiation but the norway would not declare 
the zone clean until a more extensive examination late this week 
soviet media reports tuesday said the sub commander capt 
yevgeny vanin pulled a sailor through a smokefilled hatch then 
died while trying to reach other survivors 
he had spent all his energy saving sailors and he perished in 
front of his crew lt andrei zaitsev told the official news 
agency tass from his hospital bed in murmansk 
another crew member capt b kolyada said the first thing the 
crew did when the fire started was secure the nuclear reactor and 
nucleartipped torpedoes 
several of the 27 survivors were shown on television greeting 
their families and praising the courage of shipmates 
one crewman not identified said we were in the water for an 
hour and a half but we never doubted that we would be rescued 
there was no panic absolutely no panic at all 
official media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members 42 of 
whom were killed officials say only 19 bodies have been recovered 
tass said the commander was the last person to leave the 
submarine when it started to sink and the crew could not put out 
the fire 
prior to that he looked once again into the submarines exit 
hatch belching out smoke it said one of the seamen was there 
the commander dived into the icy water swimming toward the 
inflatable life rafts 
vanin died in the water before he could reach a raft the agency

the agriculture department said tuesday that 
scientists have invented a vaccine to make pigs piggier 
pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of 
225 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs 
without the treatment the departments agricultural research 
service reported 
if a commercial product results from this venture and is 
approved by regulator agencies it could mean more quality pork 
produced at lower cost and in less time said animal physiologist 
jerome c pekas 
the usda agency has signed a threeyear cooperative agreement 
with codon a san francisco biotechnology firm for development and 
further testing of the vaccine 
pekas who works at the agencys meat animal research center in 
clay center neb said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment 
of cholecystokinin a natural appetitelimiting hormone made in the 
upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans 
when the fragment called cck8 is joined to a larger foreign 
carrier protein the animals immune system recognizes the fragment 
as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the 
natural cck hormone he said 
when that happens there is nothing to tell pigs when theyve 
had enough to eat so they keep on eating

to a visiting polish cabinet minister to press for removal of a 
roman catholic carmelite convent from the site of the auschwitz 
death camp officials said 
in geneva the european leader of the jewish organization bnai 
brith said in a telephone interview that jewishcatholic relations 
will remain frozen until the convent is gone

blueprint had been drawn up despite reported intervention by pope 
john paul ii the convent has been at auschwitz since 1984 
in jerusalem arens met with polish minister of religious 
affairs wladyslav loranc and told him the continued presence of 
the carmelite convent on that site causes very strong pains and 
indignation in israel foreign ministry officials said

way to put the 1987 agreement into effect said the israeli 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
polish officials made no comment

rep bill alexander dark filed a formal 
complaint with the house ethics committee tuesday accusing 
republican whip newt gingrich of violating house rules with an 
unusual 1984 book promotion deal 
alexander listed 10 alleged violations of house rules in the 
complaint filed as the ethics committee discussed behind closed 
doors the results of a lengthy investigation of house speaker jim 
wright that was initiated by gingrich 
mr gingrich is a congressional jimmy swaggart who condemns 
sin while committing hypocrisy alexander said 
the complaint which under house rules will force the ethics 
committee to vote on whether to investigate the georgia republican 
centers around a limited partnership created to promote window of 
opportunity a book written by gingrich his wife marianne 
gingrich and david drake 
the partnership involved 21 investors who put up 5000 each to 
promote the book in exchange for a promise of half of the profits 
that normally would have accrued to the publisher the publisher 
however ended up losing money on the book and the investors got a 
tax write off 
gingrich who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the 
book deal said tuesday that the partnership was controlled by his 
wife and that he was not aware of the details of the arrangement 
but he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written 
questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his 
office by members of congress and reporters since the existence of 
the partnership was disclosed last month 
mrs gingrich has acknowledged receiving less than 10000 from 
the partnership for her work in setting up the deal and 
coordinating the promotional effort 
gingrich said tuesday his wife resents the implication in 
alexanders complaint that she was used as a conduit to funnel 
money to him in violation of house rules he said she has contacted 
an attorney to determine if she has grounds for legal action 
in addition to the promotional deal gingrich said the book 
involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each 
received 3 percent royalties and drake 2 percent 
but alexander said the payments gingrich received cannot be 
characterized as royalties because of the unique promotional deal 
associated with the book consequently alexander argued those 
payments are not exempt from the house rule limiting outside earned 
income as royalties are 
alexander also alleged that the promotional deal involved four 
apparent violations of house limitations on gifts one possible 
conversion of campaign funds to personal use two possible 
instances of conversion of government resources to personal use 
one apparent violation of house financial disclosure rules and one 
apparent violation of the campaign finance law

two major nursinghome groups filed suit 
against the government tuesday to block provisions of a law 
requiring nursing homes to turn away the mentally ill and mentally 
retarded 
the american health car association and the american association 
of homes for the aging said the federal government is requiring 
states to implement the law which took effect jan 1 even though 
the department of health and human services has issued no 
regulations to guide them 
they said the result is that the law will hurt the people it was 
intended to help by denying them admission to nursing homes even 
when no alternate care facilities are available 
nursing home applicants and patients who are mentally retarded 
or mentally ill are being held hostage by this legislation and 
its misguided implementation said sheldon goldberg president of 
the american association of homes for the aging which represents 
about 2500 nursing homes 
though he did not cite specific instances in which mentally ill 
or mentally retarded patients have been discharged from nursing 
homes he said his concern was that could happen in the future 
the suit was filed in us district court for the district of 
columbia naming hhs secretary louis sullivan department officials 
had no immediate comment on the lawsuit 
under the law nursing homes will lose federal medicaid funds if 
they accept patients who suffer from mental illness or mental 
retardation unless they also need nursing home care nursing homes 
get about 44 percent of their revenues from the federalstate 
medicaid program patients who have lived in a nursing home for 
fewer than 30 months also must be screened for mental illness and 
mental retardtion under the law 
paul willging executive vice president of the american health 
care association which represents about 9000 nursing homes said 
that without regulations from the hhs nursing homes dont know how 
to define mental illness the law exempts alzheimers disease but 
diagnosis of the condition is difficult and its victims are often 
classified as mentally ill he noted 
depending on how mental illness is defined an estimated 26000 
to 208000 current residents of the 15 million americans in 
nursing homes might have to be involuntarily discharged under the 
law he said 
with few alternate care facilities available in most areas he 
said many of these patients may be left homeless without even 
basic levels of care 
willging and goldberg said the law is wellintentioned in that 
it seeks to ensure that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get 
the specialized treatment they need for their conditions 
but it is equally important to provide some elementary 
protections willging said we demand the horse be put before 
the cart 
the suit asks the court to put the screening requirements of the 
law on hold until hhs issues implementing regulations it also asks 
the court to prohibit application of the rules to privatepay 
patients 
restraining orders have been issued by courts in idaho arkansas 
and texas in response to suits filed by nursinghome groups 
willging said a suit also has been filed in louisiana he said 
earlier this year terry coleman thendeputy director of hhss 
health care financing administration said the law was an effort to 
get states to develop grouphome and communitybased services for 
the mentally ill and mentally retarded 
historically it has been the states responsibility to fund 
services and facilities for the mentally ill he said to avoid 
this cost however some states have sent these patients to nursing 
homes where medicaid picks up the tab for those who cannot pay 
more states have special facilities for the mentally retarded 
because medicaid helps pay for them but nursing home care for 
these patients is often cheaper he said

the navy on tuesday issued a public denial 
stating it had never received any medical evidence suggesting 
sailors who served aboard nuclear missile submarines were more 
likely to contract cancer 
responding to a report monday in a trade publication alleging 
increased risk the navy released a 140page statistical study 
performed by the yale school of medicine that tracked both the 
inservice and postservice death rates for nuclear submariners 
the study conducted at a cost of 600000 was originally 
completed in august 1985 and then updated and revised in april 1987 
the navy insisted there was no reason to challenge the studys 
conclusion that submariners were not placed at higher risk as a 
result of their occupation adding in a statement it would stand by 
the work of the yale researchers 
the us naval medical command has reviewed the yale study in 
view of recent news media reports the statement said 
the us naval medical command finds that there is no basis in 
the yale study to conclude there is any health concern related to 
cancer rates and submarine service on either attack nuclearpowered 
submarines or ballistic missile nuclearpowered submarines 
navy news and undersea technology a weekly trade publication 
reported monday the navys statistical study contained evidence 
that sailors who had served aboard nuclearmissile submarines were 
more likely to develop cancer than their civilian counterparts 
the publication said the research reported an observed rate 
of cancer cases among former missile submarine personnel of 54 
compared to an expected rate for the general population of 394 
by contrast the statistics for sailors who served aboard 
nuclearpowered attack submarines vessels that do not carry 
nucleartipped missiles showed the number of cancer deaths 
precisely matching the expected rate 22 versus 225 
the publication also quoted dr michael sheridan an 
epidemiologist and biostatistician at georgetown university as 
saying the study utilized procedures that were bound to be biased 
in the navys favor and to underestimate cancer rates 
the navy in responding tuesday said the trade publication had 
failed to take account of the fact that all such mortality 
statistics are developed with a range of numbers 
while the numbers cited by the publication are correct as drawn 
from one table the observed rate of 54 cancer cases compares to an 
expected range of 26 to 53 based on nationwide averages the 
navy said 
the yale researchers found that there were 54 actual deaths 
one higher than expected a small increase such as this may be due 
to normal statistical variation in a group of this size 
the navy said the yale researchers themselves had made the same 
point in the study writing it is not proper to interpret this 
standard mortality ratio as statistical proof that men on 
nuclear missile submarines are at elevated risk of cancer 
the study distributed on tuesday was originally requested in 
1974 by rep pat schroeder dcolo and her military affairs 
assistant at the time capt james bush a retired navy submarine 
skipper who developed cancer 
bush who was treated and survived his cancer is now an 
associate director at the washingtonbased center for defense 
information 
bush has said his interest in pushing the navy to conduct the 
study was spawned by his own experience and the fact that he 
personally knew 14 former submariners who developed or died from 
the disease including four from the same missile boat that he 
commanded 
phone calls to bush on tuesday to discuss the navys response 
were not immediately returned

the soviet defense ministry will cut the length of 
military service required for students who have completed higher 
education courses the official tass news agency said tuesday 
under new regulations for conscription students who graduate 
this spring will be required to serve only one year in the military 
instead of 18 months in the army and air force or two years in the 
navy the news agency said 
the new regulations were expected to begin with the spring 
intake of conscripts tass said 
the defense ministry announced in march that students could 
defer military service until after graduation but it did not 
specify the length of service that would be required 
previously all soviet men between the ages of 18 and 25 were 
liable for the draft and there were no exemptions for students 
changes in the conscription system have been under discussion 
for the past five years and the program of officer training is 
also under review according to the communist youth newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda 
the new rules apply only to conscripts and not officers or 
officer candidates tass said about 75 percent of soviet military 
personnel are conscripts 
changes in the draft law follow the announcement dec 7 by 
president mikhail s gorbachev at the united nations that soviet 
troop strength would be cut by 500000 and military spending would 
be reduced by 14 percent

a coalition of environmental groups on 
tuesday sued the state of pennsylvania and the federal government 
alleging they had failed to reduce ozone pollution in the 
philadelphia area 
the lawsuit filed in us district court seeks to block more 
than 100 million in federal highway and cleanair planning grants 
until the state takes action to clean the air 
we believe that pennsylvania has not made a goodfaith effort 
to meet the standards of the clean air act said joseph minott 
executive director of the delaware valley citizens council for 
clean air one of the plaintiffs 
if they wont do it voluntarily well get a court to force 
them to do it he said 
ozone pollution forms when fumes from gasoline and other organic 
chemicals such as cleaning solvents and paint interact with the 
suns heat and light ozone is the principal component of the 
brownish smog that covers philadelphia and other urban areas 
especially in the summer months 
1988 was pennsylvanias worst year for ozone pollution since 
the reauthorization of the clean air act in 1977 said jerome 
balter of the public interest law center lead attorney for the 
council 
a spokesman for the environmental protection agency lee 
blackburn said the federal agency had been expecting the suit but 
he declined to comment on it until he had read the complaint 
susan woods spokeswoman for the state department of 
environmental resources said the state is trying to launch a 
farreaching effort to control ozone pollution with new gasoline 
volatility regulations 
but a state senate committee citing costs and possible gas 
shortages recommended last week that the new rules not go into 
effect completely until 1992 
groups joining in the lawsuit in addition to the delaware 
valley citizens council for clean air include the sierra club 
the delaware valley toxics coalition and the pennsylvania 
federation of sportsmens clubs

president bush intends to call for more 
stringent ethical rules on executive branch officials and recommend 
a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges in a sweeping 
ethicsingovernment program to be unveiled wednesday 
administration officials said tuesday 
but these officials said bush has decided for the time being 
against recommending any hike in the 89500 salary received by 
members of congress and will recommend no change in the widely 
criticized system that permits lawmakers to earn thousands of 
dollars in speaking fees 
bush who promised during last years campaign to crack down on 
ethical laxness in government arranged to lay out his 
recommendations in a speech at the american society of newspaper 
editors convention 
among the recommendations is one extending the oneyear ban that 
currently prohibits executive branch employees from lobbying their 
former office to have it apply to members of congress and to 
judges said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
in making his proposals bush is expected to accept most of the 
recommendations made by a special commission he established and 
discard some others 
the commission that bush set up to recommend changes for an 
ethics overhaul had called for a ban on honoraria to members of 
congress for speaking engagements or similar work such honoraria 
provide thousands of dollars in outside income for senators and 
representatives in a system that critics including bushs ethics 
panel contend allows for too much special interest influence on 
the representatives 
but the president decided that the issue of honoraria should be 
considered in conjunction with the question of a congressional pay 
raise separate from the ethics package he was preparing to put 
forward wednesday said the official who spoke anonymously 
bushs proposal is expected to cover matters such as outside 
income conflicts of interest financial disclosure enforcement 
and restrictions on what executive branch employees can do after 
they leave the government 
his announcement follows the march 10 report by his eightmember 
ethics commission which detailed 27 recommendations for changes in 
ethics laws and regulations as they apply to senior officials 
judges and members of congress and their staffs 
in addition to proposals that require congressional legislation 
bush will issue an executive order covering executive branch 
employees the administration sources said 
the order will include provisions to give elevated rank to a 
designated ethics officer in each department and will do away with 
compartmentalization of the various agencies of the executive 
branch for purposes of lobbying after working for the government 
the current oneyear lobbying ban for executive branch workers 
would remain but would be extended to cover all agencies rather 
than just the one in which the individual was employed 
for instance a former employee of the vice presidents staff 
would be precluded not only from lobbying that office but also any 
other executive branch agency such as the office of management and 
budget 
bushs commission on federal ethics law reform in its march 10 
recommendations reiterated bushs campaign pledge to seek the same 
ethical standards for the judicial and legislative branches of 
government that apply to the executive branch 
the panel recommended a ban on honoraria for all three branches 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater without 
specifically confirming that bush had dropped the honoraria 
provision for members of congress said tuesday that the president 
believes the matter should be discussed in conjunction with 
congressional pay raises 
we have always said that honoraria are a part of the pay 
equation and we do not intend to deal with the congressional pay 
raise so it makes sense we wouldnt deal with the other part of 
it fitzwater told reporters 
bush does intend to work with congress to come up with a pay 
raise coupled with a resolution on the honoraria question said an 
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush backed previous pay raise legislation but congress itself 
voted against giving its members a raise earlier this year 
the subject of honoraria is inherently attached to pay raises 
hed like to work with the congress separately on it rather than 
cramming the honoraria ban down their throat the source said 
bushs executive order also bars senior government officials 
from serving on the boards of profitmaking enterprises an area 
that caused complications for his own white house counsel c 
boyden gray 
gray voluntarily stepped down as chairman of a familyowned 
communications company after it was revealed that he continued to 
hold the post in contradiction to bushs planned ethics guidelines 
bushs reported decision on the honoraria question brought 
immediate criticism from fred wertheimer president of the 
organization common cause which backs a congressional pay raise 
and wants to do away with all honoraria 
he said bushs proposal undermines the presidents avowed effort 
to set stricter ethical standards for government 
it appears he has caved in to pressure by members of congress 
who want to keep this corrupt system going he knows better and it 
appears the president doesnt have the courage of his convictions

viewers watching wcixtv were surprised when cuban 
television cut in briefly with a preview of endless love 
starring brooke shields and a shot of giron the site of the bay of 
pigs invasion 
and viewers switching past channel 3 a blank unused channel in 
miami also got a taste of cuban government programming 
some think the interference saturday and monday was intentional 
a warning against the united states proceeding with plans for tv 
marti an alternative to cubas statecontrolled media and the next 
step after the success of radio marti 
the reason fidel castro may be doing this now is that the 
legislation to authorize tv marti is going to be debated on the 
floor of the house this week said barbara burris an aide to 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee and a key backer of radio and tv marti 
rep fascell anticipated this and has already cautioned the 
administration that theyd better be prepared for this type of 
action 
but it may instead have just been a rare combination of 
technical difficulties and inopportune weather conditions said jay 
newman vice president and manager at cbsowned wcix 
his station experienced a power outage and briefly was off the 
air monday night when the cuban signal appeared 
we believe it was a unique combination of circumstance us 
going off the air and of the wether being such that the signal 
from cuba was able to bounce fullstrength onto our frequency 
newman said 
channel 3 carried a variety show and the cuban governments 
national news program saturday 
angel pino a spokesman for the cuban interests section in 
washington would not confirm or deny the jamming was a warning 
from cuba 
cuban foreign ministry officials have suggested that if tv marti 
goes into operation their government might retaliate by beaming tv 
programs to the united states even if the signal interfered with 
american stations 
the reagan administration began considering tv marti after 
seeing the success of radio marti which broadcasts news 
editorials and entertainment to cuba under the auspices of the 
voice of america both are named after cuban independence hero jose 
marti 
the tv marti section of the annual house authorization bill is 
based on a senate version passed last year that provided 75 
million for starting costs and a study to determine whether tv 
marti is viable 
the study released in january endorsed tv marti but cautioned 
that castros ability to retaliate be weighed closely before 
proceeding

the nassau county police department has 
begun random drug testing in certain narcotics squads making it 
one of the first departments in the nation to test officers for 
drug use 
officers who fail the test will be fired and officers who 
refuse to take it also may be dismissed the program was announced 
to the 200 officers in the drugfighting squads this week and is 
effective immediately 
the policy follows a us supreme court decision which last 
month upheld the right of the us customs service to randomly test 
employees who work on drug interdiction even without reasonable 
suspicion an officer has used drugs 
harry greenberg attorney for the police benevolent association 
in nassau county said the union has not decided whether to 
challenge nassaus new policy 
the program is designed to make the public and officers 
confident of an officers integrity commissioner samuel rozzi said 
he noted that the officers assigned to the drug units including 
undercover agents and police lab workers have ready access to 
drugs 
almost all of our officers are above reproach the finest in 
the country said rozzi whose department on long island numbers 
3200 we want to be able to weed out the one or two who are 
not 
for 15 years the nassau county department has drugscreened 
applicants officers during their first year of probation and 
those under suspicion of drug use since 1983 nine officers and 
two civilian employees have been fired for illegal drug use six of 
the officers were charged with crimes 
in new york city random testing for drugs was started last 
october among the approximately 1000 officers assigned to the 
organized crime control bureau 
boston detroit and chattanooga tenn are awaiting court 
rulings on drug detection programs being fought by their police 
unions 
in 1986 the maryland state police implemented a random 
mandatory testing program for all its members the program was 
suspended after eight months when the state attorney general 
advised that it may be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy 
miami officers asked that an annual mandatory drug screening 
exam be written into their contracts

maryland lawmakers have ratified a bill 
requiring background checks and a sevenday waiting period for 
buyers of militarystyle semiautomatic assault weapons 
the bill prompted by januarys schoolyard shooting in 
california and by an upswing in street violence involving 
semiautomatic weapons was approved late monday in the closing 
hours of the 1989 general assembly session 
the measure still must be signed by gov william donald 
schaefer whose support is expected 
under the legislation state police would check the background 
of a prospective gun buyer before a sale could be completed the 
sale would be canceled if police found evidence that the applicant 
was a drug addict alcoholic convicted felon or was mentally 
deranged 
purchases of 24 specific gun models are affected and those who 
violate the law would be subject to prison terms of up to three 
years and maximum fines of 10000 
earlier in the 90day session some legislators proposed banning 
the sale of semiautomatics altogether but later modified the 
measure in the face of overwhelming resistance 
in 1988 maryland passed a bill eliminating cheap handguns known 
as saturday night specials the measure established a ninemember 
board to decide which guns may be manufactured and sold in the 
state 
gun control opponents spent 6 million in a losing effort to 
defeat that bill continued pressure from the national rifle 
association has kept lawmakers leery of further weapons legislation 
however lawmakers around the nation have felt pressure to 
control the spread of semiautomatic weapons particularly after 
januarys schoolyard tragedy in stockton calif where a gunman 
killed five children and wounded 30 other people in a rapid burst 
of gunfire from an ak47

priests on tuesday granted asylum to 
two survivors of a shooting by authorities and warned democracy and 
justice are endangered in the country 
the two men sought asylum citing death threats following a 
military court decision last week to free 19 police and soldiers 
involved in the killing of 14 other venezuelan fishermen on oct 29 
the rev oswaldo santana told reporters that jose arias and 
wolmer pinilla went to the vatican diplomatic mission late monday

caracas where they will receive unconditional protection 
santana the churchs human rights vicar said they are 
depending on the sanctity of the church to keep the men safe 
arias and pinilla said they survived the october shooting by 
jumping in a river and swimming to safety they later sought asylum 
in mexico while a lower military court ruled them guilty of 
military rebellion 
in january the military court declared arias and pinilla 
innocent and ordered the arrest of the 19 this followed a 
congressional investigation that declared the 14 dead men were 
murdered and the military brigade had tried to cover up their 
actions by accusing the fishermen of being colombian guerrillas

have got numerous anonymous telephone calls threatening their 
lives local reporters following the case also reported receiving 
death threats 
this situation is extremely grave not only for the lives of 
the two men but also for the correct administration of justice

republics official language 
demontrations in the southern province where former soviet 
leader josef stalin was born began april 4 protesters had 
attacked calls from some abkhazians to break away from the republic 
because of alleged discrimination by georgians others demanded 
that georgia secede from the soviet union because of alleged 
interference by the central government in their political economic

nearly 25000 children in military families 
nationwide are on waiting lists for child care despite department 
of defense efforts to expand its child care program according to a 
study released tuesday 
the survey conducted by the general accounting office found 
that military child care facilities are providing day care for 
about 62000 children an 82 percent increase over the end of the 
1984 fiscal year 
two types of care are available to families living on air force 
navy army and marine corps bases child development centers 
provided in governmentbuilt and subsidized facilities by trained 
care givers and family day care homes usually provided in 
government housing by nonmilitary spouses 
the survey of 200 military installations in the continental 
united states found that child development centers have the 
capacity to care for more than 38500 children while 4557 day 
care homes can care for as many as 23417 children eighty percent 
of the remaining 24729 children who are on waiting lists need 
fullday care 
the survey by the congressional watchdog agency had no 
information on nationwide spending for military child care 
worldwide however operating costs for child care centers totaled 
1016 million in fiscal 1985 including 314 million in federally 
appropriated funds the report said by fiscal 1987 federal 
spending had increased 39 percent to 436 million out of a total 
cost of 1343 million the survey said 
if the program is to continue to grow many child care centers 
need to be renovated or built the gao said 
military parents child care needs are complicated by the fact 
that they often work unusual hours cant rely on extended family 
for help and because of frequent moves dont have the support of 
an established neighborhood according to the report

the conviction of four puerto rican 
nationalists in the 71 million wells fargo robbery could 
revitalize the independence movement in puerto rico a professor 
who has written a book about the case said tuesday 
its going to provide a tremendous stimulous said ronald 
fernandez a sociology professor at central connecticut state 
university in new britain 
five defendants were accused of being members of los macheteros 
a militant group seeking puerto rican independence the group has 
been linked to terrorist attacks on us military installations on 
the carribean island 
fernandez who wrote los macheteros about the case compared 
their cases to that of lt col oliver north on trial in the 
irancontra case 
oliver north was clearly engaged in revolutionary activity 
clearly used violence and allegedly used illegal means but a large 
number of americans perceive him to be a hero a patriot and are 
willing to look the other way its the same thing for the 
macheteros in puerto rico he said a portion of the population 
regards them as patriots and regard this a terribly unjust thing 
juan e segarra palmer iii 39 antonio camacho negron 45 
norman ramirez talavera 32 and roberto maldonado rivera 53 were 
convicted monday at us district court in hartford ending a trial 
that began oct 11 1988 
segarra was found guilty on robbery conspiracy and 
transportation of stolen money charges but innocent on four 
weaponsrelated charges hes being held without bond and faces up 
to 165 years in prison 
camachos bond was revoked and he faces up to 15 years in 
prison while the others face up to five years behind bars no 
sentencing date was set 
a fifth defendant carlos ayes suarez 29 an anthropology 
student was the only defendant found innocent he had faced a 
conspiracy charge stemming from the sept 12 1983 heist of about 
900 pounds in cash from the wells fargo depot in west hartford 
fernandez said the defendants should have been tried in a 
different location by an hispanic jury 
us attorney stanley a twardy jr didnt immediately return 
telephone calls to his office in new haven 
throughout pretrial proceedings defense attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to have the trial moved to puerto rico us 
district judge t emmet clarie refused 
it clearly proves that puerto rican patriots cannot get a fair 
trail in the united states and thats the reason they brought it 
to hartford in the first place said defense attorney ronald l 
kuby of new york city 
kuby represents luis alfredo colon osorio one of nine other 
defendants awaiting trial the second trial has been delayed while 
prosecutors appeal claries decision to suppress wiretap evidence 
kuby and other attorneys for the defendants awaiting trial said 
tuesday a second trial might not be held if claries wiretap ruling 
is upheld because of the money and time it would take to prosecute 
but if a second trial is held they said they would renew their 
efforts to move it out of hartford 
the only place its conceivable to get a fair trial is in 
puerto rico said richard j harvey an attorney from new york 
city 
harvey represents filiberto ojeda rios who the government 
considers a leader of los macheteros ojeda is jailed in puerto 
rico on charges of shooting an fbi agent when authorities raided 
ojedas house and arrested him in 1985 in connection with the 
robbery

the military criticized for 
killing two reporters last month said tuesday it will not fire on 
journalists vehicles even if they ignore or inadvertently run a 
roadblock 
two reporters were killed and another seriously wounded in march 
by soldiers manning roadblocks the incidents are being 
investigated but the armed forces have acknowledged that in at 
least one of the cases the soldier fired without provocation 
in another development president jose napoleon duarte returned 
to his duties at the presidential palace after five days of 
convalescence from side effects of cancer treatment 
a document containing instructions on military relations with 
the press was signed tuesday by defense minister gen carlos vides 
casanova it says that if a news vehicle passes through a 
roadblock soldiers manning the position will limit themselves to 
taking down the license plate number to be reported to the joint 
chiefs of staff which will take appropriate action under no 
circumstances will the vehicles or their occupants be fired upon 
security force roadblocks are common in zones where fighting is 
heaviest in this central american country ravaged by nine years of 
civil war between leftist guerrillas and the usbacked government 
news vehicles are identified by the local convention of 
affixing with tape the large letters tv on the windshield 
sides roof and back they also fly small white flags out windows 
or from antennae 
the document to be distributed in the form of an order to 
military units nationwide also prohibits the arrest of accredited 
journalists discovered in battle zones without a safeconduct 
document from the joint chiefs of staff 
such passes are required for access to regions of frequent 
fighting journalists who have entered such areas without the pass 
have been arrested the new regulation authorizes local commanders 
only to take down the violators name and affiliation for relay to 
the joint chiefs of staff which would administer any sanction 
the new document also prohibits confiscation of equipment film 
or written material under any circumstances military authorities 
in the past have temporarily impounded or confiscated such 
material prompting protests from the local correspondents 
association 
we feel it is our obligation to establish regulations that in 
addition to improving our relationship with the media allow both 
of us to carry out our missions in the best possible manner said 
the document 
duartes secretary carmen vallejos said the president met with 
several ministers and other officials when he resumed his duties 
in a telephone interview she described his mood as animated 
duate a 63yearold christian democrat is dying of liver 
cancer chemotherapy intended to slow the advance of the disease 
provoked severe nausea and vomiting last week duarte became 
dehydrated and was confined to bed for intravenous feeding he 
temporarily delegated the presidency to vice president rodolfo 
castillo claramount 
duartes fiveyear term ends june 1 when he is to hand power 
over to presidentelect alfredo cristiani of the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance cristiani was elected march 19

oliver north defended his efforts for the 
nicaraguan contras tuesday testifying at his trial that he knew a 
pivotal letter his boss sent congress on the subject was false but 
regarded it as a political problem not a fraud 
did any moral bells go off in your head asked prosecutor 
john keker 
it wouldnt be proper to describe it as a moral bell north 
said and then he turned his focus to the cutoff of us contra 
aid that led to his secret efforts 
i thought it was extraordinarily immoral to have put a force 
in the field to have fed it armed it equipped it and then leave 
it in the lurch said north it was heinous i happened to be 
right smack dab in the middle of it 
all through his fourth day as a witness at his irancontra 
trial north defended his honor as well as his efforts on behalf of 
the nicaraguan rebels meeting a fusillade of suggestions from 
keker that he violated the code he was taught at the naval academy 
keker accused north of telling a flatout 100 percent 
oldfashioned allamerican lie when he was instrumental in 
getting president reagan to send thankyou notes to a fundraiser 
and a major donor to the contras keker read from a document which 
quoted north as giving an assurance the two were not involved in 
raising private funds for the contras 
other questioning concerned a letter sent by national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane on sept 5 1985 to rep lee hamilton 
dind then the chairman of the house intelligence committee that 
letter denying news accounts that the national security council 
staff was soliciting donations and offering tactical advice to the 
contras is at the heart of several charges concerning lying to or 
obstructing congress 
i recognized it to be false because i had gone to some lengths 
since 1984 to get his mcfarlanes approval for and keep him 
apprised of what i was doing north said of the letter it 
denied the things he sent me off to do 
didnt he see the letter as a fraud on congress the prosecutor 
asked 
to me a fraud means to break the law i did not recognize it 
as breaking the law i recognized it more as an increasing 
political problem north replied 
but he said im not proud of this i didnt think it was 
unlawful but i didnt think it was right 
he said he had urged mcfarlane to assert executive privilege and 
refuse to reply to hamilton and failing in that argument attached 
talking points to mcfarlanes draft to discuss before the 
letter went out 
asked why his insistence on executive privilege did not show up 
in attached notes north said by that point he felt he had lost the 
argument 
what is not in the notes is anything about fundraising 
said keker 
surely he and the president had done it north said he 
mcfarlane had authorized me to go to the taiwanese i had 
arranged for the peoples republic of china to get missiles he knew 
i had arranged air drops of weapons and intelligence and recoilless 
rifles to the contras he knew all of these things none of which 
was in those letters 
i believe mcfarlanes letter was false to the point of being 
deceptive north said 
keker asked north about a recommendation approved and forwarded 
by mcfarlane that reagan sign thankyou notes to fundraiser carl 
channell and to barbara newington who had contributed 250000 a 
document introduced by keker said white house counsel fred fielding 
approved the recommendation on grounds that north had said neither 
had been involved in fundraising 
keker characterized that assertion as a flatout 100 percent 
oldfashioned allamerican lie 
north said he barely knew fielding 
at the us naval academy you would have been kicked out for 
this keker asked at one point in connection with norths role in 
drafting the mcfarlane letter to congress 
in the us naval academy nobody taught me to run a covert 
operation north retorted nor about political warfare going on 
in washington in 19831986 
on another matter north denied he tried to help his associate 
richard secord make a half million dollars by renting a ship to 
the cia which turned out not to be interested in the offer 
during a 19841986 congressional ban on military aid to the 
rebels north had enlisted secord to run arms to the contras an 
operation which the government alleges turned millions of dollars 
in profits for secord a retired air force major general 
keker has been trying to draw a connection between secords 
profits and favors done for north for example one charge against 
north is that he illegally accepted a 13800 home security system 
paid for by secord 
at the naval academy you were taught falsehood included 
deception asked keker of the witness a marine lieutenant 
colonel until he resigned in the wake of the irancontra affair 
you were also trained to obey all lawful orders asked 
keker underlining the word lawful on a large pad on an easel 
facing the jury 
did you take courses in that and learn what was meant by 
lawful and unlawful you were trained and taught that it was a 
crime when in world war ii at the end of the war german officers 
came and said they were ordered to do it 
said north i dont believe i have ever received an unlawful 
order

despite two tests that seem to confirm part of 
a utah cold nuclear fusion experiment experts said tuesday that 
more questions need to be answered before most scientists accept 
there has been a breakthrough 
were all mystified by this and watching it said dale m 
meade head of fusion reaction research at princeton niversity 
its the scientific way to be skeptical that process is still 
going on 
meade and others said the experiments announced monday at texas 
aampm and georgia tech did shed some light on what university of utah 
officials claim is a demonstration of fusion at room temperature 
but most experts remain unconvinced that fusion has actually 
taken place and some suggest the phenomenon may be something new to 
science 
they utah researchers have taken the position that it was a 
fusion reaction said john soures a university of rochester 
fusion scientist but that has yet to proven 
i think this whole thing may go down as one of the most 
bizarre episodes in 20th century science he added 
in an announcement two weeks ago stanley pons of the university 
of utah and martin fleischmann of the university of southhampton in 
england said they had achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory 
equipment at room temperature 
their experiment used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum 
immersed in a beaker of deuterium an isotope of hydrogen commonly 
found in seawater pons said that when electrical power was applied 
to the coil for about 100 hours it forced deuterium atoms into the 
palladium until they finally fused producing energy in the form of 
heat 
pons claimed the device made four watts of energy for every watt 
of energy used 
fusion has been the goal of thousands of scientists around the 
world for more than a quarter century it is the energy secret of 
the stars the sun and the reaction that gives the boom to the 
hydrogen bomb 
if the reaction could be controlled scientists believe it could 
be the ultimate energy source giving virtually limitless 
electrical power using a cheap fuel extracted from sea water and 
producing only modest amounts of radiation hazard 
in fusion hydrogen atoms are forced together as they fuse 
they give off energy neutrons and helium3 a stable chemical 
fusion is the opposite of fission the nuclear reaction that splits 
the atomic nucleus fission is the force that powers atomic power 
plants and nuclear bombs 
at texas aampm scientists said monday an apparatus similar to the 
utah experiment did produce some excess energy but the reaction 
was so small that their equipment was not sensitive enough to 
detect the flow of neutrons a characteristic of fusion 
aampms charles martin said his group could have come from some 
unusual chemical process and not from nuclear fusion this 
possibility he said is being investigated 
a similar experiment at georgia tech did produce neutrons 
causing researcher bill livesay to announce theres no question 
its fusion i still dont believe it even though i see it 
the georgia tech experiment began producing neutron particles 
and probes measured a flow of about 560 neutrons an hour above the 
background radiation 
however georgia techs james mahaffey said the team did not 
confirm that the experiment produced more energy than it used 
meade said fusion cannot be confirmed until more laboratories 
have conducted the experiment and made precise measurements of both 
the heat production and the flow of neutrons he said the rise in 
neutrons and in heat should track each other that is show by 
measurement to be directly related 
it is not enough to just see some heat there and the hint of a 
few neutrons said meade we need to be able to relate this 
energy to some process that would produce it 
he said the amount of energy reported in the utah experiment 
would develop trillions of neutrons a second and if the texas and 
georgia experiments matched the energy output they too would 
have high neutron flow 
they are missing billions of neutrons per second said 
meade they hypothize that is may a different type of nuclear 
reaction than we have known physics experts around the world are 
trying to come up with some nuclear reaction that we havent seen 
before it possible but not very probable 
both meade and soures said the energy surge seen in the 
experiment may be created by a battery effect 
it takes weeks for the energy output to get up to the reported 
levels said soures this suggests that its operating more 
like a battery than fusion 
he said the device could be storing the electrical energy put 
into the experiment and then discharging the power as heat when it 
becomes satuated 
tom dolan of the department of energy laboratory in idaho falls 
idaho said that a good explanation of the utah experiment will not 
be developed until more experiments are conducted and the 
fundamental process is finally understood 
sometimes these things could drag on for months before they 
are resolved he said but right now i dont think it is a 
breakthrough that will be useful

have never had that type of dealings 
the court is located inside the southern prison on the outskirts 
of mexico city felix gallardo stood behind bars during the 
proceeding 
he was asked if he used drugs and he replied yes 
sporadically but im not an addict 
felix gallardo was moved under heavy guard before dawn from the 
attorney generals office where he had been held since his arrest 
saturday in guadalajara 
nine others arrested in the investigation including several of 
felix gallardos aides and the chief federal antidrug official and 
five other ranking police officers in sinaloa state were jailed in 
mexico citys northern prison 
authorities on monday seized some of felix gallardos assets 
including a hotel pharmacy realestate company bank accounts and 
other properties no value was placed on the assets but his net 
worth is estimated to exceed 500 million 
he was asked in court how much he earned he said he could not 
say 
judge amado guerrero alvardo said the charges against felix 
gallardo carry a sentence of seven to 15 years 
the judge has three days to decide whether to issue an 
indictment and then a year to review the evidence and present the 
verdict 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo on monday called 
felix gallardo the no 1 drug trafficker in mexico 
in the northwestern state of sinaloa judicial police patrolled 
the residential zones in felix gallardos hometown of culiacan 
especially the districts where he owned property 
felix gallardo 43 was taken to the 10th district court on the 
basis of a warrant the court issued for him in 1986 after the 
arrest of hugo devere becerra 
parts of the 500page court document read to felix gallardo were 
based on testimony by devere becerra who allegedly was felix 
gallardos partner for a year or two beginning in 1983 
devere becerra also has been linked to other drug traffickers 
including rafael caro quintero who was arrested in the 1985 
slaying of american dea agent enrique camarena salazar 
caro quintero was sentenced in september 1988 to 34 years in 
prison after being convicted on drugrelated charges he has not 
been tried in the abduction torture and killing of camarena 
salazar that case is in a court in the western city of guadalajara 
during tuesdays hearing felix gallardo denied knowing devere 
becerra or at least four other reputed narcotics kingpins he was 
not asked about caro quintero 
alvarez del castillo said monday his office had no evidence 
linking felix gallardo directly to the killing of camarena salazar 
but he said he was the intellectual author of the organization 
that murdered the agent 
felix gallardo was asked by the court what he did between march 
and december of 1984 the period covered by devere becerras 
depositions 
he said during this period i was only dedicated to my hotel 
business and a concession for sales of building along with 
various businesses in which im up to date on tax payments 
he gave his profession as a businessman said he was married and 
had four children and had attended junior high school he also said 
he was a native of culiacan and lived in guadalajara 
felix gallardo denied testimony in the court record that he used 
several airplanes including his own 15 million aerocommander to 
transport drugs from south america to various parts of mexico and 
sometimes across the border to the united states

the governments exportimport bank which has 
been borrowing money at more than 9 per cent interest announced 
tuesday it is making a 17 million loan to the firm of babcock and 
wilcox at 65 percent 
most loans by the bank go to other countries to encourage them 
to buy us goods but the bank also is authorized to lend to 
american companies to help them compete for business at home 
against subsidized loans from other governments 
babcock and wilcox will use the money to install a heat recovery 
boiler at a gaylord container corp paper mill at bogalusa la the 
loan is for eight years with repayment beginning in july 1990 
the loan was announced after the government determined that the 
brazilian government had offered a 65 percent noncompetitive 
loan to gotaverken a joint venture of brazilian and swedish 
companies the us bank matched the offer 
ann frey public information officer at the bank said 
babcock and wilcox employees will build the equipment in the 
united states were supporting american jobs and not brazilian 
jobs 
a noncompetitive loan by an official agency needs a subsidy from 
taxpayers to make up the difference between the higher interest 
rate that the government has to pay for the money it borrows and 
the lowercost financing it offers to the private company 
last time the us bank itself borrowed money it had to pay 934 
percent

the senate small business committee voted on 
tuesday for the nomination of susan s engeleiter to be chief of 
the small business administration five months after she lost a bid 
for the us senate 
by a unanimous voice vote the panel sent the nomination to the 
full senate where her formal confirmation is expected as early as 
next week 
the small business administration was persistently targeted for 
elimination by former president reagan as part of his deficit 
reduction efforts but engeleiter 37 told the lawmakers that the 
agencys future is bright under president bush 
president bush fully appreciates the importance of small 
business to the american economy and the importance of the small 
business administration to small businesses she said in her 
opening remarks 
engeleiter the wisconsin state senate republican leader was 
defeated in november by democrat herbert h kohl in the race for 
the us senate seat vacated by william proxmire who retired 
her selection to head the small business administration was 
supported by several business groups including national small

a nurses aide who reported a suspicious 
death at a hospital last year was questioned tuesday by police 
investigating four other nurses aides who confessed to what they 
described as 49 mercy killings 
all the patients at lainz hospital were elderly 75 years or 
older and were killed over the past six years with overdoses of 
medicine or by water forced into their lungs police said they 
doubted the claim of mercy killing because of the methods used 
one investigator said the nurses aides also admitted to killing 
patients they considered a nuisance 
after a cabinet meeting tuesday chancellor franz vranitzky 
spoke of the case as the most brutal and gruesome crime in 
austrias history 
the killings prompted vienna mayor helmut zilk to evoke nazi 
medical experiments at auschwitz and other death camps 
the death angels of lainz remind me of the death angels of 
auschwitz zilk said during a televised debate late monday 
nurses aides maria gruber 25 irene leidolf 27 waltraud 
wagner 30 and stephanie mayer 50 are in custody but no charges 
have been filed three were arrested friday and one sunday 
police said ms wagner admitted killing 39 patients 22 of them 
by forcing water into their lungs and ms mayer to killing five 
patients one with water 
a fifth nurses aide chileanborn dorah eugenie 
ferradaavendano was on vacation when a warrant for her arrest was 
issued and she went to police tuesday for questioning 
authorities said they doubted she was involved and speculated 
the other four implicated her because she reported her suspicions 
last year 
the first deaths in the ward which has come to be known as 
the death pavilion occurred in 1983 but most were committed 
in the last two years police said 
max edelbacher a senior police investigator said tuesday that 
questioning of nursing personnel substantiated the assumption of 
knowledge and suspicion about the crimes committed at the 
hospitals first medical department he said police got the 
impression staff members did not take rumors about the deaths 
seriously 
edelbacher told the associated press the total of patients 
killed will probably rise above 49 with further investigation 
as aides the women were supposed to wash and feed patients but 
not to give injections according to hospital officials 
austrian radio said ms ferradaavendano told police she knew of 
one murder and told a doctor about it 
but edelbacher said she knew of killings at the hospital two or 
three years before she first mentioned her suspicion last year 
he said that as a single woman coming from abroad and having to 
look after a son she was under constraint that made it hard for 
her to approach authorities 
police chief guenter boegl has said the overdoses administered 
were insulin or tranquilizers 
police sources said aides plugged the noses of at least 23 
victims and pumped water into their lungs investigators said each 
nurse knew the others were killing patients and in some cases two 
nurses would act together 
an unidentified man confirming a newspaper interview told 
austrian tv he saw waltraud wagner administer sleeping medication 
to a 86yearold male patient who died hours later the man refused 
to face the camera or give his name 
franz pesendorfer who heads the department where the murders 
occurred said he and his doctors could not have known about the 
mass slayings because the crimes were committed in a secret and 
sophisticated way 
edelbacher said police met a wall of silence when they tried 
to get the name of the doctor said to have been told about 
suspicious events in the ward 
zilk read a police statement that said the doctor when finally 
identified refused to name his informant 
the mayor appointed a commission to consider possible negligence 
at the hospital viennas fourth largest

princess anne had a brief reunion tuesday with her 
husband of 15 years while a royal aide the tabloids say is 
besotted with her remained on duty behind the walls of windsor 
castle 
all three kept silent on the questions that grip britains 
masscirculation newspapers is the marriage of the queens only 
daughter in trouble and is timothy laurence the royal aide who 
wrote four letters to her the other man in her life 
buckingham palace refused to comment on reports that laurence a 
handsome 34yearold bachelor who is a royal navy commander had 
offered his resignation to queen elizabeth ii 
it said only that the theft of the four letters delivered to the 
sun britains largestcirculation tabloid was under investigation 
by scotland yard 
in a frontpage story tuesday the sun quoted unidentified 
friends of laurence as saying he is besotted with princess anne 
and believes she loves him too 
under the banner headline tim so in love with anne the 
rival daily mirror quoted other unidentified friends as saying they 
have had long telephone chats at night and have met secretly at a 
house in the country 
rumors have circulated since 1981 of trouble in the marriage of 
princess anne 38 and mark phillips a 40yearold commoner and 
former captain in the queens dragoon guards they were brought 
together by their love of horses but have led increasingly separate 
lives spending about half of 1988 apart 
on sunday and monday the princess and phillips had separate 
schedules and did not see each other then had only a brief reunion 
in the early hours of tuesday 
she arrived at their gatcombe park estate in western england 
after midnight monday and went horseback riding at 6 am tuesday 
by the time she returned three hours later phillips was gone 
his business agent taryn bennelick said he was somewhere in 
spain 
his father maj peter phillips said his son was advising 
people who wanted to set up an equestrian center in spain 
there is no question of him running away said the senior 
phillips 68 one is getting rather fed up with all the 
speculation they have been getting along for the last 10 years 
without any problems 
anne kept public engagements in london later tuesday including 
visits to research projects related to multiple sclerosis and 
muscular dystrophy at the national hospitals institute of 
neurology 
laurence was on duty at windsor as an equerry or aide to the 
queen 
the sun which told scotland yard it would not reveal the 
contents of the letters quoted one of laurences friends tuesday 
as saying 
obviously tim and the princess were physically attracted to 
each other but their friendship goes deeper than that tim has 
apparently filled a loneliness in her life and given her a shoulder 
to cry on when she needed someone to tell her troubles to 
he understands her tantrums and the bad publicity she often 
attracts but most of all he cares for her in the way she believes 
her husband does not 
there is royal precedent for divorce the queens only sister 
princess margaret divorced lord snowden in 1978 and he has 
remarried 
because anne is seventh in line to the throne and unlikely to 
become queen a divorce would not threaten the monarchy

retired supreme court justice willard estey said 
tuesday he will not hear new testimony in reviewing the disputed 
investigation of a 1985 gander newfoundland airplane crash that 
killed 256 americans 
im giving a legal opinion im not holding a hearing estey 
said in a phone interview from his office in toronto im sitting 
here reading tons of evidence 
estey agreed last month to review a threeyear investigation by 
the canadian aviation safety board and deliver a report in 90 days 
on whether it was adequate or if further investigation or even a 
new inquiry is warranted 
a letter from estey to a transportation official published 
tuesday by the ottawa citizen rejected requests that he hear new 
testimony 
estey said he had no direct comment on the citizens report but 
remarked that the terms of reference for his 90day review were to 
decide if a new hearing is needed and not to hold one now 
the safety boards report on canadas worst air disaster was 
released in december after internal disputes that often went public 
five of the nine members approved the report saying the probable 
cause of the dec 12 1985 crash was ice on the wings of the arrow 
air charter dc8 
four members released a minority report saying an inflight fire 
or explosion was the most likely cause 
the plane carrying us soldiers from middle east peacekeeping 
duties to fort campbell ky crashed shortly after taking off from 
a refueling stop at gander killed were 248 us servicemen and 
eight crew 
according to the letter obtained by the citizen estey decided 
to base his review on existing records of the crash investigation 
this upset some members of the safety board and families of 
crash victims who hoped estey would let them testify on why they 
believe a fullscale judicial inquiry into the disaster is 
warranted 
in an april 5 letter to a transport canada official the ottawa 
citizen reported estey wrote he had heard some safety board 
members planned to submit new information 
if i were to entertain submissions from board members i 
believe that that would be both improper in law and would oblige me 
to hear submissions from all interested parties on an equal 
footing it quoted the letter as saying 
transportation minister benoit bouchard named estey to review 
the investigation last month 
theresa griffin widow of pilot john griffin wrote estey last 
week asking to testify she is among those trying to clear the name 
of griffin indirectly blamed for the accident by not having the 
plane deiced before takeoff 
this is not going to be an impartial review said jerry 
rusinowitz a griffin supporter the fact that we are being 
excluded is intentional its part of the game plan its a 
coverup

republican legislators on tuesday introduced a 
childcare bill that would offer a tax credit to low and 
moderateincome families who care for small children at home as 
well as those who send their children to daycare facilities 
were going to use the tax code of this country to put dollars 
in pockets of parents said sen pete domenici rnm chief 
sponsor of the bill in the senate were not going to 
discriminate if they want to put their children in day care 
centers theyre going to have money to pay for it and 
essentially were not going to discriminate if in these families 
the mother or father chooses not to work 
the proposal recognizes every family has different 
circumstances said rep tom tauke of iowa the bills chief 
house sponsor 
republicans said their bill is an alternative to the act for 
better child care abc bill that has been revived by sen 
christopher dodd dconn 
they said their bill would serve more families give the money 
directly to parents and not daycare providers allow state and 
local governments and not the federal government to set daycare 
standards and not restrict eligibility to child care in 
centerbased facilities 
the tax credit approach is not a child care bill responded 
dodd spokesman jason isaacson he said the 1000 credit proposed 
by the gop would cover just onethird of the average annual 3000 
child care costs families face 
to propose childcare legislation and to dismiss the question 
of quality is to say that if you live in a state that has tough 
health and safety standards congratulations and if you live in a 
state that does not tough luck said isaacson 
republicans including thenpresidential candidate george bush 
were critical of the democrats version of the bill in the past 
congress 
current tax law provides tax savings up to 720 annually per 
child for a maximum of two children to help offset some expenses 
required for parents to get or keep a job 
domenici said the gop initiative would help the majority of the 
nations families whose children he said were not served in 
daycare center settings but were in homebased facilities 
we now know that only about 12 percent of the children that 
were talking about today are taken care of in childcare 
centers domenici said eightyeight percent of them are taken 
care of either at home by their parents theyre taken care of by 
relatives theyre in homebased kinds of daycare facilities so we 
think that we ought to help the 88 percent 
the bill called the child care assistance act of 1989 would 
provide a 1000 refundable tax credit for the first child 
under age five and 500 each for up to two additional children 
expand the current dependent care block grants authorization 
to states to 300 million annually 
offer a 10 percent tax credit to employers for spending on 
dependent care assistance programs made available to employees 
establish a 75 million fund to assist states in establishing 
insurance liability pools to which any accredited childcare 
provider may belong 
authorize 25 million in revolving loan funds which 
familybased daycare providers could tap to help them make capital 
improvements to meet accreditation requirements 
the gop lawmakers said 3 billion in potential tax revenues 
would be foregone during the first year of the bill but they 
expected those revenues to be replaced they did not say how that 
would happen

papua new guinea facing a revolt on 
the remote island of bougainville has asked australia to provide 
emergency medical aid to its troops after two were killed in 
weekend ambushes the australian government said tuesday 
the request for helicopters for rapid medical evacuation came 
after two soldiers were shot dead sunday apparently by militant 
landowners bringing the death toll from in recent violence to six 
the local landowners are opposed to foreigncontrolled mining 
operations prime minister rabbie namaliu of papua new guinea said 
it appeared they were equipped with weapons from overseas 
kim beazley australias defense minister said papua new guinea 
made the request because sundays violence marked the first time 
its troops were killed in action 
an aide to the australian defense ministry speaking on 
condition of anonymity said australia expects to respond favorably 
to the request 
papua new guinea with a 35 million mainly melanesian 
population is just north of australia it gained independence from 
australia in 1975 
namaliu did not give details of the clashes but said if it 
is established that foreign elements have been involved we will 
pursue these criminals this is truly a sad event in the nations 
history 
tensions have been high on bougainville for months after local 
landowners objected to profits being made from the islands copper 
mine which ranks among the worlds 10 biggest open cut mines 
last year local landowners demanded the equivalent of 4 
billion in compensation for mining operations and mounted a series 
of sabotage attacks that temporarily suspended mining operations 
local landowners also object to the presence of immigrant tribal 
highlanders who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s and have formed a 
large community depriving many locals of employment 
a spate of recent murders between the two groups has fueled the 
unrest 
australias biggest mining company cra ltd jointly operates 
the bougainville copper mine which is about 300 miles northeast of 
the mainland 
the papua new guinea government also issued shoottokill 
orders if further violence erupts the australian associated press

turgut ozal whose party suffered defeat in local elections last 
month won a vote of confidence in parliament on tuesday 289 to 95 
the 57 members of the centrist true path party boycotted the 
vote in the onehouse 450seat parliament the chief opposition 
the social democrat populist party voted against the government 
ozals motherland party has an overwhelming majority in the 
legislature 
after the setback in local polling ozal overhauled his cabinet 
and then sought the confidence vote 
about 300000 workers meanwhile joined a campaign of passive 
resistance called by turkis the nations largest labor union 
confederation to protest what it said were low incomes at a time 
of high inflation 
the protest includes a work slowdown a boycott of 
companyprovided luncheons the growing of beards a refusal to 
work overtime and going for hospital visits en masse said turkis 
spokesman erkin okay 
turkis president sevket yilmaz whose federation has 18 
million members said on tuesday that the campaign was prompted by 
deadlock in contract negotiations for more than 600000 workers 
employed by state agencies such as sugar factories the electricity 
authority and state highways department 
in march 26 local elections motherland won only 22 percent of 
the vote nationwide and trailed both the social democrat and true

say ozal wants to delay the voting until 1990 
he apparently hopes to win voter support if given more time to 
lower inflation which reached 75 percent last year

a house banking panel voted tuesday to gut the 
key reform of the bush administrations savings and loan proposal 
but then rolled back in several followup votes on some of the 
changes that most weakened the plan 
by a 2423 vote the house banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions diluted a requirement to force sampl owners to back 
loans with more of their own capital 
the original weakening amendment sponsored by reps frank 
annunzio dill and stan parris rva provided a much looser 
definition of what constitutes capital by including such balance 
sheet items as goodwill subordinated debt deferred loan losses 
and mortgage servicing rights 
then the subcommittee partly retightened the definition of 
capital regarding subordinated debt and deferred loan losses in 
subsequent votes of 2819 and 2621 respectively 
however the bill as written so far still would allow 
institutions failing to meet the standard to grow by about 7 
percent to 8 percent a year the administration wants to bar 
capitaldeficient thrifts from expanding 
weve come back some but were still concerned that we not 
have fictional capital assistant treasury secretary david w 
mullins said after the votes 
there are still problems it is still not as good as the bush 
bill but a small group of democrats got george bush his 
capital standards said rep charles schumer dny who has 
been supporting the administration position 
the subcommittee with sessions scheduled wednesday and 
thursday still faced long hours drafting other provisions of the 
bill but members agreed the capital standards were the central 
reform accompanying president bushs proposal to spend 50 billion 
to close or merge failed sampls 
in the original vote to gut the provision seven republicans 
joined 17 democrats in supporting the change they were opposed by 
11 democrats and 12 republicans 
it really really guts this bill i would have to say it 
surrenders to the us league of savings institutions the 
industrys chief lobby group said rep gerald kleczka dwis 
rep jim leach riowa told panel members before the vote that 
we ought to have a little backbone and said bush would veto any 
legislation with weak capital standards 
this amendment embraces one more time smokeandmirrors 
accounting and smokeandmirrors capital said rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full committee which will 
review the version of the bill that eventually passes the 
subcommittee 
bush wants to increase sampl capital requirements by june 1991 
from 3 percent of assets to 6 percent contending that the more 
capital sampl owners have at risk the less likely they will be to 
take undue risks and the greater the buffer standing in front of 
the government deposit insurance fund 
parris said his amendment worked out over the weekend by aides 
to committee members was absolutely not overgenerous to 
thrifts he argued that if each element of the capital standards 
was separately debated the end result would be an even weaker 
bill however so far the individual votes have gone in the other 
direction 
annunzio said 1091 solvent sampls more than a third of the 
industry would fail to meet the administrations capital rules and 
would not be allowed to grow 
in reality that is a death sentence he said adding it 
must be pointed out that these 1100 savings and loan institutions 
are not the bad guys rather for the most part these are 
institutions scattered throughout the country that were primarily 
engaged in home lending 
earlier the subcommittee adopted 3017 a separate weakening 
amendment offered by rep bill mccollum rfla 
the administration wants to encourage sampls to get out of areas 
such as direct investment in real estate insurance and junk bonds 
by requiring owners to back those investments entirely with their 
own capital mccollums amendment exempts healthy thrifts already 
engaged in those businesses from the stricter standard 
the panel also approved on a 357 vote a proposal by rep doug 
barnard dga that would protect holding companies that bought 
sick sampls last year with the promise of government aid from having 
to absorb the costs if those institutions fail because the 
assistance is cut off 
barnard said the measure was aimed at preventing other sampls 
under a holding companys umbrella from also failing because of a 
government failure to live up to the aid agreements 
gonzalez complained that the amendment would create a large 
loophole for holding companies to skirt any liability if the 
oncefailed thrifts go under again 
in other decisions the subcommittee 
rejected 3114 an amendment by rep joseph p kennedy ii 
dmass proposing a sweeping change in accounting standards 
kennedy would force banks and sampls to value loans at their market 
price rather than at their original worth the change would have 
drastically altered the balance sheets of big banks with shaky 
loans to third world countries 
rebuffed on a voice vote an attempt rep john lafalce dny 
to get states with high numbers of statechartered thrift failures 
such as texas california and florida to help pay for the bailout 
protected the federal deposit insurance corp from political 
interference by extending on a voice vote the terms of board 
members to eight years and the terms of the chairman and vice 
chairman to five years

chiles military preparing to surrender 
power after 16 years of authoritarian rule has vowed to intervene 
again if an elected civilian government does not maintain the 
present institutional order 
that warning was issued by president augusto pinochet the army 
commander and the chief of the military academy of strategic 
studies 
pinochet led the coup that ousted the elected government of 
marxist president salvador allende in september 1973 in october 
voters rejected a military proposal to extend pinochets term until 
1997 an open presidential election now is scheduled for dec 14 
with the winner to take office next march 11 
the 73yearold pinochet speaking monday night in southern 
chile said the armed forces must guard the constitutional 
order 
that obliges us to make sure without hesitation that the 
sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years 
destroyed he said we will continue to work to ensure that 
those seeking political power are authentic democrats who defend 
the model of a free society 
army gen alejandro medina commander of the military academy 
delivered a stronger message monday to hundreds of noncommissioned 
officers 
if the institutional order is broken the armed forces have 
the duty to restore it using all the necessary means he 
said 
medina said civilians must understand the role of the armed 
forces and that role is not one of a policeman watching the 
country but to support the reign of law and the institutional 
order 
opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the 
institutional order based on a 1980 constitution approved in a 
referendum 
opponents have centered their criticism on two issues a 
constitutional article that allows pinochet and the heads of the 
other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998 and the 
creation of a militarydominated national security council to 
represent its views on crucial matters 
no significant progress has been reported in negotiations 
between the government and opposition on possible constitutional 
changes 
pinochet authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow 
changes in key articles 
the army issued a communique monday denouncing criticism of 
pinochet and saying the army considered such criticism as 
addressed to each and all members of our institution

the interior department faced with a 
longrunning fight over central california water announced the 
renewal tuesday of a longterm contract to supply water to farmers 
despite objections from environmentalists 
but interior secretary manuel lujan jr directed that an 
environmental assessment of the lease renewal be done and he 
suggested that state officials and other interested groups could 
solve any environmental problems 
while the lease only involves the orange cove irrigation 
district in the san joaquin valley the action is likely to set a 
precedent for other central california irrigation projects which 
serve farmers who also rely on the delivery of federal water 
through an elaborate system of dams and canals 
environmentalists have opposed a renewal of the longterm leases 
because they argue the leases lock the government into supplying a 
certain volume of water well into the next century at a time when 
rapid population growth also is putting new demands on nonfarming 
water needs 
as water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban 
use streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands which support 
migratory waterfowl will disappear the critics maintain 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources sharply 
criticized the decision to resume renewing the leases at a time 
when there are uncertainties about their environmental impact 
this decision further corrodes the environmental credentials 
of the bush administration miller said 
randall block an attorney who represents several environmental 
groups that have challenged the lease renewals said its kind 
of backward to sign the leases and then order an environmental 
assessment 
the friant unit of the central valley project as the huge 
irrigation system is called receives 15 million acrefeet of 
water a year from interiors bureau of reclamation providing water 
for both large and small farms and orchards 
the decision to renew the lease came as different agencies of 
the bush administration also continued to disagree sharply on 
whether new california water contracts running 40 years should be 
issued without resolving all their potential environmental 
ramifications 
after the interior department indicated last november that it 
planned to renew the 40year leases without first developing formal 
environmental impact statements the environmental protection 
agency challenged the leases elevating the matter to the white 
house 
more than a dozen environmental groups also protested and the 
natural resources defense council filed suit in california arguing 
that another 40year water commitment is such a significant act 
that it requires a formal environmental assessment under the 
national environmental policy act 
a federal judge recently said in response to the suit the 
leases could be issued but he reserved the right to void any such 
lease depending on the outcome of the government debate over 
environmental issues 
the presidents council on environmental quality has scheduled 
meetings in washington and california on thursday and monday to 
gather information on the environmental issues surrounding the 
lease renewal controversy 
while the presidential council has no authority to block the 
leases or order environmental assessments its opinions on such 
matters historically have carried considerable weight among federal 
agencies and in congress 
in a statement lujan said the department action on the orange 
cove lease renewal should not have an impact on the ceq 
proceedings he said he has ordered the head of the bureau of 
reclamation to proceed with an environmental assessment of 
continuing water deliveries to the massive central valley project 
of which orange cove is only a small part 
the renewal of longterm water supply contracts may pose 
legitimate environmental concerns said lujan adding that the 
assessment he ordered should be considered by the state and 
local districts as they adopt environmentally sensitive operating 
procedures and water policies 
that is essentially different than doing an eis environmental 
impact statement under federal law suggested richard sanderson 
director of the office of federal activities at the environmental 
protection agency he said interior officials are essentially 
sidestepping the national environmental policy act in the 
procedures being used to consider the environmental issues 
our position at epa is the entire water issue for california 
needs to be reviewed in light of todays environmental standards 
and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence 
said sanderson in an interview 
lujan said the lease renewal would encourage increased water 
conservation among the farmers by charging substantially higher 
prices for the water uder the new contract with orange cove the 
cost of federal water would quadruple from 350 to 1494 per acre 
foot he said 
an acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land 
one foot deep or about 350000 gallons

the soviet unions decision to stop jamming 
radio free europe and radio liberty presents an unparalled 
opportunity to spread american ideals and policies in eastern 
europe an official said tuesday in seeking new money for the 
usoperated networks 
malcolm s forbes jr the publishing magnate and chairman of 
the board for international broadcasting told a senate 
subcommittee that the greatest challenge for rferl is to respond 
to the end to jamming despite severe budget constraints 
he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs new policy of 
openness has placed the soviet union and eastern europe at a 
crossroads of history 
soviet jamming stopped late last year making the mission of 
rferl more important than at any time in its nearly 40year 
history forbes said the united states can affect the nature 
and direction of reforms in the east bloc by ensuring that all 
citizens of the region have access to the full range of information 
necessary for making intelligent political decisions 
the board for international broadcasting an independent federal 
agency that oversees rferl is seeking a 4252 million 
appropriation in fiscal 1990 to beam its broadcasts into the soviet 
union and eastern europe 
more than 55 percent of that amount 2348 million is a 
onetime expense to complete modernization of rferls transmitting 
system 
about 207 million will go to build a new relay station in 
israel with the rest to be the final installment on a refurbishing 
program for existing relay stations that began in 1985 
funding of bib modernization needs is critical in fiscal year 
1990 said pat schlueter the agencys financial manager this 
is very important for the israeli relay station so the major 
contracts can be let in 1990 
the relay station will be used jointly by rferl and voice of 
america the radio network operated by the us information agency 
and will increase the stations signals by 300 percent in central 
asia beginning in 1992 forbes said 
marvin l stone acting director of usia proposed a 1990 
appropriation of 9492 million at the hearing before a senate 
appropriations subcommittee 
stone said the budget request is a 669 million increase over 
this year but that losses in funds from the state department and 
other cost increases will mean an actual cutback in usias 
operating funds 
he said usia will be forced to cut back voas greek and turkish 
language broadcasts close some relay stations and overseas posts 
and cut staff 
house and senate appropriations subcommittees have been 
supportive of the budget requests but neither have made any 
promises said an agency official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
the usia budget does not call for any money for the 
controversial tv marti project which is to beam voa broadcasts to 
cuba but stone said usia is negotiating with the office of 
management and budget for a 1990 budget amendment for tv marti 
usias 1989 appropriation included 75 million in startup funds 
for tv marti which faces strong opposition from us broadcasters 
who fear it will interfere with their tv signals 
a presidential commission in january questioned tv martis 
legality and technical feasibility 
sen claiborne pell dri who is chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee has opposed tv marti particularly in 
light of the soviet decision to stop jamming us broadcasts in 
eastern europe 
the house is expected to vote on new tv marti funding wednesday

an adviser to prime minister yitzhak shamir was 
indicted tuesday on charges of accepting bribes in land deals in 
the occupied west bank and israel radio said the money was passed 
to shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
a tel aviv district court accused michael dekel a former deputy 
minister of agriculture of soliciting 233000 in bribes from land 
developers in return for help in obtaining government permits for 
buying land in the west bank 
the indictment said dekel began demanding the money in april 
1984 after national elections were announced and that dekels 
assistant avi tzur passed the money to the likud and other 
organizations linked to the political bloc 
the elections held in july 1984 ended in a stalemate between 
the likud and the leftleaning labor party and the two formed a 
joint unity government 
prosecutor rachel shiber said dekel received money from at least 
four land dealers 
dekel now shamirs adviser on settlements in the occupied 
lands was charged with soliciting and accepting bribes breach of 
confidence and conspiracy he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years 
in prison if convicted 
as deputy agriculture minister for settlement affairs from 
august 1981 to october 1984 dekel was instrumental in involving 
private entrepreneurs in projects for building jewish settlements 
in the west bank 
about 70000 jewish settlers live in more than 130 settlements 
among 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
which were captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east

two house panels gave unusually routine 
approval tuesday to a 497 million aid package for nicaraguas 
contra rebels designed to carry out an agreement between president 
bush and the democraticcontrolled congress 
the house foreign affairs committee approved the aid package 
always a source of virulent contention in the past on a 32to6 
vote and the appropriations foreign operations subcommittee gave 
voicevote approval to the package which is expected to come 
before the full house on thursday 
the money is to keep up the flow of food clothing and medicine 
to the roughly 11000 rebel fighters encamped in honduras along the 
nicaraguan border through february of next year when the leftist 
sandinista regime has promised to hold national elections 
it may be used as well to support voluntary reintegration 
of the rebels into nicaraguan political life assuming promised 
electoral and media reforms are made by the sandinista government 
under the agreement announced march 24 at the white house the 
money may be cut off if the rebels engage in human rights abuses or 
in offensive military action 
the bill would require no new money instead transferring the 
aid funds from various pentagon accounts 
later tuesday a companion bill providing the 497 million in 
contra money was introduced in the senate and put on track for 
swift passage 
the measure offered by senate majority leader george mitchell 
and minority leader robert dole was referred immediately to the 
appropriations and foreign relations committees the latter of 
which planned a hearing wednesday 
dole rkan said he was working with mitchell on a time 
agreement for debating the plan and said he hoped the floor debate 
could come thursday 
this legislation is the result of a great many hours of work 
by members on both sides of the aisle said mitchell dmaine 
dole said he wished there was sentiment in the congress to 
approve military aid to the contras but conceded the votes 
arent there 
dole then applauded bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii for striking the deal for humanitarian aid for the contras 
saying the united states needed to remain a player in central 
america in case nicaraguas sandinista government reneges on 
commitments to democratic reforms 
im not under any illusions that danny ortega is suddenly 
going to be a good boy in central america dole said referring 
to the nicaraguan president

pakistan agreed tuesday to permit more 
un checkpoints of military observers along the afghanpakistan 
border where kabul says illegal aid from pakistan is flowing to 
the afghan rebels 
pakistani envoy iqbal akhund told the security council in 
emergency session that pakistan has agreed to provide a permanent 
presence along the border to the un military assistance group for 
afghanistan and pakistan or ungomap 
this increased presence of un military observers now 
numbering only 50 repeatedly was requested by kabul and moscow 
which allege pakistan is violating unmediated agreements on 
noninterference 
pakistan denies the charges but its agreement on the additional 
checkpoints is considered a minor concession un diplomats said 
they did not think it would have a significant impact 
afghanistan pakistan the united states and the soviet union 
signed a unsponsored agreement in april 1988 calling for the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan soviet troops entered 
afghanistan in 1979 to help the marxist government fight 
usbacked moslem guerrillas and 100000 soldiers were in the 
country before the withdrawal 
akhund the prime ministers adviser on foreign affairs and 
national security said pakistan has agreed to provide new border 
checkpoints to ungomap in border areas including chaman parachinar 
and torkham nawa pass these are in the northwest frontier 
province and in baluchistan 
earlier afghanistan urged the security council to take 
immediate action to stop what it called pakistans fullfledged 
war against kabul and to stop intervention by the pakistan army 
and militia 
aside from more un border checkpoints it called for an 
international conference on afghanistan a security council 
factfinding mission and us and soviet efforts to persuade 
pakistan to stop aid to rebels 
foreign minister abdul wakil appealing to the us government 
said the question is why the united states a big world power 
becomes the tool for the implementation of pakistani policies on 
afghanistan why should the strategic interests of the united 
states be subdued to the expansionist designs of pakistan in the 
region 
pakistan which aids the afghan rebels denied all allegations 
of interference massing its troops and taking part in the battle 
for jalalabad a key city in afghanistan 
the 15member council was not expected to adopt any critical 
resolution or take action on afghanistans complaint because the 
united states which backs pakistan would veto any action 
it adjourned after speeches from afghan and pakistani envoys no 
further meeting was scheduled 
the other permanent council members with veto power are britain 
china france and the soviet union the soviet union which arms 
the kabul government against the rebels is president of the 
security council this month 
despite the withdrawal of soviet troops in february the united 
states and pakistan continue to arm the afghan guerrillas and the 
soviet union continues to resupply the kabul army moscow says it 
will halt its arms supplies if the united states does so but the 
rearming continues and efforts to seek a political settlement and 
establish a broadbased government have faltered 
the other council members are algeria brazil canada colombia 
ethipia finland malaysia nepal senegal and yugoslavia

police said tuesday they had leads to the 
youths who killed two people in a weekend driveby shooting and 
community leaders were waiting for the bloody revenge they fear is 
coming over the attack 
mayor art agnos responding to the citys worst gangrelated 
murders in 14 years hinted he may ask the national guard to help 
free police for temporarily increased patrols in the citys 
drugplagued southeast corner 
the weekend shooting that left two dead and nine injured spurred 
threats of revenge from a rival gang including an ominous graffiti 
warning that promised 10 for one retaliation 
its really like a war zone here said the rev jim goode of 
st paul of the shipwreck a church inside the embattled 
bayviewhunters point neighborhood thats the climate over here 
right now 
goodes church is about a mile from the corner where several men 
armed with assault rifles and shotguns opened fire early saturday 
when they drove past a large crowd 
the gunmen yelled sunnydale before firing up to 60 shots 
into the crowd and two parked cars loaded with young people 
police said none of those killed or injured are known to have 
connections to the rival black teenage gangs in bayviewhunters 
point and the sunnydale project in nearby visitacion valley 
the sunnydale youths who call themselves the swampy desert 
gang and the bayviewhunters point gang have been linked to more 
than 30 shootings in the past year 
police said they had leads but would not discuss any details in 
connection with the attack the worst gang incident since the 1975 
golden dragon massacre in chinatown that left five dead and 11 
injured 
police said the attack may have been swampy deserts retaliation 
for the slaying of edric carr 19 who was killed by a sniper on 
bayviewhunters point turf march 16 
gang tensions intensified when carrs funeral was held in 
hunters point during the service rival gang members angrily 
taunted one another while police kept the two groups apart 
city supervisor doris ward said tuesday that the weekend 
shooting was more than just revenge by one gang against a rival 
she said it appeared one gang was intent on attacks on anyone from 
their rivals neighborhood with no regard to gang affiliation 
and that is different thats scary thats horrendous 
because we have never had that kind of behavior on that scale 
said ward whos involved in a task force led by goode which seeks 
to ease local tensions 
ward believes crack cocaine is at the root of all the violence 
and gang battles plaguing southeast san francisco and other urban 
areas 
its a vicious vicious circle and one causes the other and 
its a whole domino effect said ward who also blasted the 
availability of assault rifles 
goodes task force held a community meeting monday night that 
attracted 125 parents community leaders and youths to discuss gang 
problems and possible solutions 
one of the ideas presented goode said was formation of a 
community youth and family discussion group to resolve the 
communication gap he sees between parents and their children 
i think that thats one of the things that we are trying to do 
here we really have to bring the families of these kids 
together said goode something has to be done we have to 
address the needs of this community

a police records clerk said tuesday 
that she was being fired from her job because she married another 
member of the police force even though she and her husband have 
since filed for divorce 
im going to appeal said evelyn atencio whose marriage 
last august to lt bob larson placed their jobs in jeopardy because 
of the citys nepotism policy 
atencio and larson filed for divorce last month in an effort to 
save their jobs despite that atencio said police chief bob evers 
decided to fire her as of april 20 it was not clear why she was 
singled out and not her husband 
evers and city manager mark achen did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment tuesday and the police chief told a reporter 
waiting outside his office that he would have nothing to say about 
the case 
atencio has worked in the police department for nine years and 
her husband for 16 she said she wasnt interested in another city 
job that paid less than her current job 
i cant afford a cut in pay she said i was left 
destitute after my previous divorce and im not going to let that 
happen again 
the 34yearold mother of three children said she didnt marry 
bob for him to support my kids 
city officials say that larson as administrative services 
lieutenant is in charge of atencios direct supervisor and as such 
has control over his wifes job 
larson and atencio say that because larson doesnt directly 
supervise his wife they arent violating the nepotism policy 
atencio said the couple filed for divorce march 13 after city 
personnel director claudia hazelhurst agreed that they would be 
given more time to find new jobs if we could show intent to 
divorce and documentation that divorce proceedings were under way 
colorado law requires at least 90 days before a divorce becomes 
final

donors pledged all 133 million needed to 
stockpile food in sudan before the rainy season isolates villages 
but a un official said tuesday not all sudanese who need help can 
be reached 
james p grant head of operation sudan lifeline and director of 
the un childrens fund told reporters the goal of aiding 1 
million people and preventing more than 100000 deaths by 
starvation may be unrealistic but its what is needed 
we have no alternative but to try 
the operation hopes to move 110000 tons of food to isolated 
villages in sudan before the rains begin in may washing out roads 
and airstrips 
in august 1985 at the height of the ethiopian famine 
international agencies delivered only 85000 tons of food under far 
more favorable conditions 
the united nations estimates 250000 sudanese starved to death 
last year because of flood drought or warinduced famine 
grant said about 22000 tons of food have been delivered so far 
divided about equally between areas controlled by the 
moslemdominated government in khartoum and rebel areas in the 
south which is mainly christian or animist 
the emergency program had received 77 million in pledges by the 
time grant led a un planning conference a month ago in khartoum 
and received pledges for te rest of the 133 million needed at a 
donor pledging meeting tuesday 
pledges include 11 million from the united states 10 million 
from the european community and the donation by france and west 
germany of the services of four transall aircraft to carry relief 
supplies said grant 
grant denied reports that juba in southern sudanese was cut off 
from airlifts by threats from the rebel sudan peoples liberation 
army or that ethiopia closed its border to food convoys 
there is no ceasefire grant acknowledged but he said two 
relief flights are reaching juba daily 
the cocoordinator for operation lifeline sudan vincent 
oreilly said monday that ethiopias president mengistu haile 
mariam closed the border 
grant said mengistu has cabled secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar reaffirming his complete support for the convoy program 
and negotiations are under way on details of road shipments

the federal government wants to appeal a 
decision requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public buses saying 
the ruling would cost the nations mass transit systems 90 million 
a year 
groups representing the disabled praised the feb 13 ruling by 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals as a means to help put 
handicapped people into the mainstream but transit agencies said 
the costly lifts are rarely used 
in petitioning monday for a rehearing by the full court the 
government said the ruling contradicted congress intent in 
addition the government argued the court failed to comprehend the 
full cost of the order 
in the 21 decision the court ordered the us department of 
transportation to rewrite regulations that allow communities to 
offer only paratransit service such as van rides to the 
disabled the court said the 24hour reservations that van riders 
need hindered spontaneous use of mass transit 
the judges said instead that all new buses must be equipped with 
lifts 
since the decision disabled people nationwide have demonstrated 
in hopes of persuading the bush administration to allow the ruling 
to stand 
the case was brought by the american disabled for accessible 
public transit and other groups for handicapped people 
stephen gold an attorney for adapt said the bush 
administrations decision to appeal is a slap in the face and 
renders the presidents pledge of a kinder gentler nation a 
hollow promise 
itll keep disabled people out of the mainstream and out of 
jobs for years and years to come he said 
in its petition the government argued the legislation does not 
require wholesale restructuring of masstransit services or 
imposition of the attendant financial burdens on an already 
overburdened public transportation system 
the government said transit agencies across the country would 
pay 90 million a year for the lifts in addition to 10000 for 
each lift the government said maintenance and operating expenses 
would add 9600 over 12 years

attorneys for a group of bondholders said tuesday 
that a 750 million settlement in the 225 billion washington 
public power supply system default case was the best deal they 
could get 
us district court judge william d browning heard the 
appraisal at a hearing on how to distribute money from settlements 
made late last year in the wppss fraud case the biggest default in 
us municipal bond history 
the settlement must be divided among more than 24000 plaintiffs 
and attorneys 
however representatives of a separate group of bondholders in 
the classaction suit said they will argue that no settlement 
should be allowed until after the court decides individual 
bondholders and attorneys shares in the settlement 
the attorneys also want to argue that the state of washington 
the bonneville power administration and wppss should bear more 
responsibility for their roles in the case 
the legal action grew from wppss 1983 default on 225 billion 
in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were 
abandoned before completion 
melvyn weiss a plaintiff attorney said he and other attorneys 
for bondholders felt that the best they might achieve if they won 
the case was a 14 billion settlement 
the 750 million settlement was much more realistic and it 
could well be much less said weiss 
weiss said he recognized its a horrible thing for people to 
lose money that could have meant their retirement or savings for 
education but we also understand if you get nothing its 
nothing 
attorneys for the bondholders unhappy with the settlement 
promised to press their argument before browning 
we have a hard fight arthur hoffer who is pursuing a 
separate classaction suit against the state of washington on 
behalf of bondholders said monday night but were not going to 
give up 
defendants in the federal lawsuit which incorporated dozens of 
separate suits filed as early as 1983 in federal court in seattle 
included the supply system the 88 utilities that contracted with 
wppss to build the two plants engineering firms the wall street 
bond underwriters utility and wppss directors and the advisory 
firm of blyth eastman

in spain tuesday in what appeared a drive by basque separatists to 
unnerve the government following a breakdown in talks between the

earlier tuesday experts defused a package bomb addressed to an 
army sergeant in a military mountain training school in the

a fire that turned into a real witchs 
brew of dangerous chemicals burned itself out after about 1600 
people were evacuated and 17 were taken to hospitals authorities 
said tuesday 
the fire at pacific intermediates a company that blends 
chemicals for pharmacies and other businesses started about 6 pm 
monday and burned through the night it kept people from their 
homes for more than 12 hours 
the red cross housed 357 people at an evacuation center set up 
at buena high school until they were allowed to return home at 515 
am tuesday about 75 minutes after the fire burned itself out 
one hundred people were ordered to evacuate and another 1500 
were asked to leave their homes voluntarily said ventura county 
fire department dispatcher vicki crabtree the unincorporated town 
of saticoy is about 75 miles northwest of downtown los angeles 
noxious fumes sent 17 people to hospitals firefighters said 
all were treated and released except ventura county fire department 
capt sam turner who was in stable condition tuesday at los robles 
regional medical center in thousand oaks 
the fires cause was still under investigation tuesday ms 
crabtree said she said there was no damage estimate yet 
the 35000squarefoot industrial building housed several 
businesses but only the chemical plant and an auto repair firm 
were gutted 
pacific intermediates had stocks of several kinds of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals including cyanide hydrogen corrosives and 
several materials that react violently with water said fire capt 
tom kruschke 
with the mix of chemicals and fire he said we dont know 
exactly what were coming up with here it becomes a real witchs 
brew for us 
more than 130 firefighters were sent to the plant but they 
could not spray water on the chemicals besides the fear of 
chemical reaction there was concern that water runoff would 
contaminate the santa clara river kruschke said 
the best thing to do is just let it burn itself out 
kruschke said 
firefighters said pacific intermediates was cited last year for 
having larger quantities of chemicals than allowed on its premises 
the citation for violating county ordinances has yet to reach 
court they said

defense minister yitzhak rabin said in an 
interview published tuesday that israels proposed elections in the 
occupied lands could take place in six months if the united states 
can persuade whoever needs to agree to elections 
rabin did not mention the us dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization that began in december but repeated 
several times that washington will have to play to play a major 
role in negotiating the elections process according to the yediot 
ahronot newspaper 
it quoted unidentified israeli officials as saying a us middle 
east envoy was expected to open talks next month 
the paper quoted rabin as saying it would be possible to have 
palestinians from outside the occupied lands take part in the 
negotiations on the final status of the west bank and gaza strip 
he offered no names but mentioned past proposals to include 
prominent palestinian professors in america it added 
rabin of the centerleft labor party said he believed 
elections were possible within six months but that prime minister 
yitzhak shamir thought nine to 12 months would be needed 
i presume that the americans who support the idea will do 
all they can to persuade whoever needs to agree to elections 
rabin was quoted as saying 
shamir leader of the rival rightwing likud bloc said monday 
he stood by his view that the plo could play no role even 
indirectly 
the plo in a statement issued monday by its wafa news agency 
rejected the shamir plan it said elections could be held only 
under international supervision after israel withdraws from the 
lands it has occupied since capturing them from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war 
hanna siniora a prominent palestinian moderate in jerusalem 
said tuesday elections were a possibility even without complete 
israeli withdrawal 
but he said israel would have to deal at least indirectly with 
the plo and link the vote to an overall negotiating strategy that 
promised a landforpeace trade 
siniora said israels suggestions are suspended in thin air 
without any regard to the future they are trying to sidestep 
talking about land for peace and withdrawal by trying to spotlight 
elections

the government said tuesday it wants 
nato to delay a decision to modernize its shortrange nuclear arms 
until the early 1990s and agree to open eastwest arms talks about 
these weapons as soon as possible 
by adopting this position belgium hopes to contribute to 
arms control and disarmament prime minister wilfried martens 
told a joint session of parliaments defense and foreign affairs 
committees 
by seeking a delay belgium joins west germany where the issue 
has caused political friction chancellor helmut kohl said recently 
he wants any production decision delayed until 1991 or 1992 after 
important elections in west germany next year 
the united states and britain seek an early commitment to 
modernization 
martens defended a delay by pointing to a new climate of detente 
and a more moderate leadership in moscow 
the atlantic alliance nations evidently cannot remain 
insensitive to the policy of perestroika and glasnost he said 
martens said defense minister guy coeme would present belgiums 
view to a nato defense ministers meeting in brussels next week 
he said no decision to upgrade shortrange nuclear arms should 
be taken before 199192 adding that the government hopes 
negotiations on such arms can begin as soon as possible 
the government will do all it can to achieve that goal it is 
determined to open an active diplomatic action both within nato 
and in bilateral contacts 
he said belgium agreed the north atlantic treaty organization 
should maintain tactical nuclear arms where needed without 
significant increases in their ranges 
martens announcement was seen as reflecting a compromise on 
nuclear arms within his centerleft coalition government the 
socialist partners of christian democrat martens strongly oppose an 
early modernization decision 
martens referred to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
program of economic and political reforms which he said were of 
historic importance 
the prime minister said a delay to modernize was entirely 
consistent with nato efforts to draft a comprehensive overview of 
its defense needs over the next decades this overview under study 
since june 1987 is to be released at a summit meeting of the nato 
leaders in brussels on may 2930 
within nato america and britain want quick approval of plans to 
boost the range of the 700 nucleararmed lance missiles from 65 to 
roughly 250 miles by the mid1990s 
this is part of a modernization program that also covers 
artillery shells and replacing freefall bombs with airtoground 
missiles 
the new lances and the airlaunched missiles would be deployed 
as of 1995 the gun shells already have been upgraded or are being 
improved 
the united states and britain want to move ahead on the new 
lances now so the us congress can allocate the required research 
and development funds the two countries oppose negotiations about 
these weapons 
we cannot accept negotiations about shortrange nuclear 
arms a us source at nato said tuesday speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
we think these weapons are necessary to nato strategy there 
are the only nuclear weapons left in europe he said following 
ussoviet accord to remove groundlaunched mediumrange nuclear 
missiles 
the source said an alliance commitment to the new lance does not 
imply a decision to produce the missiles 
what we want from the allies is a signal so that the 
congress can proceed with funds for research and development he 
said adding that such a signal would go a long way to stifle 
congressional complaints that the european nato allies do not pull 
their weight in nato

but said he believed he could work with them productively 
its not a working situation retorted committee member 
robert cappucci a wilson opponent i dont see how dr wilson 
thinks hell be able to get anything done 
if i were him id see the handwriting on the wall realize 
what ive tried to do hasnt worked and bow out cappuci said 
he is not the man for the boston job 
but committee member john nucci who supports wilson said it 
was everyones duty to try to make the uneasy union work 
i hope they realize that personal vendettas have to be put 
aside in the interest of the school system nucci said 
wilson had spent the past two weeks trying to work out a new 
contract with three of the school committee members under tuesday 
nights action wilson is subject to a professional review every 
six months at which time the committee can reconsider his contract 
the arrival of wilson whose fouryear contract expires in june 
was heralded as a mature step for boston a black man was going to 
run schools in a city that erupting in racial violence over federal 
courtordered busing in 1974 
only days after wilson was hired he asked for and got a 15000 
raise to make his yearly salary 85000 
since then white flight to private schools has left the system 
mostly black of the systems 1972 enrollment of 96000 60 percent 
was white today there are 59000 students 24 percent of them 
white 
critics of the 53yearold chicago native complain he is aloof 
and autocratic 
this isnt a racial issue its a competence and quality 
issue school committee member peggy davismullen who is white 
and is one of wilsons fiercest detractors said monday hes a 
diligent worker but his approach isnt meeting the needs of the 
children of boston 
he lacks the insight and the philosophy that this system needs 
to move forward mrs mullen said although weve had 100 
million added to the budget now 361 million since dr wilson 
arrived the dropout rate has increased 
supporters praise wilsons hard work and honesty saying he 
needs more time 
you really cant get anything done changing horses in 
midstream just changing who it is right now isnt going to change 
a thing said jean mcguire a former school social worker and one 
of four black school committee members 
in a selfassessment requested by the school committee wilson 
gave himself high marks for dedication and for raising math and 
reading scores on national standardized tests and for lowering the 
dropout rate 
wilson says fewer youngsters are quitting school each year the 
school system figures however show increasing attrition in class 
size between ninth grade and graduation day the class of 1983 was 
33 percent smaller than when it began the class of 87 eroded by 
40 percent

if diego alonso is a young mozart his parents 
dont want to make too much of a fuss about it 
thats why they whisked the 5yearold out of their native 
spain where the press hailed him as a genius and a virtuoso and 
enrolled him in kindergarten at the mackintosh academy a school 
for gifted children in denver 
we wanted him to get a wellrounded education and be with 
children his own age who are more like him said rosa alonso 
plaza 29 diegos mother 
she and her husband manual 49 are amateur musicians who set 
out to create a musical child while pregnant they played scales to 
the fetus because she said we love music and we think music is 
very important for the development of the childs mind the 
creative abstract mind 
diego began singing scales when he was 6 months old his parents 
say and at 2 began to read music 
at 3 he could play simple bach pieces on the piano 
alan weber a teacher at the national conservatory of music in 
paris who tested diego said the 3yearold showed exceptional 
gifts and could listen to music and then play it back by memory 
weber said diego should not be schooled with children his own age 
in february 1988 when he was 4 diego had an audience before 
queen sofia of spain but declined to play instead he showed the 
queen a game he played in which he stands with his back to a piano 
and identifies any note that is struck 
all the attention however soon made diego stop playing for 
several months he was after all only 4 and according to his 
parents has a stubborn streak 
it was too much pressure his mother said 
so they brought him to the united states this fall and to the 
mackintosh school in denver he has had to learn english and he 
takes piano lessons and dance classes after school but he 
practices piano only about five minutes a day and his parents say 
they dont want to force him to concentrate on his music any more 
than that yet 
we think little by little hell do it rosa alonso plaza 
said 
carolyn shaak diegos piano teacher in denver says he is 
exceptional for his age and has perfect pitch but the child would 
love to do anything else but play the piano 
he has put up certain barriers he wouldnt want to be forced 
to sit there she said the potential is there it depends 
what he does with it he certainly has the intelligence 
she said his coordination was about average for a 5yearold 
eve mackintosh the director of the school calls the boy a 
genius who has caught on quickly in all subjects she thinks his iq 
is higher than the 139 at which he tested when he was 4 
rosa alonso a former secretary and a violinist played scales 
and repetitive melodies on the violin at least three times a day at 
regular intervals while she was pregnant at the same beat as 
the mothers heart 
manual who worked for the telephone company in spain plays the 
piano he said diego showed an early fascination with the 
instrument peeking around his fathers back to watch him play and 
crawling underneath the piano to watch the pedals move 
the couple filled their home with classical music during the 
pregnancy and when diego was born they would sing him to sleep 
with scales 
the alonsos are unemployed in denver writing a book about 
childrearing and hoping for an extension of their visa which runs 
out this month living on savings they are not sure how long they 
will stay in denver but would like diego to finish eighth grade at 
mackintosh before returning to europe for high school 
diego is on a partial scholarship at mackintosh and the alonsos 
are hoping a foundation or university will step in and help support 
his education 
but they dont like the child to be bothered by the press and 
asked that reporters and photographers not talk to diego at school 
because that might draw attention to him 
in a recent music class at the academy however diego drew 
attention all by himself when music teacher david glenn asked each 
child in the kindergarten class to name their favorite musicians 
diego pulled up two names many of the children could barely 
pronounce tchaikovsky and rachmaninoff

call it the heartland call it middle 
america call it americas hometown 
but please just call especially if youre a bigtime 
journalist who can put this high plains town in the national news 
imbued with a new sense of pride and a hunger for publicity 
after president bush styled lubbock a barometer for national 
opinion civic leaders want the washington press corps to make a 
habit of asking bush what lubbock thinks of national issues from 
the minimum wage to arms control 
dc phone home was the headline of a fullpage ad lubbock 
officials ran in the washingtonbaltimore edition of the wall 
street journal recently to kick off a campaign to promote this city 
of 187000 as everybodys hometown 
the ad closed with the citys new slogan look listen 
lubbock now 
president bush has really given us something we can rally 
around said randy christian a local advertising executive who 
helped think up the slogan 
the city is buying advertising buttons and tshirts to 
capitalize on all the free publicity bush handed it 
notoriety hit the city when bush recounted during a nationally 
televised news conference a conversation with an old friend in 
texas who told him all the people in lubbock think things are 
going just great 
bushs story took city leaders by surprise but it didnt take 
them long to see they were getting the kind of publicity money 
couldnt buy 
after reporters stopped calling and the crews from good 
morning america took their lights and cameras out of the local 
pancake house lubbocks leaders went to work devising ways to stay 
in the spotlight 
we felt that this was an opportunity we should take advantage 
of said mayor bc peck mcminn who treasures a handwritten 
note from bush thanking mcminn for his comments about lubbock 
residents support of the president during the media onslaught 
its just been feeding on itself 
mcminn even got a congratulatory call from james maloof mayor 
of the town made famous by the nixon administrations will it 
play in peoria 
all of a sudden we were propelled into the limelight said 
lee stafford executive vice president of the citys industrial 
development board 
he hopes greater awareness of lubbock might bring the west texas 
city more jobs tourists and conventions city officials arent 
sure what the whole campaign will cost they spent 6100 on the 
wall street journal ad 
its too early to look for results but the attention showered 
on this agriculturebased town already has spawned envy among other 
midsized cities 
there are a lot of other texas cities that want me to get the 
president to mention their cities said us sen phil gramm 
rtexas 
while lubbock doesnt boast about its crime rate with a 
burglary incidence thats among the highest in the nation or the 
dust that swirls through town from the surrounding cotton fields 
each spring being americas heartland makes the city an easier 
sell stafford said were not just another city out looking for 
new business were lubbock and thats a unique term now 
others express the more altruistic desire that lubbocks example 
will remind politicians the real america knows and cares whats 
going on in the nations capital 
it doesnt take a genius to realize that there are many cities 
in america just like lubbock said the ad and how they think 
and how they feel about national and international issues is a 
barometer our leaders inside the beltway should never ignore

one of the most abrupt changes ever taken by 
those who seek to direct the american economys course occurred 
about 15 years ago under circumstances somewhat similar to those of 
today 
it was during the administration of gerald ford and inflation 
was on everyones mind the popular patriotic slogan of the day was 
whip inflation now it was printed on lapel buttons and 
splashed in advertisements 
the campaign had an ignominious ending when the facts were 
realized that the nation was stumbling into recession and that 
recession far more than inflation was the big threat to the economy 
it was not the first time the economic ship of state had been 
nearly driven onto the shoals and it wasnt the last either almost 
all of americas recent presidents have been accused of erratic or 
even irresponsible steering 
in relatively recent history for example herbert hoover 
franklin roosevelt dwight eisenhower richard nixon lyndon 
johnson jimmy carter and ronald reagan have suffered criticisms 
for their tenure at the wheel 
but nothing quite matches the abrupt realization in 1974 that 
the economy was headed to recession while all eyes were on 
inflation and now some critics contend there could be a repeat of 
the scenario in 1989 
these critics cannot as yet demonstrate their thesis by means of 
the popular statistics which show the economy still has some 
forward momentum but when youre steering a ship as big as the 
us economy you never really know 
when you flip the control buttons or turn the wheel a few 
degrees for example nothing seems to happen a big ship doesnt 
turn on a dime it takes time to observe a change and when change 
comes you cannot reverse it quickly 
in effect gloomy analysts are saying that maybe too many 
buttons have been pushed already and that while we havent seen 
the effect so far it is bound to show up in the next few months 
therefore they say beware of recession 
adding conviction to their fears or vice versa is the uncanny 
coincidence of the same man being in the control room 
in 1974 as chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers alan greenspan led the inflation fight today as 
chairman of the federal reserve board he has given inflation 
priority over recession 
few economists doubt greenspans knowledge or that he is 
capable of absorbing wisdom from experience but one of them eric 
heinemann of ladenburg thalmann amp co a securities firm offers 
this typical cautionary view 
in sum we think the economy is vulnerable a slowdown if not 
worse is in the cards alan greenspans zeal to whip inflation now 
is commendable but lets hope he doesnt give us a replay of the 
crunch of 1974 
the question says heinemann is whether greenspan will get the 
mild slowdown he wants or will we go through something more 
sinister 
in short will the economy scrape bottom and continue on its 
way or will it run aground spring a leak and spill its energy 
like the exxon valdez

villagers in southern lebanon got their 
wish the irish government has decided to keep its 750man 
batallion in the united nations peacekeeping forces here 
the government in dublin had been reconsidering the irish 
battalions presence in lebanon because four of its soldiers had 
been killed and one wounded in three attacks in the past three 
months three of them were killed by a landmine march 21 
we greatly need the irish contingent in south lebanon said 
abbas fawaz the mayor of tibnin a town 11 miles north of the 
israeli border 
the estimated 100000 shiite moslems living in 20 hamlets around 
tibnin the irish headquarters enjoy their protection fawaz 
said 
before making the decision the irish cabinet reviewed a report 
by lt gen tadhg oneill chief of staff of the irish army who 
had come here to investigate the landmine explosion march 21 
the cabinet renews irelands commitment every six months and 
the irish political opposition had called for a policy review after 
the deaths the fourth death occurred earlier 
our presence here is very vital to the security of the area 
and to the locals who depend on our humanitarian aide said lt 
col pat mcmahon commander of the irish contingent in the united 
nations interim force in lebanon unifil 
on march 30 hundreds of tebnins 5000 residents participated 
in a memorial ceremony for the three irish soldiers killed by the 
landmine 
the irish contingent lives among its people in the south 
said one of the banners at the ceremony aggression against it is 
aggression on the southerners 
the un peacekeeping force made up of 5800 personnel from 
nine nations has monitored a narrow strip of 65 towns and villages 
in south lebanon since march 1985 
the population in the forces area of operation increased from 
about 50000 when the force first arrived to about a half million 
people today 
before unifil came to south lebanon the area was a free 
terrain to militiamen and terrorists who spread fear and death 
everywhere said fawaz 64 who has been mayor for 20 years 
now everyone is moving around here peacefully and freely 
thanks to the irish battalion 
an irish sergeant about to be moved out on routine rotation said 
he was leaving with mixed feelings 
there are a lot of poor people here who are in great need of 
our humanitarian work which is worth risking my life for said 
the sergeant who could not allow his name to be used because of 
standing regulations 
an irish major at headquarters in tebnin said it would be a 
fire zone without us 
when the irish battalion first came here the villagers did 
not have any electricity and had shortages of water he said 
but we helped them and now they are confident in their future 
because of us 
the irish battalion has lost 30 soldiers in attacks by various 
groups over the years 
investigations were still under way to determine who planted the 
landmine that exploded under a unifil jeep near haddatha on march 
21 and killed the three soldiers lt col patrick hayes said 
the other two recent attacks were carried out by the 
israelibacked south lebanon army sla militia which controls a 
narrow strip of lebanese territory that israel refers to as its 
security zone 
israel maintained the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its 
invading army from south lebanon in the summer of 1985 ending a 
threeyear occupation 
the terrain which extends from the mediterranean sea in the 
west to the slopes of snowpeaked mount hermon in the east serves 
as a buffer against crossborder infiltrations by palestinian 
guerrillas into northern israeli settlements 
col mcmahon blamed israel for the south lebanon army attacks on 
the irish battalion he said such hostilities were due to the 
lack of control from the israeli army command on the sla 
militiamen 
hassan fawaz the son of tebnins mayor who owns a gift shop 
near the irish battalion headquarters said tebnin residents 
notify the irish command about the possibility of any attack on 
them that we come to know of 
the younger fawaz stressed the economic value that the irish 
battalion represents to the area the troops spend at least 
500000 annually on souvenirs and goods they buy dutyfree from 
local stores

on april 26 the us supreme court will convene 
for a 60minute hearing on one of americas most polarizing issues 
abortion the debate centers on a missouri law that restricts 
abortion and declares that human life begins at conception the two 
sides in this missouri case represent in microcosm the deeply 
divided sentiments felt across the country in two stories part of 
an intermittent series on abortion issues the associated press 
profiles key players in this missouri case the prochoice 
advocates and the clinic at the heart of the dispute and the 
leader of the antiabortion forces a man committed to a fight he

bj isaacsonjones has days when she knows 
that dressing in red will provoke the ugly taunts again 
bj youre wearing red scream the protesters sometimes 
gathered outside her office does that match the blood on your 
hands 
the taunts have taken a toll on the director of reproductive 
health services the abortion clinic at the heart of an emotional 
and explosive debate before the us supreme court 
its not unusual for me to close my office door and sob she 
said im proud of the way i live my life its hard when youre 
standing close to people and you can feel the hatred i dont hate 
people 
the intense feelings are likely to grow even stronger as april 
26 draws nearer the day the supreme court hears arguments over a 
missouri statute that could chip away or overturn the 1973 ruling 
that legalized abortion 
for antiabortion advocates whove been waiting and working for 
this day for 16 years its a time of great hope but for 
prochoice supporters just as eager to prevent this moment its a 
time of high anxiety 
we are gravely concerned about this case said 
isaacsonjones whose nonprofit clinic is the largest in the 
midwest whats at stake here is womens lives its that 
complicated and that simple 
missouris prochoice forces have grown from a small underground 
movement to a group of determined activists challenging a state 
whose legislature has passed antiabortion measures by 51 
majorities 
two veteran advocates are key players in this case frank 
susman a lawyer who will be arguing his fifth missouri abortion 
case before the high court and judith widdicombe a former nurse 
at a roman catholic hospital and the founder of the clinic 
together with isaacsonjones theyve shared not only their 
convictions but also death threats pickets at home or outside the 
clinic obscene phone calls and harassment of their families 
susman who represents the clinic says someone once placed a 
bogus newspaper ad saying his house was for sale a picket sued him 
for 250000 claiming hed assaulted her as he escorted a woman 
into another clinic where protesters were gathered a jury cleared 
him 
reproductive health is only one of seven plaintiffs planned 
parenthood of greater kansas city is another but it has been the 
target of some of the most vicious attacks once protesters stood 
on clinic desks and jumped through a reception window 
in 1986 five gallons of gas were poured under the waiting room 
door and ignited the blaze caused more than 100000 damage no 
one was arrested 
this is a very violent movement said widdicombe now a 
consultant for voters for choice in washington dc i think it 
has become a rapidly escalating war in the last 10 years 
abortion opponents in missouri however insist they repudiate 
violence and say verbal harassment is the wrong way to sway hearts 
and minds 
if i have a sincere desire to point out the error of their 
ways im not going to be able to accomplish that by screaming and 
hollering at them said sam lee a missouri antiabortion leader 
the namecalling and pickets do prompt soulsearching 
i stand in the shower the next morning and go over everything 
that was said said isaacsonjones who started at the clinic as 
a volunteer i think could they possibly be right i go back 
stronger in my conviction i will examine that again i know i 
shall 
but what i return to are the faces of the women i see she 
added i always always understand the reason why a woman has 
chosen to terminate her pregnancy i may not like the reasons shes 
waited so long 
the antis say gods on their side she said i say gods 
on my side as well 
isaacsonjones support of abortion rights stems from her high 
school days in the 60s when she saw pregnant classmates shunned 
and forced to drop out of school i realized the incredible 
impact of one sexual experience on the rest of a woman and her 
familys life she said 
today she runs a clinic with 64 staff members 35 volunteers 
and two offices it counsels 15000 women each year more than 
8500 choose abortion the women come from eight states illinois 
indiana iowa kentucky missouri oklahoma tennessee and texas 
30 percent are poor 
its a long way from the late 50s when widdicombe then a 
nurse saw women disfigured trying to abort themselves sometimes 
with lye 
she later worked at a catholic hospital caring for new mothers 
in the labor and delivery section then spending her free time 
arranging legal and illegal abortions sometimes as far away as 
puerto rico and mexico 
the hospital found that totally incongruent widdicombe 
said she resigned 
it was a scary time too there was a level of paranoia 
absolutely widdicombe said i did think about what it would be 
like to go to jail 
susman provided legal advice at the time he now represents 
about 20 abortion clinics nationwide on a parttime basis 
estimating reproductive issues account for about 10 percent of his 
work 
in 1973 widdicombe opened the clinic three hundred protesters 
marched outside 
i though wed just provide a clinic and work ourselves out of 
business she said it was pretty naive we really felt we 
would decrease the need for abortion with education and research 
prochoice leaders say theyve been far less successful in 
organizing than their opposition they also claim abortion foes 
misrepresent their cause 
we have allowed this small group to define prochoice as 
proabortion said isaacsonjones think about the vivid 
pictures the antiabortion people display whos going to argue 
with that they have signs money blood murder thats 
not the reality of choice 
unlike her opponents isaacsonjones says she isnt interested 
in converting anyone 
i really dont want to change their minds she said i 
wish theyd leave us alone and allow us to work in dignity 
susman expresses optimism about this case i do not believe 
the court is prepared to turn back the clock 16 years

asiana airlines will spend about 1 billion to 
buy nine boeing co jetliners and take options on seven more 
because the new airline doesnt want to risk its reputation on 
older planes an asiana executive said 
in a separate announcement monday gulf air of bahrain said it 
will spend 1 billion over the next five years to buy six boeing 
767s and 12 airbus industrie a320s 
the combined value of the asiana and gulf air orders to boeing 
would be about 14 billion 
sy park chairman of kumho business group asianas parent 
company said that in addition to wanting new planes it chose 
boeing was because the seattlebased plane builder took the new 
airline seriously 
asiana based in seoul korea began operations within that 
country on dec 23 it said it will use its new jets to expand to 
other asian markets and eventually to north america and europe 
in the short term we could have saved a few dollars by buying 
or leasing older planes park said however a new airline has 
enough problems establishing its market base without the burden of 
heavy maintenance responsibilities and the uncertainty of whether 
older planes will perform reliably 
asiana ordered five 737400s and took options for another five 
it also signed letters of intent to order two 747400 jumbo jets 
and take options for two more and to convert two previous options 
for widebody 767300s to firm orders 
boeing normally doesnt announce letters of intent said boeing 
commercial airplanes spokesman randy harrison but asiana had made 
it clear it intended to buy the planes 
harrison described a letter of intent as just short of an order 
with the major difference being no money is paid to begin 
construction 
asiana began its korean service dec 23 with six 737400s leased 
from gpa group ltd 
deliveries of asianas new planes will begin in july 1992 
gulf air spokesman abdullah abdelkarim said it was ordering its 
new planes on an optional basis allowing the airline to drop the 
order without liability to compensate the manufacturer 
gulf air is owned by the governments of bahrain qatar oman and 
abu dhabi the announcement came one day after gulf airs board met 
in the qatari capital of doha 
abdelkarim said the 18 jets will be delivered between 1990 and 
1994 gulf air is currently spending 260 million to lease four 
boeing 767300s as part of a modernization program 
abdelkarim said that by june the airline will have nine 
lockheed l1011 tristars eight boeing 737s and six boeing 
767300s the fleet will increase to 40 to 42 aircraft by 1994 he 
added 
not counting the gulf air planes boeing has announced orders 
for 110 jetliners worth 87 billion this year

our own indepth analysis we have concluded that a reorganized 
internal procurement and distribution system will be a tremendous 
asset to burger king he added

consistent product

billion and stop amp shop cos for 12 billion and merrill lynch 
capital markets acquired supermarkets general corp for 18

gulf amp western inc should be able to get 25 
billion or more for its giant consumer finance subsidiary that 
could be used to buy more media and entertainment properties or 
repurchase stock analysts say 
gulf amp western stock rose monday following its weekend 
disclosure that it plans to sell the associates the nations 
thirdlargest consumer finance company and concentrate on its 
entertainment and publishing businesses 
in trading on the new york stock exchange gulf amp western rose 
237 a share to 5187 
some analysts predicted chairman martin s davis would use the 
huge cash hoard to make acquisitions in the media and entertainment 
business but others said he may use the money to accelerate the 
companys stock repurchase plan that has gobbled up more than 45 
million shares since 1983 
im taking the contrarian view here im not convinced there 
are attractive assets available at prices they would be willing to 
pay said jeffrey logsdon an entertainment industry analyst for 
the investment firm crowell weedon amp co in los angeles 
he said he expects gulf amp western could get 3 billion to 4 
billion for the associates and use the proceeds for stock 
repurchases 
but carol neves who follows gulf amp western for merrill lynch 
research in new york said a cashrich gulf amp western could be 
vulnerable to a takeover 
if they dont know what they are going to do with the cash 
they may have put themselves in play she said 
sony corp the japanese electronics giant already has 
indicated interest in buying a us entertainment company 
davis was unavailable monday to comment on what he planned to do 
with the proceeds of the sale the company said in sundays 
announcement that sale proceeds would be used to expand the 
companys communications operations globally through product 
development and distribution as well as acquisitions and 
investments 
the sale of the associates would leave the company with a 
paramount pictures operation that includes such successful movie 
titles as beverly hills cop fatal attraction and 
crocodile dundee and a tv library with more than 2000 
episodes of network shows such as family ties and cheers 
gulf amp western also is a major force in consumer and textbook 
publishing through its simon amp schusterprentice hall division it 
also has interests in cable programming theaters and sports 
some analysts said davis is under no immediate pressure to 
outline acquisition plans they said finding a buyer for the 
associates and closing the deal could take months 
they said gulf amp western already is a big enough force in 
entertainment and the media that its place among the global media 
giants is assured 
but the announcement appeared to stir renewed interest in 
several media and entertainment companies mentioned recently in 
takeover speculation 
for instance tribune co was up 125 a share to 4475 time 
inc rose 187 to 11537 cbs inc rose 412 to 18262 and 
mca inc rose 62 cents to 5625 
since he became chairman of gulf amp western in 1983 davis has 
narrowed the scope of the once farflung conglomerate he sold 
businesses ranging from cigarmaking and chemicals to racetracks 
while making selective acquisitions in publishing motion picture 
houses and cable television 
j kendrick noble a media analyst for painewebber inc said 
the proposal to sell the financial unit may help davis boost the 
stock price by simply focusing the investment communitys view of 
the company 
gulf amp western earned 3847 million or 321 a share on 
revenue of 51 billion in 1988 
the consumer finance operations accounted for 46 percent of its 
operating income and 40 percent of its revenue last year 
entertainment accounted for 31 percent of operating income and 37 
percent of revenue while publishing and information services 
contributed 23 percent of operating income and revenue

a battle between industry giants over 
superabsorbent diapers and the millions of dollars that come 
through their sale has opened in us district court here 
in the case procter amp gamble co charges that the design of its 
highly successful superabsorbent pampers was copied by 
kimberlyclark corp in developing superabsorbent huggies 
the huge consumer products company wants us district judge 
falcon hawkins to order kimberlyclark to stop manufacturing the 
huggies and remove them from store shelves the company also is 
seeking unspecified monetary damages 
the stakes are high for making disposable diapers is a 33 
billionayear business according to court records 
procter amp gamble based in cincinnati is the industry leader 
with 47 percent of the market dallasbased kimberlyclark is no 2 
with about 30 percent industry analysts say 
as the trial got under way monday attorneys crowded the 
courtroom while scattered along the jury box were boxes and bags of 
diapers the case is expected to last at least three weeks 
allen gerstein representing procter amp gamble said pampg came up 
with the idea that made super absorbent diapers possible and took 
out a patent on the development 
the breakthrough he said allowed the manufacture of diapers 
that are generally thinner but more absorbent than regular more 
bulky disposables 
we stayed within the system while kimberlyclark disregarded 
and took unfair advantage of the system he told hawkins in his 
opening argument 
pampg researcher paul weisman developed a means for combining wood 
pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in the diaper to allow it 
to be made thinner gerstein said 
gerstein said kimberlyclark copied the idea shortly after the 
pampers were test marketed in wichita kan in 1984 
the introduction of the new diapers turned the diaper world on 
its ear he said 
but attorney h blair white representing kimberlyclark said 
this case is about two fiercely competitive companies each trying 
to improve baby diapers 
he charged that pampg never had a valid patent because it withheld 
important test information from the us patent office 
in addition he said the system weisman developed was already 
covered in a british patent for superabsorbing materials issued to 
an italian inventor in 1979 
in order to have a valid patent you cant be the second 
person or the 10th person to invent something you have to be the 
first he said 
white argued that kimberlyclark had widespread experience with 
superabsorbent materials as early as 1977 in the manufacture of 
tampons and adult diapers 
kimberlyclark didnt need lessons from anyone about super 
absorbent products white said noting that the only things our 
scientists learned from the wichita diapers was how not to make a 
diaper 
white said the problem with the pampers when they were 
introduced was that the superabsorbing material would come off on 
the skin of babies 
it was a problem kimberlyclark was trying to address in its own 
labs at the time he said adding the company eventually developed 
a system of putting the material farther away from the babies skin 
a system for which the company has been awarded a patent 
the case is being heard in a nonjury proceeding it was brought 
in south carolina because kimberlyclark runs a diaper 
manufacturing plant in beech island near aiken

ford motor co chairman donald petersens 105 
million pay for 1988 is part of detroits annual executive 
pigout and should be spent on new employees and factories 
instead the united auto workers union says 
ford issued its proxy statement monday listing compensation for 
the companys top five executives also on monday ford announced 
three new executive vice presidents including the likely successor 
to petersen 
the proxy statement said petersen was awarded 33 million in 
salry bonuses and other benefits and 72 million in stock options 
for 1988 thats far beyond the 37 million chrysler corp 
chairman lee iacocca received for 1988 
general motors corp is expected to issue its proxy statement 
within a week 
at ford president harold poling followed petersen in 
compensation with awards of 41 million 26 million in salary 
and supplemental compensation and 15 million in exercised stock 
options 
the uaw said it was pleased by fords financial success last 
year but that its profits should be invested instead in the 
company and its hourly employees rather than its executives 
we think they would be far better advised to invest in new 
facilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuable 
resources on trying to keep up with the compensation of junkbond 
barons uaw president owen bieber and vice president stephen 
yokich who heads the unions ford department said in a statement 
fords success in no way justifies the action of fords top 
executives in taking full advantage of detroits annual executive 
pigout they said 
the uaw figured petersens hourly wage to be about 5070 
compared with the hourly wage of a car assembler at 1573 
last year ford said petersen exercised no stock options and 
received 37 million poling exercised 8 million in stock options 
and received 109 million in compensation for 1987 
other ford officers listed in mondays proxy statement along 
with their salaries supplemental compensation payments and stock 
options exercised were 
louis r ross executive vice president for north american 
automotive operations and named monday as executive vice president 
for international automotive operations 35 million 
philip benton executive vice president and president of the 
ford automotive group 3 million 
allan gilmour ross predecessor in international operations 
who monday was appointed executive vice president for corporate 
staffs 17 million 
supplemental compensation payments can be deferred into common 
stock purchase or other programs otherwise the awards will be 
paid in two lump sums one last month and the other in january 
1990 the company said 
ford the nations most profitable automaker with earnings of 
53 billion last year said its board of directors compensation 
committee limited the total compensation for eligible officers to 
250 million 
the compensation plan permitted distribution of 3751 million 
the difference 1251 million will become part of the companys 
general fund 
the appointments of gilmour ross and alexander trotman who was 
named ross successor are effective may 1 
gilmour also was named to the office of the chief executive and 
becomes the oddson choice to become chairman when petersen reaches 
fords mandatory retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991 that 
office is shared by petersen poling and executive vice president 
and chief financial officer stanley seneker 
at the end of march vice chairman william clay ford sr 
grandson of the companys founder henry ford retired from the 
company and with it his title was eliminated ford who was a 
member of the office of the chief executive remains a member of 
the companys board of directors 
the promotion of gilmour 54 leaves only gm among the big three 
without an heir apparent to its chairman gm chairman roger b 
smith will be the first of the big threes leaders to step aside 
smith turns 65 in july 1990 and is expected to step down about then 
in november chrysler promoted gerald greenwald to vice 
chairman tapping him as the likely successor to chairman lee 
iacocca whose contract expires in december 1991 
gilmour joined ford in 1960 as a financial analyst during his 
career with ford he has been president of ford motor credit co 
vice president and controller vice president for extrnal and 
personnel affairs and executive vice president and chief financial

an nec corp supercomputer that will go on sale 
next year represents the leading edge of a japanese assault on 
american supremacy in the field of highspeed computing 
nec fujitsu ltd and hitachi ltd are looking at the 1990s as 
the decade in which they plan to make some serious headway in the 
supercomputer commercial marketplace said jeffrey canin a san 
franciscobased technology analyst 
nec said monday the fastest member of its sxx series attains 
peak speeds of more than 20 billion operations per second in one 
kind of scientific calculation 
the necs peak speed is about 25 percent faster than cray 
research incs cray 3 which is due for shipment to customers 
around the same time the julyseptember period of 1990 
minneapolisbased cray is likely to hold its lead in 
supercomputer sales for several years partly because hundreds of 
programs are written especially to run on its machines analysts 
say 
but in the long run there is a chance that japans excellence 
in supercomputer hardware could slowly overcome americas 
entrenched superiority in software 
this new machine is obviously the one to beat said george 
lindamood an analyst at the gartner group consulting firm in 
stamford conn i imagine there will be some fairly severe 
government wrangling in washington as a result of this one 
cray stock closed down 12 cents to 5387 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading monday reflecting 
investors lack of concern about the shortterm effects of the nec 
announcement on the company 
supercomputers are considered crucial to national security 
because they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons they 
also are used for such tasks as scientific research oil 
exploration and weather forecasting 
japan limited sales of usmade supercomputers in its home 
market in the early and mid1980s while its own companies developed 
competitive machines 
the us government has strongly discouraged federal agencies 
and universities that receive government grants from buying 
japanesemade supercomputers nec has only one installed in the 
united states at the houston area research consortium 
it is common for supercomputer makers to leapfrog one another 
with new models but necs forthcoming models are unusually 
threatening in two respects 
necs fastest machine achieves its speed with four processors 
while crays requires 16 if nec learns how to hook together more 
processors it could extend its lead dramatically 
for the first time nec is using a base layer of software that 
is already familiar to potential american customers unix that 
could entice customers who have shied away from nec until now 
because of its unfamiliar operating system 
cray is the worlds largest supercomputer maker although 
international business machines corp leads in the number of 
machines installed when mainframe computers rigged for 
supercomputing work are included 
cray spokesman john swenson said the company takes all its 
competitors seriously but added we still seem to offer the most 
effective solution to the user he said peak speed comparisons 
are misleading because what counts is how fast a computer will run 
a particular customers jobs 
every time the japanese come out with a new machine people 
start saying the japanese are going to eat our lunch today we 
still have about twothirds of the worldwide market swenson said 
nec has one undisputed advantage it is the worlds largest 
semiconductor manufacturer that sells on the open market and can 
make its own customized highspeed logic chips 
cray relies on fujitsu for the central logic chips in its cray 
ymp line the central logic chips for its cray 3 line will come 
from a small us company gigabit logic inc of newbury park 
calif 
possibly the greatest threat to cray is that american customers 
will buy a few japanese machines because of their sheer speed and 
then develop sophisticated software to run on them 
if the japanese software begins to approach the quality of 
what you can get on a cray then the competition begins to get very 
severe lindamood said 
necs machines will be sold through hnsx supercomputers inc of 
burlington mass a marketing company jointly owned by nec and 
honeywell inc its president james berrett said the company would 
like a chance at the government market but failing that will sell 
to commercial customers including multinationals that are not 
singularly concerned with the united states 
ibm not cray is the company most feared by the japanese 
supercomputer makers while ibm never has made a pure 
supercomputer the worlds largest computer company is researching 
the area intensively and is backing steve chen who left cray last 
year to start a company called supercomputer systems inc

after the 1964 good friday earthquake sent 
a flood of water to wash away its homes and heart valdez turned 
its back on the sea 
mindful of the waters treachery that killed 33 of its 
neighbors the city relocated three miles inland behind a 
protective hump of hills its fishing fleet destroyed its civic 
consciousness turned inland to the road to anchorage and the 
promise that the transalaska oil pipeline would pump new life into 
the community 
a halfdozen inlets and mountain ridges to the east the city of 
cordova suffered far less the quake did milder damage shaking 
down the million dollar bridge a railroad trestle being converted 
to carry highway traffic 
the loss ended attempts to link the fishing village to the land 
that was just fine for many cordova residents who believe their 
collective soul is tied to the blue waters of orca inlet and the 
rich herring and salmon schools in prince william sound 
twentyfive good fridays later the exxon valdez ran aground and 
ripped its hull on bligh reef a hardluck spot close to the 
epicenter of the 1964 earthquake 
the resulting spill of 101 million gallons of oil has had a 
very different impact on the two cities 
valdez has been the focus of world concern about the oil spill 
receiving fullpage newspaper apologies from exxon its become a 
boom town its hotels and restaurants crowded with oil people 
military and media exxon has rented an office building and will be 
a presence for the years the cleanup will take pumping money into 
the local economy 
this means millions for us said jan buccini a valdez 
cabbie who says his payday is triple that of prespill days this 
town is going to grow 
but cordova which fought against the transalaska pipeline and 
the tankers it brought to prince william sound is in shock an 
anticipated 12 million herring harvest has been canceled and 
favorite fishing grounds are cesspools cordova got no official 
apology and little money from exxon 
were devastated said linden colour otoole who has 
handled an emergency hotline since the oil spill people are 
scared and hurt theyre afraid the world has forgotten about us 
in normal times cordova would be a busy place its 1200boat 
marina would be crowded with gill netters seiners and support 
ships the canneries would be going and the half dozen bars on 
first street would be bustling thered be money in everyones 
pocket after the long winters hibernation 
but instead the town is quiet the bars are empty and flags fly 
at half mast the marina is half filled many of the boats are in 
the sound warring with the oil slick 
no fishing no business no business no economy no economy 
no cordova said bob van brucklin who owns a bar laundry motel 
and warehouse 
many people attend meeting after meeting worrying at the future 
while trying to deal with working on the cleanup for exxon 
the problem with the fishermen is were used to going out and 
doing our own work said jerry mccune president of the cordova 
district fishermen united now we have to take exxon jobs and sit 
here and wonder whats going to happen to the salmon fishery 
the adults arent the only ones hurting cordovas children use 
to otters and killer whales in the inlet and bald eagles in the 
sky have been traumatized by the spills carnage 
linden otoole told of her 3yearold son seeing a box of dead 
oiled birds brought in by a fisherman he kept saying i want to 
go safe the birds i want to go safe the birds she said 
whatever happens now the future of valdez is assured by the 
800mile oil pipeline that fills tankers like the exxon valdez tax 
revenue from it provides 92 percent of the citys 31 million 
budget a budget 10 times that of cordova 
the fishermen of cordova opposed the pipeline 
some of the oldtowners the preearthquake valdez 
residents share cordovas concerns pat day whose family has 
fished for four generations fears the effects of the spill and is 
frustrated by the attitude of some fellow townspeople 
what i hear is nature will take care of it said day i 
think she probably will but it will take 30 years

if you go by the numbers us mergers and 
acquisitions fell sharply in the first quarter of 1989 compared 
with the frenzy of last year but experts say the figures are 
misleading and the outlook for more takeovers is good 
i dont see this as anything but a fluctuation said louis 
lowenstein professor of corporate finance at columbia universitys 
school of law nothing fundamental has changed 
the numbers at least on the surface indicate merger activity 
slowed from january through march mergers and corporate 
transactions announced during the first quarter fell to 340 from 
410 in the same period of 1988 according to statistics compiled by 
securities data co a newark nj research firm 
the transactions include include recapitalizations and stock 
buybacks 
the dollar value of the deals also plunged to 7436 billion in 
the latest quarter from 13717 billion a year earlier securities 
data said 
but the people who follow merger activity attach little 
significance to the figures 
its much too short a period from which to draw any 
conclusions said isaac shapiro a partner in the law firm 
skadden arps slate meagher amp flom which has a large practice in 
mergers and acquisitions 
i dont think quarter to quarter statistics mean a lot 
shapiro said 
donald margotta an assistant professor at northeastern 
university in boston agreed saying its not significant 
enough 
its simply cyclical activity margotta said mergers have 
gone through cycles there are lows and there are peaks 
furthermore theres no reason for merger activity to fall off 
the professor said 
the basic forces driving the market are still there 
lowenstein said 
recent developments support his statement gulf amp western inc 
announced this weekend it was in the market for acquisitions and 
beatrice cos also says it is looking for companies to buy 
securities data reported the number of acquisitions declined as 
the investment banking industry regrouped in the wake of the 
landmark deals of the previous year 
the company referred to the record 2453 billion buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 129 billion 
acquisition of kraft inc by philip morris cos and other big deals 
lowenstein acknowledged that the system was absorbing rjr 
but said that should not have affected overall activity 
interest rates moved higher during the first quarter but 
lowenstein also dismissed that as a possible factor 
that has not chilled mergers in the past he said noting 
that when interest rates soared in the early 1980s mergers went 
along at a splendid clip 
merger activity hit an alltime high in 1988 with securities 
data reporting 2994 transactions totaling 36509 billion 
many analysts said last year that acquirers were moving up their 
deals to take advantage of the reagan administrations relatively 
lenient attitude toward mergers 
lowenstein discounted that theory as a factor in the 
firstquarter dropoff 
that would have accounted for some deals that had antitrust 
implications but youre talking about such a high level of 
activity he said 
the securities data report also noted a downturn in foreign 
merger activity in the united states with the number of 
firstquarter acquisitions valued at 100 million and more falling 
to 27 from 30 the dollar value of the deals fell to 1086 billion 
from 2801 billion 
but said shapiro a specialist in foreign mergers i really 
dont think it tells you much of anything 
the fundamentals remain the same shapiro said as long as 
the dollar remains at its relatively low value us assets 
continue to be attractive 
securities data said the number of big us acquisitions by 
japanese concerns also slipped during the first three months of the 
year but shapiro again did not see any trend 
the japanese have enormous liquidity and they and other 
foreign acquirers remain interested in us properties he said

but the index started to rise as participants discovered 
takeshita said nothing worse than what had already been 
disclosed he added

days estimated volume was 11 billion shares ishizuka said 
addressing parliament tuesday morning takeshita said he had

prime minister noboru takeshita told parliament 
today that he received 1 million from the company at the center of 
a highly damaging bribery scandal but he rejected opposition 
demands that he resign 
takeshitas statement was a reversal of earlier comments that he 
had not received money from recruit co an information and 
publishing conglomerate 
i am feeling my political and moral responsibilities very 
strongly he told parliaments budget committee i think it is 
important to settle this matter legally and politically as soon as 
possible 
a series of recent news reports linking takeshita to recruit had 
prompted the prime minister to explain his role in the widening 
scandal 
i am aware the recruit scandal is the most serious matter i 
have ever experienced in the 38 years of my political career he 
said during the nationally televised committee hearing 
political reform is essential to overcome the current 
situation and restore public trust in politics 
takeshita said recruit and its subsidiaries gave about 1 
million between 1985 and 1987 to his political organizations in the 
form of donations and purchases of fundraising party tickets while 
he was finance minister and secretarygeneral of the governing 
liberal democratic party 
the prime minister said the money was treated as political 
donations not bribes 
asked by opposition lawmaker kanji kawasaki of the japan 
socialist party what his understanding was of recruits intention 
in making such large donations takeshita replied i am not in a 
position of telling the intent of another partys political 
donations 
in the scandal recruit sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted 
shares in a realestate subsidiary to about 160 political business 
and government officials at low prices 
buyers of the shares received handsome profits when the stock 
value soared shortly after being listed on the overthecounter 
market 
takeshita has acknowledged that a former aide and relative 
bought shares for a profit of about 190000 but he denied 
personal involvement in the transactions 
to opposition charges that he had reversed his earlier 
statements takeshita said i do not remember the details of my 
statement but i probably did not have clear recollections of the 
matter then 
in october takeshita told japans diet or parliament i have 
never received funds or whatsoever from recruit 
the scandal has prompted the opposition to demand that takeshita 
resign and call elections to allow the public to give its verdict 
on the scandal some members of his party also want him to step 
down 
your resignation is the only way to save japans democracy 
said kawasaki you are not entitled to discuss political reforms 
your hand is contaminated with recruit money 
japanese politicians long have relied on substantial donations 
from corporations both for campaign expenses and for the kind of 
giftgiving that has become a custom politicians say for example 
they are expected to send gifts for constituents weddings 
funerals and other occasions 
because of widespread giftgiving links between gifts and 
favors generally are not clear but the media long have criticized 
the close links between business and government 
proposed reforms would require a clearer public accounting of 
donations 
three people resigned from takeshitas cabinet after 
acknowledging they continued to receive recruit donations after the 
scandal broke last summer takeshita said he did not receive 
recruit money after 1987 the year he became prime minister 
he declined to answer opposition questions about how he would 
take responsibility if more allegations linking him to the recruit 
were revealed 
but at this point i do not anticipate anything of that sort 
will come out he said 
so far 14 people including two former vice ministers have 
been arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in 
the recruit scandal 
the investigation is continuing and several politicians are 
being questioned by authorities 
opposition parties said they suspect takeshitas donations from 
recruit may violate the law governing political donations 
companies of recruits size are only allowed to donate 113636 
annually to a politician 
also if it was substantiated that takeshita as the finance 
minister provided the firm with favors in return for donations he 
will become subject to bribery laws 
public support for takeshita in opinion polls has declined to 
alltime lows one poll released monday showed takeshitas approval 
rate at just 78 percent

in addition to the facts and figures formally 
found in a firms annual report southwest airlines co 1988 
features fun in the form of a paper airplane 
this was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of 
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to 
the basics and we translated that to what we thought was the 
most basic of all airplanes the paper airplane said tim 
mcclure executive creative director of austin advertising agency 
gsdampm which designed the report 
the booklet besides reporting on southwests record 5795 
million in profit traces the construction of a paper airplane from 
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble 
shamu one southwests flying whale jet rolled out last year 
during the airlines promotion of sea world theme parks in texas 
and california 
you think every preschooler and first grader in dallas will 
want one asked southwest spokeswoman charlotte goddard or all 
the ceos 
besides a picture of chairman herb kelleher throwing a paper 
airplane the middle of the report features a fourpage foldout 
picture of shamu one 
on the back page theres the punchout version of the unusually 
painted plane with assembly instructions and this helpful hint 
herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights 
shamu ones not his 
even though southwest previously has taken a light approach to 
its reports mcclure said it was a little difficult this year to 
sell the idea of a punchout airplane because once someone 
punches it out you have an annual report with holes in the back 
he said he persuaded southwest that the unusual idea would 
become enticing everybodys going to pick it up and call up 
for one 
i think its a delightful brochure and something that really 
shows the personality that southwest is mcclure said 
southwest a regional airline that employs almost 6500 people 
is based at love field near downtown dallas and operates a 
distinctive fleet of gold rust and orange jets

twentytwo chicago traders face large fines and 
possible suspension for their alleged roles in a scheme to 
prearrange trades for us treasury bond futures contracts 
the commodity futures trading commission said the traders 
executed a series of transactions with robert j griffin a floor 
broker on the chicago board of trade between july 10 and 24 1986 
that were of the character of fictitious sales and that as a 
result all of the traders caused prices to be reported that 
were not true 
the sixcount complaint disclosed monday in washington also 
charged griffin who was trading on behalf of customers with 
fraud alleging that his customers suffered losses because he 
traded with the other 21 traders rather than file the orders 
competitively 
griffins attorney matt lydon denied the cftc charges 
the trades were executed at prices which were the best 
attainable by the customers lydon said 
the cftc said a hearing before an administrative law judge would 
be scheduled the accused traders face possible penalties ranging 
from fines of 100000 per violation to revocation or suspension of 
their licenses and trading privileges 
the cftc charges follow disclosures a few months ago that the 
fbi was winding down a twoyear undercover probe of alleged 
wrongdoing among traders at the board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
i think the cftc is pressing on this because of the fbi 
investigation one trader named in the complaint told the chicago 
tribune his name was not printed 
they are trying to use this as a ploy to show congress that it 
the cftc is a necessary agency another trader named in the 
complaint told the newspaper 
mark prout a spokesman for the board of trade said after the 
exchange became aware of the investigation in may 1988 it asked 
the cftc for permission to take over the probe but received no 
reply 
those named in the complaint were 
john k angelo hinsdale ill leonard cahnmann and roy e

holly farms corp stockholders would get 
1875 shares of conagra inc stock for each of their holly farms 
shares if a proposed merger between the two firms goes through the 
companies announced 
the exchange agreed upon monday would be worth 60 a share to 
holly farms stockholders or a total of 108 billion for the 
company based on mondays closing market prices 
in an attempt to fend off a buyout by rival poultry producer 
tyson foods inc of springdale ark holly farms announced plans 
last november to merge with with conagra 
the tentative stock exchange rate was set then at between 1875 
and 2 shares of conagra stock for each holly farms share traded

cash or a total of 11 billion but holly farms managers are 
urging shareholders to reject it 
holly farms president r lee taylor ii said the conagra proposal 
would be a better deal for holly farms shareholders 
it gives stockholders an equity interest in a company that 
should be strategically the best performing food company in the 
united states he said 
tyson has turned to fullpage newspaper advertisements to urge 
holly farms employees who are stockholders to reject the conagra 
merger 
in advertisements published sunday in editions of the commercial 
appeal at memphis the winstonsalem journal in north carolina and 
the des moines register tyson touted its 6350ashare offer and

the house energy and commerce committee today 
approved legislation to lift the remaining price controls on 
natural gas which accounts for onequarter of the nations energy 
supply 
before a voice vote to send the bill to the house floor several 
panel members said the decontrol would help ease the nations 
growing dependence on imported energy without raising consumers 
heating bills 
i think gas prices are going to fall in the short run if the 
legislation is enacted said rep billy tauzin dla 
prospects for full congressional approval appeared better than 
at any time in this decade worries about price rises had blocked 
attempts to end the controls 
industry officials and analysts say the legislation could result 
in slight declines in consumer prices but any immediate effect is 
likely to be small because most of the controlled gas already sells 
at prices below the federally set ceilings 
the house measure is strongly supported by all segments of the 
natural gas industry and by the bush administration which views 
price decontrol as a way of promoting natural gas as a 
cleanerburning alternative to oil president bush has expressed 
concern at the countrys growing reliance on imported oil 
some consumer groups however say ending limits on how much 
producers may charge on about onethird of the nations gas supply 
will help the industry without tackling problems of greater concern 
to the 48 million households that use gas 
simple natural gas decontrol can do no good for the 
residential ratepayer said mark cooper research director for 
the consumer federation of america it probably wont do much 
harm but there are a lot of other things that could be done to 
protect consumers from the effects of rules changes 
coopers group and other consumer advocates say that while 
market forces are keeping natural gas prices low congress should 
be focusing more attention on supply issues one such problem 
called takeorpay is forcing consumers to help pay off 
longterm supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s 
when unlike today supplies were tight and prices were rising 
the average price for residential users in 1987 the latest year 
for which official government estimates are available was 556 
per thousand cubic feet down from a peak of 612 in 1985 in 1979 
the average price was 298 per thousand cubic feet 
the price decontrol bill was introduced by rep philip r sharp 
dind and cosponsored by 22 of the 23 members of a house energy 
subcommittee that approved it last week no action has been taken 
yet on a similar bill in the senate 
the house billcalls for price decontrol to be completed by jan 
1 1993 in the interim price controls would be lifted from gas 
not subject to a contract on the date of the legislations 
enactment as well as certain other gas 
sharp in past years had opposed lifting price controls on gas 
as had rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and 
commerce committee who once said decontrol would occur over my 
dead body but who now supports the sharp bill 
the switch in their views is an acknowledgement of changes in 
the industrys structure since gas deregulation was started by the 
1978 natural gas policy act that measure removed price limits on 
certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen categories 
of gas each with a federally set ceiling price 
the collapse of crude oil prices in 1986 coupled with the 
effects of other market and regulatory changes led to falling gas 
prices excess supplies and greatly increased competition both 
within the industry and with other fuels 
the reagan administration which had accelerated the decontrol 
of oil prices as one of its first official acts in 1981 never came 
close to winning congressional support for gas decontrol the bush 
administration has vowed to lobby hard on the issue 
you can be assured it is a major issue with the president 
himself energy secretary james d watkins told a house panel 
last month we will support it and support it in a major way

wheat futures prices moved moderately higher 
today on the chicago board of trade on signs of a deteriorating 
winter wheat crop corn and soybean futures were narrowly mixed 
in its weekly report on crop conditions released monday after 
the markets closed the agriculture department found a net decline 
in the condition of the winter wheat crop during the week ended 
sunday 
the finding was somewhat surprising since a recent increase in 
precipitation in some key wheatgrowing areas had led many traders 
to expect an overall improvement in the crop 
corn futures prices were slightly lower in early trading due in 
part to slack export demand 
slow foreign demand also limited early gains in the soybean

a house panel today amended president bushs 
savings and loan bailout plan to ensure that companies which bought 
failed sampls with federal aid last year do not suffer any losses if 
the assistance is cut off 
but it rejected an effort by liberal democrats to make both sampls 
and commercial banks reflect on their books the market value of 
real estate and third world loans whose value has declined 
substantially because borrowers are not repaying them 
with a twomonth honeymoon disintegrating into a kitchen 
squabble over who takes out the trash and whose friends get invited 
to supper the house banking committees financial institutions 
subcommittee began tackling the most controversial issues in bushs 
90 billion bailout proposal 
on a 3114 vote the panel rejected an amendment by rep joseph 
p kennedy ii dmass to make financial institutions list loans 
as assets only at the level for which they could be sold to others 
rather than their original value when issued 
theres no reason why banks and thrifts cannot be held to the 
discipline of the market and not hold on their books loans at 
values which are greatly in excess of what theyre worth kennedy 
said thats why we are in the trouble that we are today 
much of the magnitude of the sampl bailout has been blamed on 
congressionally approved accounting practices that allowed thrifts 
to effectively hide the deterioration of souring loans in their 
portfolios from regulators 
we keep hearing about the need for certainty and stability 
said rep bruce vento dminn this would formalize that process 
if you want to get tough this certainly gets tough 
critics however contended that such a radical change in 
financial accounting practices might hurt both banks and sampls 
dramatically 
if we were in a new world and starting from scratch it would 
be appropriate said rep cliff stearns rfla 
the panel approved on a 357 vote a measure by rep doug 
barnard dga that would protect holding companies who bought ill 
sampls last year with the promise of government aid from having to 
absorb the costs if those insitutions fail because the assistance 
is cut off 
barnard said the measure was aimed at preventing other sampls 
under a holding companys umbrella from also failing because of a 
government failure to live up to the aid agreements 
but banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
complained that the amendment would create a large loophole for 
holding companies to skirt any liability if the oncefailed thrifts 
go under again 
the panel had yet to tackle the much tougher capital standards 
that bush and bankers want to place on sampls and an offbudget 
financing scheme that has drawn the opposition of house ways and 
means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
to discourage risky loans blamed for much of the current crisis 
bush would require sampl owners to put up 6 percent capital or 6 
of their own money for every 100 they lend by june 1991 those 
who dont could not make additional loans with federally insured 
deposits 
but the subcommittees chairman rep frank annunzio dill 
and barnard have an amendment that would require sampls to 
effectively have only 15 percent tangible capital in relation 
to total outstanding loans 
many sampls already fail to meet the current 3 percent capital 
requirement many others meet the requirement only because of 
widely criticized but federally approved accounting practices 
which allow them to count good will from gestures such as 
taking over even weaker institutions in the past at the 
governments behest 
a subcommittee aide asking that his name not be used said the 
capital alternative proposed by annunzio and barnard is tougher in 
some ways than bushs standard because it narrows the range of 
acceptable accounting practices but he also acknowledged it would 
be much easier for sampls to meet the 15 percent target 
the issue is considered critical for 300 to 400 marginally 
solvent sampls and industry officials have said as many as onehalf 
of the nations 3000 savings institutions could have trouble 
meeting bushs proposed standards 
banks already are subject to the 6 percent capital requirement 
and they strongly endorse making sampls meet the same standard they 
also back provisions in bushs bill that would end prohibitions 
against bank ownership of thrift institutions 
but even republicans on the house banking committee have joined 
in the chorus criticizing the latter predicting it will create a 
feeding frenzy of banks preying upon sampls

white house and congressional budget writers 
with deadlines slipping away pushed today to finish their talks on 
a compromise spending and tax package for next year 
were hoping to come to an agreement but we havent made it 
said rep bill frenzel of minnesota the senior republican on the 
house budget committee as he entered todays meeting 
when we get one issue resolved we run into another said 
sen pete v domenici rnm frenzels senate counterpart who 
said he was still optimistic 
the bargainers have been meeting behind closed doors for more 
than a month in search of a compromise plan for reducing the 
federal deficit to 100 billion next year as required by the 
grammrudman law 
several of the groups own informal deadlines for actions have 
passed with some more significant ones looming including 
congress april 15 deadline for passing a budget resolution the 
negotiators were pressing to finish today 
a budget pact would be formally announced at a white house 
meeting but without agreement today that was unlikely until next 
week because president bush is leaving town 
based on latest estimates and bushs 116 trillion spending 
plan about 28 billion in deficit reduction is required the group 
has agreed that about half would come from spending restraints and 
half from raising revenues 
the revenues include roughly 34 billion from selling 
government assets 52 billion from raising various fees for 
government services and some 56 billion would be in unspecified 
new taxes but presumably none that president bush would concede 
violate his campaign promise for no new taxes 
more than 7 billion in savings would be made by restraining 
entitlement programs those requiring direct benefit payments to 
individuals including more than 25 billion trimmed from the 
expected growth in medicare costs 
mondays session was dedicated to deciding generally where cuts 
in nonentitlement government programs would be made at the 
pentagon and at domestic agencies according to participants who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
bush proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with 
inflation while domestic programs other than his own initiatives 
would be frozen at the previous years levels democrats in the 
talks have proposed trimming back defense growth so that more 
domestic demands can be met 
the bargainers traded offers monday toward a possible compromise 
on those and on the small but also politically sensitive foreign 
aid budget 
bush has personally contacted at least one lawmaker to lobby 
against cuts in foreign aid a program now administered by his old 
friend secretary of state james baker who appeared before the 
negotiators early in the talks 
congress has a selfimposed april 15 deadline for producing a 
budget resolution and even if agreement is reached quickly that 
deadline will be missed by weeks 
even if the negotiators complete their task this week the house 
and senate budget committees must draft more detailed spending 
plans for each chamber to consider then the two chambers would 
need to approve a single compromise plan 
the budget which does not require the presidents signature 
serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax legislation 
for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 
if congress and the president dont by then bring down the 
deficit to within 10 billion of the 100 billion goal the 
administration is required under the grammrudman law to order 
acrosstheboard spending cuts to make up the difference

the philippines could drop a lawsuit 
against westinghouse electric corp over an allegedly defective 
nuclear power plant if the us company helps provide alternate 
power an official said tuesday 
the government of president corazon aquino claims the 
620megawatt plant rests on an earthquake fault and has structural 
defects 
of course we are seeking recovery of damages but damages 
can be paid in services and facilities justice secretary sedfrey 
ordonez said in a television interview 
the 23 billion plant on the bataan peninsula 60 miles west of 
manila was completed in 1985 several months before president 
ferdinand marcos was driven into exile the plant was never started 
the aquino government sued westinghouse its subsidiary 
westinghouse international projects inc and contractors burns and 
roe enterprises inc in us district court in newark nj last 
december 
the philippines government also accused westinghouse of bribing 
marcos to win the contract to build the plant the suit is intended 
to cancel the contract and recover the money spent on the plant it 
also seeks unspecified damages 
westinghouse has denied the bribery charges and claims the plant 
is safe 
ordonez said an outofcourt settlement was not out of the 
picture 
our concern now is to develop alternate sources of energy 
he said if that can be met the money aspect can be minimized 
what is important is that we get something for the same value which 
would help us solve our power needs 
a justice department source said the remarks were hypothetical 
philippine and westinghouse officials held lengthy negotiations 
before the decision to file the suit 
ordonez was interviewed after salvador laurel mrs aquinos 
estranged vice president called on the administration to operate 
the plant because of the countrys power shortage 
ordonez and mrs aquino said they did not understand laurels 
position because the vice president voted with the cabinet in 1986 
to close the plant laurel quit as foreign secretary in 1987 and 
joined the political opposition last year 
according to our lawyers we have sufficient evidence in the 
matter of proving that we got a raw deal from westinghouse mrs 
aquino said monday 
robert f pugliese a westinghouse executive vice president 
said in a statement released in pittsburgh that the company was 
willing to explore how we can help bring the philippine nuclear 
power plant into service 
we are confident we built a safe plant he said prior to 
its mothballing by the philippines government it had passed every 
official inspection of its readiness to load fuel and begin 
startup testing 
in newark attorneys for the philippine government asked us 
district judge dickinson r debevoise to have the case heard in 
federal court westinghouse asked the judge to send the case to 
arbitration before the international chamber of commerce in geneva 
switzerland 
philippines attorney mark augenblick said a contract clause 
prescribing arbitration of disputes is invalid because the 
staterun national power corp was forced to sign the agreement

weatherdamage fears drove wheat futures prices 
to a moderately higher close tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed 
the gain in wheat prices was partly a reaction to the 
agriculture departments weekly report issued after the close 
monday showing a net decline in the condition of the winter wheat 
crop for the week ending sunday 
dry conditions in the great plains were cited for the 
deterioration and the cold weather of the past three days added to 
traders cropdamage fears 
the weathers a little nippy to put it mildly in some areas 
slowing development of wheat by about two weeks said katharina 
zimmer an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
she said other buying was prompted by perceptions that the steep 
decline in wheat prices over the past two weeks was not entirely 
warranted 
corn and soybean futures closed mixed in cautious trading ahead 
of the usdas monthly supplyanddemand report 
in that report the usda revised upward its estimates for 
198889 corn and wheat ending stocks but let stand its estimate for 
198889 soybean ending stocks 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the

crude prices also rose slightly while wholesale home heating

bob baker an energy analyst with prudentialbache securities

corn exports are at their highest level since 
the early 1980s but domestic use by livestock farmers is down 
sharply an agriculture department report showed tuesday 
the new supplyanddemand report said corn exports in the 
current marketing year that began last sept 1 are expected to 
total 21 billion bushels up by 100 million bushels from 
indications a month ago and up 21 percent from 173 billion shipped 
in 198788 
exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments 
totaled 24 billion bushels in 198081 
about 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as 
livestock feed this year down from 43 billion forecast in march 
and well below the record of 474 billion bushels consumed a year 
earlier 
according to usda records that would put feed use at the lowest 
since 382 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 198384 
the us stockpile at the end of the beginning of the new corn 
marketing year on sept 1 was forecast at 183 billion bushels up 
from the 166 billion bushels indicated in march 
last sept 1 before the droughtshriveled 1988 corn harvest was 
added to the supply the corn carryover was 423 billion bushels 
with a reduced supply corn prices shot up from an average of 
194 per bushel in 198788 to a projected range of 245 to 270 
this season 
the us wheat carryover on june 1 the beginning of the new 
wheat marketing year was indicated at 549 million bushels up 
slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the 
126 billion bushels in the inventory last june 1 
wheat exports and domestic use are down but the main impact has 
been the reduced 1988 harvest wheat prices are expected to average 
365 to 380 per bushel this season up from 257 in 198788 
the soybean situation reflects a barebones level of supply 
with the carryover on sept 1 the beginning of the 198990 
marketing year expected to be about 145 million bushels compared 
with 302 million last sept 1 
drought reduced last years production forcing prices higher 
the report forecast soybeans might average 720 to 760 per 
bushel this season compared with 588 in 198788 exports and 
domestic use are both down

a judge in switzerland has lifted a temporary 
restraining order that could have blocked a portion of the 
acquisition of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
polly howes a spokeswoman for rjr nabisco at the food and 
tobacco companys headquarters in atlanta on tuesday confirmed the 
decision by swiss judge gorg zogg in basel 
ms howes said the matter was handled entirely overseas and she 
could not provide further deatails 
the judge issued the temporary restraining order march 20 in 
response to a lawsuit filed by three bondholders in switzerland who 
contended that the 25 billion buyout of rjr nabisco last year 
diminished the value of their holdings 
the judges order was directed at the merger as it pertained to 
the assets of certain swiss subsidiaries of rjr nabisco the 
company argued during a hearing march 28 there was no basis for the 
order according to an rjr nabisco proxy statement 
a forsyth county nc judge last week also issued a temporary 
restraining order blocking the kkrrjr nabisco merger that stemmed 
from the swiss suit 
at the time county district judge james harrill jr set an 
april 17 hearing on a motion by swiss investors to block the 
merger it was not immediately clear what effect the swiss judges 
decision would have on the case in north carolina 
but ms howes said neither case was expected to delay the 
closing of the merger 
at least three other us lawsuits are pending claiming that 
the merger reduced the value of rjr nabisco bonds

the senate rejected president bushs minimum 
wage plan tuesday and moved closer to confronting him with 
legislation raising the hourly figure to 455 which he repeatedly 
has promised to veto 
the senate on a 6139 vote largely along party lines backed an 
amendment to legislation sponsored by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass that brought the measure essentially in line with a 
housepassed bill that would boost the minimum wage to 455 by 
october 1991 
rejected by 5841 was bushs proposal to increase the minimum 
wage by 30 cents a year from the current 335 an hour to 425 in 
january 1992 it was the second time bushs proposal was defeated 
in congress the house rejected it three weeks ago 
the senates action brought a quick response from the bush 
administration 
today congress had a golden opportunity labor secretary 
elizabeth dole said after the vote but senate democrats 
squandered the chance the first chance in eight years to raise 
the minimum wage 
more amendments were being considered before the legislation 
faced a final senate vote likely to come wednesday but no further 
significant changes were expected before then 
we compromised said kennedy referring to his past 
proposals to raise the minimum wage even higher he also noted a 
number of other changes in the legislation including expanded 
exemptions for small businesses to meet republican concerns 
the presidents approach is a far superior approach sen 
orrin hatch rutah said in his unsuccessful effort to win support 
for substituting bushs proposal for the kennedy bill 
the action seemed to guarantee the first domesticpolicy 
showdown between congress and bush barring a compromise while the 
bill is before a conference committee that will work out minor 
differences between the house and senate versions 
such a deal however appears unlikely 
there isnt going to be a compromise said senate republican 
leader robert dole of kansas its going to be 425 an hour and 
a sixmonth training wage period 
democrats nonetheless called on bush to accept their proposal 
if there is any one thing that the 101st congress must do it 
is to increase the minimum wage said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine chastising bush for opposing a 455 an 
hour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains tax 
breaks for the wealthy this legislation will be a test of 
whether we indeed are seeking a kindler gentler nation said 
mitchell 
both the defeated bush proposal and the amended kennedy bill 
contain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage below 
the federal minimum wage 
bush has insisted that provision extend for six months to all 
newly hired workers regardless of prior work experience 
kennedy like the sponsors of the house bill balked at that 
proposal but to win the support of moderate and conservative 
democrats agreed on a twomonth period during which some employees 
could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage 
that provision was contained in the amendment offered by 
democratic sens bob graham of florida and david pryor of arkansas 
our training wage proposal is a proper balance of the need to 
train new workers and the need to set a fair minimum wage said 
graham 
the grahampryor amendment requires an employee to hold one job 
for at least 30 days before the twomonth training period would 
expire the housepassed bill also allows for a twomonth training 
period at a subminimum wage but only if the affected employee had 
no prior job experience

prime computer inc said tuesday it will 
seek a buyer willing to pay more than the 20 a share offer by 
hostile suitor mai basic four inc that values the company at 970 
million 
prime said its financial advisors first boston corp and smith 
barney harris upham amp co had been instructed to actively 
solicit proposals and to pursue discussions and negotiations to 
sell the company for more than 20 a share 
the computer firm also said it would provide confidential 
information to interested parties 
prime climbed to 1987 up 187 in heavy new york stock 
exchange trading tuesday more than 285 million shares changed 
hands 
mai basic four inc a tustin califbased computer firm 
controlled by investor bennett s lebow launched its bid five 
months ago for prime which is four times its size 
in a statement tuesday lebow said he endorsed primes move if 
it is the companys intent to sell itself to the highest bidder 
however if this is another one of primes delaying tactics we 
intend to vigorously oppose it he said adding that he would 
continue to pursue his tender offer for prime 
prime spokesman joe gavaghan said estimates valuing prime at 23 
to 28 a share are more credible than mai basics offer especially 
since prime acquired computervision inc in february 1988 
he also said primes board of directors has not been opposed to 
a sale if it provides the share holders with a good price 
prime chairman david j dunn said in a statement that the mai 
basic offer does not reflect the intrinsic value in the company 
today and the longterm values achievable for all our 
stockholders 
prime said it was delaying its annual meeting to june 14 from 
may 12 to provide for an orderly and effective sale process

a state judge has ruled that insurance 
companies dont have to pay for a 25 million dioxin cleanup at the 
site of a former diamond shamrock plant but must fund payments to 
agent orange victims insurance company attorneys said tuesday 
the case centers around dioxin produced as a byproduct of 
herbicides including agent orange made at a newark plant between 
1951 and 1969 by the old diamond alkali company a predecessor to 
shamrock diamond shamrock has restructured and now is called maxus 
energy corp of dallas texas 
the company sued more than 100 insurers seeking coverage for the 
cleanup of the dioxin which is linked to certain cancers liver 
disease and a severe skin rash known as chloracne 
in a decision released to lawyers on tuesday superior court 
judge reginald stanton in morristown nj ruled that diamonds 
actions removed it from coverage said bates stanton heard a 
nonjury trial that began in september 
the decision could have wideranging effects in other cases in 
which companies seek to have their insurers handle millions of 
dollars in chemical and toxic waste cleanups said robert bates 
who represents american reinsurance co of princeton nj 
the opinion was to be filed wednesday morning insurance company 
attorneys provided excerpts from it but diamond shamrock lawyers 
could not be reached for comment stanton reached at home 
confirmed his ruling but declined to discuss it referring 
questions to the written opinion 
even by the standards of the 1951 to 1969 period diamonds 
conduct in operating the newark plant was unacceptably wrong and 
irresponsible stanton wrote 
diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic interest 
first it deliberately and persistently cheated on the limited 
environmental regulations which were in place 
but stanton also found that the insurance companies have to pay 
the bulk of diamonds 23 million share of a 180 million 
settlement reached in 1984 between makers of agent orange used in 
the vietnam war and those who sued over its health effects 
stanton interpreted the companys insurance contracts to mean 
that the insurers would have to bear most of the agent orange 
payments and established how the payments would be distributed 
among the carriers according to bates 
lawyers for the company could not be reached they either had 
gone home for the evening or did not return phone calls 
a maxus spokeswoman ginger shearburn could not be reached 
there was no answer at the company and she did not return a 
telephone call left on her home answering machine

white house and congressional budget 
negotiators driving toward a deficitreduction deal said tuesday 
that major issues remain and pledged not to let any deadline blow 
up the talks 
when we get one issue resolved we run into another said 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate budget committee 
we have not closed on any of the major ones issues said 
rep thomas s foley dwash the house majority leader you 
just have to keep plodding on one step after another 
privately some participants said there was an eagerness to 
finish so that president bush and congressional leaders could 
announce a pact at the white house this week but no announcement 
was scheduled by the time the group broke for the night tuesday 
and bush planned to leave washington for the weekend early thursday 
but foley said the group was not working against any deadline 
its silly to blow up a long negotiation over an artificial 
deadline he said 
the goal of the talks is agreement on the general outlines of a 
budget to bring the fiscal 1990 deficit down to 100 billion as 
mandated by the grammrudman law 
the talks have dragged on far longer than expected and are now 
pressing against a saturday deadline for passing a budget 
resolution 
bush proposed his 116 trillion budget in february estimating 
that about 27 billion needed to be slashed from current government 
programs or revenues increased to meet the grammrudman goal 
the negotiating team has been working on a 28 billion plan 
with about half the deficit savings coming from new revenues and 
half from spending restraint 
on the spending side more than 7 billion in savings would be 
made by restraining entitlement programs those requiring direct 
benefit payments to individuals more than 25 billion of that 
would be from holding back some of the expected growth in medicare 
spending 
they tentatively agreed last week that the revenues would 
include roughly 34 billion from selling government assets 52 
billion from raising various fees for government services and 56 
billion from unspecified taxes 
however the revenue mix has been changing this week as the 
group has consulted the white house and the congressional 
committees responsible for putting the agreement into legislation 
less money would be raised with new fees and more through asset 
sales sources said 
although the tax figure is about the same as bush proposed in 
his budget the presidents plan relied heavily on his proposal to 
cut the tax rate on capital gains bush contends a lower capital 
gains rate would actually increase government revenues by 48 
billion next year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on tuesday denied bush 
was abandoning his support of capital gains tax reduction but it 
was subject to negotiation 
he will believe in the capital gains tax cut forever and 
ever fitzwater said im not making any commitments in terms 
of the budget deal the budget deal is up to negotiation 
everything is under discussion 
actually the details of the tax package and specific spending 
decisions would be left for later 
the negotiators have been working to produce a very broad set of 
guidelines setting forth total figures for a handful of revenue 
and spending categories it would be left for the normal 
legislative process to produce the steps to enact those totals 
participants in the talks said they were sworn to secrecy about 
the specifics because of the sensitivity of the current 
discussions on possible cuts in bushs 300 billion defense budget 
and in domestic programs 
bush proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with 
inflation democratic negotiators have asked for slower defense 
growth so that more domestic demands can be met 
if the negotiators complete a package the house and senate 
budget committees would then draft more detailed spending plans for 
each chamber to consider then the two chambers would need to 
approve a single compromise plan 
the budget serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax 
legislation for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 
if congress and the president dont enact legislation to reduce 
the deficit to within 10 billion of the 100 billion goal the 
administration is required under the grammrudman law to order 
acrosstheboard spending cuts to make up the difference

northrop corp and five current and former 
employees were indicted tuesday on charges they conspired to 
defraud the government in building components for the guidance 
system for the cruise missile and the harrier jet fighter 
the 167count indictment announced by us attorney robert 
bonner charged that northrop and the five conspired to install 
install parts of the cruise missile system which failed to meet 
government specifications 
the indictment also alleged that lengthy reliability testing on 
the cruise missiles flight data transmitter was not performed as 
required and that three of the defendants supervised false testing 
and falsification of test results 
if convicted on all charges northrop faces a maximum fine of 
more than 30 million each of the individual defendants would face 
maximum jail sentences of five years on each count and fines 
ranging from 5000 to 250000 
todays indictment is part of our continuing efforts to 
identify prosecute and hopefully deter defense procurement 
fraud bonner said in a statement 
he said the indictment was the result of a twoyear probe by a 
multiagency task force 
there was no immediate reaction to the indictment from northrop 
obviously we havent seen it so we cant comment said greg 
waskul a spokesman at the century city office 
named in the indictment were joseph yamron a resident of 
massachusetts and vice president and general manager of the 
precision products divsion of northrop also named were leopold 
engler of massachusetts formerly a vice president with northrop 
charles gonsalves of glendora calif former manager of the 
western services department of northrop cheryl hannan of 
glendora formerly quality assurance supervisor for western 
services and howard hyde of yorba linda calif former chief 
engineer for western services 
with regard to the harrier jet project the indictment accused 
northrop gonzalves hyde and ms hannan of conspiring to defraud 
the government about the stabilization systems sold by northrop to 
be installed in the navy jet 
the indictment accused the defendants of failing to conduct 
vibration tests at levels required by the contract on sensor 
assemblies used in the jet and then falsely certifying they had 
been properly tested 
the harrier can take off from short fields and can hover and 
sophisticated stability controls are critical to its performance 
and safety 
on the cruise missile project the indictment charges that 
northrop yamron and engler knew that the flight data transmitter 
was required to withstand temperatures as low as 65 degrees but 
supplied parts that froze at temperatures of 40 to 50 degrees 
many of the cruise missiles presumed targets are deep within 
the soviet union where temperatures can drop to extreme levels 
should the flight data transmitter fail in extreme cold the weapon 
could not reach its target 
northrop produced and shipped approximately 1175 flight data 
transmitters between 1981 and 1989 for use in the missile which 
have been deployed on b52 and b1b bombers 
the company produced and shipped 189 sensor assemblies for the 
harrier jet between 1982 and 1989 
bonner said the air force and navy are now evaluating the 
evidence on the alleged falsifications in order to determine if 
action must be taken to ensure the reliability of the missiles and 
the harrier 
northrop also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former 
employees who alleged the company falsified test results and 
cheated the air force on the mx missile project 
in addition to wellpublicized battles with critics of the mx 
program the company faces a congressional investigation of 
allegations of improper payments to south korean businessmen in an 
unsuccessful effort to sell its f20 tigershark fighter in that 
country in 1984 
northrop is also the main contractor for the b2 stealth bomber

rough seas that helped stall and break up 
some of giant oil spill from the exxon valdez became calmer tuesday 
and winds shifted away from fishrich kodiak island the coast 
guard said 
kodiak still seems to be saved said jim hayden the state 
of alaskas cleanup coordinator 
coast guard spokesman ken freeze said the spill appears to have 
stalled and is breaking into tar balls thats better than ooey 
gooey oil he said 
equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military 
transports about 67 tons of material everything from containment 
booms to absorbent pads were scheduled to arrive tuesday 
a huge soviet oilskimming vessel the vay dagursky was 
expected to arrive saturday state officials said the ship can 
skim 200000 gallons an hour and store 2 million gallons of oil on 
board according to the officials but it remains unclear how 
effective it might be against the alaska spill 
despite the favorable weather a light sheen of oil seeped into 
the kenai fjords national park at scattered inlets and fjords 
freeze said with a thickness measured in molecules the sheen does 
not threaten serious environmental damage he said 
the operator of the transalaska pipeline said it had complied 
with a state order for an aroundtheclock 12person oil spill 
emergency response crew and had purchased a supply of oil 
dispersant 
alyeska pipeline service co has been criticized for disbanding 
the emergency response team years before the spill and for not 
having enough dispersant on hand to combat the 101 million gallons 
of crude that spilled 
the coast guard said it planned to deploy a flotilla of 30 
fishing boats from seward and six from kodiak along with the coast 
guard cutter morganthau to drag smallholed herring and shrimp 
nets through the leading edge of the slick 
coast guard capt joe blackett said tests monday showed the nets 
break the oil into small globs which dont reform the operation 
may not begin until wednesday blackett said 
much of the cleanup operation so far has relied on floating 
containment booms cleanup crews ran into trouble when they tried 
to deploy a more permanent boom at sawmill bill site of a salmon 
hatchery anchors werent available in adequate numbers freeze 
said and depth charts that hadnt been updated since the 1964 
earthquake proved inaccurate 
the coast guard has been in charge of cleanup operations since 
president bush ordered stepped up federal involvement last week 
mondays rough weather which saw seas to 15 feet galeforce 
wind warnings and small craft advisories turned calmer tuesday 
aerial spotter flights resumed seas reduced to 5 to 7 feet still 
above normal and winds shifted from the northwest that could 
steer oil to the southeast and away from the coastline and kodiak 
the nations richest fishing port last year 
oil hasnt traveled further southwest than gore point about 80 
miles northeast of kodiak in four days 
the weather did get very rough out there said hal 
alabaster spokesman for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration under certain conditions these weather factors 
could be very beneficial 
officials hoped for a more accurate assessment of the seas work 
when aerial surveys are completed 
the spill has killed thousands of birds and animals and 
gasoline prices in the united states have surged in the wake of the 
disaster 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner warned oil 
companies against using the spill as an excuse to increase prices 
if theyre doing it theyre making a big mistake he told 
reporters in cincinnati i hope the oil industry isnt foolish 
enough and i dont think they are i havent seen any proof of it 
to think they can take advantage of the situation at valdez to 
raise prices unnecessarily 
in new york gov mario cuomo ordered state officials to 
investigate the rising oil prices 
it would be patently unfair if the oil industry took advantage 
of a tragedy of its own making in alaska as an excuse to increase 
retail gasoline prices said cuomo that would be the 
equivalent of picking the pockets of consumers 
at the kodiak cafe fishermen anxiously awaited their fate even 
if the spill turns back this time kodiak may not be in the clear 
for months until most of the slick is out in the gulf 
yeah i worry about the longterm effects we all do i wonder 
what will happen said earl peterson who harvests crab salmon 
and halibut on his 52foot boat 
about 18000 barrels of crude have been recovered only 8 
percent of the 240000 barrels that spilled march 24 when the 
tanker ran aground on bligh reef 
exxon said with additional skimmers about 2000 barrels were 
being recovered daily reports from state officials and the coast 
guard have placed the figure at about 1000 barrels a day

eastern airlines striking unions reached 5year 
agreements monday with peter v ueberroth that apparently resulted 
in changes to ueberroths agreement to buy the airline from parent 
texas air corp sources said 
after four days of almost continuous bargaining ueberroths 
group and the three striking unions representing the machinists 
pilots and flight attendants struck their deals at about 6 am 
monday in washington 
the parties then flew to new york and went directly to us 
bankruptcy court for a series of meetings that lasted eight hours 
present for some of the meetings was former defense secretary frank 
carlucci although his role was not clear 
at 7 pm ueberroth emerged from the courthouse and announced 
the union settlement calling it a historic labor partnership 
sources said ueberroth and the unions apparently made changes to 
the 464 million deal under which the former baseball commissioner 
would buy eastern unless texas air chairman frank lorenzo agrees 
to the changes the unions agreements with ueberroth cannot go 
forward 
a key change demanded by the unions is that the bankruptcy court 
appoint a special trustee to take over the operation of eastern 
from lorenzo as the airline attempts to emerge from chapter 11 the 
new york times reported in tuesdays editions 
we have not yet seen a copy of the agreement we understand it 
is very complex and we will study it texas air spokesman art 
kent said late monday from houston 
we have one more major bridge to cross ueberroth told 
reporters reading a statement he had just scrawled in the 
courthouse lobby and thats right here in this courthouse that 
bridge must be crossed theres no guarantee we will cross it 
ueberroth said talks would continue tuesday in an effort to get 
eastern the nations seventhlargest airline back in the air 
eastern has been largely grounded since machinists struck march 4 
and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support 
texas air which purchased eastern in 1986 was maintaining that 
nothing had been accomplished 
theres no agreement as far as were concerned said bruce 
zirinsky an eastern lawyer 
there was no meeting of the minds said harvey miller 
another eastern lawyer 
ueberroth declined to give details of his deals with the unions 
union sources said the concessions totalled about 210 million 
the unions have been wary that proposed tranfers of assets 
totalling 79 million from eastern to texas air could affect 
easterns viability the unions since before the strike have been 
oppoosed to transferring aircraft routes airport gates among 
other thing 
all agreements must be approved by parties to easterns 
bankruptcy proceeding which include texas air and easterns 
creditors eastern filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws 
on march 9 
lawyers for the creditors were present for the whirlwind series 
of meetings at the courthouse among the union participants were 
charles bryan head of easterns machinists union jack bavis head 
of easterns pilots union and mary jane barry head of easterns 
flight attendants union 
judge burton r lifland who is presiding over the bankruptcy 
was nearby and even made popcorn for the negotiators carlucci a 
vice chairman of a washington investment company was in and out of 
the talks he declined to identify his role 
by the end of the day the negotiators had reached the point of 
exhaustion ueberroth who flew to california on friday returned 
to washington on saturday and said he had not slept since 
representatives of the unions and examiner david shapiro had been 
going nonstop with ueberroths people since thursday night 
several times they needed to break away ueberroth took 
representatives of the three striking unions to lunch at another 
point ueberroth broke away with partner j thomas talbot and and 
went to a restaurant where they talked and watched a college 
baseball game on television 
by dusk the parties said they were too tired to go on and 
ueberroth asked the courts permission to announce the deals with 
the three unions he said the agreements also would cover 11000 
nonunion employees at eastern such as reservation clerks ticket 
agents and clerical workers 
a representative of nonunion employees mary grace shore said 
her group objected to not being represented in the talks ms shore 
sits on the eastern unsecured creditors committee 
ueberroth has said eastern could begin expanding its schedule 24 
hours after final agreements are reahced between his group texas 
air and the unions 
karen ceremsak an eastern spokeswoman in miami said monday it 
could take 10 days for the airline to resume 80 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights once the unions agreed to 
return 
the delay would stem from needed maintenance and inspection of 
idled planes ferrying of aircraft to appropriate airports 
recalling laidoff employees and other logistical tasks 
using nonunion employees and nonstriking 200 pilots eastern 
is flying about 110 flights daily focusing on its northeast 
shuttle and latin american routes the airline has a deal to sell 
the shuttle to new york developer donald j trump for 365 million 
raymond wright a vice chairman of the master executive council 
of the air line pilots association estimated it could take 4560 
days for eastern to resume a full schedule once striking employees 
return 
union officials also said it would be foolish and costly to 
restore a full schedule immediately because eastern already 
carrying a heavy debt would have few passengers in the days 
immediately following resumption of service 
separately a federal appeals court upheld injunctions barring 
new york metropolitanarea passenger rail workers from striking in 
sympathy with eastern employees 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court 
ruling that the federal railway labor act barred unionized workers 
at the long island rail road metronorth commuter railroad new 
jersey transit and amtrak from honoring the picket lines of 
striking eastern machinists 
sympathy strikes at the railroads would have affected about 
400000 commuters
