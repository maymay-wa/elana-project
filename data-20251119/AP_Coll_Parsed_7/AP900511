the lead prosecutor in new yorks pizza 
connection heroin trial was named friday to coordinate the 
investigation in the bombing deaths of a federal judge and a black 
savannah lawyer 
louis freeh an assistant us attorney in new york was named 
to head the justice department investigation and prosecution of the 
case 
attorney general dick thornburgh said he picked an outside 
prosecutor to oversee the probe because the mail bombs case spanned 
several jurisdictions 
freeh handled the 17month new york trial of an mafia ring that 
distributed tons of heroin and cocaine in the united states he won 
prosecutions against 18 members of the 16 billion ring that used 
pizzerias as fronts to distribute large amounts of heroin and 
cocaine from 1975 to 1984 
the reputed former chief of the sicilian mafia gaetano 
badalamenti and his associate salvatore catalano received 
45year prison terms for running the ring 
in the present case four packages containing explosives were 
sent to sites in alabama florida and georgia over a fourday 
period in middecember two of them exploded killing 11th us 
circuit court judge robert s vance at his home near birmingham 
ala and savannah alderman robert robinson at his law office 
packages containing explosives were removed from the 11th 
circuits headquarters building in atlanta and the jacksonville 
fla office of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
hundreds of law enforcement personnel have been working on 
this investigation and cooperation among the various districts has 
been excellent thornburgh said 
as this multidistrict investigation has progressed however 
it has become evident that the naming of the a single coordinating 
prosecutor with overall responsibility is essential the attorney 
general said

the army on friday ordered the 
arrest of brazils former secret service chief after he criticized 
president fernando collor de mello and the new governments 
economic reform plans officials said 
also disciplined for similar criticism was retired gen euclydes 
figueiredo the brother of former military president joao 
figueiredo 
carlos tinoco the minister of the army announced the 
punishments in a televised interview 
the presidential palace refused to comment 
both generals were punished under a military code that prohibits 
military personnel from making political statements or attacks on 
the president to the press without authorization from an armed 
forces minister 
the confrontation underlies growing tensions between collor and 
conservative elements of brazils armed forces 
tinoco said gen newton cruz the former head of the recently 
abolished secret service was ordered arrested for 10 days in an 
army barracks in brasilia after attacking collor in an interview 
published friday in the o estado de sao paulo newspaper 
cruz criticized collor for firing 400000 public employees 
earlier this week to speed his antiinflation program 
i think we live in a dictatorship validated by the judiciary 
and the congress cruz was quoted as saying if former 
president jose sarney erred by lacking authority and determination 
collor fails for his excessive aggressiveness 
tinoco said cruz confirmed basically all of his criticisms 
euclydes figueiredo was also severely reprimanded for defending 
cruzs criticisms in a separate article tinoco said 
in addition to scrapping the 29yearold secret service collor 
has irked a number of generals by opening up classified files of 
political opponents to the 196485 rightwing military regime 
figueiredo ended military rule by turning the presidency over to 
sarney a civilian but the military exerted great influence during 
the fiveyear sarney administration

a federal appeals court panel friday upheld 
texas countywide elections for judges ruling 21 that black 
voting strength isnt illegally diluted by electing as many as 59 
judges at large from one county 
the threejudge panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned us district judge lucius buntons decision that the 
elections in nine urban texas counties illegally dilute the 
strength of minority voters 
while elected judges are representatives in that they are 
accountable to a constituency of electors the full authority of a 
trial judges office is exercised exclusively by one individual 
and there can be no share of such a singlemember office the 
panel said in its decision consequently the countywide election 
of district court judges does not violate the voting rights act 
bunton ruling last november on a lawsuit by the league of 
united latin american citizens ordered texas to divide the nine 
counties into electoral subdistricts and to hold nonpartisan 
elections in those districts 
bunton had directed the elections be held may 5 but the 
appellate court has stayed that order 
the counties which include dallas fort worth houston san 
antonio austin and four smaller cities elect 172 of texas 390 
district judges 
fridays decision is clearly good news for our judicial system 
and for the people of texas said gov bill clements by its 
decision today the panel ruled that texans will retain the right 
to elect all trial judges who serve in their local county 
courthouse 
as texas chief elections officer and a defendant in this 
lawsuit i am extremely pleased with this action said texas 
secretary of state george bayoud 
the league of united latin american citizens a major minority 
rights group based in san antonio didnt immediately return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
the losing side can petition the panel for a rehearing or 
appeal to the supreme court 
appeals judge sam d johnson of austin disagreed with the ruling 
by judge patrick higginbotham of dallas who voted with judge 
carolyn dineen king of houston 
i am totally at odds with the majoritys application of the 
socalled single officeholder exception johnson wrote in his 
dissent 
he said the majority incorrectly based its decision on a new 
york case involving three candidates elected from three different 
districts the majority expands this beyond its logical 
bounds wrote johnson 
under texas law district judges are elected every four years 
they run atlarge with all voters in a county allowed to vote in 
every race 
bunton said the atlarge elections deny hispanic and black 
voters an equal chance to elect the candidates they want 
the appellate panel rejected texas arguments that judges are 
not representatives and that congress didnt mean judicial 
elections to fall under the voting rights act 
but it also rejected the central argument brought by the league 
that each judge is part of a larger court which should have more 
black representatives 
indisputably district judges in texas share administrative 
tasks with other district judges in the same county it said 
equally indisputably however the district judge in texas does 
his judging alone

with memorial day on the horizon and 
floods in the foreground lake texoma businesses that spend 
millions to lure fishermen and boaters are worrying about swamped 
marinas and closed campsites 
intermittent rains fell over the region friday and showers are 
forecast for the next few days but some business owners hope they 
can recover in time for memorial day the first big holiday of the 
season 
you always think things wont get this bad said arnold 
perkins president of the lake texoma association weve had 
floods 10 to 15 feet above normal thats a bad flood were 
talking 24 feet above level now 
normal elevation at lake texoma on the red river at the texas 
line is 617 feet above sea level it crested monday at 64476 
feet dipped to 6414 friday but still sloshes windowhigh on 
mobile homes once 100 feet from its shore 
a restaurant disco and marina complex used by 5000 to 6000 
people a day during the summer was submerged and has been flooded 
for three weeks david hull who leases the property estimates 
damage at 2 million 
about 700 concession workers have been laid off because heavy 
rains in the region pushed the lake to its highest levels since it 
was built in 1944 
some campsites lodges and golf courses are open but word is 
out that lake texoma has suffered its worst flooding since 1957 
and that could be as big a blow to the tourism industry as the 
flooding itself perkins said 
the rains in oklahoma and texas filled lakes to their brims 
causing flooding in the two states and arkansas as water was 
released downstream on the arkansas and red rivers 
the army corps of engineers said its expects a greater volume of 
water to move safely through the red river flood control system 
than did in the disastrous floods of 1957 and 1927 texas had a 
dozen floodrelated deaths oklahoma one 
corps spokesman ed engelke said the 20 camping areas around lake 
eufaula in eastern oklahoma all have limited access because of high 
waters there he said rangers must check for damage before the 
sites are fully accessible 
downstream in arkansas where the arkansas river is receding 
from its crests at little rock and pine bluff the red river 
crested 8 feet above flood stage thursday at fulton and closed 
westbound lanes of interstate 30 
were looking at 80 square miles of flooding said jim 
barnes head of the us agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service in little river county it stretches for six 
miles 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon asked president bush on friday for 
federal disaster assistance for 36 of oklahomas 77 counties 
because of the floods 
in texas where severe flooding extended along the trinity river 
from north texas to the gulf coast the red has flooded 40 homes 
near texarkana where national guard troops were in their fourth 
day of reinforcing levees 
at lake grapevine near dallas some say it could take months for 
boat ramps to be reopened because of recent high waters 
summertime is like our christmas we only make it three months 
out of the year said terri berthelsen manager of the landing 
snack shop at the marina we pulled through last year on our 
savings this year we dont know what is going to happen 
on lake texoma caney creek resort owner virginia wornom said 
business slowed considerably in the last week and should stay 
through memorial day and beyond until people realize we havent 
floated off 
in the next two weeks all the marinas should be in condition 
to take care of the public perkins said but on friday about 
half were either under water or inaccessible 
perkins said water covered the roads leading to his marina in 
denison texas his restaurant once 5 feet deep in water reopened 
friday 
he and other proprietors say they cant begin to guess at the 
amount of the damage until the water recedes the corps of 
engineers has said it could be 45 to 60 days before the lake 
returns to a decent level 
perkins and other business owners have their eye on the holiday 
weekend traditionally a huge kickoff for a season that runs 
through labor day 
we were booked solid for memorial day but weve had a lot of 
cancellations said marion stone owner of soldier creek resort 
and marina people are not going to come to the lake 
james atnip superintendent of lake texoma state park said park 
officials are trying to be positive even though 270 of the 300 
campsites are closed and tree limbs and other debris are scattered 
across the lake 
theres not going to be a lake texoma this summer said mrs 
stone all the beaches are under water the water is murky the 
publicity has been harmful but we try not to mislead people

the pedestrian the most flexible inexpensive 
and pollutionfree unit of transportation is being driven into 
manhattan streets by sidewalk obstructions 
obstacles range from construction scaffolding to slowmoving 
outoftowners 
this becomes apparent on the west side of lexington avenue each 
weekday afternoon at 523 when according to scientific studies 
the sidewalk between 42nd and 43rd streets is the most crowded on 
the planet 
almost 160 pedestrians a minute squeeze through a channel 
usually narrowed to 4 feet by newspaper vending machines trash 
cans street and traffic light poles a newsstand a table selling 
exotic oils and incense a flower stand and a tank of refrigerated 
liquid nitrogen 
something has to give so the pedestrians step off the curb a 
few at first then more until at least a third of the thousands 
steaming toward grand central terminal are doing so in the dubious 
safety of the lexington avenue bus lane 
the pedestrian has been losing ground in the struggle for 
space in manhattan according to a report by the borough 
presidents office and that is a serious problem in an 
environment which depends so heavily on walking for its mobility 
another reminder of how serious a problem came last week 
erica moreno 3 was walking handinhand with her mother in 
40th street because a construction project had closed the sidewalk 
a driver lost control of his car and smashed another vehicle into 
the girl killing her 
each year cars and trucks in new york kill more than 600 
pedestrians and injure 15000 william h whyte an urban planner 
who has counted and studied pedestrians on lexington and streets 
all over the world says new yorkers try to bully cars with an 
attitude of make way for me or kill me 
but walking is vital on a crowded island where 60 percent of 
eligible adults dont even have a drivers license and whyte says 
pedestrians in manhattan walk longer and faster than any place in 
america 
they need space however and manhattans already congested 
streets and sidewalks have been tied up by the financial services 
boom of the 1980s which brought in more workers and the attendant 
construction boom which closed down more sidewalks 
then there are tourists a male new york pedestrians cruising 
speed can exceed 350 feet a minute visitors from less populous 
communities often move at 250 feet a minute and they have been 
seen doing so three abreast as a result locals are always walking 
up the heels of outoftowners 
but the biggest problem is the dimension and condition of the 
citys pedestrian infrastructure the sidewalks on lexington 
between 42nd and 60th much of the pavement is cracked or buckled 
sloping in spots at 20 degrees it is full of holes and hollows 
some with semipermanent puddles replenished by rain and snow in 
winter and by condensate from store air conditioners in summer 
at 12 feet lexingtons sidewalks are far narrower than fifth 
avenues 22 feet and they usually are further reduced by various 
obstacles traffic is reduced to one lane at the northwest corner 
of 60th by a subway entrance construction scaffolding and a 
newsstand selling everything but washing machines 
most of the space along lexington goes to vehicles even though 
the pedestrian volume at the lexington entrance to grand central is 
rivaled only by one approach to tokyos shinjuku rail station 
about 78 percent of the people moving along the avenue at peak 
periods are on foot only 22 percent are in vehicles yet only 34 
percent of the avenues total space is given to pedestrians 20 
percent of that usable while vehicles get 66 percent 
to pedestrians the solution seems obvious damn the motorists 
and widen the sidewalks the city plans the latter on sixth avenue 
above 42nd street where it will narrow each vehicular lane to add 
3 feet of sidewalk drivers and many businesses oppose such 
tactics but later this year a coalition of environmental groups 
will ask the city to begin a broad program of sidewalk expansion 
and reconstruction 
until that happens there will be more jaywalking more midblock 
crossing more people in the bus lane according to peter hecht of 
the project for public spaces who has filmed and studied 
pedestrian movements 
street walking he says is the pedestrians way of saying the 
sidewalks are too crowded theyre voting with their feet

adam gotner badly wounded survived that 
bloody day when police opened fire on people in the street twenty 
years later solidarity runs the government and he leads a search 
for secretly buried bodies 
dec 17 1970 is etched in polish memory as a day of slaughter 
at 6 am gotner and many others were walking to their jobs at the 
paris commune shipyard 
tanks and police were posted at the shipyard gates suddenly 
the police began shooting 
gotner then 25 felt something hit his shoulder and saw his 
jacket turning red he thought of running at the tanks but i 
realized it would be instant suicide and retreated 
all this time for several minutes i could hear the shooting 
continuing and then it seemed i was stepping on people he said 
i had the impression i was stepping on bodies the whole 
street had been covered with people going to work in my mind 
there were at least 500 dead 
long afterward gotner realized most were not dead but either 
wounded or sprawling for cover 
the communist authorities had declared the port and shipyard 
closed because of unrest over governmentimposed increases in food 
prices but had not told the workers police may have thought the 
men intended to occupy the shipyard 
official accounts said 45 baltic port and shipyard workers were 
killed that day 28 of them in gdynia and gdansk many poles 
believe the number was much higher 
a committee led by gotner is trying to determine how many died 
in gdynia which means digging for bodies two excavations have 
yielded no conclusive results 
a macabre legend grew around the december events and the 
authorities contributed to it by collecting bodies and burying them 
hastily at night often with no relatives present 
tombstones erected later were allowed to say only that the 
person honored had died a tragic death no mention of the 
gdynia killings was permitted in the statecontrolled press 
attempts to investigate were blocked even in 198081 
solidaritys first brief experience of legal existence 
censorship was eased enough to allow andrzej wajda to make the 
acclaimed movie man of iron in which the 1970 gdynia killings 
are portrayed as central to the rise of solidarity a decade later 
gotner survived five bullet wounds in the chest eventually 
became a solidarity activist in gdynia and organized a civic 
committee this year to build a new monument to the victims in front 
of city hall 
soon after it was formed his committee came under public 
pressure to investigate the killings with the communist party out 
of power city officials agreed 
on a sunny april day at the witominski cemetery gravediggers 
lifted the coffin of jadwiga sikorska from a sandy hillside and 
probed a little deeper 
they found two sets of bones wrapped in cloth one was too old 
to be from 1970 the other did not appear old enough 
a representative of the prosecutors office was present and the 
remains were taken to a forensic laboratory for analysis 
mrs sikorskas son jerzy had noticed bones in the earth when 
he buried his mother in march and told the committee 
earlier 70 volunteers dug up a 60foot stretch of path in 
another part of the cemetery where witnesses had reported signs of 
newly dug graves immediately after the 1970 shootings no bodies 
were found 
experts confirmed part of the path had been dug up about 20 
years ago but only to a depth of about four feet they said there 
was no evidence the soil had been disturbed below that depth for 
hundreds of years 
there were several hypotheses and mine is that they were 
preparing to bury bodies there and then decided not to because of 
personnel changes in the government gotner said in an interview 
at his modest apartment overlooking the shipyard 
he is a slender articulate man with dark curly hair salted 
with gray and is cautious in expressing opinions about the outcome 
of his search when pressed gotner said i think it may turn out 
to be true that five or 10 more people were killed than has been 
reported 
that conclusion would not be popular already i have heard 
gossip that the fact that we have not found anything proves we are 
on the side of the authorities he said 
several people claimed to have seen secret burials three 
witnesses who appeared reliable including a militiaman claim to 
have seen about 200 bodies 
gortner noted however that no one is coming to us and asking 
us to find somebody despite public appeals for information 
whether the victims were more or fewer gotner said we want 
to find the truth we cannot let halftruths continue to exist if 
we want to build the future 
he removed his shirt revealing scars on the upper chest and a 
very deep exit wound in his back 
if i had known i had five bullets in me i would have died of 
fright he said and laughed 
the laughter gone gotner said doing this is my 
responsibility to those who died at that time i remember when i 
was walking and i saw someone falling down i wanted to to help him 
then but i could not

the american press ought not to be described 
as free because its members keep playing the same tune according 
to an assessment by a controversial russian magazine editor 
reported in friday editions of the washington post 
all our stay in this country is described with the same 
epithets the same words the same expressions as if it was 
xeroxed stanislav kunayev was quoted as saying 
kunayev editor of nash sovremennik our contemporary was one 
of eight editors and writers chosen by the us embassy in moscow 
for their russian nationalist views for a monthlong tour of the 
united states 
jewish organizations protested the visit saying kunayev and 
others in the delegation advocated antisemitic views the sponsor 
the us information agency defended the choices on the grounds 
that everybody could benefit from a close look at a free open 
society 
kunayev was interviewed at a reception at columbia university in 
new york city the newspaper reported 
he was quoted as saying you folks in america worry too much 
about the jews theyre not that bad off 
he called the controversy over the visit primitive and 
ludicrous and said i dont see any reason to call the american 
press a free press in relation to us 
kunayev who has been quoted as saying he supports the united 
nations resolution equating zionism with racism told the 
interviewer he opposes the form of zionism that spreads reports of 
what he called nonexistent pogroms 
he criticized the extremist russian patriotic group pamyat on 
the grounds that their practice helps zionists but added that 
the group is a phantom which is exaggerated by propaganda 
viktor likhonosov an author described the tour by and 
large there was no chance for dialogue the way the newspapers 
were proceeding 
its particularly surprising when you know youre not the way 
youre represented and you think youre behaving honorably even 
during the cold war they received governmental people with more 
understanding 
kunayev said between all the nationalities in the soviet 
union we have very tense relationships and the jewish question is 
not the most important one

the nations toughest penitentiary will be 
losing that distinction along with some of its most hardened 
criminals now that federal officials have decided to build a new 
prison in colorado 
the changeover is still more than 2 years away but it will 
mark the end of almost three decades in which us 
penitentiarymarion has served as the nations alcatraz housing 
inmates no other prison is equipped to handle guard killers 
escape artists and spies 
you dont get into marion by being a nice person said terry 
finnegan administrator at marion the nations only federal 
penitentiary rated as level six the highest level of security 
the federal bureau of prisons decided four months ago to build a 
complex at florence colo said jack crosley assistant warden at 
marion it will include a levelsix section with space for 500 
inmates and when it is finished marion will be remodeled and 
downgraded to a level five 
construction of the new prison hasnt begun but is expected to 
be finished in december 1992 it should be cheaper than modernizing 
marion which was built in 1963 crosley said the prison will be 
designed so that one guard can control the movements of prisoners 
in several cellblocks using electronic doors cameras and audio 
equipment 
even with its tight security marion has had to resort to 
locking most of its approximately 360 prisoners in their cells 23 
hours a day since october 1983 when two guards and one inmate were 
killed in a series of confrontations 
once the new prison is built marion prisoners wont be 
transferred en masse said john l clark who took over as marions 
warden in january 
it will happen in slow transition we will take one or two 
cell houses at a time so that the staff can get their feet on the 
ground said clark 
marions 230 guards have mixed feelings about losing their level 
six status clark said in a recent interview 
right now the staff are very proud of the unique role they 
play at the marion prison he said it will be a change it 
will take some adjustment 
colorado residents are undaunted by the prospect of living near 
the most violent federal criminals fremont county about 120 miles 
south of denver welcomed the complex with 130000 in incentives 
said county commission member bud chess 
the county already is home to seven state prisons chess said 
to the people here its just part of life when you move 
something like that into an area where the people havent been 
around prisoners they are all shook up chess said from his 
office in the county seat of canon city 
the 160 million florence prison complex will house 1960 
prisoners in security levels ranging from minimum to maximum said 
federal bureau of prisons spokesman scott burton in washington dc 
clark estimated that the new prison will have about 500 beds for 
level six inmates burton said it would require a total of 650 to 
750 staff members including an undetermined number of guards 
a decision is pending on whether some of the most infamous 
marion inmates including spies jonathan pollard and john walker 
jr colombian drug lord carlos lehder rivas and escape artist 
garrett brock trapnell will be among those transferred officials 
said 
those inmates are among seven who live in marions kunit 
reserved for the most notorious prisoners which one prison 
official said takes nearly an act of congress for visitors to 
gain access to 
when marion is changed to level five it will have enlarged 
recreation areas a central education area more classrooms and 
psychologists rooms and an expanded library clark said there 
are large parts of the institution that arent used much or arent 
used at all he said

west of pine bluff the felix brown family had to call on a 
friend with a rodeo background to rescue between 160 and 170 cattle 
stranded on an island 
the water surrounding the island ranged from 4 to 35 feet deep 
melvin brown said 
the only way they could manage to get the cattle onto boats was 
for friend danny murdock and some others with rodeo training to tie 
the animals feet together 
we toted about 40 calves in flatbottomed fishing boats across 
saturday because the water wasnt deep enough for a barge to get in 
there brown said we tied their feet and brought two at the 
time 
brown said the cattle were a little skittish and we had a few 
crazy ones but you always have that with cattle and water

traffic jams and landfills have come to 
mount everest the roof of the world 
a growing number of nature lovers and the flags clothes and

a long line of climbers snaked near everests peak thursday 
vying for elbow room on the top americans new zealanders swiss

one was the son of sir edmund hillary the first person to reach 
the summit hillary has expressed concern about damage to the

from the north side but the others hiked from the southeast 
taking the traditional route made famous by hillary the new 
zealander who first conquered everest with his nepalese guide 
tenzing norgay on may 29 1953 
fortunately thursdays climbers did not all reach the summit at 
once everests pointy peak has room for only about 10 hikers 
backpacks and oxygen gear included 
it has been one of the mountains busiest seasons 
a japanese team of three even tried to fly over everest in the 
first attempt to buzz the peak in a hot air balloon they crashed 
wednesday and one man suffered leg injuries 
in late april the nepalese tourist administration said more 
than 100 people were climbing the mountain from the nepalese side 
add to that a group of 30 climbers from a peace group of 
soviets chinese and americans who attacked the mountain from 
tibet 
this mountainous traffic jam raises questions about the effects 
such hikes have on the ecology of everest and the pristine 
himalayas the mountain range famed for its breathtaking views 
pure air and fertile valleys is being ravaged by deforestation 
population increases in the himalayan valleys have led farmers 
to cut down local forests for fuel and housing maneka gandhi 
indias minister of state for environment warns that deforestation 
will have disastrous results far beyond the highlands already it 
contributes to flooding in bangladesh and erosion in the indian 
plains 
everest itself has been turned into a dump in some places 
littered with mountaineers used oxygen tanks metal food 
containers flags and clothes climbers estimate that two tons of 
garbage despoil everests majestic flanks 
since this years season began the first to reach to peak were 
nepalese soldiers on april 24 five of 25 soldiers scaled 
everests heights then three assaults from the peace group 
expedition made it to the top 
among the pack thursday was hillarys 36yearold son peter he 
reached the summit at 730 am with two other members of an 
eightmember team from new zealand along with a nepalese sherpa 
guide 
even at that early hour which necessitated setting out from the 
26197foot high camp 4 an hour before midnight wednesday hillary 
still wasnt the first 
five americans had already arrived at the peak with two sherpas 
the climbers were peter george alhams 32 of snow bird utah dana 
quentin coffield 31 of columbia sc glenn porzak 41 of 
boulder colo michael browning 37 of monitou spring colo and 
brent manning 39 of salt lake city 
later in the day six climbers from the joint 
americanchinesesoviet team scaled everest bringing to 20 the 
number from the peace group to reach the summit 
two more teams were waiting in the wings three belgians turned 
back when the regulator of an oxygen cylinder burst 
only one expedition in the recent season set out with the 
express idea of cleaning the mountain the peace group will be 
filling up duffle bags to be buried in a landfill near the 
mountains base camp 
jim whittaker a top american mountaineer who is overseeing the 
international trip has focused attention on the garbage problem 
whittaker was the first american to climb everest in 1963 
edmund hillary has also spoken out against the destruction of 
the himalayan range in a news conference in march in new delhi 
hillary now 70 said tourist development has destroyed much of the 
beauty of the himalayas 
the living standards are increasing but the beautiful tracks 
and valleys have been littered and the forests destroyed he said 
indeed trekking traffic in the himalayas has skyrocketed in the 
past decade fueled by the desire by many westerners for exotic 
vacations 
the jam on everest also has increased since hillary first 
scaled its peak everest has been conquered about 240 times 
sometimes by the same person about 100 people have died making the 
attempt 
the going price for an expedition ranges from 50000 to 
300000 depending on its size each sherpa makes about 300 to 
500 per climb

poles once blamed the communists for 
shortages of everything from meat to gasoline but their newly won 
freedoms have produced a unique supply problem too few passports 
to meet the demand 
now that regulations have been loosened to allow poles to travel 
freely abroad there has been a rush to apply for passports which 
people can now keep at home 
this has resulted in a shortage of the passport documents 
themselves according to media reports 
a personnel shortage also has lengthened the waiting time for 
passports the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza reported this 
week sometimes the wait is even longer than it took to obtain a 
passport when the communists were still in power 
a meeting at the interior ministry on tuesday failed to solve 
the problem the document shortage is blamed on the state mint 
which prints passports the newspaper said 
while the holiday season is approaching the lack of passports 
continues the interior ministry did not promise any rapid 
improvement gazeta wyborcza said 
negotiations are under way with a swiss firm to produce the 
travel documents but the 22 million price tag may prove too high 
for the financially strapped government the newspaper said 
in one warsaw district the wait for a passport now exceeds two 
months and the situation is similar across poland gazeta wyborcza 
said 
the issuance of passports is to be transferred from the interior 
ministry which controls the police and security forces to the 
civil administration under reforms pending in parliament 
but that shift which will take three months from the time the 
law is enacted is not expected to solve the shortage the 
newspaper said 
after martial law was lifted in 1983 communist authorities 
gradually eased restrictions on travel abroad and in many cases 
poles were able to receive a passport within several weeks of 
filing their application 
in early 1989 the thencommunist government lifted a regulation 
requiring poles to surrender their passport to police after every 
trip abroad and then reapply for the document when they wanted to 
travel again 
instead poles were allowed to keep their passport at home and 
the document remained valid for an unlimited number of trips abroad 
for up to 10 years 
the solidarityled government which came to power in august 
has further eased travel regulations 
the biggest problem now for poles wanting to travel west is 
obtaining a visa poles face long lines and must undergo a careful 
screening process in order to obtain visas for such popular 
destinations as britain and the united states

oral roberts university has agreed to pay 
6 million in cash for the ptl satellite network once headed by jim 
and tammy faye bakker but the ministrys courtappointed trustee 
said thursday the deal is not final 
the trustee columbia attorney dennis shedd said he is still 
hoping to sell the network and other ptl assets as a package before 
the contract with oral roberts is approved by a us bankruptcy 
judge 
shedd said he signed the pact with the tulsa oklabased 
university founded by evangelist oral roberts because he wants to 
force action by buyers interested in acquiring the entire ptl 
complex 
he added however that he did not yet have such an offer 
although there are four or five groups that are seriously looking 
at the whole package shedd declined to identify them 
i do have a firm deal with oral roberts university however 
in the contract i expressly reserved the right to sell all the 
assets until the point of approval of the sale of just the 
network shedd said in a telephone interview 
the complex includes the satellite network the 500acre 
heritage usa christian retreat in fort mill and 1700 acres of 
undeveloped land in upstate south carolina 
shedd said he made the deal because i have a cash offer and i 
think it makes good business sense to sell this asset this asset 
is essentially deteriorating plus it also works into the 
broader scheme to sell the whole property 
shedd filed legal papers in columbia thursday asking us 
bankruptcy judge thurmond bishop to approve the sale to roberts on 
may 31 in effect the deadline for prospective bidders to submit 
offers for the entire package 
the actual contract signing which was done by fax machine and 
air express service between tulsa and columbia was completed 
wednesday and included a 1 million down payment 
i plan to sell it one way or the other and this is the only 
firm offer i have for any substantial part of the estate shedd 
said 
richard roberts son of the 72yearold faithhealer said 
university regents approved the offer this week 
we believe it is important to provide 24hour christian 
broadcasting to a global audience assuring that gods word will be 
taken to every mans world roberts said in a statement 
roberts told the tulsa world the agreement was reached about two 
weeks ago but that ministry officials needed seven days to raise 
the money for the down payment 
we were able to raise the 1 million from our regents and from 
several of our very dear prayer partners roberts told the 
newspaper 
the assets of the bakkers former religious broadcasting empire 
have been on the block since april 1988 a year after jim bakker 
resigned in a sexandmoney scandal 
bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising 158 
million from ptl contributors and is serving a 45year prison 
sentence in a federal prison in minnesota 
the heritage usa retreat has been shut since september when 
canadian businessman stephen mernick failed to close on his 
contract to buy the assets for 65 million 
the broadcast network however continues to operate with a 
skeleton staff of about 10 employees it broadcasts shows produced 
by other evangelists such as jerry falwell james robison and 
roberts son richard 
as for the networks future shedd told the charlotte nc 
observer my understanding is they want to operate it as a 
religious network 
the contract gives roberts all the networks satellite and cable 
leases and all of ptls television production equipment which will 
be moved to tulsa 
shedd said roberts has already given him a 1 million deposit 
which will be refunded if all ptls assets are sold as a package to 
another buyer 
the remaining 5 million is due in cash at the closing which is 
to come 10 days after federal communications commission approval 
transferring the broadcasting license the observer reported 
i think its a good price shedd said 
at the time ptl declared bankruptcy in june 1987 the satellite 
network was carried on 1300 cable systems that had 12 million 
subscribers 
according to court papers filed thursday that has slipped to 
800 systems with 64 million subscribers the observer reported 
besides ptl there are only four other religious satellite 
networks in the united states pat robertsons christian 
broadcasting network cbn the southern baptist conventions acts 
network paul crouchs trinity network and jimmy allens life tv 
other evangelists such as roberts buy time on those four 
networks

a joint usvietnamese team has 
excavated warplane crash sites in central vietnam to search for the 
remains of about 12 missing american airmen the official vietnam 
news agency reported 
the report dated thursday and seen in bangkok today did not 
say if anything was recovered from the search in quang tri and 
quang binh the 21day project ended thursday 
it was the 10th time vietnamese and us specialists have 
conducted joint field searches for remains of a total of about 
2300 american servicemen listed as missing in action or mia from 
the vietnam war 
the war ended 15 years ago in a communist north vietnamese 
victory over the usbacked south vietnam government and many 
vietnamese and american experts believe many of the remains will 
never be found 
the us government has said progress on the mia search will 
determine the pace of efforts to establish diplomatic relations 
between the united states and vietnam the major barrier is 
washingtons demand for a political settlement of the war in 
cambodia which vietnamese soldiers invaded in 1978

the tipoff was the story the other day that 
president bush is willing to halt production of us chemical 
weapons 
the president is aiming for an agreement with moscow provided 
he gets it on his terms to sharply reduce us and soviet 
stockpiles of poison gas 
but the reason bush is making the move now is that other arms 
control accords are proving to be elusive as the may 30june 3 
summit approaches 
and bush wants to be able to do some serious business with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to go along with five days of 
photo opportunities otherwise the two leaders could be accused of 
unproductive posturing 
months ago when the summit was scheduled it looked like an 
agreement could be ready to reduce longrange nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines 
only wild optimists expected a finished treaty for bush and 
gorbachev to sign the issues are complex besides any 
verification system to make sure there is no cheating requires an 
enormous amount of work and trust 
but considering the soviet leaders determination to cut nuclear 
arms and bushs positive response after an initial delay the plan 
was to celebrate the summit with a strategic arms 
agreementinprinciple on key issues 
bush and gorbachev would initial the framework accord and up to 
50 percent of the most dangerous weapons in the world would be 
consigned to the scrap heap after us and soviet negotiators in 
geneva worked out the details 
but with gorbachev due here in less than three weeks the two 
sides are still far apart 
for example they have agreed tentatively to eliminate 
landbased ballistic missiles with multiple warheads but the 
soviets want to extend the ban to such missiles carried by 
submarines that is an area of us strength and the 
administration is balking 
the soviets also want to make deeper cuts in airlaunched cruise 
missiles than the administration is willing to accept the reason 
is the pentagon plans a new missile above the cutoff range proposed 
by moscow 
negotiations between the north atlantic treaty organization and 
the warsaw pact have also slowed in vienna on another treaty to 
reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms in europe 
the plan was to have the heads of 35 countries including bush 
and gorbachev sign the treaty at a european summit before the end 
of the year there is still some hope of reaching that goal 
but bushs prediction last june that the treaty would be ready 
by now is falling flat so he and gorbachev are unable to announce 
that the major arms control accord is at the wrapup stage 
the picture could change when secretary of state james a baker 
iii holds talks in moscow next week with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze although they failed to make serious 
headway only last week in bonn 
thus a chemical weapons accord looms as the most promising 
candidate for the bushgorbachev summit though it is not a cinch 
either 
bush wants the soviets to agree that the two sides should retain 
small stockpiles of chemical weapons until all 40 nations sign and 
implement a global ban 
the soviets have resisted until now some two dozen nations are 
believed either to possess or be capable of manufacturing poison 
gas 
the soviet argument is that waiting for all 40 nations to carry 
out the treaty before scrapping the last us and soviet chemical 
weapons would indefinitely postpone ridding the world of poison gas 
still the presidents move this week probably is based on a 
judgment that enough is settled for him and gorbachev to assure the 
people of the world that in one dangerous arena there may be cause 
for hope and that the united states and the soviet union will lead 
the way

nato nations will have fewer nuclear weapons 
on their soil as a result of an alliance review of its future 
nuclear strategy needs defense secretary dick cheney predicts 
cheney speaking with reporters after a twoday nato meeting in 
western canada also left the door open for a unilateral alliance 
move to withdraw aged nuclear artillery shells from western europe 
its entirely possible cheney said it wouldnt be the 
first time its been done 
the defense secretary said the north atlantic treaty 
organization clearly is in the mood to pare its nuclear arsenal in 
light of the nearevaporation of the warsaw pact prospects for 
soviet troops withdrawals from eastern europe and eastwest 
agreements to slash conventional forces 
given those developments you can also take down nuclear 
forces cheney told reporters aboard his plane returning to 
washington 
we want to go to the lowest level of nuclear weapons we can 
we dont want any more nuclear weapons than necessary he 
said 
the meeting was the first alliance discussion of nuclear issues 
after president bush announced he had dropped plans to upgrade 
shortrange nuclear lance missiles and was scrapping a move to 
modernize nuclear artillery 
at the conference dutch and west german officials pressed for 
speedy unilateral elimination of the 1600 nucleartipped 
artillery shells the weapons are designed to be used within a 
10to 20mile range to halt an overwhelming advance of warsaw pact 
troops 
britain expressed reservations about the idea and called for 
holding onto some shortrange landbased nuclear weapons 
but the united states did not object to the dutch and german 
proposal which was supported by other ministers leaving it for 
further study under a lengthy review of nato nuclear strategy 
cheney said the comprehensive review of natos nuclear force 
structure wouldnt be anywhere near completed by the time alliance 
leaders gather for a summit in london july 56 
he said the review is going to take a long time but believed 
it would result in an overall reduction in nuclear weapons 
were likely to see fewer nuclear weapons in europe than in 
the past he said 
cheney appeared upbeat about the results of his third nato 
nuclear planning group session which was held at the snowy 
kananaskis ski resort at the foot of the canadian rockies 
fourteen of the alliances 16 defense ministers including an 
observer from iceland ended the session with a statement that 
there is a diminishing need for shortrange nuclear systems in 
the alliance arsenal amid the changing security situation in europe 
the ministers left to a future series of nato sessions decisions 
on what kind of cuts might be made in those shortrange nuclear 
systems and how deep they might go 
cheney stressed that some us nuclear weapons must remain in 
europe as a fundamental deterrent and as a means of avoiding war 
conventional forces alone wont prevent an outbreak of war he 
argued 
he described as very very shaky thinking the view that 
europe can rid itself of nuclear weapons when nato and the warsaw 
pact reach parity in conventional forces 
everybody wants to operate as though the future is here 
today he said repeating his oftstated warning that although 
changes in soviet military posture in europe have begun they are 
by no means complete 
the shortrange forces under discussion have come to prominence 
in light of the ussoviet treaty eliminating intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles which had a range of more than 300 miles 
the alliance in its statement acknowledged that the decision 
to cut back on shorterrange weapons places more emphasis on 
airlaunched nuclear missiles which also must be upgraded in the 
coming decade 
but nato members made no decision on the weapons studiously 
avoiding entering any kind of debate such as the one that split the 
alliance over the upgrade of the lance systems 
the lance was deemed irrelevant in light of prospects for german 
unification given that it was designed for use against east 
germany and czechoslovakia 
the upgraded lance could reach into the soviet union and some 
in west germany opposed adding a more powerful weapon to their 
stockpile amid lessening tensions

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan is 
outlining ideas for overhauling the bank deposit insurance system 
but is stopping well short of advocating a substantial cutback in 
the 56yearold program 
in his first extensive remarks on the subject greenspan on 
thursday suggested 
varying insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a 
banks investments 
examining banks books more frequently 
seizing weak banks faster 
requiring bank owners to risk more of their own money 
federal deposit insurance began in 1934 after the nation 
suffered an unprecedented wave of bank runs and failures during the 
depression however it has been blamed for skewing incentives in 
the financial system and helping create the savings and loan crisis 
all banks now pay the same deposit insurance premium current 
law in most cases bars the takeover of banks until they officially 
are insolvent but by that time losses to the federal deposit 
insurance fund sometimes are steep 
greenspan in a speech in chicago did not address proposals on 
cutting back 100000 per account insurance limiting insurance to 
one account imposing deductibles on insurance or finding a way 
to let large banks fail without endangering the system 
he is proceeding gingerly but in the chairman are the 
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system 
said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america which represents 
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes 
the treasury department is due to release its banking reform 
plan by next february greenspan is expected to be a major 
influence in its development and in congressional debate on the 
issue next year 
the treasury study at greenspans insistence was required by 
last years legislation on bailing out the nations troubled 
savings and loans 
greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply abolishing 
deposit insurance and other safeguards which some freemarket 
conservatives advocate 
the united states has not suffered a financial panic or 
systemic bank run in the last 50 years in large part this reflects 
the safety net he said 
but protection comes at a cost he said the threepart safety 
net poses a moral hazard for bankers by allowing them to shift 
some of the risks of their actions onto the public 
the three areas are deposit insurance the ability of banks to 
borrow at low rates in emergencies from the feds discount window 
and banks access the feds electronic payments wire which 
guarantees payments between banks 
reform of the safety net should be considered in tandem with 
permitting banks to expand into securities and insurance greenspan 
said 
offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial 
banking to shrink shifting money to unprotected parts of the 
financial system that in turn may create systemic risk similar 
to that faced in earlier years he said 
some have advocated strict fire walls separating new 
activities from an insured bank but greenspan said that 
undercuts the reason for granting any additional powers to 
banking organizations in the first place 
instead we should probably develop additional 
marketsimulating ways of limiting moral hazard he said 
we might also consider the desirability of returning to 
capital requirements that more closely simulate those that the 
market dictated in a world without a safety net he said 
bank owners currently risk about six cents of every dollar they 
lend greenspan noted that in the 1800s before the creation of 
deposit insurance and the discount window bankers risked 25 cents 
to 50 cents for every dollar loaned that encouraged them to use 
more caution he said

the coordinator of the governments war on 
drugs says he will not change strategy despite a senate study that 
sets the number of hardcore cocaine addicts in the united states 
at 22 million more than double the administrations estimate 
national drug policy director william j bennett angrily 
rejected suggestions by a senate committee chairman thursday that 
the administrations focus on discouraging casual use of cocaine 
should be changed to give more attention to hardcore addicts 
the addiction statistics in the judiciary committee report 
contrast with an estimate by the governments national institute of 
drug abuse that there are 862000 hardcore addicts defined as 
individuals who use cocaine at least once a week 
the report and the criticism by committee chairman joseph r 
biden jr ddel touched off a day of feuding between biden and 
bennett who said the senator was seeking ammunition for 
congressional election campaigns this fall 
this is ridiculous bennett said in a telephone interview 
what official estimate is he talking about there is no official 
estimate in the national drug control strategy we use a number 
larger than the one he is using we use 4 million drug addicts 
i think i know why he is doing it though bennett added 
what is it now may its not that long until november its that 
time of year the political time of year 
the feud resumed thursday night when biden and bennett met on 
the macneillehrer newshour on the public broadcasting system 
bennett told biden sharply that you are trying to discredit 
our policy and we think this is just a bit disingenuous 
i dont like this rhetoric bill biden shot back i dont 
like these cheap shots about being disingenuous 
while bennett clung to the national drug strategys figure of 4 
million addicts biden pointed out that it referred to users of all 
kinds of drugs not just cocaine bennett retorted that most 
addicts abuse more than one drug both men conceded however that 
there was no way of getting a perfectly accurate count 
dr edgar adams of the national institute of drug abuse told 
reporters at bidens news conference that the senate report was a 
good attempt to look at what was a very complex problem 
he praised the report because it restates the fact that drug 
abuse is a very serious problem but he said there was a 95 
percent confidence level for the institutes smaller estimate and 
cautioned it might be hard to arrive at anything similar for the 
senate version 
the senate report put the number of hardcore addicts nationwide 
at 2159000 and said nearly one in every 100 americans is a weekly 
cocaine user 
some areas of the united states have extraordinarily high 
concentrations of addicts according to the report it said one 
out of every 40 individuals in new york state uses cocaine at least 
once a week 
the nations capital had the highest per capita rate 329 
hardcore users among every 1000 washington dc residents the 
report said 
the report was prepared under the supervision of mark ar 
kleiman of the kennedy school of government at harvard university 
biden said the results of the survey were tragic and urged a 
3 billion drugfighting plan ranging from research and development 
of new treatments to doubling law enforcement grants to 900 
million 
our consciences demand that we act our pocketbooks command 
that we do so and our safety demands that it be done immediately 
biden said 
the report said only one out of 10 hardcore addicts receives 
drug treatment and that most who are arrested quickly return to the 
streets 
the report estimated that new york state had the most hardcore 
addicts 434000 followed by california 325000 texas 144000 
illinois 142000 and florida 93000

president alfredo cristiani 
says us lawmakers are interfering with salvadoran justice by 
saying the investigation into the killings of six jesuit priests 
has ground to a halt 
a panel of house democrats headed by joe moakley of 
massachusetts reported april 30 that the investigation into the 
jesuit killings had reached a virtual standstill 
cristiani said thursday that a us congressional report 
gathered up speculations and sometimes tries to present them as 
facts and this makes things difficult because it obstructs the 
judicial process 
the american congressmen can say it bogged down but the truth 
is that it did not bog down the case continues to be worked on 
cristiani said 
the house report based on an investigation that lasted months 
and included a visit to el salvador said authorities were making 
little effort to determine if senior officers ordered the crime or 
covered it up 
the six jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter were shot to 
death by uniformed soldiers on the night of nov 16 at their home 
on the central american university campus in san salvador 
the assassinations took place in the middle of a monthlong 
offensive by leftist rebels and the area was under military 
control with a dusktodawn curfew 
col guillermo benavides three lieutenants and four soldiers 
have been arrested and charged with murdering the eight people a 
ninth soldier a private is a fugitive 
cristiani spoke shortly after col inocento montano deputy 
minister of public security told reporters he thought benavides 
was innocent 
pretrial testimony showed the soldiers left the military school 
which benavides directed at the time on the night of the murders 
four cadets who were on guard duty at the time were summoned 
twice by judge ricardo zamora to testify but failed to appear 
three were sent on a study mission to fort benning ga and the 
fourth to panama 
us officials thursday said the three cadets at fort bennings 
school of the americas where many of el salvadors thirdyear 
cadets receive training were sent back to san salvador 
the schools commandant col william depalo jr said the three 
were sent home wednesday to testify in the case 
the army said the guard logbook at the salvadoran military 
school disappeared and benavides said he never kept a personal 
diary that soldiers of his rank are supposed to keep 
zamora said tuesday two other officers summoned to testify have 
also not appeared 
the only evidence against benavides is testimony from other 
suspects and under salvadoran law such testimony is not valid 
zamora has said there may not be enough evidence to send the case 
to a jury 
at least one retired officer said publicly benavides acted under 
orders from high officials to assassinate the jesuits 
progovernment newspapers had accused the jesuits of being leftist 
sympathizers 
more than 72000 people have been killed since leftist 
guerrillas launched their insurgency a decade ago most of the 
victims were civilians suspected of leftwing sympathies slain by 
rightist death squads with links to the military

a microbe that is a common contaminant in 
laboratories may be an infectious agent that contributes to the 
lethal effects of the aids virus 
the organism called mycoplasma was discovered four years ago 
by shyhching lo but is only now being considered seriously by 
aids investigators according to an article published today in the 
journal science 
lo a virologist at the armed forces institute of pathology 
here said in a telephone interview that his work was ignored until 
he presented his work last december and march at special workshops 
some of the worlds leading experts on mycoplasmas attended the 
workshops and at least four labs now are trying to confirm los 
work 
lo reported that in five years of study he has isolated a 
specific mycoplasma from the heart kidneys brain spleen and 
liver of aids patients he said the microbe which he calls 
mycoplasma incognitus is a new species that may also be able to 
independently cause disease 
dr john bartlett of johns hopkins university who sponsored lo 
at the march workshop said the findings are intriguing but 
that the research needs to be verified in other laboratories before 
it can be accepted widely 
whenever a researcher finds mycoplasmas the medical community 
tends to be skeptical said bartlett mycoplasmas frequently are 
found as contaminants in microbiological experiments he said 
im not convinced it is a cause of disease but it needs 
further study bartlett said of los study other researchers 
agreed 
lo first reported discovery of his mycoplasma in 1986 but the 
findings met with ridicule in the research community lo now 
acknowledges there was reason for skepticism the data were not 
very conclusive he said 
lo continued to work however and last year the american 
journal of tropical medicine published his first paper on 
mycoplasmas it captured new interest he said 
when we presented this work before it wasnt understood 
said lo now they have started a lot of work looking into it 
the findings were strong enough for the governments national 
institute of allergies and infectious diseases to convene a 
workshop last december in san antonio and allow lo to present his 
studies to some of the nations top microbiologists 
dr joel b baseman a microbiologist at the university of texas 
health science center in san antonio and chairman of the december 
workshop said los studies stood up to close scrutiny from experts 
in the field he said many went away convinced that lo had found 
enough evidence of a new infectious agent that further study was 
justified 
but just what role if any the mycoplasma plays in aids is not 
known 
its not absolutely clear what it is doing in aidsrelated 
disease but it appears to be present in many cases and seems to 
the sole source of pathology in specific tissues said baseman 
the evidence is reasonable 
science the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science reported that luc montagnier a prominent 
french researcher and the codiscoverer of the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv believed to cause aids also has 
studied a mycoplasma in aids patients 
montagnier has speculated that a mycoplasma is an aids virus 
cofactor which means it works with hiv to cause disease 
a mycoplasma is neither a virus or a bacteria it has no cell 
wall but it contains genetic material and reproduces by division 
as does bacteria mycoplasmas have been associated with some rare 
types of pneumonia and have been isolated in the genital tract of 
healthy men and women 
baseman said lo in his workshop presentation showed that 
although the mycoplasma may play a role in aids it may be a lethal 
infection agent all by itself he said lo isolated the mycoplasma 
in six patients who tested negative for the aids virus but who 
died from unspecified causes within seven weeks of becoming ill 
four silvered leaf monkeys also died of unspecified disease 
within nine months of being injected with the mycoplasma science 
reported

prosecutors seeking six new drug charges 
against mayor marion barry hope to show a pattern of drug use by 
the mayor sources familiar with the case say 
the new charges returned thursday include five counts of 
misdemeanor cocaine possession and a misdemeanor charge of 
conspiracy to possess cocaine they were added to an eightcount 
indictment including three felony perjury counts filed against 
the mayor in february 
the updated indictment alleges that barry possessed cocaine 
and crack with other coconspirators at more than 20 locations 
including private residences hotels government offices and 
business establishments and on boats 
the charges are intended to establish a pattern a practice of 
illegal activity that ranges over a period of years said a law 
enforcement source familiar with the case 
prosecutors have worried privately that r kenneth mundy 
barrys attorney might suggest in court that the mayor was 
unfairly lured into drug use on jan 18 the night of his arrest in 
an fbi sting operation sources said 
in order to battle that possible entrapment defense 
investigators have sought to portray barry as a regular drug user 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
these new charges certainly suggest that he barry has done 
drugs on an awful lot of occasions over the past five or six 
years said one source was he an occasional or experimental 
user these charges suggest otherwise 
the new charges allege that barry conspired to possess cocaine 
and possessed the drug on numerous occasions between the fall of 
1984 and his arrest in january 
following the arrest barry spent seven weeks in rehabilitation 
facilities in florida and south carolina for treatment of what he 
said was alcohol and prescription drug abuse 
barry has pleaded innocent to the crimes with which he was 
charged in february herbert o reid sr the citys corporation 
counsel predicted the mayor will plead innocent to the new 
indictment as well 
one new charge says barry possessed cocaine on sept 7 1988 
two days after returning from a secret vacation at a health spa in 
the catskills mountains of new york state 
aides said later that the mayor was receiving dietary counseling 
and a variety of health treatments designed to help him lose weight 
and reduce his stress level 
in a statement us attorney jay b stephens spoke of the barry 
investigation as ongoing and a source familiar with the effort 
said the grand jury will continue hearing evidence 
barry refused to comment on his legal status but said his new 
troubles with the law will not affect his ability to govern 
im not looking for votes he said during an appearance at a 
senior citizens center im just being an elected official 
trying to do my job and trying to make sure the government goes to 
the people 
mundy barrys attorney complained that the charges should not 
have been lodged so close to the june 4 scheduled start of the 
mayors trial but he predicted that the trial would not be 
postponed 
barrys mayoral term ends this year and he has not yet said 
whether he will seek reelection to a fourth fouryear term 
however he has been touring the city and speaking to a wide array 
of community groups in campaignstyle appearances 
if convicted of a felony he would be barred from holding office 
or running for reelection once appeals were exhausted

farmers are headed for a whopper of a wheat 
harvest this year perhaps enough to boost the nations depleted 
stockpile of bread grain by 70 percent or more 
the bright outlook is based on the agriculture departments 
forecast thursday for winter wheat which accounts for 
threefourths of the us total 
as of may 1 surveys showed that 1990 winter wheat production 
could be a nineyear high of 209 billion bushels up 44 percent 
from last years harvest of 145 billion bushels 
average yields were forecast at 411 bushels per acre compared 
with 351 bushels last year 
in kansas for example winter wheat production was estimated at 
4602 million bushels more than double the shriveled 1989 harvest 
of 2136 million bushels both the acreage and average yield were 
up 
overall farmers are expected to have about 508 million acres 
of winter wheat for harvest this year up 23 percent from 415 
million in 1989 the report said 
winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested the next year 
accounts for about threefourths of the us total wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers said the larger harvest will put us 
in a stockbuilding mode for some time in the future at least 
until something can be done about worldwide capacity for producing 
too much grain 
schwensen said the united states has made a real 
accomplishment by putting millions of acres of marginal land in 
the conservation reserve program which takes it out of crop 
production for 10 years he said about 11 million acres of that 
land has come from nations wheat base 
no other major producing and exporting nation has even 
attempted to take the initiatives that weve had to set aside 
marginal lands specifically from wheat production schwensen said 
in a telephone interview 
in the early and mid1980s us wheat surpluses grew rapidly 
rising to a peak carryover of 19 billion bushels on june 1 1985 
schwensen said he doesnt see that happening again soon but 
we are going to be getting up to a billion bushels i would 
think over the next couple of seasons 
ideally he said the association would like to see yearend 
us wheat stockpiles maintained at around 800 million bushels 
although some others including usda experts say a billion bushels 
would be all right 
however schwensen said much depends on how the soviet union and 
china continue to perform as wheat markets and on the way the us 
export subsidy program shapes up in the 1990 farm bill 
the usdas first official estimate of 1990 production of all 
wheat will be issued july 12 with the first estimates for corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops scheduled for 
aug 9 along with revised figures for wheat 
although no official estimates based on field surveys were 
included except for winter wheat department analysts in a related 
supplyanddemand report did project highly tentative 1990 
production of all wheat at more than 269 billion bushels up from 
less than 204 billion last year 
projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on 
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather 
the remainder of the growing season 
the 1990 corn harvest was projected at 81 billion bushels up 
from 753 billion harvested last year soybean production was 
projected at 1925 billion bushels virtually the same as the crop 
of 1927 billion bushels in 1989 
according to the supplyanddemand report the us wheat 
stockpile will be drained to a 15year low of 442 million bushels 
june 1 the beginning of the new wheat marketing year 
but with the expected larger 1990 harvest the wheat stockpile 
could be rebuilt to about 765 million bushels a year from now that 
would be close to the 800 million bushels schwensen and the wheat 
growers say is desirable 
the projected larger 1990 wheat harvest could put pressure on 
market prices which were indicated in the range of 290 to 330 
per bushel in 199091 compared with an estimated 371 this season 
if corn production turns out at the projected level of 81 
billion bushels it still wouldnt be quite enough to match 
domestic and export demand the report showed thus the us corn 
stockpile which may be around 133 billion bushels next fall 
could edge lower by oct 1 1991 
corn prices were projected at 225 to 265 per bushel in 
199091 compared with the current seasons forecast of 230 to 
240 per bushel 
looking at the global situation the analysis said prelminary 
indications point to larger crops in a number of countries and 
continued growth in use world wheat production is expected to be 
record large in 199091 the report said

design flaws in the armys advanced transport 
helicopter forced at least one pilot to take the unusual step of 
flying the aircraft just 600 feet above the ground 
the pilot figured he would have a better chance of landing 
safely if anything went wrong with the helicopter say 
congressional investigators 
members of the general accounting office working for a house 
panel told lawmakers thursday that the army has been unable to 
overcome persistent safety problems with the helicopter that killed 
15 soldiers in two accidents 
investigators said the ch47d chinook helicopter experienced 
failures with its transmission cooling fans flightcontrol rods 
that burned and cracked cross shafts 
we recommend that the army be required to report to congress 
on progress in fixing current problems on the ch47d they said 
funding for additional aircraft purchases should be contingent on 
the army presenting convincing evidence that aircraft problems have 
been resolved 
the army plans to buy 472 of the helicopters produced by boeing 
vertol of philadelphia and avcolycoming of stratford conn 
pentagon plans call for buying the last 144 helicopters at a cost 
of about 900 million 
investigators who visited five of the seven army sites where 
the helicopters are used said widespread mechanical problems have 
forced the service to ground the aircraft nine times 
army officials disputed the conclusions of the yearlong inquiry 
by investigators into the 64 million helicopter 
the ch47d is the safest cargo helicopter in the united states 
inventory maj gen donald williamson head of the army 
aviations systems command told the panel 
but rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations questioned 
the armys actions 
there is simply no justification for putting our soldiers at 
avoidable risk because of mechanically deficient aircraft 
dingell said 
a 1988 accident in chico texas that killed 10 soldiers and 
injured eight others was blamed on a cooling fan transmission that 
came apart investigators said the fan sometimes shatters when the 
aircraft vibrates too much spewing debris that damages the 
transmission 
investigators also testified it took the army 18 years to 
replace the helicopters aluminum flightcontrol rods which are 
susceptible to burning with fireresistant steel rods 
during that time the army tried to prevent the rods from 
burning by treating them with a fireresistant paint and wrapping 
them in firesleeves investigators said 
a helicopter that crashed in honduras in december 1988 killing 
five soldiers was one of 73 aircraft whose control rods had not 
been treated with the paint 
while development testing and production f steel rods was 
under way silicone fire sleeves were installed as an interim 
measure to afford protection all aircraft were retrofitted with 
steel rods by september 1989 said williamson

congressional analysts say a greater reliance 
on military reserves could save the united states 43 billion over 
several years by cutting active duty forces 
changes in threats to us security coupled with downward 
pressure on the defense budget suggest that the reserves may take 
on even greater importance robert reischauer director of the 
congressional budget office told a senate panel thursday 
under the proposed scenario active duty armed forces would be 
cut by 463000 down to 16 million the reduction would increase 
the share of the reserves in the total force from 36 percent to 42 
percent 
analysts presented their findings at a senate armed services 
committee hearing on increased use of the reserves at a time when 
the soviet threat to the west has diminished and constraints on the 
budget has grown 
in this period of increased warning time and fiscal austerity 
i think we have to conduct a fundamental reexamination of the use 
of the reserves in all of the military services said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the panel 
president bushs defense budget for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 calls for 303 billion for the military a total that has 
come under attack in congress as too high 
the cbo director told the panel more than 43 billion could be 
saved over five to seven years by cutting the active duty forces 
and maintaining the current level of reserves 
according to the cbo 12 million people serve in the selected 
reserves which includes personnel who have been on active duty and 
train parttime another 524000 people belong to the individual 
ready reserve many of whom have completed active duty service but 
do not train in peacetime 
the cbo director also proposed new approaches that included 
nested ships in the navy stored aircraft in the air force or 
cadre units for the army 
nesting would involve stationing four or five ships together 
including one mother ship 
except for the mother ship all the vessels would be in a 
stored status they might go to sea for training but would not be 
deployed overseas in peacetime reischauer said 
the air force according to the cbo could store its aircraft at 
davis monthan air force base in arizona where it would be 
maintained in nonoperating status 
the army could adopt a cadre system in which each army division 
would retain on active duty about 3000 noncommissioned officers 
and senior officers in the event of war reserves who have been 
off active duty for fewer than 18 months could be called up 
the system is similar to that employed in west germany

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
meet in moscow next week with egyptian president hosni mubarak but 
plans no new strategy for opening negotiations between israel and 
palestinian arabs us officials say 
bakers main purpose for going to moscow is to hold talks with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on the may 30june 3 
superpower summit meeting in washington 
however mubarak will be in the soviet capital as well giving 
baker a chance to discuss the middle east situation with the 
egyptian leader the officials said thursday 
bakers plan for israelipalestinian talks is on hold while 
israel tries to form a new government prime minister yitzhak 
shamir declined to endorse the plan because it provides for 
palestinians expelled from the west bank and former residents of 
jerusalem to participate in the negotiations 
still us officials who insisted on anonymity said baker 
intends to try again after a new government takes over in jerusalem 
mubarak has served as a middleman between the united states and 
the palestine liberation organization relaying plo demands and 
then advising washington what arafats group finds acceptable or 
objectionable 
arafat made a oneday visit to cairo last week to see mubarak 
the only arab leader whose country has signed a peace treaty with 
israel their meeting was believed to deal mainly with the plos 
call for an arab summit 
on thursday meanwhile the bush administration again criticized 
israel for settling soviet jews on the west bank and in gaza but 
said it was not conspiring with arab governments at the united 
nations to curtail immigration 
we want to see immigration take place and will oppose efforts 
by anyone to block it margaret d tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman said 
however the administration which is hotly opposed to the 
settlements did not promise to veto and thereby kill any 
resolution in the un security council aimed at israel 
and an israeli source insisting on anonymity said a resolution 
being prepared condemns settling soviet jews in jerusalem and 
upholds a right of expatriate arabs to return to israel 
we are very disturbed the source told the associated press 
moshe arad the israeli ambassador to washington conveyed the 
concern to robert kimmitt the under secretary for political 
affairs on tuesday at the state department 
then foreign minister moshe arens went public saying in 
jerusalem on thursday that he was troubled the united states was 
working with arab governments on a resolution 
for the time being the dispute has been sidetracked the 
security council postponed indefinitely its consideration of the 
resolution 
and the white house and state department tried to softpedal the 
settlements issue which has flared for several months 
were a member of the security council so quite obviously we 
would be a part of the deliberations and the discussions but we 
have not taken a position on that resolution or any specific 
resolution marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
israel is our close friend our strong ally our bilateral 
relationship is very strong as with any strong friendship there 
are differences of opinion on certain issues said state 
department spokeswoman tutwiler 
these can and should be managed in a mutually satisfactory 
fashion she said 
the bush administration insists that settling jews on the west 
bank and in gaza presents an obstacle to a negotiated settlement in 
the middle east 
only a small percentage of jewish immigrants from the soviet 
union have wound up in the territories surrendered by jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 sixday war 
the bush administration considers those settlements an obstacle 
to mideast negotiations since the arabs hope to recover the lands 
from israel 
additionally president bush objects to soviet jews living in 
east jerusalem which israel won in 1967 and made part of its 
capital city 
without referring directly to jerusalem or to its inclusion in 
the prospective resolution spokeswoman tutwiler said the 
government of israel is well aware of our concern that soviet jews 
not be encouraged to move into the territories 
therefore she said we find the foreign ministers comments a 
little confusing 
and yet the bush administration supports jewish emigration from 
the soviet union to israel and will keep pressing the soviet union 
to permit direct flights to tel aviv ms tutwiler said

opponents of a bill that guarantees workers up 
to three months of unpaid leave in family emergencies say theyre 
confident they can sustain a presidential veto of the measure 
passed by the house 
the 237187 vote thursday sent the family and medical leave bill 
to the senate where it faces a contentious and uncertain future 
alixe glen white house deputy press secretary called the vote 
close and said president bush remained firm in his opposition 
bushs aides and spokesmen have threatened a veto 
he fully supports and encourages flexible family leave 
policies by all employers but feels that should not be dictated by 
a washington mandate she said employers and employees know 
what works for them best 
one of the sponsors of the final version rep william clay 
dmo called the margin a landslide but the vote fell well 
short of what would be needed to override a presidential veto 
though the bill had the backing of the house democratic 
leadership 54 democrats sided with business groups that opposed 
the bill thirtynine republicans supported the bill 
the business community is very happy about this vote we got 
well over what we needed to sustain a veto said mary tavenner 
lobbyist for the national association of wholesalerdistributors 
the bill would require business and government employers to 
provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or 
leave for the care of a new child or ill child parent or spouse 
it exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave and restore a returning employee to his or her 
previous job or an equivalent position 
foes said the bill would be costly and burdensome for 
businesses ultimately hurting american competitiveness but 
supporters said nearly all industrialized nations already provide 
such minimum job security to workers many with provisions for full 
or partial pay 
in the senate a similar bill won a committee vote more than a 
year ago but its a divisive issue that could tie up the senate in 
protracted debate and democratic leaders have yet to schedule 
senate floor action 
the bill is the second dealing with family concerns the white 
house has threatened to veto this year after a childcare 
assistance bill now in conference committee 
democrats tried to contrast that record with bushs public 
support for family values the bills supporters hoped 
electionyear pressure would prompt the president to relent in his 
veto threat 
every piece of legislation that comes through here theres a 
threat of a veto clay said i dont know if the president is 
willing to veto all of these 
the bills chief republican sponsor rep marge roukema of new 
jersey said she hoped to persuade bush not to veto the bill 
i dont think the president or the republican party or the 
democratic party wants to go into an election year looking as 
though they are against working families roukema said

some congressmen challenging the 1990 farm 
bill say us agriculture policy gives too many subsidies to people 
who dont need them 
the bigger you are the more money you have the more money you 
are entitled to get rep barney frank dmass said thursday of 
the legislation that governs all farm programs 
frank is part of a coalition being organized by reps richard 
armey rtexas and charles schumer dny to oppose subsidies in 
the bill 
none of the coalition members is a member of the agriculture 
committee 
schumer acknowledged the members of group arent all interested 
in the same subsidy programs but said in general we have 
agreement that agriculture has gotten out of control 
rep claudine schneider rri said she opposed the wool 
subsidies and reps thomas downey dny and john porter rill 
spoke out against the sugar program 
others opposed the peanut program or any subsidy for farms with 
annual profits over 100000 
other congressmen at a press conference to introduce the 
coalition were reps bill frenzel rminn and dana rohrabacher 
rcalif 
armey said several other congressman were also part of the group 
hes gaining a lot of support with the major media 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas said 
recently of armeys efforts that will have some effect on the 
members 
de la garza has indicated however that plenty of support 
existed in the house for the bill the agriculture panel is writing 
frank called the multibillion dollar farm bill one of the 
last vestiges of the bad old days when differences were worked out 
by adding money to the budget 
attempts to cut the federal deficit are requiring tightening of 
the farm programs as well both senate and house agriculture 
committees are working with that in mind though the programs they 
have approved contain safeguards for farm income 
frank said the government should save its money and let the free 
market regulate agriculture 
since the great depression of the 1930s the federal government 
has enacted laws to regulate the food supply and assure farmers of 
certain prices for their crops every five years congress approves 
a farm bill that determines the way and degree in which tax dollars 
will be used to support farmers

the nations top aviation security official is 
being reassigned a few days before a presidential commission 
releases a report said to be critical of federal aviation 
administration security measures 
raymond salazars decision to become manager of the agencys 
center for management development in palm coast fla isnt linked 
to tuesdays scheduled release of the report by the aviation 
security and terrorism commission faa chief james busey said 
thursday 
we needed a good man for the job and weve got one busey 
said 
but relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland welcomed salazars 
departure as civil aviation security director they blame salazar 
for flaws in security before the dec 21 1988 bombing and for 
what they say are failures to improve some conditions since 
salazar has directed civil aviation security since 1986 
faa officials declined to comment on whether the reassignment 
had anything to do with criticism of salazar by victims relatives 
and members of congress including some on the commission 
salazar didnt immediately return a call seeking comment 
the sevenmember commission headed by former labor secretary 
ann mclaughlin will present its report on the flight 103 bombing 
and other aviation terrorism issues to president bush on tuesday 
the commission report will be pretty hard on the faa and 
will call for some reorganization including setting up a high 
visibility special security office according to a congressional 
source familiar with some of its recommendations the source spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
commission spokeswoman patricia moran said panel members have 
agreed not to reveal contents of the report until after they 
present it to the president and victims relatives 
paul hudson of albany ny who speaks for one group of flight 
103 relatives said the faa removal of salazar was long overdue 
hes totally tied to the blunders made prior to 103 hudson 
said his leadership clearly has not been effective in 
eliminating the security gap 
salazar appearing at the last commission hearing denied sworn 
testimony by pan am officials that he had given the airline a 
waiver of some security procedures at frankfurt west germany 
before the bombing flight 103 originated in frankfurt en route to 
london and new york 
faa spokesman fred farrar defended security operations under 
salazar saying the security offices budget has doubled since he 
took over with 519 million proposed for fiscal 1991 
the amount devoted to research and development of more 
sophisticated bomb detectors for airports has increased from 113 
million in 1986 to 25 million in the new budget farrar said 
salazar has been the target of tough grilling by members of 
congress at several hearings since the lockerbie bombing

procter amp gamble co pulled 1 million of 
advertising from a television station that had run ads saying 
coffee made by the company brews misery destruction and death 
in el salvador 
the 30second spots were bought by a group that advocates a 
boycott of folgers coffee because it includes salvadoran beans 
said sy yanoff president and general manager of whdhtv 
the group neighbor to neighbor paid 1000 for each of two 
spots on wednesday and thursday and the advertisements were 
cleared with the stations lawyers he said 
the ad met our commercial and goodtaste standards yanoff 
said thursday 
don tassone a spokesman for procter amp gamble said the spots 
disparaged folgers coffee its advocacy advertising and 
were surprised that any television station is willing to run that 
type of ad he said 
the boston globe said whdh was the only station in the country 
to run the ad which is narrated by actor ed asner a critic of 
us military aid to the salvadoran government 
if you want peace in el salvador tell congress to stop our 
massive military handouts and tell your supermarket that you refuse 
to buy folgers which uses coffee grown in el salvador boycott 
folgers coffee what it brews is misery destruction and death 
asner says in the ad 
its misleading and its grossly inaccurate tassone said 
this ad singles out folgers even though virtually every us 
brand contains some salvadoran coffee 
neighbor to neighbor says coffee income enriches wealthy 
salvadorans allied with the rightist salvadoran government it says 
it has targeted pampg for the boycott because the firm was less 
responsive on the issue than its competitors 
yanoff said procter amp gamble at first told him they would pull 
only their ads for folgers coffee but the station was told 
thursday the firm would pull all its advertising worth 70000 for 
june and about 1 million for the year

each day water from a small nearby lake 
edges closer to elaine cowards home once it reaches her driveway 
shes leaving 
theres nowhere for it to go but to head for the gulf said 
ms coward who hopes to avoid the expected flooding from waters 
rampaging down the trinity river but its got to run over us 
first 
the flooding has resulted from last weeks heavy rain that 
inundated north texas more than 200 miles away the waters are 
heading south down the trinity making their way into lake 
livingston and eventually the gulf of mexico 
but many communities sit in its path including the 
libertydayton area about 40 miles east of houston where 
residents have been told they may be hit with the worst flooding in 
80 years 
some dirt roads already are covered with water but the real 
flooding isnt expected until early next week 
already many residents threatened by flood waters have moved 
their belongings to higher ground and made plans to stay elsewhere 
at ms cowards home which she has owned for 12 years the 
furniture is up on blocks clothes important documents and 
mementos have been moved into a trailer where she will live 
temporarily if her home is flooded 
its hard to accept the fact that the water is going to come 
into your home she said thursday a mild sunny day in southeast 
texas its heartbreaking 
last july her home was flooded by heavy rains causing 7000 
worth of damage it took four months to repair the house 
now she keeps an eye on the water that has creeped to the edge 
of her yard once it reaches her driveway she said she knows it is 
time to take the dog and leave 
the potential flooding is the talk of this town of about 6000 
residents even though many are not expected to be hurt by the 
flooding 
if theyre not personally affected they have family or 
friends who are she said 
jim mitchum emergency management director for liberty county 
said thursday there already is flooding in some areas because of 
the large releases from livingston dam about 25 miles to the north 
exactly one year ago mitchum said his agency was dealing with 
flood victims after receiving 15 inches of rain 
hows that for an anniversary he said 
while a voluntary evacuation notice went to people in lowlying 
areas in liberty county others like george and brenda clark 
plan to stay and they were in town thursday stocking up on goods 
everybodys getting ready theyre not waiting like they did 
last time clark said 
the couple and their 7yearold son were stranded last year for 
two weeks when water flooded the nearby creek and covered the road 
to their home 
but were going to stay our house wont get flooded were on 
high ground he said were prepared this year

nearly 3 million federal employees and postal 
workers would be allowed for the first time in half a century to 
campaign actively for their favorite politicians under a bill 
passed by both the senate and house 
the two chambers still have to iron out differences in their 
versions of the bill before trying to muster votes for overriding a 
threatened veto by president bush 
the senates 54 democrats garnered support from 13 of the 45 
republicans to pass the legislation by a potentially 
vetooverriding 6730 vote thursday 
hopefully we can sustain a veto later said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas in bushs first 16 months in 
office congressional democrats have been unable in 10 attempts to 
override any of his vetoes 
bushs senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any 
change in the law as undermining the integrity and independence 
of the traditionally nonpartisan civil service 
gop leaders contended the bill is a pot of gold for the 
democratic party because federal employee and postal unions already 
contribute nine times more money to democrats than republicans 
through their political action committees 
the eight days of debate much of it focused on union pacs 
before thursdays final vote provided a preview to what is sure to 
be more rancorous battle as the senate takes up rival versions of 
campaign finance reform legislation today 
its ironical to me we have legislation before us to expand 
pacs to make possible for federal employees to dun other employees 
at the very time we will be considering campaign reform 
legislation to eliminate or at least reduce pacs said sen 
william v roth rdel 
outlawing pacs entirely while increasing the amount the 
individual contributors can donate for political causes is the 
centerpiece of the gop campaign finance proposal 
the bill approved thursday would overhaul the hatch act the law 
was passed in 1939 in response to evidence that enrollees in the 
works progress administration were being required by new deal 
political appointees to donate to the reelection campaign of 
thensen alben barkley dky 
the legislation was sought by federal employee and postal unions 
after the reagan administration filed hatch act charges against 
three union presidents for endorsing democrat walter mondale in the 
1984 presidential election the charges were later dismissed by a 
federal appeals court 
because a permanent and professional civil service is 
wellestablished now democrats contended most of the hatch act 
restrictions are no longer needed 
sen brock adams said federal workers now enjoy fewer political 
rights under an archaic curtain of silence than people do in 
the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
republicans however contend the legislation will return the 
civil and postal services to a spoils system in which workers 
will be subtly coerced to take up political causes 
the bill would still prohibit federal workers from engaging in 
political activities while on the job and from running for public 
office or soliciting campaign funds from the public 
but they could in their off time begin holding office in local 
state and national political organizations attend their 
conventions as delegates and solicit campaign funds fromcoworkers 
on behalf of candidates or federal employee union political action 
committees 
the house passed by a vetoproof 29790 vote a year ago a 
similar but broader bill that also would remove the prohibitions on 
running for office and soliciting campaign funds 
before the senate vote thursday republicans made a stab at 
trying to continue the current restrictions on employees of the 
irs intelligence agencies the justice department and the federal 
election commission 
certain critical agencies of this government need to be beyond 
political involvement and not have any taint of politics or 
coercion said sen pete v domenici rnm 
his amendment to exempt employees of those agencies from the 
looser restrictions on political involvement and forbid government 
workers from soliciting coworkers for campaign funds was defeated 
on a 5839 vote 
the senate however did adopt on a 970 vote an amendment by 
dole that would maintain the current restrictions on the 240 
employees of the federal election commission

aurora hinojosa casillas traveled more 
than 200 miles to chihuahua and although she knew she wouldnt get 
close to pope john paul ii she said just hearing him was enough 
she joined more than 100000 other people thursday on a dusty 
stretch of baseball fields to see the pilgrim pope 
for us it is the ultimate to come here said mrs hinojosa 
of ciudad juarez across the border from el paso texas since i 
was born ive been a catholic and its important he is closer to 
god 
the crowd sang hymns and chanted cheers as they awaited the 
pontiff but turned frantic when john pauls approach was broadcast 
playbyplay over loudspeakers 
hundreds clung to a wire fence separating them from the 
motorcade while the more agile scurried to keep up with the 
glassedenclosed popemobile 
i am so pleased that i got so close to him said brisa 
rivera 21 as she wiped away tears i got to see him one moment 
and no more but i feel wonderful this is a proud moment for 
chihuahua 
the crowd waved yellow and white banners and their arms as they 
sang the hymn hallelujah 
occasionally the crowd let out a cheer a la bim a la ba a 
la bim boom ba papa papa rah rah rah the pope is called 
el papa in spanish 
although many had brought blankets and lawn chairs the majority 
stood under the hot sun and many wore sun hats or straw cowboy hats 
in his halfhour homily the pope criticized the governments 
family planning program and advised fathers to become more involved 
in raising their children 
he gave advice that was very good for the family said 
miguel martinez in particular what he said about the husbands 
we need to listen to his advice because he is a very important 
person 
for many the trek to the papal celebration was a mothers day 
outing the holiday is celebrated on may 10 in mexico 
we have never had a mothers day as noble and beautiful as 
this said maria luisa lopez martinez 56 of durango who was 
with her mother and sister it is worth it to be here because we 
are awaiting the best person of the world its something we 
wouldnt do for anyone else 
adela cota de santiesteban said she left her home almost 900 
miles away in baja california on monday crossed the sea of cortez 
by ferry and arrived here wednesday her family enjoyed the popes 
message she said because it was about the mother of god and we

hillary pipkin has been farming all his 
life but at the moment all his wheat fields are good for is 
fishing 
as waters continue to surge down the arkansas red and trinity 
rivers in texas and arkansas agriculture is suffering the most 
im just hoping we can pay our debts and stay in farming 
pipkin said thursday cause theres not any profit to be made 
this year 
pipkin and his brother grow wheat cotton soybeans and rice on 
about 1000 acres in the community where they grew up a few miles 
north of pine bluff in central arkansas their land handed down by 
their father is divided by the arkansas river levee about 250 
acres on the river side of the levee are under water 
you can walk down there and catch a fish if you want to 
said pipkin pointing to a spot where water swallows the road that 
used to cut across his wheat field 
pipkin said about half of his 100acre winter wheat crop is 
destroyed 
its going to hurt the yield no doubt about that he said 
id say after this we might cut half a crop 
and his cotton might not be planted at all 
its going to hurt us bad pipkin said if we get in any 
cotton its not going to have time to make enough like it should 
officials are estimating that 450000 acres of wheat statewide 
have been damaged by the flooding which could amount to a 48 
million loss rough estimates indicate 25000 to 30000 head of 
cattle were stranded by high water and many are presumed drowned 
in a letter thursday to president bush gov bill clinton said 
initial official estimates of damage to private nonagricultural 
property total 65 million 
according to preliminary state figures flooding has damaged 251 
homes but that number will go up as the water recedes said gary 
talley spokesman for the arkansas office of emergency services 
the flooding was touched off by last weeks severe storms which 
were blamed for 13 deaths one in oklahoma and the others in texas 
in texas estimated damage to agricultural production stands at 
500 million to 700 million with millions more to houses and 
roads 
arkansas farmers have been attacking the us army corps of 
engineers saying it had mismanaged dams at lake texoma on the 
red river and lake eufala in oklahoma on the arkansas 
after meeting with farmers along the red river on wednesday 
clinton said he would talk with members of arkansas congressional 
delegation about the possibility of forming a task force to study 
the corps flood management 
so many of them down there felt rightly or wrongly that the 
corps could have made different decisions on over the last few 
months and there would be less flooding clinton said 
the corps rebutted complaints that its discharges from rising 
lakes was too much too late 
our projects operated as they were designed to we managed 
them just exactly as they were designed to operate ross adkins 
spokesman for the corps in tulsa okla said thursday 
what we do is capture all the water we can to minimize any 
damages downstream when mother nature dumps as much rain as we had 
they the reservoirs took off a heck of a big bump that could 
have gone downstream 
if we had not been here a lot more houses and perhaps lives 
would have been lost 
decisions by the corps on how fast to release water from the 
reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on who is flooded 
and how severely a quick release of water through the dams 
floodgates after a heavy rain increases flooding downstream while 
slower release can mean more flooding upstream if the reservoir 
fills up 
marilyn quayle vice president dan quayles wife visited 
flooded parts of dallas on wednesday and said the federal emergency 
management agency had added nine texas counties to 16 already named 
in a may 2 disaster declaration

the federal communications commission has 
reversed a reaganera rule and says it will again consider criminal 
records in evaluating broadcast license applicants 
the fcc in 1986 under thenchairman mark s fowler rewrote its 
characterpolicy rules to consider only felony convictions that 
appeared to have a direct link with an applicants ability to tell 
the truth and comply with commission rules 
also thursday the fcc dropped a proposal to allot broadcast 
licenses by lottery and formally opened an investigation into the 
charges home satellitedish owners must pay to receive network and 
superstation signals 
the characterpolicy revision had been called into question in 
1988 when the fcc renewed the license of williamsburg county 
broadcasting corp to operate wkspam in kingstree sc the 
companys principal owner gregory knop had been convicted of 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to five years in 
prison 
the station had told the commission that knop had a 
nonbroadcastrelated felony conviction and the fcc did not 
investigate further 
the 1986 revision said crimes that shock the conscience or 
misconduct which demonstrates the proclivity of an applicant to 
deal truthfully with the commission and to comply with our rules 
and policies were relevant to licenserenewal proceedings the 
revision did not say whether drug convictions fell into that 
category 
explaining thursdays change fcc chairman alfred sikes said 
that broadcasting pervades and influences our culture and i think 
we must have reasonable standards for holding a license 
under the latest change all felony convictions and some 
misdemeanors will be considered relevant in determining whether a 
party should possess a broadcast license 
the decision was one of several fcc actions designed to tighten 
licensing requirements 
fowler in 1982 legalized unlimited payoffs between competing 
applicants to build stations an action critics said drew a flood 
of nuisance applications from parties simply wanting to be paid off 
to withdraw 
on thursday the fcc proposed to restrict such payoffs perhaps 
to 50 percent of expenses after the licensing process reaches a 
newly proposed settlement conference stage 
the fcc said its action would discourage sham applicants 
the commission also dropped a proposal by fowlers reaganera 
successor dennis patrick to use lotteries to award radio and 
television station licenses 
opponents have said the selection of licensees should not be 
left to a roll of the dice and that such a system would throw open 
broadcasting to unqualified applicants who after gaining a 
license could sell it to the highest bidder 
the lottery proposal also would have ended the existing 
preference in the licensing procedure for applications filed by 
women members of minorities 
in opening the inquiry into prices home satellitedish owners 
pay to get the same signals available to cable television 
companies the commission was following up on its december finding 
of disturbing evidence that cable operators receive 
preferential treatment from satellite tv carriers 
the fcc cited assertions by the national rural 
telecommunications cooperative that some companies may be charging 
backyard dish owners 20 times more than cable tv systems for the 
same programs

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen friday 
while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange rose moderately 
the dollar closed at 15415 yen down 260 yen from thursdays 
close of 15675 yen it started trading at 15575 yen and ranged 
between 15390 and 15575 
on the stock market the 225share nikkei stock average gained 
53188 points or 172 percent to close at 3151214 the index 
gained 3465 points thursday 
dealers attributed the dollars plunge mainly to its overnight 
weakness against major european currencies especially the swiss 
franc 
the franc has been rising because of high swiss interest rates 
strong asian demand and the increasing tendency to view the franc 
as a safe haven currency they said 
the dollars weakness against european currencies is 
encouraging tokyo investors to sell the dollar and buy the yen 
said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co 
although there is demand for the dollar among trading houses 
the market is basically in a dollarselling mood he said 
kanai said the belief that the us economy is slowing also 
helped push the dollar down against other currencies a soft 
economy could allow us interest rates to ease weakening the 
attraction of holding dollars 
market participants were reassessing the situation following the 
dollars sudden plunge dealers said the dollar seemed to have a 
floor at about 15460 yen they said 
some market players remained on the sidelines awaiting the us 
governments release later friday of the us producer price index 
and retail sales figures for april 
the surge in the yen as well as in japanese government bonds 
helped stock prices but was not fully reflected in the nikkeis 
moderate rise traders said 
the equity market was surprisingly uninspired by the strength 
of the yen and bond markets said matthew a rifkin assistant 
vice president for equity trading at prudentialbache securities 
japan 
rifkin attributed the markets restrained reaction to big 
advances earlier in the week and reluctance to make major moves 
ahead of the weekend the market has moved pretty far already 
this week he said

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
and other top banking regulators blame a slowing economy and not 
overaggressive bank regulation for increased difficulties in 
getting credit 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke and l william 
seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp joined 
greenspan on thursday in meeting with the board of the american 
bankers association to allay fears about what they call 
misconceptions about tightening credit 
such a gathering is practically unheard of though all the 
regulators frequently meet bankers and other business executives 
separately 
the three asked to attend the associations board meeting to 
respond to charges that overregulation is making bank credit 
suddenly too difficult for real estate developers and other 
businesses to get 
we decided that it would be very useful for us to meet with 
our colleagues and increase communication greenspan said 
he dismissed talk of a credit crunch in the northeast or 
elsewhere saying the evidence of that is quite limited 
we need to turn down the rhetoric said clarke whose office 
has sent extra examiners to the northeast where real estate prices 
have been declining and several banks have heavy real estate 
portfolios 
it was an opportunity to get the point across to them that we 
believe that were doing the right thing clarke said we need 
the support of the industry in connection and need to try to 
clarify some of the misconceptions that may be out there about what 
were doing 
the association which represents banks holding 93 percent of 
the commercial banking assets in the country offered a subdued 
response compared with the criticism clarke and others have 
received from politicians 
the politicians complain that regulators are overreacting to the 
sampl scandals where many institutions were brought down by unsound 
real estate loans 
in a news conference following the hourlong meeting 
association officials discounted the severity of any tightening of 
credit 
the aba board told the regulators that thorough but balanced 
supervision is the best way to keep the commercial banking industry 
safe sound and competitive said aba president kelly holthus 
the board consists of presidents of banks ranging from 
international institutions to small state banks 
donald g ogilvie executive vice president of the association 
agreed that the credit slowdown has more to do with a general 
economic slowdown than with aggressive regulatory practices 
association officials however said it was true that some banks 
were cutting back their lending in response to tougher regulatory 
supervision 
a key message brought to the meeting by the regulators was that 
banks should continue to make sound loans

a defector says chinas communist party 
planned to browbeat about 100 exchange students in the united 
states considered ringleaders in criticizing the beijing 
government the washington post reported in todays editions 
xu lin a third secretary in the education section of the 
chinese embassy told the post that embassy officials were told to 
go to us college campuses to court sympathetic students and 
intimidate the others 
xu provided documents to support his claim the newspaper said 
todays editions of the new york times also carried an account 
of the documents 
to strike the ringleaders we should give them a bad name 
the post quoted one of the documents as saying now we must think 
of a name that has a resounding effect we cannot use the word 
dissident 
the documents classify the students under five headings ranging 
from loyal communists to the reactionary core elements who 
actively organize and plan antigovernment activities 
tactics to be used against the dissidents the documents 
suggested could include keeping files on them revoking passports 
cutting off government stipends firing them from their jobs back 
in china and isolating them from their families still at home 
president bush has signed an executive order promising that 
chinese students in the united states will not be forced to return 
home against their will 
more than 50000 governmentsponsored exchange students are 
studying in the united states and canada and the documents said 70 
percent to 80 percent of them would not return to china 
the state department says it is looking into allegations that 
students were harassed the post said 
a chinese embassy spokesman told the newspaper that the 
allegations in the documents were rumors

it looked like a breeze election when 
george e j carr and theresa b quincel ran unopposed for the 
county democratic central committee 
all they needed was one vote apiece but no one not even the 
candidates themselves wrote their names in and they both lost in 
tuesdays primary 
neither carr or ms quincel were disappointed 
carr a retired sheetmetal worker said a friend talked him 
into running for the job after no one filed nominating petitions 
carr 71 later had second thoughts 
i didnt really want the commitment he said i want to 
come and go as i please plus i have arthritis so i didnt even 
vote for myself 
ms quincel 36 said her political activity is limited to 
voting and called her candidacy an honest mistake she said someone 
in the party offered her a job similar to one held by her niece 
who she said is a precinct judge 
two weeks before the election i found out the job was as a 
committee member and by then it was too late to change she said 
the central committee will fill the vacancies by appointment

federal appeals court judge alex kozinski 
an avowed film buff couldnt resist using 204 movie titles in an 
antitrust decision 
in a 25page decision wednesday for the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals kozinski rejected a federal antitrust suit accusing 
theater operator raymond syufy of monopolizing the firstrun film 
market in las vegas 
by kozinskis account the trial lasted not eight days or nine 
but 8 as in the fellini film 
he wrote the middle initial of syufys lawyer maxwell blecher 
as m without a period the title of the 1931 fritz langpeter 
lorre classic 
syufy was somewhat of a local hero the judge wrote 
another chain stepped into the major leagues and against all 
odds began competing seriously the competitors theaters 
evolved from absolute beginners barely staying alive into a big 
business 
some of the titles were natural fits to the case kozinski wrote 
that antitrust law did not require rivals to finish in a dead 
heat as long as they were allowed to do their personal best 
he described bureaucrats who ostensibly saw the big picture and 
knew how to do the right thing 
others matches were more difficult he wrote that syufy entered 
the las vegas market with a splash that competitors saw their 
future as rocky and that a little big man might hold 
monopoly power

federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty 
for two men charged with murdering a drug case witness in what 
would be the first execution by the us government in 27 years 
we recognize the death penalty is an extreme sanction 
andrea l zopp one of the federal prosecutors handling the case 
said thursday we think it is appropriate in this case 
it would be the first use of a november 1988 federal law that 
allows the death penalty for murders committed to further drug 
conspiracies the socalled drug kingpin provisions sanction 
the death penalty for murders ordered by drug dealers as part of 
their business 
alexander cooper and anthony davis are charged with murdering a 
federal witness to protect their 50000aday drug ring davis is 
still at large 
in a statement us attorney general dick thornburgh said 
street level distribution networks such as the one alleged in 
this indictment cannot be effectively dismantled without the 
cooperation of citizenwitnesses 
when those witnesses are murdered because of their cooperation 
with law enforcement authorities congress has determined that this 
ultimate sanction should be available 
federal authorities are eager to show that theyre tough on 
drug crime but the law wont stop drug dealers from killing 
said henry schwarzschild director of the capital punishment 
project for the american civil liberties union 
they expect to get away with it they dont expect to get 
caught and if you expect to get away with it you dont care if 
the penalty is 40 years in prison or the electric chair he said 
in a telephone interview from new york 
were certainly not pleased with the federal government 
getting back into the business of death penalty cases and having a 
federal hangman again but its certainly not anything surprising 
and its not a great legal event said schwarzschild 
no civilian has been executed in a federal case since victor 
feuger was hanged at iowa state prison on march 15 1963 after 
being convicted on charges of kidnapping and murder schwarzschild 
said 
the provisions constitutionality is certain to face court 
challenges but schwarzschild said federal lawmakers were probably 
careful to make the law conform with guidelines set up by the us 
supreme court in the 1970s 
we think the statute is clearly constitutional and will pass 
constitutional muster zopp said 
older federal law has death penalty provisions for such crimes 
as treason assassination of the president and top federal 
officials and killings involving aircraft hijackings train 
wrecks kidnappings and bank robberies 
those statutes however were never amended to reflect changes 
in death penalty laws mandated by the us supreme court in 1972 
and are widely considered unconstitutional 
the 1988 law is the first new statute to take the supreme court 
guidelines into account legal experts said 
under military law provisions exist for capital punishment for 
violent crimes or spying but no member of the us military has 
been executed in peacetime since 1961 schwarzschild said 
cooper 29 and davis 39 had been named along with 20 others 
in two indictments issued oct 19 charging them with various 
federal drug charges 
federal authorities say cooper ran an extensive streetlevel 
operation from 1982 to 1989 that distributed up to six kilograms of 
heroin and two kilograms of cocaine a week 
cooper directed davis to kill an associate robert parker 
because parker was cooperating with police and giving federal 
authorities information about the drug operation the government 
said 
parker was shot in the head five times feb 6 
telephone calls to attorneys for cooper went unanswered thursday 
night 
the death penalty has withstood recent legal challenges in 
illinois which expects to execute a prisoner this year for the 
first time in 28 years thirteen other states have executed a total 
of 124 inmates since the supreme court allowed states to restore 
the death penalty in 1976

newsday is in an uproar again after a columnist 
defended fellow writer jimmy breslin suspended for slurring a 
koreanamerican reporter and in doing so used what one official 
claimed was an epithet for irishmen 
peter king comptroller of nassau county demanded that newsday 
reprimand columnist robert reno and order him to apologize for his 
article in thursdays paper 
king an outspoken supporter of irish nationalism accused reno 
of arrogant insensitivity if not outright antiirish racism 
and called him a man of unbounded ignorance and stupidity 
reno thursday tried to defend the pulitzer prizewinning 
columnist by writing breslin has a pathologically rotten temper 
for which all his greatness is no excuse on the other hand if he 
wasnt capable of such mindless offensive and imaginative rages 
hed just be another windy irishman 
the article ran in some editions with the headline a lions 
heart a donkeys head belong to breslin 
even in the rarefied offices of the newsday editors someone 
must be aware that donkey is a derogatory term long used against 
the irish king said he said the term means stupid and 
thickheaded 
apparently being antiirish is a prejudice or an ignorance 
which is still acceptable at newsday king said 
if donkey is a synonym for irishman thats a new one on me 
said reno adding he thought king was being foolish 
the breslin uproar began when reporter jiyeon yuh sent a 
computer message to breslin and the newspapers editor don forst 
in which she called a breslin colunm sexist 
breslin responded by calling yuh slanteyed and a yellow 
cur 
breslin was suspended without pay for two weeks on tuesday after 
he made light of the tirade

privatesector companies face increasingly 
stiff competition from a prison manufacturing program thats 
growing so rapidly it may soon become the equivalent of a fortune 
500 company lawmakers say 
rep howard coble rnc lobbied thursday for support of a 
bill to curb the preferential treatment accorded the federal prison 
system in selling products to government agencies 
at least i want the private companies to feel like theyre 
essentially playing under the same conditions as the prisons he 
said 
he said manufacturers in his district were hurt by the prison 
program which last year sold 361 million worth of products 
ranging from clothing to electronics furniture sales totaled 90 
million a 20 percent increase over 1988 
the program employed 13000 inmates and 1400 civilians 
the prison programs sales are expected to double by 1992 as the 
inmate population swells said rep fred upton rmich upon which 
it would rank as a fortune 500 company and likely dominate the 
federal market for furniture and many other products 
upton and rep paul henry rmich testified at a hearing of 
the house judiciary subcommittee on courts intellectual property 
and the administration of justice 
the panel is considering a bill under which prisons would have 
to compete on an equal footing with private companies once the 
prisons obtain a 10 percent share of the federal market for a 
product 
currently federal agencies must buy products from the prison 
system if it can meet the purchasers price and delivery 
requirements

recalling resuscitators with model numbers beginning with 90 91 
95 or 96 and ending with a 0 1 2 or 3 after the hyphen the fda 
said thursday 
the recalled models have lot numbers 9321 through 9361 and were 
made between nov 17 and dec 27 1989 
life designs systems has recalled other models of the

struggling to stay afloat the 
government imposed huge price increases and suspended a law 
protecting workers rights public employees retaliated by 
announcing a strike and an occupation of government offices 
the indefinite strike by a union federation of the governments 
60000 employees began in some offices late thursday a union 
leader said it would begin officially today 
the workers are demanding 200 percent raises to keep pace with 
inflation 
thursdays austerity measures came a day after antonio lacayo 
minister of the presidency announced that nicaragua was in 
bankruptcy and even more painful remedies had to be implemented 
in addition to the price hikes and suspension of the workers 
law president violeta barrios de chamorro devalued the nicaraguan 
cordoba 9 percent in relation to the dollar it was the second 
devaluation in two days and the fourth in three weeks 
water rates were doubled electricity rates tripled and 
telephone service hiked 1300 percent the government subsidy for 
public transportation was eliminated 
the cordoba traded at 180000 to the dollar on the parallel 
market thursday an official rate for most currency transactions 
the rate in january was 38150 
the chamorro government blames its leftist sandinista 
predecessors for the countrys economic situation the treasury was 
down to a bare 3 million when mrs chamorro took office last 
month officials of the new government say 
in a communique thursday government workers said they would 
protest the new governments actions with the immediate takeover 
of installations and the blocking of access to ministers and vice 
ministers of the government of mrs chamorro the communique was 
released by the general federation of state workers 
however lino areas a federation official said the strike 
could be postponed if the government negotiates 
unions are demanding that the government make a fair salary 
readjustment so that workers can acquire basic consumer products 
areas said 
laborers now earn an average of about 44 a month and 
whitecollar workers about 100 they have faced a series of 
devaluations and soaring prices both under the sandinistas and 
under mrs chamorro who took office april 25 
inflation after hitting 33600 percent in 1988 dropped to 
1800 percent in 1989 there are no reliable estimates for this 
year 
the workers rights law approved by the sandinista government 
less than three weeks after it lost feb 25 elections allows 
government employees to organize unions bargain collectively 
strike and exercise other rights 
thursdays decree suspends the law until the new government 
writes its own rules it also allows the labor ministry to review 
all labor contracts signed during the sandinistas lameduck period 
referring to suspension of the law the federation accused the 
government of preparing general conditions for the massive firing 
of state workers 
on the political front meanwhile contra rebels said they would 
stop a demobilization process begun tuesday when about 80 contras 
turned in their weapons to un troops 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo said in miami that the 
sandinista army had failed to pull back from the security zones 
where the rebels are gathered the pullback is called for in the 
demobilization agreement signed may 4 
the usbacked contras battled the sandinistas during a 9year 
war acevedo said more than 12000 contra fighters still hold arms 
but independent observers say contra forces have been reduced to a 
few thousand

scientists cured mice of a disease 
similar to multiple sclerosis and said their work could lead to 
successful treatment of the human disease although a cure for 
people is 10 or more years away 
the new method also might help scientists develop treatments for 
a variety of other human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid 
arthritis lupus and myasthenia gravis the california institute of 
technology announced thursday 
in autoimmune diseases the bodys immune system attacks the 
bodys own tissues instead of simply defending against 
diseasecausing foreign invaders 
in multiple sclerosis certain white blood cells called helper 
tcells attack the bodys nerve tissue causing paralysis muscle 
cramps and weakness slurred speech blurred vision fatigue 
difficulty in coordination dizziness and loss of balance 
about 250000 americans have multiple sclerosis 
scientists from caltech and washington university in st louis 
said they designed special antibodies called monoclonal 
antibodies to destroy the white blood cells that cause a disease 
in mice resembling human multiple sclerosis 
while we are quite excited about these results i think its 
important to emphasize at the outset that we have not developed a 
cure for human multiple sclerosis or any other human autoimmune 
disease said caltech biologist leroy e hood 
in my opinion our technique is at least 10 years away from 
human application hood said in a prepared statement adding that 
he wanted to avoid raising false hope in those who suffer from 
this debilitating and quite serious disease 
during the past decade other researchers showed monoclonal 
antibodies could to some extent reverse or prevent the mouse 
disease some even used mouse antibodies to treat human multiple 
sclerosis patients who displayed only slight improvement and 
developed allergic reactions to the foreign antibodies 
the method used by hoods laboratory involved designing 
antibodies aimed at the exact type of tcells that cause the mouse 
disease significantly boosting the proportion of mice in which the 
disease was prevented or reversed 
of five sick mice given the new treatment three showed complete 
reversal of paralysis within two to seven days and a fourths 
complete paralysis was reduced to slight paralysis of its tail the 
fifth mouse died five other mice were not given the treatment and 
their paralysis wasnt reversed 
related experiments in dozens of other mice showed the disease 
could be prevented if they were injected with the monoclonal 
antibodies before scientists tried to make them sick 
the study was conducted in hoods laboratory by research fellows 
dennis zaller and gamal osman and by osami kanagawa at washington 
university it will be published in next months issue of the 
journal of experimental medicine 
development of the new method certainly is significant said 
dr george ellison a professor of neurology at the university of 
california los angeles 
if a similar treatment can be developed for humans that would 
be a major achievement ellison said adding that he agreed with 
hood such therapy was years in the future 
to perform the experiments the scientists made mice sick with a 
disease called murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or 
eae which produces symptoms similar to human multiple sclerosis 
they did this by injecting the mice with a protein found in the 
sheaths that coat nerve cell fibers in the brain the rodents 
immune systems then produced helper tcells that attacked not only 
the injected protein but the protein in the rodents brains 
after studying the makeup of this type of tcell in great 
detail the scientists designed monoclonal antibodies that when 
injected into the sick mice found and destroyed the 
diseasecausing tcells while leaving intact tcells that protect 
the mice against other diseases 
hood said use of the technique on human autoimmune diseases is 
years away because they are much more complex than the mouse 
ailment also he said understanding of human tcells is far less 
advanced than the understanding of such cells in mice

even his fellow comedians say theres something 
a little dicey about andrew dice clay whose shtick prompted a 
saturday night live cast member and musical guest to boycott 
this weekends show 
is this an attitude dice man or what 
peewee herman in a leather jacket he aint dice is an xrated 
fonzie the archetypal corner wiseguy a lewd sexist makeout 
artist whose kindest term for a woman is broad 
dices comedy is deep deep blue he evokes body fluids 
orifices and how they get together on bad dates his critics say 
his jokes are at best crude and at worst angry sexually violent 
homophobic and bigoted 
last year mtv banned clay for life after he delivered a 
monologue laced with lewd poetry and references to fat women and 
sex during the networks awards show 
clay and his defenders say the comedian is only acting dice 
that his humor mocks the dice mans attitudes and has enough truth 
in it to attract an audience of men and women who love him 
i talk about what people do think or say behind closed 
doors clay told playboy magazine in a january interview as i 
tell the crowds i dont write this material you write it for 
me 
i dont buy it said richard belzer a comedian whos taken 
his share of flak as well as praise for his handling of adult 
themes 
i dont mean to sound pretentious but we do have a 
responsibility as comedians especially if we deal in inflammatory 
subjects he said 
there are people that do jokes gaybashing and 
antiminorities because it gets a laugh not because it makes any 
kind of statement belzer said 
i think its just an easy cheap stupid laugh unless youre a 
richard pryor a david steinberg or a robert klein somebody who 
can take social issues in a comedic context and say something 
thats incisive and funny without being hurtful or meanspirited 
george carlin who made a comedy breakthrough by speaking the 
seven words you cant say on television is worried that clays 
humor targets the wrong people 
andrew clay is picking on underdogs gays women and 
immigrants carlin said his audiences share his beliefs so 
they cheer him on but andrew ought to remember that he is jewish 
and the same people who hate gays women and immigrants probably 
have jews somewhere on their list as well 
clay 32 born andrew clay silverstein in brooklyn was a 
struggling actorimpressionist when he donned the studded jacket 
combed up the ducktail and started talking about bad sex the dice 
man was born 
a successful comedy album hbo comedy specials and sellout 
concerts followed his first starring role in a feature film the 
adventures of ford fairlane opens this summer 
the current controversy began when nora dunn a cast member on 
saturday night live since the 8586 season refused to perform 
on this weeks show because she considers clays comedy degrading 
and repulsive 
in my heart i know i dont want to work with him dunn said 
clay told entertainment tonight that dunn was being silly 
ive seen her play from hookers to just like street tramps i 
wouldnt look at that and go if thats really her i wouldnt do 
the show 
dunn denies ever portraying streetwalkers 
pop singer sinead oconner whose nothing compares 2 u is 
no 2 on the charts also bowed off the show after her publicist 
was alerted by the national organization for women and the singer 
reviewed tapes of clays act 
it would be nonsensical of saturday night live to expect a 
woman to perform songs about a womans experience after a monologue 
by andrew dice clay the singer said 
she was replaced thursday by spanic boys a bluegrass rock n 
roll band from milwaukee and julee cruise a singer who has been 
heard on the soundtrack of the series twin peaks nbc said 
were not saying that he should be silenced said francoise 
jacobsohn a spokeswoman for nows media reform committee 
were saying that hes giving a view that is harmful to women 
she said hate crimes are on the rise in this country we have 
to make the connection between comics that are sexist and 
homophobic and hate crimes she said we have to let people 
know that this kind of humor is not ok 
efforts to interview clay about the controversy were 
unsuccessful he has no statement said clay publicist susan 
dubow hes not doing interviews hes rehearsing for saturday 
night live 
he also backed out of a scheduled taping thursday of the joan 
rivers show scheduled for broadcast today rivers spokeswoman 
linda lipman said clays representatives gave no reason for the 
noshow other than a lot of hemming and hawing

the widow of italian fashion magnate aldo gucci 
is challenging a will that leaves all of his american property to 
the woman he lived with and to the daughter she bore him 
gucci who died jan 19 in rome at age 84 left an estate worth 
millions of dollars but his will filed for probate in manhattan 
surrogate court says only that the estate is worth more than 
500000 
olwen price 82 guccis englishborn wife who bore him three 
sons filed a challenge to the will two weeks ago 
guccis will executed in palm beach fla on nov 3 1989 
leaves half of his us estate to my wife bruna palombo gucci 
and half to their daughter patricia gucci losio 25 
there is no indication that gucci and palombo ever formally 
married nor that he divorced price though they lived apart for 
many years 
in their petition for probate of the will guccis lawyers named 
price as guccis wife although the will names palombo 
the will also says gucci openly acknowledges patricia gucci 
losio as his daughter 
price who lives in rome and two of the sons paolo of west 
sussex england and roberto of florence say the will was not 
freely or voluntarily made 
they charge that it was procured by fraud duress and undue 
influence practiced upon the decedent by an individual purporting 
to be his wife to wit bruna palombo 
prices third son giorgio of rome is not contesting the will 
prices court papers also charge that the will was invalid 
because the witnesses did not sign in guccis presence or in the 
presence of each other 
price who says she is entitled to the widows share of the 
estate says the 10page will filed here was revoked by a will 
handwritten by gucci nov 8 in rome she did not cite the that 
wills provisions 
karen barkhorn a lawyer for the estate confirmed that an 
italian will exists but refused to comment on its validity 
gucci pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1986 to a year and a 
day in prison for evading 74 million in income taxes

walker percy whose deeply ethical novels 
dealt with displaced southern men searching for faith and love in 
the modern world has died of cancer at age 73 
percys first successful novel the moviegoer won the 
national book award in 1962 it established a theme that would 
occupy his entire career that of spiritually marooned men seeking 
to overcome their alienation 
historian shelby foote a lifelong friend was with percy when 
he died thursday 
he belongs with the great southern writers foote said i 
think he makes a fifth with john crowe ransom william 
faulkner thomas wolfe and eudora welty 
in jackson miss miss welty said im very grieved and very 
very hurt for all his family his friendship meant a lot to me and 
his work meant a great deal to me 
a funeral mass and burial was set for saturday at st josephs 
abbey near covington 
while percys protagonists were in the southern mold his 
philosophical concerns were not the same as other wellknown 
southern writers 
trained as a physician percy converted to catholicism in early 
adulthood during a period of intense personal examination his 
intellectual underpinnings reflected much study of french 
existentialism and he held true to these foundations to his death 
foote said 
he never said why is this happening to me foote said 
nothing like that he tried to reassure his family that this was 
all right 
said miss welty i dont know anybody like him in any way or 
anybody that did have the strong imaginative power and 
philosophical power that he had the scientific power and the 
fictional power all of those twined together into one that is a 
unique quality in his work 
critic stanley kauffmann who edited the moviegoer called 
him one of the loveliest american writers of this century he 
was a natural his novel the moviegoer will last as long as 
america loves literature 
percys other novels included the last gentleman 1966 
love in the ruins 1971 lancelot 1977 the second 
coming 1980 and the thanatos syndrome 1987 
his two major works of nonfiction were the message in the 
bottle 1975 essays on the philosophy of language and lost 
in the cosmos 1983 which he called the last selfhelp book 
percys vision of modern malaise was often ironic hardedged 
and eerily prophetic but his writings also contained some of the 
most wildly comic and deeply humane messages in contemporary 
fiction 
he also taught writing it was through his efforts that john 
kennedy tooles a confederacy of dunces was published 
posthumously the novel won the 1981 pulitzer prize for fiction 
born may 28 1916 in birmingham ala percy was orphaned in 
his teens he and his two brothers went to greenville miss to 
live with william alexander percy his fathers cousin who was 
author of the southern classic lanterns on the levee 
the percy household marked young walker forever with its passing 
parade of intellectuals artists politicians and vagabonds 
percy got a medical degree from columbia university in 1941 the 
next year working as a pathologist at bellevue hospital in new 
york city he caught pulmonary tuberculosis while performing 
autopsies on derelicts 
ive often said that getting a light case of tb was the best 
thing that couldve happened to me it gave me a period of enforced 
idleness percy said 
he read voraciously during his three years of recovery and 
turned to a life of writing 
he often gave credit to his original presbyterian work ethic 
for discipline and steadiness in the mornings he wrote and in the 
afternoons he typed what hed written he did not believe in 
writers block but he was often furiously frustrated 
he told one interviewer its a question of being so pitiful 
god takes pity on you looks down and says hes done for lets 
let him have a couple of good sentences 
its a strange abject littleunderstood profession 
he is survived by his wife mary bernice two daughters mary 
pratt percy lobdell and ann boyd percy moores two brothers leroy 
and billups phinizy percy and four grandsons

managers of a soviet circus stranded after 
just two stops on a planned twoyear goodwill tour of the united 
states scrambled to line up investors to get back in the ring 
its just one of those shows that went on the road and did not 
have its act together said rick hamilton executive director of 
the knoxville tenn civic center where the great circus bim bom 
performed before small crowds last week 
the circus performers were stranded in motels in suburban 
atlanta after being kicked out of two motels by managers who 
questioned whether bills would be paid the circus animals are in 
newburgh ny at the headquarters of the company transporting 
them 
the performers are crestfallen one of them said 
ive been all over the world and this is the first time this 
has ever happened said victor lomakin who has a chimpanzee act 
we have a great show not being able to perform is like taking a 
piece of gold and throwing it out 
the 138member allstar circus which includes performers from 
60 soviet circuses arrived in the united states march 31 to start 
its twoyear tour 
after three weeks of training in wheeling wva the circus 
performed in hershey pa april 2529 
after that stop the troupes financial problems began the 
trips backers a kuwaiti father and son withdrew their support 
according to nikolaj vissokovsky president of international 
showbusiness inc a floridabased firm directing the tour 
brooks savage a lawyer for waleed aa ahmad and his father 
khoorsheed ahmad said the men had given the circus a loan and had 
never intended to back the whole tour the backers are out 331000 
plus a promised 10 percent of receipts savage said 
the circus performed to crowds of just 300 and 400 in the 
5200seat knoxville arena on may 2 and may 3 
hamilton blamed the poor turnout on lack of advance promotion 
in knoxville we only got the promotional stuff four days ahead 
of time he said 
the circus next moved to johnson city tenn but canceled its 
performance and moved to suburban atlanta where some of the tours 
support contractors were based to regroup 
tales of bounced checks at hershey knoxville and johnson city 
soon caught up with the circus and some members of the troupe were 
kicked out of a motel 6 in marietta on wednesday and others from 
the brittany park hotel on thursday 
most ended up in a scottish inns of america where they were 
trying on thursday to find cash to pay their bills and keep their 
rooms 
john stallion the circus promotions director said a new 
financial backer planned to wire 2000 to him to pay for the 
rooms he declined to identify the backer 
vissokovsky said the promoters no 1 priority is paying the 
string of bad debts he estimated the circus owes about 450000 to 
trucking lighting and other production companies 
he said he was talking again with the kuwaiti investors as well 
as others who might be interested in sponsoring the circus 
were all hanging in there vissokovsky said weve got a 
lot of damage control to do we need to clean up our name 
officials in washington said thursday they were aware of the 
circuss plight but had no plans to intervene 
there are absolutely no political implications this just 
appears to be a case of a business venture gone bad said sidney 
smith of the state department 
vissokovsky said a soviet embassy official told him thursday 
that any decision about abandoning the tour would have to be made 
by the circus director yuri turkin

the dollar plummeted against the yen in tokyo today 
as the stronger japanese currency pushed prices sharply higher on 
the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 15415 yen down 260 yen from thursdays 
close of 15675 yen it started trading at 15575 yen its high for 
the day and ranged as low as 15390 yen 
dealers said an overnight decline in the dollars value against 
the swiss franc and west german mark pushed it below a technical 
floor resulting in widespread dollar selling 
the franc has been rising because of high swiss interest rates 
strong asian demand and the increasing tendency to view the franc 
as a safe haven currency dealers said 
japans major securities houses sold the dollar heavily in the 
morning after lunch they were joined by life insurers and other 
major market players said john radinoff vice president of goldman 
sachs japan 
the yen has been massively oversold and people have been 
looking for excuses to sell dollars radinoff said 
some market players remained on the sidelines awaiting the us 
governments release later today of the us producer price index 
and retail sales figures both for april which are expected to 
point to an economic slowdown 
concern that the us economy is slowing also helped push the 
dollar lower dealers said 
none of tokyos markets reacted perceptibly to unconfirmed 
rumors circulating throughout financial circles in asia that 
chinese leader deng xiaoping or another senior leader chen yun 
was seriously ill traders said 
chinese foreign ministry officials denied the rumor calling it 
a fabrication with ulterior motives 
the source of the rumor was unclear market sources said 
the surge in the yens strength as well as in the japanese 
government bond market helped stock prices but was not fully 
reflected in the nikkei stock averages moderate rise traders said 
the 225share nikkei index gained 53188 points or 172 
percent to close at 3151214 the index gained 3465 points 
thursday 
the index climbed only 18568 points in the morning session but 
surged higher in the afternoon after market participants became 
confident that the yen had strengthened substantially traders said 
in the morning dealers were staring at their screens and 
asking if there had been some kind of mistake it was remarkable 
said paul muller manager of international institutional sales at 
schroder securities japan by the afternoon it was clear the 
yen had broke through 
share prices advanced across the board but only a moderate 600 
million shares changed hands on the markets first section 
this implies theres a lot of selling still to be done 
muller said 
in bond dealings benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bonds closed at 8740 points up from thursdays close of 8647 
points their yield fell to 7080 percent from 7275 percent

spied on by the police departments red squad before it was 
abolished in 1974 
activists said release of the documents ordered thursday would 
lay to rest an era of social paranoia when activists were 
targeted by detroit police surveillance 
the rev william cunningham director of the human rights group 
focushope in detroit said he looked forward to seeing his file 
ill pursue it out of curiosity and to see what theyve got on 
me said cunningham it was social paranoia another chapter of 
mccarthyism 
wayne county circuit judge lucile watts ordered the city to 
allot 750000 to the red squad notification and distribution 
compliance program the program will hire 65 employees to field 
calls and letters from people seeking to learn if they were spied 
upon 
because they spoke out they were spied on the 15 million 
people were not trying to overthrow the state of michigan said 
richard soble an attorney representing the plaintiffs 
mayor coleman young opposed the red squad which had existed 
since the 1940s and shut it down after taking office in 1974 
however he wanted to destroy the files which are contained in 40 
cabinets crammed into a a small office in downtown detroit 
civil rights activists sued to gain access to the files 
young a civil rights and labor activist for decades before his 
election features prominently in the files which include minutes 
of meetings that young attended said police commissioner roy levy 
williams 
these meetings talked about the pentagon being a deterrent to 
the american objectives by stealing too much from the budget 
williams said anything like that with criticism of the status 
quo those folks wanted to know what was being said to protect the 
common good 
williams said the city was satisfied with the settlement

after squirming on the witness stand and 
sobbing in her fathers arms the first child witness in raymond 
buckeys retrial repeatedly said she couldnt remember if she was 
molested at the mcmartin preschool 
i dont remember if it happened or not the 11yearold said 
when asked if buckey touched her sexually 
at the conclusion of crossexamination buckeys lawyer danny 
davis asked the girl whether she was sodomized 
i dont remember she said 
the 31yearold buckey is charged specifically with raping the 
girl and using a foreign object to sodomize her 
clutching a stuffed toy snake she initially expressed her 
unwillingness to take the stand thursday then the youngster said 
she had a stomachache left the stand and went into a hallway where 
she sat sobbing in her fathers arms 
the parents and prosecutors spent an hour with her in private 
and she finally returned to finish her testimony 
on wednesday she had said she was neither sodomized nor raped by 
buckey when she attended his familys nursery school in manhattan 
beach 
another change in her testimony came when deputy district 
attorney pam ferrero read to the child sections of her own 
testimony before a grand jury and a preliminary hearing six years 
ago the transcripts indicated the girl had used anatomically 
explicit dolls to show that she was raped and sodomized 
she was then asked whether buckey hurt her sexually 
i dont recall but i remember it did happen she said 
ms ferrero asked no further questions to clarify the answer 
on crossexamination by davis the youngster said repeatedly she 
could not remember giving any of the earlier testimony nor whether 
any of the events she related happened 
she also could not remember that she once described a female 
teacher as lying on top of her nude and women teachers playing 
naked games 
i cant remember she answered repeatedly 
charges against five female teachers stemming in part from 
those allegations were dismissed after the preliminary hearing for 
lack of evidence 
the first buckey trial the longest and costliest criminal 
proceeding in us history ended in january with buckey acquitted 
of 40 counts of molestation at the familyowned preschool his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey was acquitted of 12 charges 
but the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against buckey and the 
district attorney decided to retry him on eight of those charges 
involving three children 
the girl who testified thursday did not appear at the first 
trial and the jury deadlocked 111 for acquittal on the two 
charges which involved her 
ms ferrero acknowledged in court that the girl did not want to 
come to court at all thursday but her parents brought her anyway 
ms ferrero said the girl expressed the desire not to testify 
when she arrived but was trying to be cheerful and agreed to 
cooperate 
she said it was difficult to remember events that occurred when 
she was 3 or 4 years old she will be 12 in july

mongolias legislature today debated proposals to 
allow direct presidential elections and create a second legislative 
chamber to meet yearround according to sources in that countrys 
capital ulan bator 
both changes are supported by mongolias fledgling opposition 
parties founded during the winter to press for democratic reforms 
like those being implemented in the soviet union and eastern europe 
in a speech thursday however president punsalmaagiin ochirbat 
proposed that the legislature known as the great peoples hural 
continue to elect the president 
he supported the idea of creating a smaller body that would be 
made of up great hural members and would meet frequently said the 
sources who spoke by telephone from the mongolian capital 
the great hural with 370 deputies generally meets only once or 
twice a year more than 93 percent of its deputies belong to the 
ruling communist party formally called the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party 
the opposition says indirect presidential elections help 
perpetuate communist control of the government 
also being debated today was a law that would legalize the new 
opposition parties and give them at least nominally equal status 
with the ruling party

a jury sentenced a former burglar to nine 
years in prison for poisoning the historic treaty oak tree in what 
authorities said was an occult ritual to purge his feelings for a 
woman 
the attorney for paul stedman cullen 46 who faced a possible 
life sentence had pleaded with the jury that less than 10 years 
would be a fair sentence 
you have to decide how much a tree is worth said attorney 
terry kirk who recalled playing as a child under the branches of 
the centuriesold tree 
cullen had faced the harsh sentence for the criminal mischief 
conviction because of his previous felony burglary conviction 
cullen had no comment as he was led from the courtroom 
the tree estimated to be as much as 500 years old was poisoned 
with the powerful liquid herbicide velpar in early 1989 about 
twothirds of the tree is now dead foresters said but the 
remaining third is still producing leaves 
according to legend the tree was the site of a treaty signing 
between stephen f austin and indians 
prosecutors said cullen poisoned the tree to protect a woman 
whom he liked and to kill his love for her 
kirk said the jury withstood extreme community pressure not to 
severely punish cullen 
i honestly do believe that there are people out there who 
would make him drink velpar hang him kirk said 
state district judge bob perkins who presided over the trial 
said people still find this crime unfathomable in terms of 
rationale nobody can figure it out it makes it that much more of 
a crime 
perkins said he would take off about a year from the sentence 
because of time cullen has spent in jail he has been jailed in 
lieu of 20000 bond since his arrest in june 1989 
since the poisoning was discovered more than 100000 has been 
donated to save the tree velparcontaminated dirt was removed from 
around its roots the tree has been doused with spring water and 
elaborate sun screens were built to shade it

a 2yearold child allegedly beaten to 
death eight weeks after his adoption should never have been taken 
from the home where people loved him his former foster parents 
said 
dale and jan may had cared for maurice west in their cincinnati 
home since he was 2 months old they wanted to adopt maurice whom 
they called reecie but were turned down because he was black 
and they were white 
this week the mays came to rochester to attend the trial of the 
couple who adopted maurice and to hear testimony about the 
battered child who died just two months after he left their home 
maurices adoptive parents bernice and gerald kittelberger are 
charged with seconddegree manslaughter and assault for maurices 
aug 26 1989 death closing arguments in the case are scheduled 
for monday 
maurice was a beautiful baby dale may said thursday outside 
a monroe county courtroom while leafing through photographs of a 
smiling laughing little boy 
another set of photographs those introduced as evidence in the 
kittelbergers trial show a child covered with bruises burns and 
scars 
medical experts testified that maurice had been beaten 
repeatedly and severely with a blunt object a doctor who examined 
maurices body in the emergency room of st marys hospital said 
the childs limbs were so swollen that he could not find a vein to 
inject intravenous medicine 
mrs kittelberger said the child had choked on oatmeal 
monroe county medical examiner nicholas t forbes said the death 
was a direct result of the beatings 
in statements to police the kittelbergers who are black 
said they had hit the child with a belt a paddle and a stick 
wrapped in tape because he had resisted toilet training 
they attributed other injuries an open gash on his forehead a 
tear near his buttocks burn marks on his hands to the child 
tripping and falling or accidentally grabbing mrs kittelbergers 
hot curling iron 
but the mays said maurice was not that kind of child 
while reecie was at our house he was allowed to go 
anywhere may said in two years there were no accidents no 
tripping no falls no anything 
by age 2 maurice was coordinated enough to play computer games 
and an electronic keyboard and knew how to run their videocassette 
recorder mrs may said 
he was smart enough and careful enough that he could turn it 
on she said you never had to worry about reecie touching 
anything getting into anything or bothering anything 
maurice never needed to be scolded or punished the mays said 
an explanation to that child was enough may said a no 
that will hurt you was enough 
the mays who have cared for 20 black and biracial foster 
children over the last three years applied to hamilton county 
ohio officials to adopt maurice 
they told adoption officials that they would enroll maurice in 
an integrated school district and that they would take african 
culture classes so he would not lose his heritage they said they 
would adopt another black child so that maurice would not feel 
isolated when he grew older 
we did every single possible thing to make what we thought was 
a good environment for reecie mrs may said and when they 
said we couldnt have him we did everything we could to make his 
adoption as easy as possible 
the mays said they hope kittelbergers are convicted and 
sentenced to maximum prison terms for destroying maurices life 
the kittelbergers face a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted 
of the seconddegree manslaughter and assault charges 
moreover the mays are angry with the system that took maurice 
from them and brought him to rochester 
they want to see better investigations of adoptive parents and 
better monitoring to prevent child abuse and they want to see 
arbitrary policies against crossracial adoptions abolished 
love and a wholesome happy environment is important not just 
black and white mrs may said

ten years after its massive eruption there is a 
5050 chance mount st helens will explode its dome again within 
three decades a university of washington seismologist says 
steve malone a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the 
pacific northwest said thursday that mount st helens is the most 
likely volcano in the cascade mountains to erupt in the next 20 to 
30 years 
our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since 
mount st helens erupted he said 
malone said seismic activity which the predication is largely 
based on is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it 
indicates the breaking of rock below the earths surface as molten 
material rises underneath the volcano 
the probability of eruption increases with the frequency and 
magnitude of the earthquakes he said 
the may 18 1980 eruption of mount st helens killed 57 people 
devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the 
globe

retail sales slumped 06 percent in april 
posting the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest 
setback in six months the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales fell by 907 million last 
month to a seasonally adjusted 14864 billion 
the april decrease was a disappointment to economists who had 
been looking for a small rebound following a 02 percent decline in 
march and no change in february 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of total 
economic activity continued weakness in the area of retail sales 
was likely to intensify concerns about the countrys future 
economic prospects especially in light of last weeks report that 
unemployment climbed in april to 54 percent 
growing joblessness could promote worries among consumers about 
the future causing them to shut off spending especially for 
bigticket items such as autos 
the 06 percent april decline was the largest since a 14 
percent plunge last october 
the backtoback declines in march and april marked the first 
time that has occurred in moe than three years 
originally the government reported february posted a sales 
decline as well but sales activity during that month was revised 
upward in the current report to show no change 
for april the biggest drag on activity came from auto sales 
which dropped 27 percent it marked the sixth time in the last 
seven months that car sales have fallen 
without the big drop in auto sales total retail sales would 
have been unchanged last month 
sales at general department stores were off 07 percent in april 
following an even bigger 12 percent drop in march a survey 
focusing only on the countrys largest chain department stores 
showed sales had generally rebounded in april when compared to a 
year ago boosted by late easter shopping 
sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 26 percent 
in april following an 08 percent decrease the previous month 
there was basic weakness across the board sales at gasoline 
stations fell by 1 percent restaurant sales were off by 02 
percent while sales at speciality clothing stores were down 19 
percent 
drug stores were the only retail establishments showing an

east germanys former communists are inciting 
unrest among workers who fear they will lose their jobs as the 
nation unites with west germany a west german official charged 
today 
tens of thousands of teachers textile workers and farmers 
staged brief protests and strikes on thursday to demand protection 
from the widespread unemployment expected as east germany moves to 
a free market 
hans klein spokesman for west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said the organizers of the strikes are to some extent exactly the 
forces who caused east germanys dire economic problems 
klein told a news conference in the west german capital bonn 
that there was legitimate uncertainty and fear over the talks 
between the germanys on the merger of their economies and social 
institutions 
guenther krause who leads the east german delegation in 
economic talks with west germany also criticized what he called a 
fear campaign by the left to trigger mass anxiety over the loss 
of huge subsidies under the former socialist system 
krause made his comments to the east german parliament on 
thursday while briefing lawmakers on the status of the unification 
talks 
lawmaker gregor gysi head of the reformed communist party 
blamed the east german government for the uncertainty among east 
germans 
he said east germans were being kept too much in the dark about 
what was being negotiated and needed to plan for economic changes 
he told lawmakers on thursday that the east german negotiating 
team has gone into talks in a stooped posture to the west 
german delegation which wants to remove all the vestiges of the 
former socialist system 
the germanys are to merge their economies and social 
institutions on july 2 when the west german mark is to become the 
currency of east germany 
full unification is expected next year after the superpowers 
find a way to agree on the strategic role of a united germany 
krause said work on the final economic and social agreement 
between the germanys should be completed by sunday the parliaments 
of both nations then would consider the treaty 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl said thursday that 
east germany must restructure its beleaguered economy before the 
two nations share the west german currency 
kohl also renewed his demand that east germany be prepared to 
start dismantling its 41yearold system of state ownership if 
economic union with west germany is going to be a success 
economists predict that many inefficient east german factories 
will close in the next year because they will not be able to 
compete in the free market and that between 500000 and 2 million 
east german workers will lose their jobs 
kohl and east german prime minister lothar de maiziere say a 
quick influx of western investment will create new jobs and raise 
east german living standards 
the two governments still have differences over the level of job 
and price guarantees to give east germans 
the talks are being held behind closed doors and many questions 
remain unanswered about how west germany would absorb and dismantle 
east germanys vast public sector and social welfare system 
the leftleaning social democrats the junior partner in de 
maizieres governing coalition are pressing the conservative de 
maiziere to push for more social guarantees for east germans used 
to cheap housing subsidized food and guaranteed jobs 
krause gave the 400member parliament an update on the status of 
talks between the countries and a grim economic picture of the east 
german economy 
he said east germany faces a yearend deficit of 120 billion 
east german marks 366 billion inflation has risen rapidly in 
recent months and only 32 percent of the nations industries are 
profitable

austrian president kurt waldheim apologized to 
israel in an interview published today for misleading statements 
about his german army service in world war ii but again denied 
that he committed war crimes 
waldheim also was quoted as urging israel to upgrade its 
diplomatic representation in vienna and to return the ambassador it 
withdrew in protest after waldheims election in 1986 
in the past years my hand has been extended and it has always 
remained hanging in the air waldheim said in an appeal to the 
jewish state 
his interview conducted monday in vienna was published today 
in the liberal haaretz newspaper 
a spokesman for israels foreign ministry said no official 
message of this kind has reached jerusalem but it was unlikely 
that israel would return its ambassador to vienna 
waldheim reiterated that he has not been involved in war crimes 
the accusations against me are completely baseless he told the 
newspaper 
waldheim was referring to allegations that he was involved in 
the massacre of yugoslavian partisans and the deportation of greek 
jews to nazi death camps about 45000 greek jews were sent to nazi 
death camps while waldheim was stationed in the balkans 
a 1988 investigation by six historians said there was no 
evidence waldheim had directly taken part in nazi war crimes but 
said his assertions that he did not know about the fate of jews 
deported from greece were not believable 
in his official biography waldheim claimed he left the german 
army after being wounded on the russian front in 1941 
he later admitted he had omitted from the biography being 
reassigned to the balkans where he served as an intelligence 
officer until the end of the war 
i apologize that i did not bring up the balkan matter i 
confess that there was a mistake here waldheim said i did not 
forsee that the issue would open in such a tragic direction 
i certainly express my regret before them on the ommissions 
he said in an appeal to the jewish state 
waldheim also dismissed recent reports that he had once declared 
himself to be a loyal nazi 
to say i was a member of the nazi party is not correct 
despite what was claimed i never admitted this he said 
waldheim said he wanted to improve his relationship with jews 
and jewish organizations around the world which have been at the 
forefront of investigations into his past 
waldheim suggested that the investigations were caused by jewish 
anger over decisions taken by the united nations while he served as 
un secretary general from 1972 to 1982 he cited as an example 
the 1975 resolution equating zionism with racism 
the jewish community accused me of supporting the resolution 
that simply was not correct he said the decision was 
regretful unjust and damaging at least to the united nations

ten years after its massive eruption there is a 
5050 chance mount st helens will explode its dome again within 
three decades a university of washington seismologist says 
steve malone a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the 
pacific northwest said thursday that mount st helens is the most 
likely volcano in the cascade mountains to erupt in the next 20 to 
30 years 
our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since 
mount st helens erupted he said 
malone said seismic activity which the predication is largely 
based on is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it 
indicates the breaking of rock below the earths surface as molten 
material rises underneath the volcano 
the probability of eruption increases with the frequency and 
magnitude of the earthquakes he said 
the may 18 1980 eruption of mount st helens killed 57 people 
devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the 
globe

police arrested 30 people today 
during rallies by filipinos who want the government to refuse to 
extend the leases on six us military bases when they expire next 
year 
meanwhile a police official announced the arrest of a communist 
rebel leader accused in the slayings of three americans and a 
filipino of american descent outside the usrun clark air base in 
1987 
in manila brig gen marino filart said a special 500man 
security force will guard us and filipino officials who begin 
talks monday on the future of the six us bases whose lease 
expires in september 1991 
rafael alunan spokesman for the filipino delegation told 
reporters the exploratory phase of the talks could be concluded 
within a week and the two sides would then decide whether to begin 
formal negotiations 
the united states maintains about 40000 troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents at the six bases 
which us officials say are crucial to stability in the far east 
president corazon aquino has not yet indicated whether she 
supports extending the lease most surveys show that bases 
supporters outnumber opponents but that a growing number of 
filipinos believe the american facilities infringe on national 
sovereignty 
in manila police said two people were arrested today when 
clubwielding police broke up an antibase rally by about 150 
university of the philippines students in front of the us embassy 
later 200 leftist students burned tires and set off 
firecrackers along a main manila street to demand the closure of 
the us bases 
in davao 600 miles south of manila witnesses said 28 people 
were arrested after protesters splashed red paint on a us 
information service office 
meanwhile about 3000 residents of olongapo site of the us 
subic bay naval base 50 miles west of manila held a rally 
supporting the us bases and protesting last weeks killing of a 
us marine sergeant 
several american servicemen in bars and clubs cheered the 
probase demonstrators who included bar girls and merchants who 
closed their shops to join the rally organized by city officials 
the killing of marine sgt john fredette of buena park calif 
caused a slump in the citys economy after us military 
authorities restricted personnel to the subic base for several days 
due to security concerns 
police say fredettes slaying was nonpolitical and might have 
resulted from a robbery attempt police are holding three suspects 
on charges of murder and illegal gun possession 
a police official ruled out any link between fredettes slaying 
and the arrest of a communist rebel leader who is accused of being 
involved in a coordinated series of attacks against americans in 
the city of angeles outside the usrun clark air base in october 
1987 
provincial rebel chief alex capitulo 33 was arrested tuesday 
at a restaurant in the town of guagua 35 miles north of manila 
the military said 
capitulo is suspected of involvement in the killings of us air 
force sgt randy davis of portland ore airman 1st class steven 
faust of pasadena texas herculano mangante a retired air force 
sergeant living near the base and joseph porter a filipino 
businessman of american descent 
us intelligence sources say they were apparently killed in 
reprisal for american troops taking filipino soldiers wounded in a 
battle with communist rebels to the base hospital

the government probably will lose more than 
177 million on a housing program used for developments alongside 
golf courses and marinas say internal reports blaming the risky 
loans on mismanagement and political favoritism 
the government already has lost 55 million on sales of 
foreclosed properties from the department of housing and urban 
developments title x land development program agency auditors 
said they said it will cost an additional 122 million if failures 
and foreclosure sales continue at current rates 
declining values of some of the properties and delays in 
foreclosing and selling the troubled projects may further add to 
huds losses the auditors said so far hud has had to pay 
claims on 32 of the 65 loans made through the program seventeen of 
the projects are still in the formative stages thus the final 
claim rate likely will be higher 
the investigation detailed in two reports completed last week 
found several examples of projects being approved despite 
overwhelming evidence they did not meet requirements or were too 
risky 
also detailed were several previously undisclosed cases in which 
former hud officials or republican consultants successfully lobbied 
senior department managers to reverse lowerlevel rejections of 
questionable projects some of the projects have failed and others 
are troubled the reports said 
the reports obtained through the freedom of information act 
blamed the problems on reaganera abuses but said the losses 
continued to mount last year because hud secretary jack kemp who 
took office with the bush administration had not allocated enough 
staff to the program 
after prodding by huds inspector general or internal watchdog 
kemp last week created a new unit to handle the program kemp 
killed title x last year but the existing projects still must be 
monitored 
several title x projects were built alongside golf courses and 
include other resortlike amenities few catered to low and 
moderateincome families 
one development reviewed bluewater bay in niceville fla 
received 154 million in hudbacked financing 
the complex which had additional private financing includes 
tennis courts bike and hiking trails a swimming pool 
restaurants a shopping center 27 holes of golf a beach and a 
120slip marina 
bluewater bay was approved in april 1989 two months after kemp 
took office despite regulations that say land development 
proposals oriented to recreationresort housing markets are not 
eligible 
hud general counsel francis keating said bluewater bay was 
funded because hud had entered into a binding contract in february 
1989 just weeks after kemp took office and before he named most of 
his top aides 
these kind of proposals could not and would not be approved on 
jack kemps watch keating said 
among former hud officials successful in lobbying was shirley 
mcvay wiseman who in congressional testimony last summer 
criticized the role of politics during her tenure at the agency 
it was wiseman who first cast doubt on assertions by former hud 
secretary samuel r pierce jr that he played no direct role in 
funding decisions 
since then others have testified that pierce was involved he 
and several former top aides are being investigated by a 
courtappointed special prosecutor 
the new audit reports said wiseman was paid 182600 to serve as 
a consultant for two texas developments they said another former 
hud official maurice barksdale earned nearly 170000 for 
lobbying on title x projects and also lobbied for developments in 
other hud programs 
the two texas developments southcreek in dallas and steeds 
crossing in austin were approved by hud headquarters after being 
rejected by regional offices they received more than 20 million 
in hudinsured financing both owners have kept up loan payments 
but the audit reports questioned the longterm viability of the 
developments 
the two were cited in a list of 10 projects that auditors said 
should not have been approved in six of the 10 there were 
indications of consultant influence with huds program decisions 
one report said 
telephone calls seeking comment from wiseman were not 
immediately returned 
virtually all of the questioned decisions were made by james 
nistler huds former deputy assistant secretary for singlefamily 
housing according to the reports he left the agency shortly after 
kemp took over and efforts to locate him for comment thursday were 
not successful 
favoritism also played a role in the approval of a houston 
development whose owners defaulted on a 256 million mortgage 
forcing hud to pay a 23 million insurance claim auditors said 
in that case nistler in 1986 allowed developers to refinance 
the troubled cumberland development first backed by a 132 
million hud loan in 1982 nistler approved the loan despite 
evidence of myriad problems and explicit regulations against using 
title x loans for refinancing auditors said 
they said the father of the principal developer marc d kovens 
of florida was a good friend of nistlers it appeared hud 
approved the project because of an intent to favor the owners 
interest over those of hud the auditors said the refinancing 
allowed kovens to pay off a 27 million debt they said 
other consultants who lobbied to win approval of title x 
projects were lou kitchin an adviser to the reagan and bush 
presidential campaigns and milton masson who served as western 
regional director of the 1984 reaganbush campaign 
kitchin who has acknowledged lobbying hud was hired by several 
title x developers including a north carolina investors group 
involving former republican gov james e holshouser jr 
holshouser and his partners with kitchins help received a 
waiver to secure a 17 million loan for a wilmington development 
without posting collateral the owners defaulted last december 
two of holshousers partners in that deal were among the 
developers of another north carolina project northwoods in cary 
whose 1988 default cost hud more than 26 million 
massons firm received 285000 to lobby for approval of a 10 
million tennessee project the reports said the auditors said the 
mortgage was bloated by 12 million because huds nashville office 
approved excessive land appraisal and development costs 
the auditors said hud employees approved those rates because of 
pressure from supervisors they were constantly aware of the 
consultants influence and felt extraordinary pressure one 
report said of the staff

schools finances can be devised the schools president said 
the incoming student body president melissa stevensondile 
said she was very pleased by thursdays action but added that

undergraduate classes males have been admitted to graduate 
programs since the 1930s

fundraising drive and increase the 72 million endowment by 10 
million 
she said that before the board takes another vote the faculty 
administration staff and students must present plans that show 
promise of the college achieving financial stability

and boycotting classes since the board of trustees voted may 3 to 
admit male undergraduates citing decline enrollment and revenues 
mills has about 775 undergraduates and trustees have said it needs 
1000 to survive 
the student protesters say they enrolled at the 138yearold 
school because they believed that not having to compete with or be 
distracted by men improved their chances for a good education they 
cite studies showing that graduates of womens colleges are more 
successful 
the 35member board is expected to reconsider its decision at 
meetings may 17 and 18

gambling opponents on 
this besieged mohawk reservation welcomed a drug raid by canadian 
police but said they feared the arrests would touch off renewed 
violence by casino supporters 
the raid thursday by three canadian police agencies at the st 
regis indian reservation netted about 4 pounds of cocaine and a 
halfpound of marijuana worth about 800000 in us currency 
said ontario provincial police spokesman peter west 
police also seized about 32000 in us currency and 12 guns 
including three automatic rifles west said 
police arrested 21 people on drug and weapons charges at 
cornwall island on the reservation and in nearby cornwall ontario 
west said 
sixteen suspects were still at large this morning said sgt al 
crocker 
the reservation straddles the uscanadian border both new 
york and canadian police said all was quiet today on their 
respective sides 
chief mike mitchell head of the tribal council that governs the 
canadian side of the reservation said he saw the raid as 
reaffirming the struggle of the people to rid themselves of the 
criminal element in our society 
mitchell and other gambling opponents blame casinos on the us 
side for drug trafficking weapons smuggling and other crime 
gambling supporters say the casinos are an economic boon for the 
impoverished reservation 
canadian police and new york state troopers have blockaded the 
reservation since may 1 when two mohawks were shot to death during 
fighting between pro and antigambling factions 
gambling opponent doug george who edits a newspaper on the 
reservation said the arrests may spark fresh violence by groups 
such as the warriors society a selfappointed reservation security 
patrol that has backed the casino owners 
i think it will make them very angry and i would suspect this 
weekend that theyre going to plan something in retaliation 
george said 
the arrests came after a 14month undercover investigation on 
the reservation west said about half of the suspects live on the 
reservation most were charged with drug trafficking which carries 
a maximum sentence of life in prison west said 
warriors society spokesman john boots said no members of his 
group were involved in the arrests we have no connection 
whatsoever boots said 
mohawks who resent the police presence said authorities used too 
much force and were careless in making the arrests 
police smashed a glass door at the home of elvis thompson who 
was arrested along with three brothers and two cousins said his 
girlfriend amanda adams 
police didnt even give us a chance to get halfway to the door 
before they broke it down adams said 
most of those arrested were released on bail after their 
arraignments thursday 
chief harold tarbell a gambling opponent who heads the tribal 
council that governs the us side said he wished police would 
launch a similar initiative on the new york side unlike the 
canadian sector the us side has no independent mohawk police

anniversary of its landing on the moon the american flag should be 
planted on mars 
in a speech highlighting space as part of americas heritage of 
progress bush said its time to open up the final frontier 
there can be no turning back americas space program is what 
civilization needs to begin this journey to perfect the commitment 
to go beyond 
further he said each time we go to the frontier and beyond 
we bring back more than we hoped for this time we have a chance to 
bring back more than we can imagine 
bush declared that the july 20 1969 landing of apollo 11 as 
the first manned spacecraft on the moon showed we could meet our 
commitments to ourselves and to the world proof that democracy 
could triumph as decisively in peace as it had in war 
bush said that his space plans which include reviving the moon 
program and having an operational space station by the end of this 
century will help rekindle public interest in science and 
mathematics and revitalize an area of our education system that has 
become disturbingly weak 
it will revolutionize everything from computers to 
communication from medicine to metals regaining and retaining 
americas hightech competitive edge he said 
the administration has offered no budget figures for its space 
program some members of congress have expressed doubts that the 
massive funding anticipated will be available given the 
budgettightening needed to reduce the federal deficit 
the president also is commencement speaker saturday at the 
university of south carolina in columbia and liberty university in 
lynchburg va 
the trio of speeches follow bushs first commencement address 
this year at oklahoma state university last week 
all are dedicated to the general theme of change in the world 
in south carolina bush is to focus on changes in eastern europe 
and the need for a standard of justice as well as democratic 
government an administration official said 
before his departure for texas this morning bushs week was 
consumed by backandforth with congress on the issue of a fiscal 
year 1991 budget 
he remained uncharacteristically out of sight on thursday as 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater faced reporters to 
disavow a comment by bushs chief of staff john sununu which 
reflected greater rigidity than the president has voiced on the 
administrations budget posture 
bush has said he is entering a series of budget talks with 
congressional leaders with no preconditions 
that differs from his past promises of no new taxes even to 
reduce a raging budget deficit 
but sununu said wednesday that no preconditions meant that 
democrats were free to suggest tax increases and the white house 
was free to say no 
sununus comments were seen as an effort to appease conservative 
republicans who are attacking bush for abandoning the no new 
taxes pledge 
they brought immediate criticism however from congressional 
democrats who voiced fears that bush was setting an electionyear 
trap to get them to push for a tax increase the republicans could 
attack 
fitzwater however reiterated that nothing is predetermined in 
the budget talks and that the table is clean 
further he insisted bush speaks for himself and his position 
is no preconditions 
the budget talks got under way sunday when bush called 
congressional leaders to the white house and proposed they work out 
a budget both the administration and congress can agree on

nasa should buy at least one more space 
shuttle because theres a 5050 chance a craft will be lost in the 
next several years a congressional report suggested today 
a new shuttle like the one being built to replace the destroyed 
challenger would cost 2 billion to 25 billion 
the office of technology assessment said nasas goal of 14 
launches a year poses increased risks to astronauts and that the 
schedule could be limited to a regular sustainable rate of eight 
to 10 launches by limiting flights to payloads requiring human 
crews 
the actual reliability of the shuttle system is unknown but 
may lie between 97 percent and 99 percent the report said if 
reliability is 98 percent the nation faces a 5050 chance of 
losing an additional orbiter in the next 34 flights 
the challenger explosion in 1986 which killed seven crew 
members happened on the 25th shuttle flight there have been 10 
missions since 
the loss of challenger left three shuttles in the nasa fleet 
discovery atlantis and columbia a new shuttle to be called 
endeavour will be finished next year and flying in 1992 
ota a congressional advisory group said in its report that the 
nation can make do with existing launch systems until the next 
century if it follows the current course of steady growth in 
civilian and military space activities 
but if the united states wants a permanent lunar base missions 
to mars or a spacebased defense system the report said it should 
be prepared to spend 10 billion to 20 billion in development 
costs alone for new launch systems 
because the nation cannot afford to invest in all the good 
ideas proposed for improved or new launch systems congress and the 
administration will have to choose from a wide range of options 
the report said some choices must be made in the next two to 
three years others can wait longer 
the most immediate choices are making improvements in expendable 
rockets that are based on 1950s and 60s designs limiting shuttle 
flights buying more orbiters and paying for shuttle improvement 
program 
much like the b52 bomber which has steadily grown more 
capable and remained operational for over 30 years the ability of 
the shuttle orbiters to stay in service can theoretically be 
extended for another two decades the report said 
nasa is improving the shuttles main engines has begun a 
program to build more reliable higher capacity advanced solid 
rocket motors and is installing new computers more tolerant than 
the ones built in the 1970s 
the report also said 
the risk to the shuttle fleet would be reduced by developing a 
heavylift launch system known as shuttlec that would replace 
the orbiter with a cargo container nasa estimates the shuttlec 
will cost 11 billion plus 400 million for each launch 
congress should decide whether to develop a rescue vehicle for 
astronauts aboard the space station that will be in orbit late in 
the decade the report said it would cost 1 billion to 2 billion 
to decide whether a riskreducing effort is worth the 
investment required congress must be advised about how much the 
investment would reduce the risk ota said even if an 
alternate crewreturn vehicle were built and worked as planned it 
would not eliminate all risks to station crew members 
for the long haul congress should look to developing two new 
launch systems a personnel carrierlaunch system that would carry 
little cargo and be launched atop an expendable rocket and a 
larger advanced manned launch system using a reusable vehicle 
work on those systems would be cheaper ota said than building 
an aerospace plane that would take off like an airplane from a 
conventional runway 
technology for such a plane is being developed jointly by nasa 
and the air force a fulltest vehicle ota said may cost more 
than 5 billion 
the ota report was one of a series entitled access to space

west germany could find itself picking 
up part of the tab for soviet troops based in east germany after 
the two germanys merge their economies this summer bonn officials 
said today 
the officials said preliminary negotiations have started between 
moscow and bonn on an arrangement to use west german marks to 
temporarily cover the living costs for red army troops stationed in 
east germany 
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
it appears that the 380000 soviet soldiers in east germany 
could start receiving west german marks for their living costs in 
exchange for soviet rubles after the german economies are merged on 
july 2 
such an agreement would mark the first time a nato country ended 
up paying in its own currency for the stationing of soviet troops 
a west german government spokeman dieter vogel said that 
finance minister theo waigel will travel to east berlin on monday 
to discuss the soviet troops issue with the east german government 
under current bilateral agreements the soviet union buys east 
german marks in exchange for socalled transfer rubles at a 
preferential rate transfer rubles are not convertible to western 
countries 
the east marks are then used to pay for goods and services for 
soviet soldiers stationed in east germany these have been 
relatively inexpensive because of state subsidies 
when the west german mark becomes east germanys official 
currency july 2 east germany will also start to eliminate state 
subsidies that means a new exchange rate will have to be 
established between the west german mark and the soviet transfer 
ruble and the steep price rises anticipated as a result of the 
loss of subsidies will also have to be taken into account 
it remains unclear how much west germany would end up paying to 
maintain the soviet troops or whether the average soviet soldier 
would come out ahead 
a west german government official said the bilateral talks with 
moscow are just at a beginning phase and it is not clear how a new 
arrangement for covering the cost of stationing the soviet troops 
will be worked out 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he did 
not know what the current costs for the soviet troops are 
he said the west germans have not yet seen any concrete 
proposals from the soviet side on how to cover the red armys 
costs

a philippine airlines jet carrying 
119 people exploded and burned today as it prepared to take off 
and officials said a bomb may have been planted on board seven 
people were killed and more than 80 hurt 
survivors spoke of up to three blasts aboard the boeing 737300 
and at least three large holes were torn in the roof 
flames quickly gutted the interior 
the plane was being towed to the runway for a domestic flight 
when it was rocked by at least one explosion which occurred before 
the jets two engines were started said oscar alejandro director 
of the governments air transport office 
the cabin filled with smoke but most passengers escaped by 
sliding down emergency chutes before flames engulfed the plane he 
said passengers said some people panicked and trampled one another 
rushing for the exits 
there was an explosion in front of me and there was a very bad 
smell said passenger isidro retaso 33 of iloilo so i 
immediately opened the emergency exit i was the first one out of 
the plane 
they were still demonstrating the safety equipment when it

ceiling shuddered on the second explosion i immediately opened 
the emergency exit 
the bodies of six adults and one child were found inside the 
burnedout cabin said ed carrascoso manager of manilas domestic 
airport he said they were either killed by the blast or died of 
smoke inhalation all were passengers

serious condition officials said 
the plane was bound for iloilo 290 miles to the south with 113

foreigners were among the passengers although authorities said a 
japanese man was treated for burns 
the injured included aurelio periquet jr a nationally 
prominent business leader and president of the philippine chamber 
of commerce and rep albertito lopez a congressman from iloilo 
the planes departure had been slightly delayed because of heavy 
air traffic over manila officials said 
carrascoso said there had been no bomb threats but oscar 
alejandro director of the governments air transport office said 
were looking into the possibility that a bomb was placed 
aboard 
alejandro also said police were examining the plane to determine

swept through the plane in only four minutes one blast apparently 
occurred near the center of the passenger cabin near where the 
bodies were found he said

everything looked normal but then there was a loud 
explosion said passenger sony villareal 30 it was really

a federal appeals court has ruled that new york 
city can oust panhandlers from the subways because asking for money 
is not a protected form of speech 
the only message that we are able to espy as common to all 
acts of begging is that beggars want to exact money from those whom 
they accost the 2nd us circuit court of appeals said in a 21 
opinion thursday 
the decision reversed a lower court ruling that said the 
metropolitan transit authoritys begging prohibition was 
unconstitutional because begging is a form of free speech protected 
by the first amendment 
the earlier ruling had overturned a city program begun in 
october to crack down on vagrancy in the subway many of the 
citys estimated 80000 homeless people congregate underground to 
stay warm sleep and ask for spare change 
the appeals court ruling means the transit authority can ban 
begging on trains near subway stairways escalators and elevators 
and within 25 feet of token booths 
a transit police spokesman sgt robert valentino said the 
police had been enforcing the ban since february because the lower 
court ruling had been under appeal although officers were not 
rigorously applying it 
the transit police officials were mapping strategy today to more 
vigorously enforce the ban now even if it is appealed to the us 
supreme court valentino said 
the court said us district judge leonard sand who made the 
earlier ruling showed an exacerbated deference to the alleged 
individual rights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment 
of the common good 
the transit authority which operates the subway system has an 
obligation to provide a safe environment for its ridership the 
appeals court said 
it is fair to say that whether intended as so or not begging 
in the subway often amounts to nothing less that assault creating 
in the passengers the apprehension of imminent danger the 
51page majority decision said 
in a dissenting opinion judge thomas meskill pointed to 
regulations that allow organized charities to solicit donations in 
the subway system he said beggars deserve the same protection 
i simply fail to see why the transit authority should be able 
to permit organized charities but not beggars to rattle a cup 
full of change as one passes by meskill said 
robert kiley chairman of the metropolitan transportation 
authority called the decision a victory for the millions of subway 
riders 
we believe the subways are a means of transportation not an 
open field for panhandling he said the transit police may now 
proceed with our efforts to restore order to the transit system 
the appeals court decision stemmed from a classaction lawsuit 
brought by the legal action center for the homeless last november 
on behalf of all people who beg in the subway system 
a lawyer said the homeless advocates might appeal the decision

an influential shiite moslem leader today 
ruled out negotiations with israel on a prisoner exchange that 
could secure the release of western hostages held in lebanon 
the believers have every moral religious and humanitarian 
objection against negotiating with israel hussein musawi told a 
news conference at his headquarters in east lebanons ancient city 
of baalbek 
our war with the enemies of god is openended musawi said 
excerpts of the news conference were broadcast by the 
communistrun voice of the people radio station 
musawi heads islamic amal a prosyrian wing in the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is believed to 
be the umbrella for shiite extremists holding most of the 16 
western hostages including six americans 
musawi is believed to wield influence on islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine the group that released american hostage 
robert polhil 55 on april 22 
another group calling itself the organization of islamic dawn 
released another american frank reed 57 on april 30 
iran and the hostageholders demanded a goodwill gesture from 
the united states after the release of polhill and reed 
they have asked washington to pressure israel to release some 
300 lebanese and palestinian detainees and that the united states 
and its western allies help determine the fate of four iranians who 
disappeared in lebanon in 1982 
the iranians were kidnapped in the christian heartland north of 
beirut by rightwing militiamen militia officials have said they 
believe the iranians are dead but tehran says it has information 
they are still alive 
israel says it would negotiate a swap provided it includes an 
israeli airman and two soldiers captured by shiite groups in south 
lebanon in 1986 
political analysts assume that if the swap of israeli and 
lebanese and palestinian detainees occurred some of the 16 western 
hostages would be freed 
in addition to the six americans the western hostages include 
four britons two germans two swiss an italian and an irishman

the state department has ruled that a 
chinese couple who fled their homelands forced abortion policy 
qualify for refugee status clearing the way for them to receive 
political asylum their lawyer said today 
li jin lin and his wife wang sai zhen are the first known 
cases to test president bushs nov 30 directive that grants asylum 
to people fleeing forced abortions or sterilizations in their 
native countries 
they had been awaiting a us immigration and naturalization 
service hearing that would decide whether they could stay in the 
united states but the state department ruling effectively ended 
the proceedings against them said kathleen rimar the lis lawyer 
the state department letter said the lis qualify for refugee 
status under federal law but did not specifically mention the 
abortion issue 
they got really just a form letter rimar said 
the letter rejected refugee status for the lis nephew chun 
kong cheung who accompanied them on their trip to the united 
states but rimar said she would ask the state department to 
reconsider based on new evidence that the chinese government has 
been looking for chun and that he might face sterilization or death 
if forced to return 
li a 37yearold machinist and his 34yearold wife fled their 
hometown of fuzhou last year when ms wang became pregnant with 
what would have been the couples second child chinese law limits 
most families to one child and requires women who conceive again to 
undergo abortions 
the couple paid smugglers in canada about 1500 apiece to get 
into the united states illegally but the ins caught them in 
albany ms wang was allowed to remain in the united states because 
of her advanced pregnancy but li was sent back to canada 
when he and his nephew tried to cross the border again last 
october they were caught at the international peace bridge in 
buffalo and jailed after bush issued his order they applied for 
asylum under it and reached a plea bargain on the illegalentry 
charges that freed them from jail 
chun cannot be deported until 1994 in any case thanks to a 
presidential order covering all chinese refugees rimar said 
the lis who are now working in restaurants in new york city 
will have to return to buffalo for an interview with the ins but 
that will be little more than a formality rimar said 
john ingham ins district director in buffalo was not in his 
office this morning and did not immediately return a telephone call 
seeking comment 
the state departments policy is not to comment on individual 
asylum cases a spokesman said

when the captain of the uss conyngham 
reached the bridge minutes after a fire swept through his ship he 
feared he might have to order the crew to abandon ship he said 
today 
but when i saw the determination of the faces of my men all 
those thoughts left my mind cmdr william r williams told 
reporters in front of the damaged guided missile destroyer at the 
norfolk naval station 
the fire tuesday killed the ships operations officer lt cmdr 
algernon pope gordon jr and injured 18 crewmen gordons 
promotion to lieutenant commander was to have taken effect in a few 
weeks but the navy said today it gave him the honor posthumously 
a hole 6 feet by 5 feet has been cut in the ships aluminum 
superstructure for repair work inside the ship bulkheads melted 
overhead decks were missing and insulation and wire hung everywhere 
williams said about 90 percent of the crew was asleep when the 
fire broke out at 5 am in the forward boiler room after a major 
fuel leak 
the fire quickly rose up through passageways burning through 
decks and sending black inky smoke through berthing spaces he 
said the decks were red hot with fireballs periodically exploding 
out of hatches he said 
because the fire was in the middle of the ship the crew was 
split half on the bow half on the stern officers mobilized 
firefighting crews and worked inward to battle the blaze williams 
said 
petty officer 2nd class otis tate 24 of hartwell ga said he 
ran from his berth to his battle station on the mess deck a 
fiveyear navy man tate said passageways were filled with smoke 
when he led a sevenman crew into the fire area with fire 
extinguishers 
this is my first shipboard fire and i hope its my last 
tate said 
williams said the crew had been training for a major inspection 
which would have tested their firefighting skills for us the 
exam came early he said

floods have killed at least 11 people wrecked 
hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 18000 
people in the bashkiria region of the southern ural mountains 
officials said today 
three people were reported missing 
the soviet press has been largely silent about the flooding 
which began about a week ago when the belaya or white river 
overflowed its banks due to heavy rains and melting snow 
alexei i kharlov deputy prime minister of the bashirian 
autonomous republic said by telephone that the flood submerged 130 
villages and 13000 houses eleven people were killed and three 
were missing he said 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda and the unofficial news 
agency postfactum put the death toll at 14 with one missing the 
tv news program vremya said loss of life has occurred but did 
not give a figure 
damage was estimated at 161 million said postfactum one of 
several independent news agencies that began in the soviet union in 
recent years 
authorities used helicopters to rescue people from some of the 
villages inundated by rising waters that destroyed hundreds of 
houses and submerged hundreds of miles of roads and railways the 
communist party daily pravda reported 
the floods ruined 90 bridges and swept away telephone and power 
lines in the region between the industrial cities of ufa and 
chelyabinsk 720 miles east of moscow said komsomolskaya pravda 
the communist youth newspaper 
farm lands were devastated and more than 160000 cattle were 
cut off from pastures or stalls 
this flooding has beaten all the records pravda reported 
quoting the deputy prime minister of the bashkirian soviet 
autonomous republic e galin the region is part of the russian 
federation the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
it was the third disaster to strike bashkiria over the last 
year a gas pipeline explosion near ufa in may claimed more than 
600 lives and toxic wastes poisoned tap water in ufa last month 
postfactum said the latest flooding also raised the danger of 
overflow from lakes that have been used to collect radioactive 
wastewater from nearby nuclear production facilities 
lev g strobbe deputy chief of the chelyabinsk region executive 
commitee said that so far i can assure you that there is no 
danger from these lakes in connection with this flooding 
but he said if worse comes to worst the contamained silt 
will go by way of northern rivers into the arctic ocean and the 
consequences may be disastrous

the interior minister said today he held farright 
leader jeanmarie le pen indirectly responsible for the desecration 
of a jewish cemetery in which a corpse was dug up and impaled on an 
umbrella 
le pen denied responsibility and said the desecration of 34 
tombs at the cemetery in southcentral carpentras was probably 
planned by people who wanted to discredit the extreme right 
frances national assembly suspended its session for 15 minutes 
today in protest and leaders across the political spectrum reacted 
with outrage at the vandalism which was discovered early thursday 
relatives held an impromptu religious ceremony at the cemetery 
while about 50 jewish demonstrators gathered outside under a banner 
reading we will not let history repeat itself 
interior minister pierre joxe said several tombs in carpentras 
were left in conditions so abominable that one cant describe 
them without embarrassment joxe traveled to the town to inspect 
the site 
the body of an 81yearold man who died about two weeks ago was 
found impaled on an umbrella police said grave markers had been 
knocked over and flower pots were trampled 
a previously unknown group calling itself the mohamed el 
boukima group claimed responsibility in a phone call to a local 
newspaper police said they were trying to authenticate the call 
authorities said the fingerprints of at least four people were 
found on tomb stones 
the incident occurred two days after a nationwide telecast of a 
threehour documentary about nazi germany and the holocaust 
officials in strasbourg meanwhile reported that a jewish 
cemetery there had been desecrated twenty tomb stones were 
overturned between april 12 and may 4 at the wissembourg israelite 
cemetery they said 
and in a related incident swastikas and nazi graffiti were 
scrawled on official buildings in rambouillet near paris 
officials said 
joxe said le pen of the extremeright national front was a 
racist and provocateur the farright party has been accused of 
condoning antisemitism and other forms of racism 
consequently he like all racists like all who express their 
antisemitism in an explicit or implicit fashion he is obviously 
one of those responsible not by the acts at carpentras yesterday 
by all that has been inspired by racist hate for years 
le pen in denmark for a meeting of rightwing european 
politicians said the incident was a plot to soil his partys 
reputation 
it seems more and more evident that it is a political plot 
against the national front he said from his hotel north of 
copenhagen i dont feel guilty at all in this case i condemn 
those who did this and i condemn all those who organized this 
after le pen left the hotel about 400 demonstrators threw 
paint smoke bombs and empty bottles at police danish radio 
reported the demonstration which appeared unrelated to the tomb 
desecrations in france occurred outside the marienlyst hotel in 
helsingoer 25 miles north of copenhagen 
protesters shouted fascists and le pen go home and 
several windows were smashed by stones 
in a telegram to carpentras jewish leader freddy haddad 
president francois mitterrand said i learned with horror of this 
criminal act 
mitterrand later went to the home of frances chief rabbi rabbi 
sitruk to express his distress ive come as one does for a 
family in mourning mitterrand said 
jean kahn leader of a national coalition of jewish groups said 
the desecration comes at a time when racial hatred is being 
encouraged by those who promote antisemitic rhetoric and fascist 
themes 
nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel who left the gala dinner 
opening the cannes film festival after learning of the desecration 
said a racist climate was on the rise in france 
french society must now examine its conscience and 
urgently he said 
mayor jeanclaude andrieu described carpentras as a quiet town

japans most famous waterbird a trafficstopping 
duck returned to her tokyo pond friday after being scared away by 
a horde of photographers and a wildlife worker hoping to mend the 
birds bad leg 
for at least a decade the spotbilled duck has returned each may 
to a decorative pond in front of the headquarters of trading giant 
mitsui and co and hatched a brood of ducklings 
a few weeks later after the young birds are strong swimmers 
the mother has herded them across an eightlane road to spend the 
summer in the imperial palace moat 
the operation requires a squad of police to stop traffic and 
usually there are five times as many photographers as ducks the 
ducks passage has become a rite of summer that is reported as 
avidly as the cherry blossoms in april 
this year the rite seemed in danger the duck had a bad leg and 
city authorities tried to capture it for medical treatment thursday 
night but the bird flew away apparently scared by a 
photographers camera flash photographers had promised not to use 
flashes 
mitsui reported the bird returned early friday still with a bad 
leg and press reports said another attempt might be made to 
capture it 
the japan wild birds society disagreed with the plan that 
duck was strong enough to escape said takio nakamura head of 
the societys protection department shes probably strong enough 
not to need protection 
but nakamura agreed that it is quite a special case 
because that duck is famous

a man who served more than seven years in 
prison for two mutilation slayings he says he didnt commit 
prepared today to leave jail for good and begin fighting to clear 
his name 
dale johnston learned of his release thursday after an appeals 
court ruled that prosecutors could not use evidence they claimed 
was crucial to obtaining a second conviction in the 1982 deaths of 
his stepdaughter and her fiance the prosecutors then dropped the 
case 
this day i knew would get here sooner or later johnston 
said in an interview at the licking county justice center i made 
it my no 1 priority now i plan to make finding the real killer of 
those kids my no 1 priority 
annette cooper johnston 18 and todd l schultz 19 both of 
logan were last seen alive in that southeast ohio community on oct 
4 1982 their torsos were found 10 days later in the hocking 
river other body parts were unearthed in a cornfield 
prosecutors contended jealousy was the motive for the killings 
and that johnston had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter 
johnston 56 was convicted in 1984 on two counts of aggravated 
murder and was sentenced to death the ohio supreme court in 1988 
threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial ruling that a 
witness whose memory had been refreshed by hypnosis had been 
improperly allowed to testify 
the second trial was put on hold last july after judge william 
gillie ruled that statements police obtained from johnston during 
8 hours of questioning without a lawyer present were inadmissible 
gillie also threw out clothing taken from johnston including 
boots that prosecutors linked to footprints near where the bodies 
were found 
on thursday a state appeals court unanimously upheld gillies 
decision saying police tried to deceive and coerce johnston into 
making statements against his will and gave no legitimate reason 
for so lengthy an interrogation 
prosecutor charles gerken dropped the case thursday afternoon 
and johnston would be released as soon as the order is filed with 
the franklin county clerk of courts said thomas tyack one of 
johnstons attorneys 
i still believe in the criminal justice system but i was a 
victim of some members of that profession who were not the best 
that they should be johnston said in thursdays interview he 
would not elaborate 
johnston wont say where hell go after his release for fear of 
retribution from people he claims have threatened him his family 
and his attorneys he and another defense lawyer robert suhr 
declined to identify any of the people 
johnstons exwife sarah said she was happy but indicated she 
still suffered emotional wounds you have to get over the grief 
but its always there every day i kid you not every day she 
said 
the johnstons are divorced she remarried and is living in 
southern ohio outside hocking county 
schultzs father donald said there is no doubt in his mind 
that johnston killed the two he knows who did it he did it 
schultz said he noted that johnston was found guilty by three 
trial judges

a ferry carrying 66 passengers ignored 
warning shots friday from gen michel aouns gunners to reach a 
port controlled by rival christian militia forces authorities said 
the shelling came two days after aoun declared the coastline of 
the christian enclave off limits to international shipping that 
was in an effort to keep supplies from reaching the lebanese forces 
militia commanded by his rival samir geagea 
police said aouns gunners on a mountain ridge overlooking the 
mediterranean fired two warning shots from a 155mm howitzer at the 
victory i ferry as it approached the port of jounieh on friday 
morning jounieh is controlled by geageas forces 
the ship arriving from larnaca cyprus stopped a few miles 
offshore for about two hours before heading into the port it let 
off its 66 passengers and then headed back to cyprus police said 
the ferry is one of the few remaining links to the outside world 
for residents of the christian enclave which is surrounded on land 
by syrian troops and their moslem militia allies 
police said four civilians were wounded when aouns gunners 
fired on the beirut port at midday to keep geageas machine 
gunmounted speedboats away 
the battle for control of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
has left 930 people dead and 2576 wounded since it erupted jan 30 
geageas militia controls most of the christian enclaves 
28milelong coastline 
geageas speedboats are blockading a threemile coastal strip at 
dbaye between beirut and jounieh where aouns forces have set up 
a makeshift harbor to try to bring in military supplies 
both sides have been reported to be running low on ammunition 
rival christian snipers in frontline positions in east beirut 
and the surrounding hinterland kept most of the enclaves roads 
closed to traffic for a fourth straight day friday 
police said only mediators representing patriarch nasrallah 
sfeir spiritual head of the maronite catholic sect were allowed 
to pass through checkpoints manned by the rival christian forces 
they were shuttling between geageas seaside command post near 
jounieh and aouns headquarters at the hilltop presidential palace 
in baabda in an effort work out a ceasefire a police spokesman 
said 
aoun has rejected an arab leaguebrokered peace accord 
supported by syria to end lebanons manysided civil war because 
it does not guarantee the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops 
geagea has recognized the syrianbacked government of president 
elias hrawi and cautiously accepted the peace plan which calls for 
an equal distribution of power between christians and moslems 
in south lebanon meanwhile rival shiite moslem factions allied 
with syria and iran declared a ceasefire friday morning in iqlim 
altuffah 
fighting between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
and the prosyrian amal militia has been raging in the area since 
dec 23 
the confrontation is part of a 2yearold struggle for control 
of lebanons 12 million shiites who make up the largest single 
sect in the country

the city council decided today that the 
federal law allowing the death penalty for some drugrelated 
homicides has no place here overwhelmingly approving a measure 
aimed at blocking enforcement 
the council voted 103 to approve a resolution urging the citys 
law officers to bypass the us attorneys office if the death 
penalty is at stake officers instead would be urged to turn cases 
over to state and local prosecutors because minnesota has no death 
penalty 
my personal opinion is that the death penalty serves no useful 
societal purpose said council member joan campbell chief 
sponsor of the resolution 
im not in any way suggesting that the crimes are not 
heinous campbell continued i dont think its the 
responsibility of a civilized society to kill people if they kill 
other people 
but council member dennis schulstad who opposed the resolution 
said the message were sending is that we care much more about 
the criminals in this city than we care about the victims 
another opponent on the council walt dziedzic argued that it 
sends the wrong message out there that this city this great 
city is soft on crime 
the resolution was sparked by a 1988 federal law that sanctions 
the death penalty for some drugrelated homicides 
in the first use of the law federal prosecutors in chicago said 
thursday they will seek the death penalty against two men accused 
of murdering a federal witness to protect their 50000aday drug 
ring 
before the vote campbell said passage of her resolution would 
show that we dont like the death penalty and we dont like the 
federal government telling the state of minnesota what to do she 
added that it is not a deterrent to crime its been proven over 
and over again 
the resolution was approved 41 last week by a city council 
panel 
my hope is that this sets an example to other jurisdictions 
and to other cities that they can say no to the federal death 
penalty said hennepin county attorney tom johnson who helped 
draft the resolution 
critics say the resolution lacks teeth because federal 
authorities could step in and try a homicide case even if local 
officials didnt refer it to them 
schulstad who voted against the resolution last week called it 
strictly a public relations thing 
minneapolis police lt richard huss the only person to testify 
against the resolution last week said thursday that the measure 
would call attention to what he considers the states already lax 
criminal system 
us attorney jerome arnold in minneapolis said he is willing to 
push for the death penalty in the first appropriate case 
minnesota has not had such a case so far he said but with 
the attendant violence to drug crimes there is some degree of 
likelihood that a homicide would fall into the federal categories

the kgb is in town tormenting the british with 
boasts about yet another top traitor in the kim philby mold 
possibly the longsought fifth man 
this latest caper includes a soviet tv movie on the affair and a 
kgb public relations man who was in london on friday to help answer 
reporters questions 
some scholars of espionage have long suspected that soviet 
penetration of the british secret service did not end with the 
unmasking of guy burgess donald maclean anthony blunt and harold 
kim philby and that there was probably a fifth man 
others maintain the kgb has deliberately fostered the theory to 
keep western intelligence in doubt 
until now the hunt for the fifth man has leaned heavily on 
conjecture dragging several illustrious british names through the 
mud now comes the kgb almost gleefully claiming the speculation 
is true 
yuri modin one of philbys handlers says in a soviet film 
about the spys exploits that the fifth one is not known to our 
exenemy exopponent so i am not in a position to tell you 
anything about that 
so a fifth man really existed yes thats a fact has he 
met him yes i know him personally 
is he an interesting man well now ill try to avoid your 
question he is an interesting man with his own peculiarities 
etc with his own ideas 
at a preview of the film at a london televison studio kgb press 
officer col igor prelin gave more details claiming the fifth man 
is of philbys generation and retired from espionage work 
philby died in moscow in 1988 at 76 he implied that the kgb had 
asked the fifth man if he would like to be identified and the 
answer was no 
this person has done a great deal for us why should we do him 
harm prelin said 
was he in the soviet union no britain prelin wouldnt say 
had he ever received a title or other honor in britain no comment 
but then prelin offered another little secret these five 
people had information covering all the different departments and 
institutions of the british government 
philby was in the secret service blunt worked for the royal 
family and burgess and maclean for the foreign office and the 
fifth man work it out for yourself said prelin 
a british reporter grumbled that it all sounded like typical 
kgb mischiefmaking not at all insisted prelin but when asked 
why the kgb was divulging the fifth mans existence he replied 
through an interpreter that it gives us pleasure 
the philby group converted to communism while at cambridge 
university in the 1930s served the kremlin faithfully until its 
unmasking after world war ii in fact the documentary says philby 
helped set up the cia while posted to washington until philbys 
defection in 1963 it was one of the most successful intelligence 
operations in history 
the film comrade philby was made by the soviet state film 
company and was being screened on soviet tv friday night british 
viewers will see it monday 
one man who dismisses the fifth man theory is historian hugh 
trevorroper now lord dacre 
i just dont believe them ill consider it if somebody 
produces evidence but i dont regard statements by the kgb as 
evidence he said 
he noted that oleg gordievsky a senior kgb officer who defected 
to britain had insisted publicly that there was no fifth man 
i can see no reason why gordievsky should not be speaking the 
truth he said i can see why the kgb would be telling a lie 
just to keep us worried 
rupert allison a conservative member of parliament said he 
thought the soviets may have revived the fifth man issue because 
they were unhappy that gordievsky appearing on british television 
nobody likes insiders spilling the beans said allison who 
writes about espionage under the pseudonym nigel west i think 
it is not improbable to believe that the kgb is saying weve all 
got our secrets and if you try to embarrass us with gordievsky we 
will respond

police have launched a dragnet for 20 
fugitive student and dissident leaders believed to have instigated 
or led violent antigovernment protests this week prosecutors said 
friday 
police said homes schools and other places frequented by those 
in hiding will be searched in one of the largest crackdowns on the 
opposition in recent months 
dissidents are being sought in connection with nationwide 
protests on wednesday by about 100000 radicals during the 
violence protesters burned a us diplomatic building in the 
capital 
i think it just happened to be a target of opportunity said 
us assistant secretary of state richard solomon but he added 
mindless violence is the enemy of democracy 
prosecutors said 55 protesters were formally arrested friday for 
violating a law banning firebombs and for participating in illegal 
rallies in connection with the violence 
another 129 people were given summary court trials and sentenced 
to jail terms of up to 30 days prosecutors said 
despite government warnings against violence dissidents said 
friday they would step up antigovernment protests to topple the 
government of president roh taewoo and radical students staged 
scattered protests 
in the southern city of kwangju about 1500 students hurled 
firebombs and rocks when riot police used tear gas to block 
antigovernment protesters from marching off chosun university the 
south korean news agency yonhap reported 
in seoul six radical students armed with firebombs and iron 
bars seized a thirdfloor office in south koreas tax 
administration headquarters they demanded roh resign saying his 
economic policies favored big companies 
police immediately charged into the building knocked down 
barricaded doors with hammers and arrested the six one protester 
was injured 
in leaflets scattered through the building the protesters 
accused rohs government of implementing a tax system that favored 
the rich 
with inflation climbing criticism of rohs government has 
mounted among south koreans housing and other prices have nearly 
doubled since roh took office in february 1988 
police took 1084 protesters into custody in seoul on thursday 
when more than 6000 students and dissidents staged violent street 
protests in capital and nine other cities for the second 
consecutive day 
thousands of riot police have remained on alert in seoul since 
students demanding rohs resignation rampaged through central seoul 
on wednesday burning police vehicles and setting fire to an office 
of the us information service 
about 150 people including 100 police were injured 
the violence coincided with the inaugural convention of the 
newly created democratic liberal party opponents contend the 
gigantic new governing coalition a merger of the ruling party with 
two opposition groups was a political coup that altered party 
alliances without an election 
the protests were the largest and most violent since nationwide 
demonstrations forced former authoritarian president chun doohwan 
to announce major reforms three years ago those reforms included 
popular presidential elections that put roh in power 
the government has said it will take firm action against labor 
and political violence contending south koreas sagging economy 
cannot endure further disturbances

they didnt eat their peas they never call and 
they almost always hold their annual meeting on mothers day 
whats a mom to do with the members of the american psychiatric 
association 
for the fifth straight year apa members will spend that special 
day in meetings courses and talks prompting this headline in the 
wall street journal oedipus wrecks mothers day 
instead of taking mother to brunch the psychiatrists will 
attend sessions such as psychological management of 
schizophrenia object relations theory in general psychiatry 
and new developments in geriatric psychiatry 
well docs heres an old development in geriatric psychiatry 
your elderly mom would like some attention on the second sunday in 
may 
seth stein executive director of the apas new york state 
affiliate said that over the years some members have complained 
about the conventions scheduling but he said that finding a time 
thats good for 10000 people and a city that can accommodate 
them all is not easy 
in the grand scheme of things i cant see what relevance this 
has he sniffed he also pointed out that the official opening 
session was not until 5 pm which would allow members to 
telephone their mothers if theyre not visiting the bronx zoo 
the world trade center or times square 
john hoffman manager of convention services for the citys 
tourism bureau said mothers day weekend was not prime convention 
time 
its kind of sacred he said i cant even get a lot of my 
own people to work 
the psychiatrists have met on mothers day 10 times in the past 
22 years a tradition that even the election of the groups first 
woman president in 1985 did not weaken 
but change looms although the association will meet in new 
orleans next year on mothers day lots of distractions there too 
in the following three years the session will be on other 
weekends in may 
i think its very likely well not be scheduling any more 
meetings on mothers day said dr elissa benedek the 
organizations presidentelect

a man who used the hours of a brief 
prison furlough to murder his former wife was sentenced today to 
die in the electric chair after he told a judge she was to blame 
for her death 
alan l matheney was condemned by lake superior court judge 
james e letsinger for the beating death of lisa m bianco 
matheney 39 stood silently as letsinger read the sentence 
moments earlier matheney had blamed ms bianco herself for her 
slaying saying she had conspired with st joseph county prosecutor 
michael barnes to imprison him unjustly he had been in prison for 
attacking her at the time of the furlough 
it was the illegal acts these two people did to me that led to 
the acts of march 4 the day ms bianco was beaten to death in 
1989 matheney said 
the death stirred widespread outrage among advocates for 
battered women in part because prison officials admitted they had 
failed to notify ms bianco that the furlough had been approved 
despite her requests for such notice 
after the couples 1985 divorce matheney was sentenced to two 
years for criminal confinement for taking the children out of 
state in 1987 he was arrested for attacking ms bianco and 
pleaded guilty to assault in exchange for the dismissal of rape and 
confinement charges 
no execution date was set the conviction and death sentence 
will be appealed automatically to the indiana supreme court 
the victims father eugene bianco said he was pleased with the 
sentence 
i just hope they carry it out and im there to pull the 
switch he said 
letsinger a special judge in the case could have sentenced 
matheney to a maximum 80year prison term if he had not ordered the 
death penalty matheney was convicted april 11 
matheneys attorney scott l king said prior to the sentencing 
that his client was emotionally disturbed and unable to control 
himself when he beat ms bianco to death 
this was a crime of passion said king disputing 
prosecutors contentions that the crime was coldly planned 
matheney had violated the terms of his pass and an earlier court 
order when he left central indiana during his furlough bound for 
ms biancos home in mishawaka in the northern part of the state 
after a brief confrontation in the house he chased ms bianco 
into the street and clubbed her with an unloaded shotgun outside a 
neighbors house 
the states prison furlough program was suspended after her 
death and later reinstated with tightened restrictions that would 
have prevented matheneys release

see the pope at tuxtla gutierrez the 28 dead included the bishop 
of tapachula a city near the border with guatemala 
the pope had not been scheduled to enter the cathedral but a 
brief memorial was arranged so he could pray for the victims and 
comfort their families 
the pope prayed and kissed the bishop luis miguel canton marins 
coffin then spoke to and blessed a group of 16 weeping mourners 
death is not the last word because for those who have faith 
life does not end it transforms itself the pope said 
illuminated and aided by that truth we raise our petition to 
the lord for those who died and invoke consolation for those who 
mourn their loved ones john paul said 
the pontiff sprinkled holy water on the bishops coffin and 
spoke individually to 16 mourners many of whom burst into tears 
we have faith we will see him again said rogelio gutierrez 
the bishops brotherinlaw 
the pope then proceeded to a scheduled outdoor service where he 
addressed a huge crowd that included refugees from guatemala 
fleeing repression in their native country 
the popes visit to tuxtla gutierrez 425 miles southeast of 
mexico city was partly designed to counter expanding protestant 
sects which are finding fertile ground in the hopeless poverty of 
the peasants and those who have moved to neighborhoods of shacks in 
the cities 
on thursday john paul criticized family planning and 
materialism as he hopscotched across northern mexico telling a 
crowd of more than 500000 that workers should not become cogs in 
an immense production machine 
the crowd the largest the pope had drawn on his eightday trip 
to mexico gathered thursday evening in monterrey the nations 
third largest city to hear a homily entitled the sanctification 
of work 
without denying the good results obtained where a free 
system reigns he said we still cannot be blind to the defects 
of an economic system that not infrequently makes riches and 
consumption its principal engine 
the throng gathered on a riverbed and surrounding hills roared 
and waved acres of flags and pennants as the pontiff spoke above 
the altar was a billboard reading welcome john paul ii 
flanked by two ads for carta blanca beer one of the citys largest 
industries 
earlier thursday in chihuahua john paul criticized this 
largely roman catholic countrys family planning program called 
for freedom of religious education and demanded greater parental 
input on sex education in public schools 
the crowds in chihuahua and monterrey included many us 
residents the two cities are respectively 225 and 100 miles from 
the border with texas 
in chihuahua the pope launched an impassioned attack on 
artificial contraception a controversial issue in mexico which 
has one of the third worlds most succesful family planning 
programs and where the church is banned from taking political 
positions 
if in the conjugal union the possibility of conceiving a 
child is artificially eliminated the couple closed themselves to 
god and opposed his will john paul said 
on wednesday the pope had linked materialism and contraception 
by saying that materialism is often the force behind population 
control efforts 
mexicos family planning program has helped cut the population 
growth rate from nearly 37 percent in 1977 to 19 percent 
according to government figures government health clinics 
distribute contraceptives and perform vasectomies but abortion is 
illegal 
nearly half of married women use contraceptives according to 
international planned parenthood figures still the population has 
increased nearly 30 percent since john paul first visited in 1979 
reaching 85 million 
the popes position has attracted hostile comments in a country 
where infant mortality illiteracy and malnutrition are severe 
problems

sandra hartman a pistolpacking landlady banged 
on the open apartment door with her 380caliber automatic and 
peered in at the litter of cocaine bags and razors lying among 
broken toys 
maintenance anybody here she called crunching broken 
glass underfoot as she made sure no one was hiding in the apartment 
look at this theyve been burning in here she said 
pointing to carpet burns and blackened aluminum cans more evidence 
of cocaine but i could fix this place up this apartment real 
easy the cabinets are still here and the floors ok for about 
5000 
gordon valley is 200 bulletriddled lowcost apartments in a 
seedy section of martin luther king jr drive its also the newest 
stop on ms hartmans daily and nightly patrols of her 11 
lowcost apartment complexes 
wearing her bulletproof vest mrs hartman evicts drug users and 
pushers disperses loiterers and punishes litterers she says its 
the only way to keep the good tenants 
during a visit in december us housing and urban development 
secretary jack kemp praised mrs hartmans antidrug approach to 
housing but she says she will lose all her properties unless 
someone in the government lends a hand 
in a city where 20 percent of lowcost housing is substandard 
and more than 700 people are on the atlanta housing authoritys 
waiting list for openings ms hartman has a reputation as a firm 
but just landlady 
ms hartman shell work with you said ann parks who has 
lived at oak valley court a complex that won a federal rental 
rehabilitation award for a year i help though when they fight 
out here i talk to both sides to try to stop it i say this 
neighborhood ought to get along together 
ms hartman spends about 10000 a month on 24hour security for 
the complexes she has fenced in the largest overlook atlanta 
where tenants say they now feel secure 
one time a lot of young kids would be hanging around the 
corner all day and you know what they were doing with their gold 
chains on and their cars with the gold trim said donna dawson 
who has lived at the complex two years now the tenants are real 
proud at how clean it is 
ms hartman doesnt believe she can stop drug trafficking the 
traffic from overlook atlanta simply moved across the street to a 
convenience store she says and one dealer known to tenants as 
frog has managed to elude her 
he was hassling me one day ms dawson said he said he 
was going to shoot me but hes not as big as hed like us to think 
he is other dealers repeatedly have threatened her 
ms hartman 41 bought her first lowcost complex eight years 
ago three years later she had 1400 units throughout the city and 
a 5 percent vacancy rate drugrelated evictions have dropped her 
occupancy rate to about 30 percent

hasnt made mortgage payments on some complexes since january she 
expects a response on her request for federal aid including a 
moratorium on back payments within the month without it she says 
she could lose everything 
if i dont get the mortgage payments reduced all the 
efforts ive made risking my life all ive done for my tenants 
and my kids will be for nothing because they will be boarded up 
again ms hartman said 
how could they allow 1400 units to be slums again 
ms hartman has 500000 in federal funds to renovate gordon 
valley but no one will lend her the 700000 more she needs and 
mayor maynard jackson hasnt answered her proposal to house the 
homeless in her projects instead of building more projects as 
jackson has proposed 
ms hartman said she has always been a survivor she left the 
poor coalmining town near st louis where she grew up with 60 and 
no college education she came to atlanta succeeded in real estate 
and opened her own firm hartman investment co 
i believe in what im doing i know i can provide safe 
affordable housing for people she said if i give up i lose 
and they lose if somebody would listen to me we all could win

one of the three leading parties 
walked out of romanias makeshift parliament friday to protest 
recent violent attacks on opposition leaders 
the national peasant partys pullout symbolized the growing 
tension before romanias first free elections in more than 50 
years planned for may 20 
antigovernment protesters seeking the resignation of former 
communists including interim president ion iliescu demonstrated 
for the 20th straight day in downtown bucharest about 5000 
government supporters rallied a halfmile away 
on thursday the united states announced it was recalling its 
ambassador because of concerns the elections will not be entirely 
free and fair 
ion diaconescu vice president of the peasant party told a 
session of the provisional council of national unity the interim 
parliament that his group was withdrawing its three deputies 
two other deputies joined the peasant party in the pullout it 
was prompted by opposition accusations that the dominant national 
salvation front is behind recent attacks on its opponents and is 
using its leading position to manipulate state funds and the media 
in an afternoon session parliament scrapped a 1978 decree that 
placed the state radio and television under government control 
opposition members have claimed the government has interfered with 
independent broadcasting 
until the elections radio and television will be subject to 
control by the provisional parliament 
the peasant party was one of romanias main political parties 
before world war ii and claims to have attracted some 600000 
members since communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was ousted by a 
popular revolt in december 
on wednesday ion ratiu the peasants candidate for president 
in the may election joined with another opposition leader radu 
campeanu of the national liberal party in offering to withdraw 
from the race 
the two said they would pull out if iliescu also withdrew and 
agreed that the president be elected by the new parliament instead 
of by direct ballot 
iliescu and his national salvation front are favored to win both 
the presidential and parliamentary votes 
in a letter made public friday iliescu said the front rejects 
any monopoly on power and seeks a ruling coalition to steer romania 
out of its political and economic chaos 
we dont claim to possess absolute truths but we do not have 
wonder solutions either iliescu said 
he suggested that the front a loose coalition of intellectuals 
and disaffected communists was the target of unfair accusations 
that it seeks to reestablish marxist rule 
the anxiety felt by public opinion across the nation is caused 
by exclusivist slogans obsessively recited untruths and sincere or 
fake fears apt to generate uncontrollable evolutions toward chaos 
and violence the 60yearold interim leader said 
ratiu and campeanu both have been physically attacked during 
electoral rallies in southeastern romania in the past two weeks 
while they did not directly blame the front for the attacks 
some romanian newspapers said the assaults were meant to discourage 
opposition and the electorate in the may vote which is to be the 
countrys first free elections since 1937 
the us embassy in a statement issued friday said ambassador 
alan green was being called to washington to give his account of 
the campaign and underlined that fair free elections were crucial 
to developing good ties

retail sales held back by another big drop in 
auto demand fell 06 percent in april the biggest setback in six 
months the government said friday 
the commerce department said sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 
14864 billion last month after a 02 percent decline in march and 
no change in february 
disappointed private economists who had been hoping for a small 
rebound in activity warned that the lackluster sales would likely 
translate into slower economic growth in the months ahead as 
businesses face growing inventories of unsold products 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity has been the driving force during much of the 
economic recovery in its eighth year a record for peacetime 
we have now had three months in a row of weak retail sales 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co the consumer 
is fading from the scene 
sandra shaber senior economist at the futures group said that 
at this stage of the recovery there is little pentup demand left 
the most disturbing trend here is the weakness in department 
store sales thats a pretty good indicator of the overall mood 
of consumers she said 
analysts said that unless consumer spending weakens further the 
country should still be able to avoid a recession although the 
predicted overall growth as measured by the gross national product 
would expand at a sluggish pace of 2 percent this year 
the 06 percent april decline in retail sales was the largest 
monthly drop since a 14 percent plunge in october the march and 
april declines marked the first time retail sales have posted 
consecutive monthly declines in almost three years 
the biggest drag on activity came from auto sales which dropped 
27 percent it marked the sixth time in the last seven months that 
car sales have fallen analysts said that was particularly 
worrisome because it was coming at a time when auto companies were 
offering heavy incentives to reduce inventories 
the consumer has clearly backed off said david wyss an 
economist at drimcgraw hill a consulting company in lexington 
mass the incentives are costing car companies a lot of money and 
sales are still weak 
even without the big drop in car sales spending in other retail 
areas was weak 
sales at general department stores were off 07 percent in april 
after an even bigger 12 percent drop in march the late easter had 
been expected to boost sales in early april 
sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 26 percent 
in april after an 08 percent decrease the previous month 
sales at gasoline stations fell by 1 percent restaurant sales 
were off by 02 percent while sales at speciality clothing stores 
were down 19 percent 
in the only major areas showing gains sales at furniture and 
home furnishing stores edged up 04 percent while sales at drug 
stores posted a 12 percent gain

from his vantage point on the edge of a 
floodswollen lake royce fikes can look in a 360degree circle and 
see nothing but water 
fikes 74 is a solitary sentry against a raging waterway the 
trinity river the river was forced from its banks by record 
flooding in north and east texas that killed 12 people in the state 
and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage 
authorities in southeast texas expect the river to crest there 
next week 
fikes a resident of the community of sportsmans paradise on 
the upper end of lake livingston about 80 miles north of houston 
uses a boat to get around the flooded homes and trailers abandoned 
there most of his neighbors have left he said late thursday 
some of us is trying to hang around and more or less try to 
watch after the place he said guarding against the everpresent 
threat of looters some using boats is his big worry he said 
if the water gets up real far we can cut the electricity 
off he said until then he said he watches television and 
answers an occasional telephone call 
his car is underwater so when its time to check out one of the 
25 scattered homes in the development he goes by boat 
i have been going out fishing some too he said but the 
fish are not fighting too good the water is too swift i wont get 
into that fastmoving water 
in another floodstricken community near the lake vivian and 
el butler are also prepared to flee their mobile home if they 
feel endangered the waters have reached her yard but still are 
not near her home said mrs butler 
im naturally nervous and watching it real close and dont 
intend to stay if it gets bad she said 
right now i love it here and i wouldnt move unless it forces 
me out said mrs butler who retired to sportsmans paradise 
with her husband 
the butlers are among a small group sticking it out on the 
highest ground in the subdivision the lakeside property has 
flooded before but this time the waters are expected to keep the 
area isolated for weeks 
john jadrosich of the trinity river authority said the region 
from lake livingston south to liberty midway between houston and 
beaumont could be flooded throughout the summer and into the fall 
mrs butler said the couple has a boat standing ready with life 
jackets food and clothing in case they need to flee 
ive put all my valuable papers and whatnot up in the bank 
ive got pictures and my bible in a metal box to take in the boat 
with me things that i dont want to lose she said weve 
moved everything up off the floor in case the water gets up high 
were just going to play it by ear 
trinity county judge jimmie thornton said he and other officials 
also will patrol the area by boat to prevent looting 
the lake is expected to reach about 7 feet above its normal 
level thornton said this flooding limit was designed for the 
hundred year flood and it looks like thats what were getting

here is the transcript of president bushs 
question and answer session with reporters aboard air force one 
today 
president bush im certainly looking forward to this visit to 
texas 
q well maybe you could help us 
q we need help 
a im not sure i can help anybody 
q there seems to be so much confusion these days over what your 
lips are reading on the subject of taxes 
a well why dont you just listen to what i say and see what we 
do and theres no subject the question is theres no conditions 
thats the way it is thats the way its going to be and thats 
the way it must be and so people can talk all day long pointing 
prematurely to discussion of one subject or another and ill 
simply repeat that i have made this proposal that we meet with no 
conditions and thats exactly the way its going to be 
and were hearing comments from you people by that i mean 
astute journalists wanting to probe beyond where im ready to 
speak were hearing comments from the political left middle 
center right and my position is ive made this offer to sit down 
in good faith and talk with no conditions and thats exactly the 
way its going to be 
q did your chief of staff accurately reflect your posture 
though when he said 
a i would ask you to reflect my posture to talk about what i 
say and ive spelled it out just as well as i possibly can just 
as clearly and tomorrow therell be a flap on something else and 
the next day a flap on something else but i am determined to 
address this problem in good faith in the way ive told you so i 
would respectfully suggest you take your guidance from me on this 
one because thats the way it is 
qhow are you going to be able to get to mars in 30 years since 
were hobbled by 
a with a laugh going to have to go fairly fast its a long 
way out there 
q how about financially how are you going to do it 
a well 30 years is a long time 
q did speaker foley seem concerned yesterday when you talked to 
him is he getting conflicting signals 
a yeah you know i keep reading that i called foley to talk 
about this but then in fairness to foley he explained the way it 
was i wasnt concerned about that and he was yes he did express 
concern and i think he expressed it at a press conference but i 
think he sees the need to go forward on the basis i have called 
for and i respect him for that 
q mr president is it your posture that if taxes are to be 
discussed 
a look frank you can come at me all day long that would not 
be dealing in good faith to to if i started going into these 
details im not going to do it 
q let me ask you one other a nice try 
q do you feel that its inevitable that the grammrudman 
targets are going to have to be stretched out in this process that 
the budget cannot 
a im approaching this with the idea that we can if everybody 
comes together we can solve some significant problems out there 
so im not prejudging anything 
q do you still think the budget can be balanced by 93 
a well i think this is certainly an objective and we want to 
go forward and deal in good faith and i think everyone realizes 
something ought to be done so lets see if we can get something 
done but you know i dont contribute to it if i start talking 
about my approach or what i think is the right way to do it and try 
to dictate to anybody but ill be there with no preconditions and 
then well have a good negotiating team and see where we go 
so tomorrow therell be another tidal wave so keep your snorkel 
above the water level and do what you think is right it goes back 
to what my mom taught me when i was about six do your best do 
your best well im trying hard to stay calm q mr 
president 
a yes 
q is governor sununu in trouble 
a with a chuckle this so silly this is so stupid scattered 
laughter none of these congressmen are in trouble either im 
approaching it in very openly and i recognize theres 
controversy swirling around from one statement or another but 
look stay on track stay steady as she goes and be open deal 
frankly with people and to deal in the way i said no 
preconditions that doesnt im not going to show you my hand 
and i havent seen a lot of hands being laid down up on the hill 
but thats the way it ought to be if were going to get anywhere 
theres some tough decisions out there and weve got to discuss 
them discuss everything 
q has the deficit problem degenerated to the point that it 
really presents the country with almost an economic crisis 
situation 
a no i wouldnt say that at all i noticed the very salutary 
prediction yesterday about continued growth from some of the 
leading financial experts in the country and so thats good were 
not dealing in a crisis mentality but weve got a major deficit 
problem and weve got a law that says where it has to be the 
deficit and im determined to fulfill my obligations to comply 
with that law but were going to need cooperation because isnt 
going to be easy its going to be very difficult and people will 
be charged and countercharged but you cant be thinskinned in a 
business like this i cant react to every charge or some 
flamboyant congressman up there blasting me i mean thats not i 
dont think thats the way a president should conduct himself 
qdo you have any message for the 19 senators who wrote you or 
the conservatives who 
a no say hey listen say what you think democrats 
republicans leaders backbenchers columnists anybody say what 
you think but i think the president has a certain responsibility 
to stay cool and make clear to people that hes dealing in good 
faith and do my best and thats exactly what i intend to do and 
i cant be ruffled by these things or ive got to be understanding 
when people come forward and express themselves forcefully on 
something or other 
q would you call on the american people now and prepare them 
somehow to share the sacrifice to take the steps 
a well i think weve got to if we can hammer out a deal i 
certainly will make clear that we support it so lets wait and 
see what happens 
q is there any way out of this without raising revenues 
a well see what happens well just go there and discuss 
everything thats the way were going to do it open agenda open 
and thats the only way you can get strongwilled people to the 
table in good faith and thats the way it will be 
q do you have a timetable 
a and now if id only get going i might get to texas aampi 
before you guys do or a little later laughter 
president bush i hope ive been able to clarify all this for 
you thank you

the galileo spacecraft looping through 
the solar system on the way to its 1995 exploration of jupiter 
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it 
near earth late this year 
were trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move 
closer and closer to our aim point near earth on dec 8 said 
neal ausman mission director at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
galileos tiny rocket thrusters which are small enough to fit 
in the palm of a hand started firing at 1110 am pdt and will 
fire roughly 3000 times by the time the maneuver ends saturday 
afternoon laboratory spokesman jim wilson said 
the twoday maneuver will slow the spacecraft which was 
traveling about 66000 mph earlier today by about 25 mph it also 
will gradually alter its direction ausman said 
it is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring 
galileo within 1000 miles of earth which will act as a gravity 
slingshot to help expand the spacecrafts orbit around the sun and 
propel it toward jupiter he added without maneuvers the 
spacecraft would miss earth by 15 million miles 
as of today galileo was 96 million miles from earth but has 
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched 
from space shuttle atlantis last oct 18 its trip to jupiter will 
total 24 billion miles 
galileo will make a second swing past earth in december 1992 it 
flew past venus in another gravity slingshot maneuver on feb 9 
in july 1995 the spacecraft separates into a 4890pound 
orbiter and a 760pound probe they are scheduled to reach jupiter 
the solar systems largest planet on dec 7 1995 
the probe will plunge into the planets atmosphere relaying 
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by 
intense atmospheric pressure the orbiter will spend at least two 
years studying and taking snapshots of jupiter and its major moons

departments export enhancement program or eep 
dickerson said 313950 tons of wheat remain in the soviet 
unions current eep allocation only wheat has been approved for 
sale to the soviets under the price subsidy program 
the seventh year of the ussoviet grain agreement began oct 
1 with the latest sales the soviet union has bought more than 35 
million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and 133 million tons of

a little church that bought seven crack 
houses to turn them into affordable apartments has received praise 
from the federal drug czar but still needs more than 62000 to 
complete its task 
we have borrowed to our capacity we cant borrow any more 
said benjamin edwards jr executive treasurer of third shiloh 
missionary baptist church if we didnt put up our own money i 
could understand but we put up our own money 
a year ago the church voted to use its own 175000 building 
fund 20 years worth of church dinners car washes and sunday 
collection offerings to buy the abandoned duplex houses 
the 25yearold cinderblock church is buckling and edwards 
figures it will last only three to four years at best but across 
the street four unfinished duplexes testify to work put in by the 
church which has about 80 active members and 220 others who show 
up for occasional services 
more than 80 families have signed up for the 14 unfinished units 
we have people stopping here every day who want to rent the 
apartments but we just had to stop taking applications said 
edwards 
third shiloh hopes to have the first two duplexes finished by 
early june were rolling around the clock were working up to 
10 at night then coming out at 4 5 in the morning to try to get 
it completed edwards said 
when you all bought those houses and nailed them up and fixed 
them up i said oh boy what a relief benjamin brown an 
elderly man who lives across from the church told edwards 
four of the houses are on piety street separated only by a 
chainlink fence from the desire housing project one of the 
citys worst 
brown and oscar robertson whose house is next door to the 
church said that two summers ago their street was full of people 
buying or selling cocaine after a particularly rough fourth of 
july weekend police swat teams hauled out many of the dealers and 
patrolled the area brown and robertson said 
police were walking out here with rifles on their backs like 
it was vietnam said robertson 
when the church decided to buy the houses last year it 
estimated it would cost about 240000 to purchase and renovate 
them it borrowed 71000 in addition to its building fund and 
began work 
church members cut down the 6foothigh weeds that had grown 
around the houses they hauled away stairs to make it harder for 
vandals to get into the houses which stand on 4foot pilings to 
be safe from floods concrete foundations were dug and poured 
much of the work is being done by volunteers helped out by 
formerly unemployed workers who say they will work for whatever 
wages the church can pay them the contractor a former member of 
the church has deferred payment until the project is done edwards 
said 
the houses turned out to need a lot more work than first 
thought edwards said the roofs and many walls had to be replaced 
the houses also held tiny one and twobedroom apartments with 
kitchens hardly big enough to turn around in the congregation 
decided to build 25footlong additions to each building doubling 
the kitchen floor space and adding a bedroom and utility room to 
each apartment 
edwards estimated this week that the church needs at least 
62500 to complete the work 
the church has applied for 72000 in federal renovation money 
the maximum it is eligible to apply for but edward said he hasnt 
heard anything 
edwards does have a nice note of from federal drug czar william 
bennett along with a page from a speech in which he commended the 
church as an example of the sort of private initiative needed to 
fight drugs 
the hearst foundation has given 10000 freeport mcmoran inc 
2500 and the riley foundation 5000 with an offer of 5000 
more if the church can find an equal amount but all other 
contributions from outside the congregation have been from private 
citizens

knot next month his imperial parents arent even invited 
but there will be rice of the fermented drinkable sort and 
plenty of pomp 
in one of the final formalities before the ceremony imperial 
messenger yasuo shigeta dressed in a gray morning coat and 
carrying a silk top hat called on prince ayas fiancee kiko 
kawashima and her parents at their home friday to inform them the

emperor akihitos cousin prince norihito wed in december 1984 
aya is next in line to the throne after his brother crown prince 
naruhito who is 30 and has yet to choose a bride 
the marriage date was unofficially selected soon after ayas 
engagement received unanimous approval in september by the imperial 
household council a 10member body headed by prime minister 
toshiki kaifu 
details of how the government plans to conduct the wedding and 
parties afterward for which it has alloted roughly 1 million 
remained vague until a palace announcement this month 
the short ceremony will begin at midmorning at a shrine to the 
sun goddess amaterasu from whom legend says the imperial line 
descends 
like most of the wooded palace behind a moat and closely guarded 
gates few commoners have ever seen the wooden shrines which are

held july 2 aya and his bride will travel to the grand shrines of 
ise the center of sun goddess worship in japans indigenous shinto 
religion

grandfather the late emperor hirohito and japans first emperor 
jimmu who according to myth ascended in 660 bc

pair a tokyo kimono school has begun renting a 320000 kimono 
patterned after the 12layered one miss kawashima will wear 
getting into the bulky garment which weighs about 50 pounds 
can take up to three hours

officials of major cities are considering 
filing a second lawsuit against the census bureau over what they 
fear will be serious omissions in this years national head count 
hulbert james an assistant to new york mayor david dinkins 
said friday that there have been serious discussions of such a 
lawsuit because of potential differences between census counts and 
those of local governments 
james comments came after a meeting of the census committee of 
the us conference of mayors 
jessica heinz of the los angeles city attorneys office said 
talk of a new lawsuit may be premature although her city also has 
concerns about differences with the bureau 
lance simmens a staff members of the mayors group speculated 
that the census undercount could climb to 15 percent in 1980 only 
about 14 percent of americans were not counted 
peter bounpane deputy census director promptly disputed the 
simmens figure and said the comment was not appropriate 
the census isnt over yet bounpane said 
we had a plan and we are still following it the only thing 
that happened is that fewer people mailed back than budgeted which 
means we have to hire more people and spend more money he said 
the bureau had anticipated 70 percent of americans would respond 
by mail and so far only 63 percent have done so that means an 
extra 180 million or more to hire people to go doortodoor a 
process that is expected to continue for several weeks 
james echoed bounpanes comment that the count is not over and 
said many city officials are engaged in efforts to encourage their 
residents to cooperate with census takers 
one concern james said is to make sure that city and census 
officials cooperate during the census followup that will start in 
late summer especially in asking people if they were counted and 
finding those who were missed 
procedures for that cooperation and making sure that the census 
bureau has done everything possible to count everyone could be the 
focus of the new lawsuit james said 
a pending suit filed by several local governments wants to 
require that the final figures be adjusted to include people who 
were missed a new suit would be separate james said focusing on 
the counting process rather than adjustment

a senior us arms control negotiator friday 
rejected a soviet plea for talks on cutting tactical nuclear 
weapons at sea although the navys chief officer told congress 
such negotiations could be in our interests 
the top arms adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
told congress on tuesday that future talks on other nuclear and 
conventional weapons could be derailed by continued us resistence 
to naval arms talks 
ronald lehman director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency told a senate panel that the soviets had not formally 
insisted on linking naval weapons with other arms even though 
marshal sergei akhromeyev raised it before congress and so the 
united states isnt compelled to respond 
we have come to the conclusion that now is not the time to 
address the issue said lehman 
lehman said the administration remained optimistic it could 
reach agreement with moscow on the main provisions of a treaty 
cutting longrange nuclear weapons before gorbachev arrives in 
washington may 30 for a summit meeting the us has said progress 
on the treaty has slowed in recent weeks 
we see no reason why we shouldnt be able to get an 
agreement next week when secretary of state james a baker iii 
meets soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow said 
lehman 
gorbachev proposed at his meeting with bush in malta last 
december that the superpowers negotiate cuts in shortrange naval 
nuclear arms but the administration has resisted bush has said 
such cuts would undermine americas position as the predominant 
maritime power 
lehman said the bush administration saw no way negotiated 
reductions in shortrange naval nuclear arms mainly torpedoes 
depth bombs and antiship missiles would strengthen us 
security he said it could instead harm the security of us allies 
weve spent a lot of time studying it and we just havent 
found it to be in us interests lehman told the armed services 
subcommittee on projection forces 
but adm carlisle a h trost chief of naval operations took a 
different approach although he expressed doubt about soviet 
intentions in pursuing such negotiations trost said he could 
contemplate eliminating all tactical naval nuclear arms if related 
weapons such as bombers assigned to naval fleets also were banned 
if we could with proper confidence in their willingness to 
abide by an agreement be sure there were no nuclear weapons that 
threatened either sides ships at sea im sure wed both be more 
comfortable that way trost told the panel 
later under questioning by sen william cohen rmaine who 
said he opposed such negotiations trost said he was referring only 
to the tactical category of naval weapons not to seabased cruise 
or ballistic missiles of longer range 
yes it could be in our interests if all the ifs i 
previously stated are included trost said quickly adding and 
you could label me as a lifetime pessimist on the likelihood of 
ever concluding such an agreement 
trost is due to retire at the end of june 
trosts description of an acceptable formula for talks to 
eliminate shortrange nuclear arms at sea appeared similar to that 
offered tuesday by akhromeyev who said his government was willing 
to include related weaponry such as that carried on aircraft 
carriers submarines and landbased naval aircraft 
joshua handler an arms analyst with greenpeace usa which 
advocates the elimination of all nuclear weapons said trosts 
comments departed from the navys past unconditional opposition to 
talks on tactical nuclear arms 
trost and lehman both stressed the administration has been 
willing to negotiate certain measures short of cutting tactical 
naval arms lehman cited a 1988 agreement to provide advance notice 
of all launches of strategic ballistic missiles whether from land 
or sea 
it isnt that were stonewalling on naval nuclear arms 
trost said 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the subcommittee said 
he could not understand why the administration was willing to deal 
in all areas of arms control except naval 
why arent we prepared even to talk with the soviets he 
asked

the desecration of a jewish cemetery and mutilation 
of a corpse horrified the nation friday reawakening memories of 
the holocaust and fueling fears of a resurgence of racism 
the french senate and national assembly suspended their sessions 
for 15 minutes and leaders of all major religious faiths condemned 
the desecration special radio and tv shows were planned and some 
channels devoted their entire evening newscasts to the subject 
interior minister pierre joxe said extreme rightwing leader 
jeanmarie le pen must take some responsibility for the crime 
but le pen denounced the desecration as barbaric and said it 
was likely a sham staged to disgrace him and his national front a 
party that has won 15 percent support in recent opinion polls 
politicians across the political spectrum made pilgrimages to 
the town of carpentras near avignon where jews first settled in 
the first century mourners on thursday found 34 graves desecrated 
and the body of an 81yearold man dug up and impaled on an 
umbrella 
police detained one man for questioning but provided no details 
we are making verifications dont draw any conclusions an 
officer said 
families of the dead held an impromptu religious service at the 
cemetery and jewish demonstrators gathered at the gate under the 
banner we will not let history repeat itself 
they impaled felix my husband wept magdeleine germon 
they merit being impaled themselves she said since he was 
the last buried they took their revenge on the freshest grave to 
impale a dead person can you imagine what hate one must have 
her husband buried less than a month ago was found sprawled 
across a neighboring tomb stone impaled on an umbrella stick a 
star of david pulled from another grave lay nearby grave markers 
had been knocked over and flower pots trampled 
it is an aggression against all humanity a barbarous and 
bestial act said israeli ambassador obadia soffer who visited 
the cemetery it is also a warning to all civilization for 
humanity this is a racist act of the first order 
police said fingerprints and footprints indicated at least four 
vandals took part in the desecration discovered when several 
mourners visited the cemetery to lay flowers 
a previously unknown group calling itself the mohamed el 
boukima group claimed responsibility for the crime in an 
anonymous phone call to a newspaper police said they were trying 
to authenticate the call 
racism has for years been a major issue in france which is home 
to more than 4 million immigrants many from former african 
colonies 
racism recently returned to the forefront with a series of 
attacks on moslems and it presents the biggest political hurdle 
for the socialist government of premier michel rocard 
le pens party wants to deport immigrants and some centerright 
politicians have taken up the call for tight curbs on immigration 
twenty tombstones recently were overturned at an israeli 
cemetery in strasbourg the jewish community there reported friday 
and swastikas were found scrawled on walls in the town of 
rambouillet 
serge klarsfeld a wellknown lawyer and nazi hunter said the 
carpentras desecration was unprecedented even during world war ii 
he said the nazis left jewish graves alone 
joxe called le pen racist and provocateur 
like all racists like all who express their antisemitism in 
an explicit or implicit fashion he is obviously one of those 
responsible because of all that has been inspired by racist 
hate for years joxe said 
le pen who has been convicted of making racist remarks 
rejected the claim saying i dont feel guilty at all he 
suggested that communists or subversive moslem fundamentalists were 
behind the desecration 
the pretended rise in antisemitism and racism is a political 
sham he said the carpentras operation is that of political 
manipulation 
at the very least le pen said politicians were exploiting the 
event 
president francois mitterrand urged france to get hold of 
itself 
there is an unhealthy climate in france a racist climate 
said nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel visiting carpentras 
its ballooning its heating up its becoming more and more 
dangerous 
french society must now examine its conscience and urgently 
he said

a parade of dignitaries arrived on a 
solemn pilgrimage friday after vandals desecrated jewish graves in 
the town that is home to frances oldest synagogue 
the choice of carpentras wasnt an accident businessman 
jacques david said it was picked as a symbol 
israels ambassador to france mayors of nearby cities cabinet 
ministers and political party leaders made their way to the 
cemetery to inspect the damage and pay their respects to the dead 
the dead will judge us said elie weisel winner of the 
nobel peace prize for his writings about the holocaust 
located in southern france about 350 miles south of paris 
carpentras has been a haven for jews since the 13th century when 
they enjoyed protection under papal rule and were free to worship 
as they chose 
recent archaeological discoveries have revealed the presence of 
jews in the region hundreds of years earlier 
in 1967 scientists working on a site near cavaillon unearthed 
an oil lamp decorated with a sevenbranch candelabra according to 
french historian rene moulinas the lamp is the oldest vestige of 
judaism in france dating probably to the end of the year 1 bc 
the 15th century synagogue is now a classified historical 
monument known for its spire ritual baths and an oven dating from 
the middle ages and used to bake the unleavened bread eaten by jews 
at passover 
after the french revolution when jews received citizenship they 
moved away from the area and settled in other parts of france 
today the synagogue is hardly used for religious worship 
carpentras jewish community is too small to have its own rabbi 
the towns 26000 inhabitants include about 100 jewish families 
many of them immigrants from north africa 
the mayor jeanclaude andrieu described carpentras as a 
tranquil town in which the jews lived harmoniously the vandals 
must have been outsiders several residents said 
families of the dead held an impromptu religious service at the 
cemetery and jewish demonstrators gathered at the gate under the 
banner we will not let history repeat itself 
this wasnt a crime against the jews this was a crime against 
all humanity said dr freddy haddad leader of the local jewish 
community

about 50000 villagers were without food 
and water for the second day friday after the decades worst 
cyclone battered towns on indias southern coast killing at least 
210 people 
the cyclone roared in from the bay of bengal on wednesday and 
swept inland thursday swamping 100 villages flattening thousands 
of houses and affecting more than 2 million people the storm 
weakened friday 
forget food there is even no drinking water said a relief 
official in machilipatnam one of the worsthit areasby 
conservative estimate at least 50000 people have nothing to eat 
and drink 
village wells were unusable brimming with sea water swept in 
with the cyclone 
we planned to drop water bottles along with food packets but 
none of the 12 helicopters could take off today due to bad 
weather said arjuna rao the top relief official in andhra 
pradesh state which bore the brunt of high winds heavy rains and 
tidal waves 
rao said at least 200 people died in the state the toll will 
be higher as more and more bodies are surfacing every hour rao 
said 
in neighboring tamil nadu state 10 people died 
most of the deaths occurred when walls collapsed or flood waters 
carried people away some people died when they were struck by 
falling live electric wires 
many towns and villages were also still without electricity 
because the storm ripped out power lines trains stopped running 
and about 100 telephone exchanges were damaged 
a 1977 cyclone in the region although less intense left more 
than 10000 people dead this time early satellite warnings 
resulted in the quick evacuation of 150000 people officials said 
a mobile telephone exchange with a satellite link was sent to 
krishna district where the entire telecommunications network had 
broken down 
troops and medical teams were in the affected areas a team of 
army engineers with mechanized boats and pumping sets were on way 
to vijayawada and machilipatnam towns which were still under 
waistdeep water 
road communication between the two towns was restored but in 
most other places it was disrupted because of flooding thousands 
of uprooted trees littered highways

many east germans are cashing in their life 
insurance so they can have more savings on hand when their money is 
converted to west german marks the government said friday 
long lines have formed at state insurance bureaus in recent days 
because east germans believe they will get a better exchange rate 
on cash than on insurance the official news agency adn said 
cash savings up to 2440 for most east germans will be 
converted at a 11 rate while insurance policies are expected to 
be converted at a 21 rate to the west german mark 
many also fear dissolution of the state insurance system after 
the two germanys merge their economies 
the state insurance office on wednesday asked that a 11 
conversion be granted for east german insurance policies 
experts from the german states are negotiating a state treaty 
under which their economies and social institutions are to be 
joined by july 2 
east germany will move to a free market economy which will 
replace the 4decadeold socialist system that heavily subsidizes 
food housing and employment 
prices and unemployment already are increasing as western 
products flood into east germany east germany is trying to 
negotiate some job and social benefit guarantees during the 
transition to a market economy 
east germans pay about the same amount of money for their 
monthly rent sometimes as low as 38 per month as a west german 
pays for two tanks of gasoline 
an east german official said friday that some price controls on 
rents must be maintained 
the prevailing income structure in east germany makes rent 
price maintenance absolutely necessary said ingemar axel 
viehweger minister for housing and construction 
too hasty steps in this sensitive area will only imperil the 
real income of the citizens during the monetary union he said 
he proposed a gradual adjustment of rents to market prices 
taking into consideration income and actual costs for upkeep and 
management of apartments 
unification with west germany has been fueled by east germanys 
decrepit economy eroded by the exodus of east germans to west 
germany and poor economic planning by the ousted communist 
government 
large numbers of east german factories are expected to close 
when they are forced to compete with more efficient western 
businesses that produce better quality goods 
east germans already swarm across the borders opened in 
november to buy west german food and clothing border crossings 
are typically packed with returning east germans toting huge 
satchels stuffed with groceries 
east germanys beleaguered shoe industry where in recent weeks 
workers have held onehour strikes to protest western imports said 
it would cut prices and try to improve quality to compete with the 
west adn said friday 
tens of thousands of teachers textile workers and farmers 
staged protests and strikes thursday to demand protection from the 
unemployment expected as east germany moves to a free market 
hans klein spokesman for west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said the organizers of the strikes were former communists who are 
to some extent exactly the forces who caused east germanys dire 
economic problems 
klein told a news conference in the west german capital bonn 
that there was legitimate uncertainty and fear over talks 
between the germanys on the merger of their economies and social 
institutions

the us government has been investigating 
allegations that chinese officials have been harassing chinese 
students in the united states who are critical of the beijing 
government the state department said friday 
the departments statement followed allegations by a defector 
from the chinese embassy who reported that embassy officers were 
ordered to intimidate critics 
the comments of the defector xu lin appeared in fridays 
editions of the washington post 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that as the 
investigations proceed we will continue to take appropriate 
action to afford chinese students here the full protection of 
united states law 
we have advised the chinese government on several occasions 
that harassment of its citizens in the united states would violate 
our laws and would damage our bilateral relationship she said 
when he defected last week xu a third secretary at the 
embassy took documents which he claimed proved the extent of 
beijings crackdown on dissidents 
they are purported to show an effort by the embassy to isolate 
and stigmatize about 100 ringleaders who have been involved in 
the campaign against the communist leadership in beijing 
to strike the ringleaders we should give them a bad name 
the post quoted one of the documents as saying now we must think 
of a name that has a resounding effect we cannot use the word 
dissident 
the documents classify the students under five headings ranging 
from loyal communists to the reactionary core elements who 
actively organize and plan antigovernment activities 
tactics to be used against the dissidents the documents 
suggested could include keeping files on them revoking passports 
cutting off government stipends firing them from their jobs back 
in china and isolating them from their families at home 
president bush has signed an executive order promising that 
chinese students in the united states will not be forced to return 
home against their will 
more than 50000 governmentsponsored exchange students are 
studying in the united states and canada and the documents said 70 
percent to 80 percent of them would not return to china were 
harassed the post said 
a chinese embassy spokesman told the newspaper that the 
allegations in the documents were rumors

a top pentagon official on friday defended a 
revived 7 billion program to build radar jammers for military 
aircraft even though he canceled the plan last year with the 
approval of defense secretary dick cheney 
deputy defense secretary donald j atwood also confirmed that 
the air force which proposed termination of the public program and 
dropped out of it because of budget constraints is working on a 
separate classified version 
the pentagons deputy inspector general speaking to the same 
congressional panel that atwood addressed said later that the 
systems effectiveness was unproven and he recommended delaying 
production decisions until tests are completed 
atwood was questioned at a hearing by a senate governmental 
affairs subcommittee about a newly disclosed july 1989 memorandum 
in which he proposed terminating the airborne selfprotection 
jammer program 
i originally killed the program based on the fact that the air 
force recommended it be killed secretary cheney then approved 
the termination he said 
that public effort a navyair force program has now been 
revived by the navy alone and sen david pryor dark chairman 
of the subcommittee disclosed the existence of a secret air force 
program 
this is one of the old shell game tricks pryor told atwood 
you dont get a program or its not working you simply put 
in as they say a black program which is a top secret program 
the congress really has no control over this he said we 
dont get to ask questions 
the pentagon envisions that the electronic system to be 
installed on more than 2000 navy and air force aircraft would 
increase the survivability of the planes by jamming or deceiving an 
enemys radarcontrolled weapons 
atwood said he changed his mind on cancellation of the program 
after the navy appealed the decision and vowed that changes would 
be incorporated into the system 
i said all right as far as the navy was concerned and then 
cheney approved that and that was in our budget atwood said 
shortly after the deputy defense secretarys testimony the 
pentagons own deputy inspector general told the panel that a 
recent department audit raised serious questions about the jammer 
system 
the effectiveness and suitability in combat has not been 
proven said derek vander schaaf 
the audit also found that the navys plans call for buying 436 
of the jammers before operational tests and evaluation are 
completed and said that the overall cost estimates may be 16 
billion too low 
the departments own cost analysis and improvement group 
estimates that the program may cost about 9 billion 
based on this information vander schaaf recommended that the 
department delay decisions on production until tests are completed 
and delivery of 100 jammers be stretched out 
robert duncan director of operational tests and evaluation at 
the pentagon said he expects the tests on the jammer to begin in 
may 1991 and be completed by october 1991 
but vander schaaf said he believes the results wont be in until 
much later 
pryor questioned the two officials as to whether congress should 
approve the 173 million in the defense budget for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 that is earmarked for the jammer program 
duncan said yes vander schaaf said no 
earlier atwood said congress should approve the money arguing 
that if the system proves itself in testing the program will be 
worth it 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii told pryor that the 
jammer program is the only system that meets the services needs 
and abandoning the program would force the navy back to the drawing 
board at a considerable expense 
but the navy secretary stressed that if the system fails to meet 
the services criteria he will propose cancellation 
im not bashful about recommending that a program be 
terminated garrett said

a courtappointed trustee says he will 
sell jim bakkers former satellite network to oral roberts 
university for 6 million at the end of the month unless he finds a 
buyer for the entire ptl complex 
i do have a firm deal with oral roberts university however 
in the contract i expressly reserved the right to sell all the 
assets until the point of approval of the sale of just the 
network the trustee lawyer dennis shedd said thursday 
the 500acre heritage usa christian retreat founded by bakker in 
fort mill and 1700 acres of undeveloped ptl land in south carolina 
have been for sale along with ptls broadcasting holdings since 
april 1988 
shedd filed legal papers in columbia on thursday asking us 
bankruptcy judge thurmond bishop to approve the sale of just the 
television production equipment and ptl satellite and cable leases 
to the tulsa oklabased university may 31 
the roberts ministry has been plagued by tight finances 
especially since donations to television evangelists plummeted 
following the 1987 scandals of jimmy swaggart and bakker 
in september oral roberts a 72yearold faith healer closed 
his city of faith hospital and medical school and put his home and 
other ministryowned property on the market to repay 25 million in 
debts 
the tulsa world newspaper quoted roberts son richard as saying 
god told his father in what my dad believes is his last major 
charge from god to create a 24houraday sevendayaweek global 
christian charismatic healing network 
richard roberts said regents approved the offer this week and 
the university made a down payment of 1 million raised from 
longtime backers 
mark swadener chief financial officer for the ministries told 
the newspaper he thought the network could provide a vital source 
of revenue for the university he called the plan to purchase the 
network an act of faith 
the ministry also was seeking guaranteed access to the airwaves 
at a time when secular networks are displacing evangelists on 
sunday mornings in favor of news shows and cartoons the newspaper 
reported 
bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising 158 
million from ptl contributors and is serving a 45year prison 
sentence in a federal prison in minnesota 
in charlotte nc the evangelist who introduced bakker to 
church secretary jessica hahn pleaded guilty to lying to a federal 
grand jury about why he set up the meeting which eventually led to 
bakkers downfall 
us district court judge robert potter was expected to sentence 
john wesley fletcher later this month fletchers lawyer said 
thursday the perjury count could carry a sentence of eight to 14 
months 
fletcher denied during a september 1987 appearance before the 
grand jury that he brought miss hahn to a hotel to have sex with 
bakker he later testified he had lied 
the broadcast network purchased by roberts is operating with a 
skeleton staff of about 10 employees it broadcasts shows produced 
by other evangelists such as jerry falwell james robison and 
richard roberts 
at the time ptl declared bankruptcy in june 1987 the satellite 
network was carried on 1300 cable systems that had 12 million 
subscribers according to court papers filed thursday that has 
slipped to 800 systems with 64 million subscribers 
even in its weakened condition the ptl network would be a major 
plum for roberts said jerry rose president of the national 
religious broadcasters association 
youre still talking about a major network that has an awful 
lot of potential rose said 
besides ptl there are four other religious satellite networks 
in the united states pat robertsons christian broadcasting 
network the southern baptist conventions acts network paul 
crouchs trinity network and jimmy allens life tv 
other evangelists such as roberts buy time on those four 
networks

for one policeman persecuted for daring to 
organize a policemans union nine years ago friday marked a day of 
victory and vindication 
to cheers and a few tears a warsaw court granted legal status 
to the independent selfgoverning trade union of police 
i can really say that the 11th of may is the happiest day of 
my life said the policeman senior sgt jan jablonski now 
deputy national chairman of the union 
his fight for the police union was an open wound left over from 
the tulmultuous years of 198081 when solidarity was born from 
national hope crushed by martial law 
for most of the 1980s jablonski suffered anonymously through a 
string of unanswered petitions lowpaying jobs and averted looks 
from former colleagues who passed him on the street 
it all began in 1981 when jablonski and 500 other interior 
ministry officers banded together and asked to be registered as 
the national trade union committee of police functionaries 
we wanted in our ministry a broader democratization in social 
life among other things to separate political goals from police 
functions he once said in a petition to government ombudsman 
ewa letowska 
certainly like every union we wanted to defend the rights 
and interests of workers of course social issues and pay issues 
were included in this he said 
jablonski already an 18year veteran said polands ousted 
communist rulers worked to create distrust between the police and 
the rest of society so it would be easier to use the police 
against the people 
in the west the policeman has much more respect of people 
i think this was a conscious action of governing teams to 
facilitate their wielding of power he said explaining why 
police wanted an independent organization to represent them 
but all 500 founding union members were persecuted and then 
fired before they could set up the organization 
i wanted to change the world and it turned out that finally 
the world changed me jablonski said of the years that followed 
his first job after being dismissed was obtained through the 
roman catholic church he checked coats in a restaurant then moved 
on to becoming a meter reader for the state power company 
friends from years on the police force were under orders he 
says not to talk with him 
a proud man jablonski kept up a steady battle to get his job 
back through court filings appeals to the ministry contacts with 
journalists and a petition to ms letowska 
solidarity regained its legal status in april 1989 and the 
noncommunist government was installed in september that month 
jablonski put a notice in solidaritys gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
asking any police interested in an independent union to contact him 
eventually a nationwide meeting was organized in southern 
poland where an activeduty captain roman hula was elected 
national chairman of the steering committee and jablonski was made 
his deputy 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak agreed to recognize the union 
provisionally in january and jablonski and other dismissed 
officers were reinstated to their jobs in february 
formal court registration was put off until after enactment by 
parliament last month of an interior ministry reform law that 
abolished the secret service and placed the ministry under civilian 
control 
the law took effect thursday and the court agreed to register 
the union friday 
about 70 percent of the 80000 police have already declared 
their intention to join his organization jablonski said

president bush brushed off a political 
firestorm over possible tax increases on friday saying i cant 
be ruffled but refusing to reveal what he will put on the table 
at next weeks budget summit with congress 
im not going to show you my hand i havent seen a lot of 
hands being laid down bush said as he embarked on a twoday trip 
of college commencement speeches 
democrats have been reluctant to be the first to mention taxes 
urging bush instead to take the lead in offering a formula to cut 
the growing budget defict 
the administration has warned there would be mandatory spending 
cuts of upwards of 100 billion this fall unless congress and the 
white house agree on major reductions in the deficit 
bush talking with reporters on air force one refused to 
provide any clues about his strategy but promised to bargain in 
good faith with democrats 
theres no conditions and thats the way it is bush said 
thats the way its going to be and thats the way it must be 
in washington sen richard g lugar rind said the budget 
talks shouldnt just work toward a broad agreement he suggested 
members dealing with the budget should be given official status as 
a joint committee that actually shapes a final budget bill for 
house and senate action 
but lugar said he is not optimistic the planned talks can 
produce an agreement the gaps are so large and the politics of 
it are so difficult lugar told reporters 
bushs invitation to budget negotiations has raised suspicions 
among democrats of an electionyear tax trap and sparked fears of 
election setbacks for republicans who have made antitax pledges a 
key part of their campaigns 
bush has not said he would endorse tax increases but he has 
muted his nonewtaxes pledge for the budget talks which begin 
tuesday 
the administration is telling republicans privately that the 
no preconditions stance offered by the white house does not 
necessarily mean bush will accept increased taxes 
the atmosphere for the talks was clouded when white house chief 
of staff john sununu suggested this week that the president would 
not accept a tax increase regardless of what the democrats propose 
bush asked if sununus remarks reflected his position said 
i would ask you to reflect my posture to talk about what i say 
so id respectfully suggest you take your guidance from me on 
this one because thats the way it is 
and bush said sununu was not in trouble for his remarks 
thats silly so stupid none of these congressmen are in 
trouble either he said 
im approaching it very openly and i recognize the 
controversy swirling around from one statement or another he 
said but look stay on track steady as she goes and be open 
deal frankly with people and deal in the way ive said 
bush said that tomorrow therell be another tidal wave so 
keep your snorkel above the water level and do what you think is 
best 
it goes back to what my mom taught me when i was about six 
do your best do your best well im trying hard stay calm 
bush said i think the president has a certain responsibility 
to stay cool make clear to people that hes dealing in good faith 
and do my best 
thats exactly what i intend to do and i cant be ruffled by 
these things bush said ive got to be understanding when 
people come forward and express themselves forcefully on something 
like this

six straight years of budget cuts have sharply 
reduced the ability of the social security administration to serve 
older americans retiree organizations told congress on friday 
a 21percent slash in the social security payroll has been 
accompanied by a marked decline in service and renewed complaints 
about inaccurate information constantly busy telephones and 
arbitrary rulings on eligibility said lawrence smedley 
executive director of the national council of senior citizens 
in some offices clerical positions have been reduced to the 
point that managers are often covering reception desks and spending 
time on data entry margaret dixon a director of the american 
association of retired persons told a hearing by the senate 
finance social security subcommittee 
louis d enoff deputy commissioner of social security 
acknowledged the agency is being stretched to near its limit 
nevertheless enoff said satisfaction with ssa service has 
also remained high with over 83 percent of respondents in a 
national survey last year rating ssas service as either good or 
very good 
one reason enoff said is that the agency has been able to 
retain technical employees and those who work directly with 
retirees and the disabled 
the testimony was presented at a hearing on a bill by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny chairman of the subcomittee 
the legislation whose chief goal is removing the agency from 
the department of health and human services would boost social 
security staff by 7000 to 70000 fulltime workers 
enoff said agency officials were confident an increase of that 
size was not needed although a former deputy used that figure in a 
memo to an associate earlier this year 
enoff said approval of president bushs budget would assure that 
social security staff would be held at 63000 and give ssa the 
period of stability it so sorely needs 
john f delfico a director of the general accounting office an 
arm of congress said that although there may be a need for more 
workers in some areas a thorough study needs to be undertaken 
before wholesale increases in staffing are made 
another part of moynihans bill would require social security to 
list local office numbers in telephone directories the agency now 
lists only a tollfree nationwide number but on request will give 
a local number to anyone who calls the tollfree line 
because the mental physical and educational handicaps of some 
older and disabled americans makes the telephone an uncomfortable 
and unfamiliar instrument local offices must remain accessible and 
adequately staffed said mrs dixon of aarp

a south african spy 
organization poisoned drinking water at a refugee camp to disrupt 
elections in namibia as part of sabotage operations in africa and 
europe a newspaper reported friday 
however a namibian health official said refugee camp water and 
sewage was extensively tested last year and that no traces of 
cholera were found 
it sounds like absolute nonsense rodion kraus director of 
community health services in namibia said of the reported claim 
that cholera germs had been put into drinking water 
vrye weekblad a weekly afrikaans language newspaper quoted a 
former official of the civilian cooperation bureau as saying in an 
interview that the unit had cells in black african nations and 
europe and planned killings of antiapartheid activists 
the south african government is conducting an investigation into 
the bureau and into allegations that police and military operatives 
killed antiapartheid activists several former police officers 
have claimed they were involved in killing activists president 
fw de klerk told the commission not to investigate activities 
outside south africa 
vrye weekblad which helped uncover the first public details 
about the ccb said it obtained further information in an interview 
with former ccb official petrus jacobus botes who said he headed 
the units activities in mozambique and swaziland 
botes said ccb activities ranged from murder and sabotage to 
bombings bribery and blackmail the newspaper reported the paper 
said botes claimed his agents were responsible for a 1988 bomb 
blast in mozambique that blew off the arm of african national 
congress legal expert albie sachs 
botes also claimed his unit was instructed to kill south african 
communist party chief joe slovo then in exile in zambia the 
article said it did not say if any attempt was made on slovos 
life 
the newspaper said botes claimed that ccb operatives put cholera 
germs in drinking water at the dobra refugee camp in namibia in 
1989 as part of efforts to disrupt the south west african peoples 
organizations election campaign the story did not say how this 
was intended to disrupt the election 
swapo which waged a guerrilla campaign against south african 
rule of namibia won the elections namibia became independent in 
march 
kraus said there was no cholera at dobra refugee camp he said 
since many of the 40000 namibians who returned from exile to vote 
had come from cholerainfected areas stringent checks were made of 
the water and sewage 
police and defense force spokesmen in pretoria had no immediate 
response friday to the newspaper report 
cabinet members and other top government officials denied any 
knowledge of the ccb until late last year 
the group allegedly used civilians or police officers to kill 
government opponents and disrupt antigovernment activities

a gang fight at a crowded nightcourt session 
left a bloodspattered courtroom and shaken court employees 
demanding better security but there were no arrests because nobody 
wanted to get involved police said 
the ruckus late wednesday involved several young men and was 
witnessed by about two dozen lawyers court employees defendants 
and others on the seventh floor of the public safety building 
which also houses police headquarters 
there was no security officer or judge present when a young man 
entered seattle municipal court no 1 and got into a fight with two 
others who were already there apparently waiting for hearing 
dates police said 
several other young men in white clothing and hats then entered 
the room and joined in the brawl punching the man whose arrival 
apparently sparked the fracas throwing him to the floor and 
kicking him in the head witnesses said 
by the time police arrived the victim and most of the youths 
had left blood was spattered near the judges bench the 
prosecutors table the courthouse hallway and an elevator 
police spokesman mark amundson said officers found several 
witnesses but none of them wanted to get involved the victim 
found later on the street refused medical attention and wouldnt 
press charges amundson said 
two suspects were still there when the officers arrived and 
the officers could have arrested them but only if a victim made a 
complaint or the witnesses said something amundson said none 
of them would 
while a police officer questioned a defense lawyer a blackclad 
youth waiting in line for a court date warned her not to get 
involved the seattle postintelligencer reported 
you should just keep it quiet just keep your mouth shut he

its a sign of the times 
municipal court administrator esther bauman said shell shift 
18000 of the budget to hire a police officer for night screenings 
after june police chief patrick fitzsimons will post an officer at 
the court until then she said 
ms bauman said court workers has been concerned about an 
increased gang presence since last year when officials began 
scheduling initial court appearances for defendants four nights a 
week to streamline the process 
ms bauman said the night hearings in which 400 defendants a 
week are assigned a public defender and a court date were very 
cost effective but differed from a formal courtroom because there 
was no judge and defendants were required to stand in three 
separate lines causing tempers to flare

nelson and winnie mandela received an 
emotional welcome from south african political exiles friday at an 
anc training camp where they spoke of their hopes and fears for 
south africa 
the mandelas urged rankandfile discipline when the african 
national congress estimated 15000 exiles around the world 
eventually return home 
we feel the day we have been waiting for might be close at 
hand said nelson mandela standing in a hut at viana viana is 
12 miles outside the angolan capital of luanda 
the anc calls on you to act in a disciplined manner when you 
return and i must say members cant expect to be able to live 
like millionaires choosing mansions in whatever part of town they 
prefer he said 
mandela was greeted by chants of we know you are our father 
in the zulu and sotho languages he gave the crowd of about 200 a 
detailed account of his talks last week with south african 
president fw de klerk the two agreed to work for an end to 
political violence and clear the way for bringing blacks into the 
government 
the anc deputy president was obviously moved by the warm 
reception he read the agreement reached with de klerk in full to 
the crowd and later answered members questions in a session closed 
to the handful of foreign journalists covering the visit 
mandela said he believed de klerk and the government delegation 
at the talks were sincerely searching for a peaceful solution but 
warned we dont know if the delegation stands for all whites in 
south africa and thats what were worried about 
he repeated anc demands that all exiles should be allowed to 
return home under a general amnesty that all political prisoners 
including those facing death sentences be released and that the 
state of emergency dating from 1986 be lifted before any truce in 
the fight against whiteminority rule 
winnie mandela paid tribute to the militants working abroad for 
as long as 30 years saying you have made us walk tall made us 
feel we could challenge pretoria with the knowledge you could hit 
where we inside south africa couldnt 
de klerk legalized the anc in february after a 30year ban the 
same month he ordered the release of mandela who had been in jail 
27 years and was serving a life sentence for plotting against the 
government 
both mandelas urged anc members to accept land offered by south 
african local authorities for housing projects citing job and 
housing shortages 
both were frequently interrupted by cheering and singing as they 
joked with the crowd through much of the speeches 
mandela ridiculed former south african governments for 
accusations that the anc envisions a sovietstyle marxist 
state and reiterated that the anc wants a democratic south 
africa 
when we fight against apartheid were not fighting against 
the whites were fighting against a policy he said 
the mandelas arrived thursday from lusaka zambia for their

where a woman said she was interviewed for an escort service 
robert stewart chief of the state law enforcement division 
would say only that an investigation was under way at the request

i sure wouldnt be involved in any such thing he said i 
sometimes sell a little insurance out of my office here but that 
other stuff absolutely no way

said we want to create new classes that will deal with at least 
three minority groups at one time in an integrated comparative 
way 
such an overlapping picture of ethnic groups will better mirror 
society he said

seven chinese farmers who mysteriously 
disappeared on arrival in this country may have been on an extended 
sightseeing trip their wouldbe host said friday 
this is kind of a sad story in a way that the mistake of one 
group can do so much harm said sponsor molly aitken who 
reported receiving a letter this week from the farmers 
the letter said the farmers merely slipped away to see more of 
new york city and were embarrassed by the national kidnapping 
investigation their departure touched off 
i think everyone wants to forgive them but theyre going to 
have to come back and work hard now to make up for what theyve 
done mrs aitken said in a telephone interview from her farm in 
athol 
the port authority of new york and new jersey whose police 
continue to investigate the case as a reported abduction is 
checking out the letter its just loony enough to possibly be 
true but were not ruling anything out at this point said 
spokesman allen morrison 
the letter postmarked in new york city and received wednesday 
in athol said the men were embarrassed felt they had lost 
face and were afraid to return in case they risk deportation 
mrs aitken said 
the seven chinese arrived april 25 at new yorks kennedy 
international airport with nine other peasants they came to 
participate in a project to build a model third world village 
during an 11month stay at mrs aitkens estate on the outskirts of 
athol a small town about 50 miles north of springfield 
mrs aitken president of the world energy foundation organizing 
the project met the farmers at the airport and told police she was 
afraid they had been kidnapped when she saw some of them being 
hustled into a car 
the letter signed by three of the missing farmers on behalf of 
all seven explained that they were met by friends at the airport 
and decided to slip away to tour new yorks chinatown mrs aitken 
said 
according to the letter they didnt realize they had caused 
so much trouble she said the letter also said the peasants did 
not see mrs aitken at the airport and planned to contact her after 
a few days in new york 
mrs aitken said she has spoken with officials at the new york 
chinese consulate and with officials in fujian province home 
region for the farmers 
i dont know the position that the chinese government will 
take but i imagine that it will also be one of understanding 
she said i certainly hope that it will be 
officials with the chinese consulate in new york did not return 
a telephone call friday from the associated press 
charles troy spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service in new york said the agency would like to interview the 
farmers if they are found and would not say what they plan to do 
after that 
morrison said the port authority doesnt think the farmers broke 
any laws investigators were skeptical of the kidnap story because 
the three alleged abductors grabbed the seven without weapons and 
got them into a car 
morrison said the authority has a copy of the letter which they 
will investigate to make sure it is not a hoax and was not written 
under duress 
we will not consider the case closed until we see them and 
interview them he said

a newspaper reported that a 
south african spy organization put cholera germs in drinking water 
at a refugee camp in namibia but a health official said tests 
turned up no such traces 
vrye weekblad a weekly afrikaanslanguage newspaper quoted a 
former official of the civilian cooperation bureau or ccb as 
saying in an interview that the contamination of the camps water 
was part of a sabotage operation aimed at disrupting the namibian 
elections 
it quoted the official as saying the unit had cells in black 
african nations and europe and had planned killings of 
antiapartheid activists 
the south african government is conducting an investigation into 
the ccb and allegations that police and military operatives killed 
activists several former police officers have claimed they were 
involved in killing activists 
but president fw de klerk told the commission not to 
investigate activities outside south africa 
police and defense force spokesmen in pretoria had no immediate 
response friday to the report cabinet members and other top 
government officials have denied any knowledge of the ccb until 
late last year 
on the cholera allegation a namibian health official said 
refugee camp water and sewage was extensively tested for cholera 
last year and no traces were found 
vrye weekblad which helped uncover the first public details 
about the ccb said it obtained further information from former ccb 
official petrus jacobus botes who said he headed the units 
activities in mozambique and swaziland 
the ccb ran destabilization operations in black african nations 
with units or cells based in malawi zimbabwe zaire and other 
nations the article said botes said ccb activities ranged from 
murder and sabotage to bombings bribery and blackmail the 
newspaper reported the paper said botes claimed his agents were 
responsible for a 1988 bomb blast in mozambique that blew off the 
arm of african national congress legal expert albie sachs 
botes also claimed his unit was instructed to kill south african 
communist party chief joe slovo then in exile in zambia the 
article said it did not say if any attempt was made on slovos 
life 
the newspaper said botes claimed ccb operatives put cholera 
germs in drinking water at the dobra refugee camp in namibia in 
1989 as part of efforts intended to disrupt the election campaign 
of the south west african peoples organization or swapo 
rodion kraus director of community health services in namibia 
said there was no cholera at dobra refugee camp he said since many 
of the 40000 namibians who returned from exile to vote had come 
from cholerainfected areas stringent checks were made of the 
water and sewage 
it sounds like absolute nonsense he said of the reported 
claim 
botes was quoted as saying the ccb was in chaos last year and 
the outcome of its plans in namibia was the mistaken murder of 
anton lubowski the only white swapo executive member lubowski was 
assassinated outside his home in september 
swapo which waged a guerrilla campaign against south african 
rule of the territory won the unsupervised elections namibia 
became independent in march 
although south african police have said they believe ccb members 
were involved in lubowskis murder de klerk specifically forbade 
the commission from including that case in its investigation 
the article also said botes informed south african law and order 
minister adriaan vlok in august 1989 of ccb activities after he was 
involved in a dispute with the groups leaders about expenses 
botes according to the newspaper also claimed the ccb planned 
to kill swapo activist hidipo hamutenya who is now minister of 
information in the namibian government 
it did not say if any attempt was made but hamutenya said 
id been warned during those days that there was a plan to kill 
me

president fw de klerk of south africa 
expressed optimism friday that his countrys isolation will soon 
end as he came to greece on a european trip aimed at winning 
support for his reforms 
de klerk held separate talks with president constantine 
caramanlis and prime minister constantine mitsotakis during a 
oneday visit to this european community member 
on friday night police battled about 200 anarchists outside 
parliament who were protesting de klerks visit the police fired 
tear gas and charged the demonstrators who were at the end of a 
protest march by thousands of students after the anarchists hurled 
firebombs 
four protesters were arrested a police spokesman said one 
policeman was slightly injured after he struck on the head by a 
stone the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
at a joint news conference with mitsotakis de klerk said he was 
pleased with the outcome so far of his 18day european tour which 
began thursday with a meeting in paris with french president 
francois mitterrand 
there has been a surge of new interest in what is happening in 
south africa de klerk said we have found that in actual fact 
there is a reevaluation taking place in the total international 
community with regard to the situation in south africa 
mitsotakis said he was impressed by de klerks viewpoint on the 
situation in south africa which aims at the total abolition of 
apartheid 
western leaders agreed to begin easing south africas isolation 
after de klerk in february ordered the release of jailed black 
leader nelson mandela and legalized the african national congress 
and other antiapartheid groups 
it is the most extensive foreign mission by a south african head 
of state since the ruling whiteminority national party took power 
in 1948 
on his trip de klerk is seeking to win support for his reform 
initiatives and the lifting of european community economic 
sanctions mandela has opposed lifting the sanctions 
mitterrand said the issue of sanctions would be taken up at the 
ec summit scheduled for june 2526 in dublin ireland 
at his athens news conference de klerk said denmark had decided 
to send an ambassador to south africa signaling the changing 
attitude in the west toward south africa 
we actually find that some foreign governments are acting on 
their own accord he said one good example is the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level 
with denmark 
denmark has maintained its diplomatic representation in south 
africa at the consular level 
friday was a holiday in denmark and there was no government 
comment on de klerks remarks however a lowlevel duty officer at 
the foreign ministry in copenhagen said there had been no 
announcement there of a change in relations with south africa 
denmark and the netherlands have been the staunchest opponents 
in the ec of easing sanctions against south africa 
relations between greece and south africa have been 
traditionally close due mainly to the 100000strong greek 
community in south africa the greek royal family took temporary 
refuge in south africa during the nazi occupation 
greece has abided by ec sanctions that ban certain south african 
imports and new investments in south africa 
de klerk was scheduled to remain in greece over the weekend on 
an unofficial stay before leaving for portugal on monday he also 
plans stops in belgium britain west germany switzerland spain 
and italy 
the greek government has said it expects mandela deputy 
president of the african national congress to visit athens when he 
starts his own european tour next month 
mandela and de klerk agreed during talks last week to work 
together to end political violence and clear the way for formal 
negotiations on a new constitution that would extend voting rights 
to south africas black majority

complications including new infections in her fifth week of 
hospitalization for pneumonia and will remain hospitalized for 
about six more weeks doctors said friday 
the recovery of miss taylor near death two weeks ago with viral 
pneumonia was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast 
infection her doctors said 
during the next 1 months she will require intravenous therapy 
in the hospital they said in a statement released by st johns 
hospital and health center 
bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than 
the viral pneumonia miss taylor initially contracted thats 
because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses 
she is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors 
are pleased with her progress miss taylors publicist chen sam 
said after talking to doctors 
hospital spokeswoman paulette weir said she couldnt go beyond 
the statement miss taylor was still in a private room and not the 
intensive care unit she said 
earlier this week ms sam said the 58yearold actress was 
improving and would be released from the hospital this week to 
recuperate at home

fbi director william s sessions said friday 
that just 40 percent of an estimated 550 major drug trafficking 
organizations are under active investigation by the bureau 
if the bureau were to pursue every drug ring it has identified 
sessions said we could use not the 1200 agents that are 
currently assigned to drug investigations we could use 9500 and 
you know it and we all know it 
sessions in a meeting with reporters at his office said the 
same problem applies to the fbis pursuit of fraud cases at banks 
and savings and loan institutions he said about 550 institutions 
actually are under investigation while the bureau has had more 
than 20000 referrals complaints from various other 
governmental agencies the bureau has about 600 agents assigned to 
such cases 
still sessions pronounced himself satisfied with the bureaus 
pace in both the drug and financial arenas i think the fbis 
national drug strategy is right on target he said 
on other topics sessions said 
he is not discouraged that the bombing of pan am flight 103 in 
december of 1988 remains an open case with no one yet charged all 
259 people aboard the boing 747 were killed as were seven people 
on the ground in lockerbie scotland i was confident then and i 
am confident now that we will successfully complete our 
investigation he said 
leads are consistently moving and progressing very well in 
the investigation of four mail bombings in the south including 
those which killed a federal appeals judge robert s vance in 
birmingham ala and a civil rights lawyer robert f robinson in 
savannah ga asked if the investigation were at the tieup 
stage sessions said were not there yet but were approaching 
it 
it is too early for the fbi to declare a peace dividend by 
allocating counterespionage resources elsewhere even though 
there is a tremendous move towards freedom and democracy in the 
eastern bloc countries we do not know about how that will 
actually change the operation of the approach of the various 
intellgence services sessions said we do have things other 
than military secrets there is a perception that these 
countries will need to succeed economically and that they will 
therefore be looking not just for military information but for 
technological and scientific information that is not properly 
theirs asked if he were aware of soviet or eastern european 
agents attempting to enlist americans in recent months session 
replied yes the patterns and activities of the past do 
continue he would not elaborate 
sessions repeatedly declined comment on the fbis role in the 
investigation of washington mayor marion barry who faces 14 
drugrelated charges but the fbi director did acknowledge he had 
seen an fbi videotape which purportedly shows the mayor smoking 
crack cocaine after being invited to do so by a female informant

a former deathrow inmate convicted in the 
mutilation slayings of his stepdaughter and her fiancee in 1982 was 
set free friday after prosecutors decided not to try him a second 
time 
dale johnston 56 who has maintained he is innocent emerged 
from the licking county jail promising to search for the real 
killer 
its a beautiful day johnston told reporters he met in his 
lawyers office in columbus 
he was freed secretly after the sheriffs department received a 
death threat against him said sheriff gerry billy 
three judges found johnston guilty in 1984 of aggravated murder 
in the slayings of his stepdaughter annette cooper johnston 18 
and her fiance todd schultz 19 both of logan in southeast ohio 
he was sentenced to death in the electric chair 
ms johnston and schultz were last seen oct 4 1982 in logan 
their torsos were discovered 10 days later in the hocking river 
other body parts were unearthed in a cornfield 
prosecutors alleged that johnston killed the two on his hocking 
county farm with a 22caliber handgun then dismembered their 
bodies prosecutors said jealousy was the motive for the killings 
and that johnston had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter 
johnston spoke of long years in prison and his resolution to 
search for a murderer 
for the last 7 years ive taken everything one day at a 
time ill continue with that for a while he said a soon as 
possible well start pursuing the one goal i have left and thats 
to find the person who killed my daughter 
johnston had been held in the county jail in this central ohio 
city about 30 miles east of columbus awaiting a second trial 
johnston served more than seven years in prison for slayings 
johnstons exwife sarah the mother of the slain woman was 
waiting for johnston at the jail she expressed happiness with 
johnstons release 
its going to be a beautiful day its just fantastic to know 
that his attorneys have finally prevailed that justice finally 
came through on our side this time she said 
the johnstons are divorced she remarried and is living in 
southern ohio outside hocking county 
johnstons release was cleared after a prosecutor on thursday 
dropped charges following an appeals courts ruling that certain 
evidence could not be used against johnston the prosecutor 
contended the evidence was crucial to obtaining a second conviction 
johnstons first conviction was thrown out by the ohio supreme 
court in 1988 which ruled that a witness whose memory had been 
refreshed by hypnosis had been improperly allowed to testify 
a second trial was put on hold last july after judge william 
gillie ruled that johnstons rights were violated when police 
questioned him for 8 hours without a lawyer present 
gillie also ruled that boots a vest and other clothing taken 
from johnston during the interrogation could not be used as 
evidence the judge said a police officer tried to deceive johnston 
into thinking that he had blood on his boots 
prosecutors tried to link the boots to footprints near where the 
bodies were found 
the 10th ohio district court of appeals on thursday upheld 
gillies decision logan county prosecuter charles gerken then 
decided to drop the charges 
schultzs mother sandra said she was not surprised by the 
events that led to johnstons release but im not happy about 
it its a hard day for us she said 
schultzs father donald said there is no doubt in his mind 
that johnston killed the two he knows who did it he did it 
schultz said in an interview with the columbus dispatch

at least five pieces on display at the chicago international art 
exhibition

billion was to be the last major exhibition at navy pier before a 
renovation that could cost more than 150 million said john 
schmidt chairman of the metropolitan pier and exposition authority 
the authority oversees navy pier and nearby mccormick place 
the lakeside group which organized the exhibition spent 
500000 for roof repairs as a condition of staging the show at the 
pier which juts into lake michigan from downtown 
but it didnt prove enough to combat torrential rains wednesday 
night that dumped from more than 4 inches on the chicago area 
barry bauman an art expert working with the exhibition had to 
dry out five works sent to him so they could be shown at thursday 
nights 125aperson opening 
bauman said none of the works was irreversibly damaged 
an estimated value of the wet art was not immediately available 
officials said they also would not identify the works 
the exhibit includes works by jannis kounellis annette lemieux 
sam francis donald judd wayne thiebaud and sherrie levine 
thiebaud a former disney animator designed the posters promoting 
the show the 100 copies of the poster sold for 10000 each 
workers meanwhile put up layers of plastic under the roofs of 
the two main halls at navy pier to try to shield the art from any 
more water 
its like closing the barn door after the cows escape said 
margaret failoni of romes il ponte galleria one of her pieces in 
the show got wet 
the weather forecast called for an 80 percent chance of rain or 
thunderstorms on saturday which made some exhibitors nervous 
weve been lucky so far nothings been damaged said penny 
pilkington of ppow a new york gallery that had about 20 paintings 
sculptures and other objects on display 
but we dont know if theyve done anything about fixing the 
roof yet 
the two leaky sheds at the pier are housing about half of the 
198 dealers at the show about 65000 people people are expected to 
view the show which ends tuesday 
schmidt said repairs to solidify the structure as well as to 
plug holes were demanded of the lakeside group before the show 
opened 
this is the last year that we will ever use the sheds 
schmidt said they are totally deteriorated 
the pier was completed in 1916 
tom blackman executive director of the lakeside group lamented 
that even with the expenditure we still had an awful lot of 
water 
some exhibitors however did not seem too upset weve been 
here before so we knew what to expect said chicago gallery

transit police friday began a vigorous campaign 
to rid the rails of beggars one day after a federal appeals court 
reaffirmed a ban on subway panhandling 
they told us about it at roll call no more panhandling 
an officer at the grand central terminal subway stop said on 
condition of anonymity the ruling makes it easier because its 
going to back us 
and the word seemed to have gotten out quickly transit police 
officers in the subways said there were fewer panhandlers to move 
along than usual 
an unscientific eyeballing through the system seemed to bear 
that out although panhandlers have been fewer since october when 
the transit authority began its operation enforcement to rid the 
system of those who disobey the rules 
on thursday the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled 21 
that a ban on begging in the subway system is constitutional 
because panhandlers dont convey a social or political message 
the decision reversed a lower court ruling that said the 
agencys panhandling prohibition was unconstitutional because 
begging is a form of free speech protected by the first amendment 
the appeals court ruling means the agency can ban begging on 
trains near subway stairways escalators and elevators and within 
25 feet of token booths 
also the appeals court unanimously reinstated a ban on begging 
in terminals of the port authority of new york and new jersey 
which the lower court also had ruled unconstitutional 
douglas lasdon a spokesman for the legal action center for the 
homeless that brought the lawsuit said attorneys had not decided 
whether to appeal 
my fear is that this decision gives them tremendous authority 
and discretion to harass homeless people he said 
you cant decree an end to hunger and homelessness you have 
to deal with the fundamental problems 
sgt robert valentino a transit police spokesman refuted that 
saying the ruling applied only to panhandling and the agency was 
not taking any additional steps against the homeless 
meanwhile transit authority police chief william j bratton and 
his top lieutenants mapped strategy friday morning to begin the 
vigorous enforcement 
panhandling will not be tolerated in the transit system 
valentino said 
valentino said teletype messages were going out to every field 
office so officers and other employees would know that the 
banishing of panhandling is a priority 
motormen conductors and token booth clerks were to be 
instructed to notify police officers if they see beggars 
they stand right here and beg a token booth clerk at the 
77th street station of the irt said as he gestured toward the side 
of his booth 
the clerk said that 40 people usually beg at his station but 
throwing his hand back toward his telephone he noted that the 
instrument has been out five weeks at a time and it would be hard 
to notify police 
they need more cops to protect the station he said 
i think its wonderful because i find it annoying they give 
the city a bad appearance to tell you the truth train rider 
glenda silversack said about the ruling 
im for it and im against it said another rider karl 
adams he didnt mind the passive panhandlers with cups extended 
but was bothered by those shouting yo you got a dollar yo you 
got a dollar 
there may not be much of a choice im a big male and i refuse 
to ride at night i cant tell the difference between someone 
asking for a quarter and ones who put a knife to my throat adams 
said 
matthew vaffney 67 a resident of the bellevue shelter who was 
begging at grand central terminal shoved a reporter and said he 
had already been interviewed by three other reporters 
youve stopped me from making a quarter he said jangling 
change in a coffee cup 
i do what i think is right gathering enough money to see 
his mothers grave on mothers day he said

fbi agents on friday seized 
luxurious homes cars and boats bought with 43 million unearthed 
from drums buried in a farm owned by a reputed drug kingpin 
authorities said 
agents from the fbi and drug enforcement administration 
confiscated property in vega baja 35 miles east of san juan and 
two other puerto rican towns as part of an investigation launched 
march 10 
the probe began after authorities heard vega baja residents were 
using large amounts of cash to buy luxury items including homes 
cars motorcycles boats and jewelry 
the fbi said it has so far traced 11 million of the 43 million 
buried in a farm in vega baja allegedly belonging to a drug baron 
agents also have confiscated millions of dollars worth of property 
bought with the treasure 
the estimate of 43 million is three times higher than when 
reports of the buried treasure surfaced in april 
fbi spokesman anibal torres said friday the 97acre farm 
belonged to alleged cocaine kingpin ramon torres gonzalez who 
authorities say runs a ring that smuggles south american cocaine 
from the us commonwealth of puerto rico to the mainland united 
states 
he said criminal charges against torres gonzalez have not been 
filed and that an ivestigation is continuing the fbi refused to 
say if it knows where he is 
ramon torres gonzalez is a narcotics importer that has been 
directly involved for many years in the importation of multikilo 
loads of cocaine between puerto rico and mainland united states 
according to an fbi court document 
the document filed with the us district court for the 
district of puerto rico and released friday said that in early 
march several residents sneaked into torres gonzalez farm and 
took money buried in 22 plastic drums 
after these incidents the persons that stole the money 
commenced a big shopping spree wherein cars houses jewelry 
motorcycles and other articles were purchased with the drug 
proceeds of ramon torres gonzales the fbi document states 
fbi spokeswoman alina bloom said fbi and dea agents on friday 
seized from the towns of vega baja dorado and carolina dozens of 
cars houses trucks bulldozers and motorcycles purchased with the 
money found in the farm 
authorities said the farm had a helicopter launching pad used 
for drug trafficking 
an fbi press release said the seizure of property was supervised 
by the office of us attorney daniel lopez romo 
ms bloom said the value of the property seized friday has not 
yet been determined the fbi court document says 32 million of the 
43 million unearthed from the farm is believed still in the 
possession of torres gonzalez 
it says 11 million was divided up among more than 10 people 
and that more than 500000 of the stolen cash has been returned 
since march 31 and dozens of cars and trucks houses real estate 
and jewelry had been recovered prior to fridays seizures 
the fbi said torres gonzalez ran a construction equipment 
company to front his narcotics activities and launder drug 
trafficking earnings since the investigation began his farm and 
construction equipment has been consficated 
according to the fbi document any property bought with the 
money is us property because of a law on drug proceeds 
torres gonzalez served a oneyear sentence in 1982 in 
tallahasse fla on charges of conspiracy and distribution of 
cocaine the fbi documents says it said torres gonzalez ran a ring 
in the 1970s out of new york that smuggled peruvian cocaine

a scientist wont testify at a congressional panel 
investigating accusations that she falsified data in a genetics 
research paper she had written with a nobel prizewinner her 
attorney said friday 
she feels very much hounded by an unwarranted intervention 
and intrusion by the government into the scientific process said 
bruce a singal attorney for dr thereza imanishikari of tufts 
university 
imanishikari is declining to testify monday before a house 
subcommittee reviewing charges she misrepresented research reported 
in a 1986 article published in the scientific journal cell 
the committees investigation has focused on forensic studies 
performed on imanishikaris notebooks by secret service 
specialists who allegedly found as many as 40 pages were prepared 
up to two years after their recorded dates 
mondays hearing also was scheduled to examine a may 4 forensics 
study that suggests the boston pathologist made fraudulent tape 
recordings to support the paper which was researched at tufts and 
the massachusetts institute of technology 
this a case study of how institutions respond or dont respond 
when there are questions or allegations about the quality or 
accuracy or integrity of research said dennis fitzgibbons a 
spokesman for the subcommittee 
the congressional investigation began in 1986 after a former mit 
researcher charged she could not duplicate the published study 
which examined the immune cells in genetically altered mice 
investigations were conducted by both mit and tufts where 
imanishikari now works but both schools reported the research 
required no corrections 
the national institutes of health also has investigated the 
charges but singal said his client would not cooperate unless the 
panel detailed the allegations against her 
this is becoming an annual rite of spring being invited back 
to the dingell committee every may singal said 
imanishikari testified a year ago before the house subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations chaired by rep john dingell 
dmich 
at that time she told the committee that her notebooks had 
nothing to do with the published experiments and showed only that 
i am not a neat person 
david baltimore an mit molecular biologist and coauthor of the 
study has joined other scientists backing imanishikaris claim 
that the notebook had no bearing on the work 
it is apparent that after years of investigation a 
reasonable person must conclude that the cell paper was an honest 
report of collaborative research said baltimore a 1975 nobel 
laureate who has been named president of rockefeller university in 
new york 
in a letter sent thursday to dingell singal said the latest 
hearings were nothing more than a rehash that his client would 
decline to attend 
we frankly do not understand why this same set of socalled 
findings is now being recycled one year later singal wrote it 
is as insignificant and irrelevant now as it was a year ago to any 
legitimate scientific issue 
singal said the secret service report issued may 4 and made 
public by his client thursday contained deficiencies and 
omissions which preclude the possibility of any meaningful 
response at this time 
he said imanishikari would be willing to respond to the charges 
her tapes were fraudulent after more information and clarification 
of the charges was made available 
fitzgibbons declined to elaborate on the report which was to be 
the subject of secret service testimony monday

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday he 
did not know of the governments secret funding of a jewish 
settlement in the christian quarter of jerusalems old city before 
it was publicly disclosed a spokesman said 
also friday an arab killed a palestinian activist who tried to 
burn his house in the west bank village of yatta arab reports said 
shamir made the statement in a conversation with jerusalem mayor 
teddy kollek said shamirs aide avi pazner kollek just returned 
from a visit to the united states where he met with president bush 
he shamir did not know of the settlement beforehand 
pazner said in an interview 
last month 150 settlers moved into a building owned by the 
greek orthodox church prompting protests by christian and moslem 
arabs and touching off a controversy that strained israels 
relations with the united states 
the settlers evacuated the building may 1 following an order 
from the supreme court some 20 caretakers remain inside pending an 
appeal of the decision the church claims a former tenant illegally 
leased the building to the settlers 
officials in the housing ministry led by david levy one of 
shamirs leading rivals within the rightwing likud bloc disclosed 
the ministry secretly put up some 18 million to help fund the 
settlement and that the finance ministry was aware of the funding 
shamir has been in charge of the finance ministry since the 
midmarch collapse of the coalition government that united the 
likud with the centerleft labor party of former finance minister 
shimon peres 
pazner insisted the initial sums were given when peres was 
finance minister 
he said the remainder of the money was transferred without 
shamirs knowledge and the move did not require his approval 
jerusalem city spokeswoman bonnie boxer refused to comment on 
shamirs statement 
she said kollek stands by everything he said which was that 
the settlement in the christian quarter was a mistake 
in recent weeks shamirs caretaker government has authorized 
the construction of two new settlements one in the occupied west 
bank and one in the gaza strip 
the united states has protested the construction of the 
settlements calling them an obstacle to peace 
the occupied lands are home to 17 million palestinians and 
about 70000 jewish settlers 
fridays violence came when a group of arab activists set fire 
to the house of fatima ale believed to be an informant for the 
israeli administration palestinian journalists said her husband 
abu zedan opened fire with a machine gun killing imahem abu 
zamran 18 the journalists said 
arabs assisting israeli authorities are sometimes issued weapons 
for selfprotection 
the army confirmed the death but said it resulted from a 
conflict between villagers the incident is under police 
investigation the military said 
at least 685 palestinians have died of israeli gunfire in the 
29month revolt against israeli rule an additional 212 have been 
slain by their arab brethren on suspicion of cooperating with 
israeli authorities fortythree israelis have also died in the 
violence

the city council on friday urged police to 
bypass federal prosecutors in cases that could draw the new federal 
death penalty for drugconspiracy homicides 
the council approved 103 a nonbinding resolution urging police 
detectives in minnesotas largest city to present such cases to 
county or state prosecutors rather than the us attorney 
the action came one day after federal prosecutors in chicago 
announced the first use of the death penalty law enacted in 1988 
they said they would seek capital punishment for two men accused of 
killing a witness to protect a 50000aday drug ring 
the federal law allows capital punishment for murders committed 
to further drug conspiracies 
the minneapolis resolution won initial approval last week by a 
city council panel 
my personal opinion is that the death penalty serves no useful 
societal purpose council member joan campbell the resolutions 
chief sponsor said friday i dont think its the responsibility 
of a civilized society to kill people if they kill other people 
im not in any way suggesting that the crimes are not 
heinous she said 
us attorney jerome arnold indicated the resolution would have 
little or no effect in determining whether his office would 
prosecute a case where the death penalty might be warranted 
what a municipality may do in passing resolutions will have no 
effect on what the federal government is going to do in a given 
case arnold said 
council member walt dziedzic a former city police officer who 
opposed the resolution said it sends the wrong message out there 
that this city this great city is soft on crime 
im not soft on crime campbell said i think we ought to 
be as tough on crime as we can be up to this point 
council member dennis schulstad the only independentrepublican 
on the democratfarmerlabordominated council said the resolution 
in effect tells drug dealers the federal government is too mean 
and that they therefore should be prosecuted by the county attorney 
that is not the message i want to send said schulstad who 
also voted against the resolution 
we are weak on crime and punishment in minnesota and dont let 
any person tell you differently he said 
i couldnt disagree with you more about the message said 
council member pat scott i would contend that the people 
committing these kinds of crimes arent listening to any arm of 
government he said 
i dont think the criminals are listening to us councilman 
schulstad said council president sharon sayles belton a former 
state probation and parole officer 
former council president alice rainville joined schulstad and 
dziedzic in voting against the resolution 
campbell said the resolution reaffirms a vote in the 1989 
minnesota legislature in which the house judiciary committee killed 
a proposal to reinstate the death penalty by an overwhelming 
bipartisan vote 
minnesota repealed its death penalty in 1911 
hennepin county attorney tom johnson who helped draft the 
minneapolis resolution said thursday he hopes the policy statement 
set an example to other jurisdictions and to other cities that 
they can say no to the federal death penalty

conservationists reacted with anger friday to 
interior secretary manuel lujans suggestion that a 200 million 
telescope should be built despite its potential effect on an 
endangered squirrel do we have to save every subspecies lujan 
had asked 
interviewed thursday by the denver post the interior secretary 
noted the controversy surrounding the arizona project which could 
be stopped under the endangered species act 
at issue is the mount graham red squirrel all that are left 
fewer than 100 are in a colony on the mountain where the 
university of arizona the smithsonian institution and others want 
to build a powerful telescope and observatory 
conservationists have sought to stop construction because the 
squirrel is on the endangered species list in the interview lujan 
suggested congress should soften the act and commented 
do we have to save every subspecies the red squirrel is the 
best example nobodys told me the difference between a red 
squirrel a black one or a brown one 
he also said the law was just too tough and added weve 
got to change it 
as the interview circulated friday conservationists vented 
their rage 
michael francis of the wilderness society said the interview 
shows mr lujans incredible lack of understanding of biology and 
public policy 
id have to say hes getting pretty close to another jim watt 
mr lujan certainly is trying to better his mark 
jay hair president of the national wildlife federation said he 
was incensed that the very cabinet official whose job it is to be 
the countrys frontline protector of endangered wildlife would 
make such outrageous statements 
hair said that the mount graham red squirrel is in the 11th 
hour of existence on the planet 
a spokesman for lujan did not quarrel with the published 
interview which the secretary gave while attending a national park 
foundation banquet at the mesa verde national park near durango 
colo 
steve goldstein lujans press secretary said his boss had 
sought only to point out some frustrations he has had with 
enforcing the endangered species act 
he said lujan wants congress to determine whether the law is 
being implemented correctly 
later friday after conferring with lujan who was in colorado 
goldstein said lujan does not consider the changes he would like 
congress to make as a weakening of the endangered species act 
he wants congress to look at two things how far down we 
should go in protecting subspecies and what protection should be 
afforded when the same species exist in multiple locations said 
goldstein 
goldstein said lujan believes that increasingly the law is 
being used by people as a last recourse to stop economic 
development projects they dont like and not specifically to 
protect endangered species 
manuel lujan will diligently enforce the endangered species 
act as it is written but he wants congress to determine whether 
its being implemented correctly or if its just being used to stop 
development projects goldstein said 
lujan had said in the interview that he expected his views would 
upset a few people 
the arizona controversy is one of several that have surfaced 
recently involving the endangered species law 
the interior department also is considering whether to halt the 
animasla plata water project in colorado because of a threat to 
the endangered squawfish in addition an emotional dispute between 
loggers and environmentalists over the spotted owl has raged for 
more than a year in the pacific northwest 
lujan said in the interview that he is obliged under the law 
to protect endangered species wherever they exist without 
regard to economic considerations and to take into account only 
biological facts 
but he questioned the narrowness of that requirement 
do we have to save an endangered species in every locality 
where it exists lujan asked 
he cited the turmoil over the squawfish in that case he said 
his department is caught between two things 
the 582 million animasla plata project would provide water for 
four indian tribes and irrigate southwestern colorado and new 
mexico farmland but the water diversion would threaten the 
squawfish by depleting water in the san juan basin 
by law i am protector of endangered species and by treaty 
i am trustee for native americans lujan said

each time the sun comes up or goes down on the 
hubble space telescope the the 15 billion instrument wobbles 
slightly for reasons engineers still dont fully understand 
it extends for several minutes 10 or maybe 30 minutes after 
we come from the dark to the sunlight jean olivier a top nasa 
telescope official said friday its only in the later twothird 
of the sunlight portion of the orbit that it begins to die down 
the telescope orbits earth every 97 minutes and goes through the 
dawntodusk cycle nearly 15 times a day the stabilization 
problem which showed up earlier this week is one of many 
headaches that have put setup work on the telescope far behind 
schedule 
still astronomers at the goddard space flight center in 
maryland hope they will see the first photograph from the telescope 
wednesday or friday 
olivier said scientists are all but certain that the telescopes 
solar arrays are causing the wobble the two arrays 40 feet by 8 
feet gather energy from the sun the energy is converted to 
electricity to provide power for the telescope 
what we havent determined is what is exciting the solar 
arrays olivier said we dont know whether its something on 
board the vehicle that is moving it could be the thermal 
changes 
olivier said the astronauts of shuttle discovery who put the 
telescope into its orbit on april 25 saw a slight twist in one of 
the arrays about a 4inch difference between one side and the 
other but olivier said it is not known whether that is causing 
the problem 
its not conclusive what that means its just an observation 
the crew made were taking it like everything else as something 
to look at olivier said 
the telescope also is rolling slightly but project scientist ed 
weiler said that problem is expected to disappear once the 
instrument finds star arrangements that match the pattern stored in 
computers 
the first picture to be taken by the telescope is to have a 
onesecond exposure the roll is so slight weiler said that an 
exposure would have to last 10 to 20 minutes before any movement 
was visible in the resulting photograph

the povertyplagued mississippi delta 
needs a broad range of remedies including a regional bank 
expanded medicaid coverage and magnet schools to catch up with the 
rest of america says a report released friday 
the 3 million report to be presented to congress on monday is 
billed as a handbook for action for a region of rich soil and 
struggling farms modern hospitals and dying babies the region is 
home to some of the nations top writers and poorest readers 
the study offers a long list of ambitious goals and broadly 
worded requests for help from federal state and local governments 
businesses religious leaders and just about anyone else who might 
be willing to lend a hand 
but the report by the lower mississippi delta commission makes 
scant mention of where the money might come from to pay for its 
recommendations 
the commmission created by congress in 1988 to prepare a 
10year plan for economic development of the delta wasnt 
responsible for finding sources of funding said commission member 
ed jones 
we dont know where the money is going to come from said 
jones a retired democratic congressman from northwest tennessee 
that wasnt our job 
the report defines the delta as a 219county strip along the 
mississippi river from illinois and missouri to kentucky 
tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana 
the studys main recommendations include 
coordination of efforts by federal agencies dealing with 
infants and pregnant women to reduce the high rate of infant deaths 
in the delta 
creation of comprehensive state programs aimed at reducing the 
number of teenage pregnancies 
expansion of medicaid coverage for former welfare recipients 
who find jobs and increased efforts to attract more doctors and 
nurses 
establishment of a regional bank to pay special attention to 
small businesses and those owned by minorities 
revision of federal tax codes to allow firsttime lowincome 
home buyers to set up taxfree savings accounts for down payments 
establishment of model magnet schools in each of the delta 
states and a regional magnet school for math and science 
more money from congress for head start educational programs 
more training for delta farmers trying to keep up with

for french jews flourishing more than at any time 
in their history the desecration of tombstones in a southern town 
was a brutal reminder of frances long sordid history of 
antisemitism 
from the conviction of army officer alfred dreyfus nearly 100 
years ago to roundups of jews by french police during world war ii 
to the bombing of a paris synagogue in 1980 antisemitism remains 
a major fear among french jews 
antisemitism is a dormant volcano whose eruptions are never 
predictable wrote political analyst robert sole 
this weeks vandalism and mutilation of a recently buried corpse 
in carpentras came in an era of renewed jewish pride in france 
it also coincided with the steady rise of the extremeright 
national front a party that has rallied an estimated 15 percent of 
voters around an antiimmigrant racist platform that also targets 
jews 
its leader jeanmarie le pen prides himself on saying out 
loud what everybody is thinking to themselves he has joked about 
the nazis crematoriums and called the gas chambers a detail 
whose existence was still being debated by historians 
he regularly rails against jewish lobbies and frequently 
accuses the media of being dominated by jews 
his followers deny their policies fuel racial hatred and 
antisemitism but french jews arent so sure 
traumatized by world war ii which saw the deportation of some 
117000 jews from france to nazi concentration camps a community 
of guiltridden survivors harbored fears of new persecution 
after the war many renounced their jewish identities changed 
their names refused to circumcise baby boys or to give their 
children jewish educations 
today jewish life is thriving in the past 15 years the number 
of synagogues in the paris area has jumped from 30 to 70 in 1950 
there were three kosher butchers today there are more than 100 
kosher restaurants fastfood outlets supermarkets and 
professional caterers are too numerous to be counted 
jewish publications boast more readers than ever and 13 radio 
stations broadcast hebrew and yiddish songs cultural and news 
commentaries 
the revival is due largely to the 150000 sephardic jews from 
morocco algeria and tunisia who poured into france during the 
1950s and 1960s as the french colonies won independence 
the sephardim jews of spanish origin as opposed to jews from 
eastern europe known as ashkenazic make up more than 60 percent 
of frances population of about 650000 jews that is possibly the 
worlds thirdlargest jewish community after the united states and 
israel since immigration has reduced the number of jews in the 
soviet union 
besides their own folklore and cuisine the sephardim brought an 
unconditional commitment to judaism and a demand for jewish culture 
in france 
in the three decades since they arrived they have become as 
prominent in french life as their ashkenazic counterparts enjoying 
enviable positions in industry government the media and the arts

peru hit hard by drought is calling on 
industrialized countries and the united nations to donate food to 
help it get through the next nine months a government spokesman 
said friday 
for the past year peru along with neighboring bolivia has been 
suffering the worst drought in the region this century the drought 
comes as peru copes with its worst economic crisis in 90 years 
the drought has led to strict water rationing in the capital 
lima and its port city of callao with a total population of 7 
million many outlying areas depend on water delivered by trucks 
limas mayor ricardo belmont has warned that the rimac river 
the citys main source of water may run dry by july 
perus electricity supply which comes mainly from hydroelectric 
complexes has also been cut by the drought 
only 14000 tons of food remain in the counrys storehouses 
said estuardo diaz head of perus national office of food support 
he said about 260000 tons of food were needed 
peru is seeking aid from the united states the european 
community and wheatrich argentina as well as the united nations 
diaz said 
agriculture ministry sources have said more than half perus 
annual crop of wheat rice and potatoes has been lost and next 
years crop is threatened 
the countrys andean mountain regions have been hardest hit 
many peasants are abandoning the countryside thousands of others 
have had to slaughter their cattle for lack of feed 
perus main wheat and riceproducing centers are mainly along 
the countrys arid pacific coast and are irrigated by rivers that 
flow out of the mountains which are running at far below normal 
levels 
no substantial relief is expected until the next rainy season 
in november 
rising guerrilla violence and the flood of peasants to the 
cities have driven down food production for the past decade last 
year peru imported 700 million worth of food 
now peru lacks foreign reserves to step up imports the annual 
inflation rate is topping 2000 percent and the government is all 
but bankrupt 
maoist shining path guerrillas have sought for years to cut the 
flow of food into lima hoping to spark an insurrection in the city

president bush setting a distant 
deadline in space exploration said friday that americans should 
walk on mars by the year 2019 
its time to open up the final frontier bush said there 
can be no turning back 
bush who next tuesday will begin a budget summit with congress 
in an effort to cut the federal deficit did not cite a cost 
estimate for a manned mars landing or say how the government would 
pay for it nasa has put a 500 billion price tag on the mission 
which would include establishment of a base on the moon 
asked how the united states could get to mars bush quipped to 
reporters you have to go fairly fast its a long way out 
there 
as for the money bush said thirty years is a long time by 
2019 bush would be 95 years old 
bush proclaimed the mars deadline in a speech at texas aampi 
university opening a twoday trip of three commencement addresses 
later at a republican fundraising event in columbia sc 
bush again called for a cut in the capital gains tax rate saying 
im going to keep on like a broken record until i get that thing 
done up there 
in his speech at the university of south carolina on saturday 
bush will annouce formation of a volunteer citizenship democracy 
corps an administration source said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the corps 
would try to help the new democracies of eastern europe establish 
democratic institutions and legal systems 
proclaiming his goal for a mission to mars bush said nasa is in 
line for the largest budget increase of any major agency of the 
government he declared that leadership in space exploration 
takes more than just dollars it also takes a decision and so 
im announcing one today 
he said he was returning to texas his adopted home state to 
announce a new age of exploration with not only a goal but also 
a timetable i believe that before apollo celebrates the 50th 
anniversary of its landing on the moon the american flag should be 
planted on mars 
the apollo moon landing was on july 20 1969 falling within the 
10year deadline set by thenpresident john f kennedy 
thirty years ago nasa was founded and the space race began 
bush said and 30 years from now i believe man will stand on 
another planet 
in a speech last summer commemorating the lunar landing bush 
set a goal of a manned expedition to mars but did not specify a 
timetable 
he also proposed completion of a manned space station by the end 
of the century and the establishment of a permanent lunar base by 
2010 
you are coming of age during a golden age of space bush 
told the graduating students also mentioning the hubble space 
telescope now in orbit 
bush said his space budget proposal was proof positive of 
americas commitment to an active exciting and continuing presence 
in space to americas leadership in space 
the president proposed 152 billion for nasa a 24 percent 
increase the largest percentage boost for any major agency of the 
government 
nearly 1 billion of that would contribute directly or 
indirectly to exploration some 188 million is to begin a variety 
of technology studies for an advanced launch system a lunar 
observer and a satellite called lifesat which would study 
radiation biology 
another 775 million includes work on a new power plant and the 
mars observer mission in 1992 nasas planning has focused on going 
back to the moon in the years 2004 to 2010 and to mars between 2016 
and 2020 
the national research council two months ago said it would be a 
mistake to use the space station the next big american project as 
a staging area for a moonmars mission it said too that nuclear 
power will be essential for such bases and that nuclear propulsion 
for spacecraft should be tested 
for any moonmars project the united states would have to 
develop rockets with far greater power than those in use currently 
it would need to work also on developing new systems to sustain the 
lives of astronauts for a voyage of two years 
in texas friday bush made a brief stop to greet flagwaving 
youngsters 
bush stopped his motorcade hopped out of his limousine and 
shook hands with some of about 100 cheering pupils lining the

fidel castro has lent a hand to manuel noriega in 
his drugtrafficking case the ousted panamanian leaders lawyers 
said friday 
the cuban president met with noriegas defense team in march 
said attorney frank rubino adding that he couldnt reveal what 
castro told them due to the classified nature of the information 
fidel castro met with some of gen noriegas lawyers and 
discussed certain sensitive issues with us rubino told the miami 
herald he further provided us with certain documentation 
castro was quoted by a brazilian television reporter as saying 
his information will clear noriega 
i have even talked with noriegas lawyers castro said if 
this is the evidence prosecutors have against noriega then they 
have no evidence against him and i have all the proof which proves 
the falsehoods of the accusations 
the cuban leader did not say what kind of evidence he gave the 
lawyers but claimed to have all the cards in my hands to 
irrefutably prove the lies 
according to a february 1988 indictment the cuban leader 
mediated a dispute in 1984 between noriega and colombias medellin 
drug cartel over a raid on a drug lab the panamanian leader had 
supposedly been paid to protect 
noriega is at the federal metropolitan correctional center 
outside of miami awaiting trail on charges he took money from the 
cartel to make his country a safe haven for cocaine smuggling 
on friday us district judge william hoeveler ordered 
prosecutors to explain why it gave 58 million confiscated from 
noriega to panamas new government 
hoeveler said it appeared the us government had failed to 
follow normal legal procedures before surrendering the cash found 
at noriegas quarters in panama during the us invasion in 
december 
although its not common to have 5 million or 6 million in 
ones bedroom it appears the money was his the judge said 
that raises an interesting question about what right the 
government had to give it away 
hoeveler spoke during a hearing called by defense attorneys 
whove threatened to withdraw saying they havent been paid since 
noriega was captured jan 4 two weeks after the invasion began 
prosecutors have seized 20 million in 27 bank accounts around 
the world the defense says noriega must have earned at least some 
money legally during his 25year career as military officer and de 
facto ruler of panama and told the judge it needs some of that 
money to represent noreiga in the complex expensive case 
hoeveler has ordered prosecutors to show why the money shouldnt 
be released to noriega and his attorneys saying the government has 
an obligation to show money was obtained illegally before freezing 
accounts 
hoeveler also questioned the defense contention that noriega had 
no information of his own about where his assets were saying he 
wanted the general to tell him by the next hearing whether he has 
additional accounts 
defense attorney john may said noreiga had not told them about 
any additional money and added that he had no records with him in 
jail 
we are not talking about accounts as you or i might have 
may said these were handled by intermediaries and certain 
people who handled a lot of these matters are under indictment 
defense attorney steven kollin said prosecutors have given the 
defense information on accounts in the united kingdom valued at 
about 10 million 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan asked the judge to 
block the defense from seeing any more details from the list 
saying some of the information could help the defense 
they contain considerable allegations sources of information 
the government has accumulated sullivan said 
defense attorneys said they would accept a strippeddown list 
with just the account numbers and the agency currently controlling 
them but the judge did not rule on the issue 
noriega had been scheduled to attend the hearing but rubino 
his lead attorney was held up in another case and the attorneys 
for both sides decided to proceed without them 
the judge set a new hearing date for may 21 and sullivan said 
prosecutors would have more information about noriegas sources of 
income by that time 
the defense has subpoenaed records of the cia the drug 
enforcement administration and other agencies seeking to show 
noriega received about 11 million in payoffs from the united 
states government as well as up to 7 million more from foreign 
governments

pope john paul ii on friday 
comforted the families of pilgrims who died in an airplane crash 
then urged mexicos downtrodden indians to fight to improve their 
lives 
dont be seduced by vices like alcohol abuse which causes so 
many ravages and dont cooperate with drug trafficking which 
causes destruction to so many people in the world he told more 
than 150000 people at an outdoor prayer service 
john paul also expressed concern for refugees fleeing political 
persecution and death squads in guatemala tuxtla gutierrez is 
about 100 miles northwest of the guatemalan border and 425 miles 
southeast of mexico city 
behind the altar were misty green mountains in the heart of 
mexicos indian country massed marimbas played and thousands of 
indian women wearing traditional black dresses and redembroidered 
blouses cheered as the pope arrived 
before the outdoor service john paul stopped at the whitewashed 
colonial san marcos cathedral to pray for 28 pilgrims who died 
thursday in a plane crash while flying in to see the pope 
death is not the last word because for those who have faith 
life does not end it transforms itself the pope said 
illuminated and aided by that truth we raise our petition to the 
lord for those who died and invoke consolation for those who mourn 
their loved ones 
he kissed a bronze cross on the coffin of luis miguel canton 
marin bishop of tapachula who worked closely with indian groups 
he then comforted family members many of whom burst into tears and 
kneeled to kiss john pauls ring 
at a mass in villahermosa 90 miles north of tuxtla gutierrez 
the pope lamented the expansion of usbased evangelical churches 
in mexico especially strong in indian areas and pleaded with 
converts to return to the catholic faith 
i think again about those people who have distanced themselves 
from the catholic church i would like to meet with each one of 
you to say return to the breast of the church your mother the 
pope cried at a mass for nearly 100000 people 
the pontiffs homily reflected growing alarm in the vatican over 
the success of noncatholic churches in latin america and 
particularly in mexico the number of protestants grew more than 
500 percent in mexico from 195080 to 27 million an estimated 90 
percent of mexicos 85 million people remain roman catholic 
as the pope began his homily a brief earthquake shook mexico 
city 400 miles away to the northwest it was not felt in 
villahermosa 
mexicos native indians suffer widespread poverty and 
discrimination and despite land reform laws many have lost their 
communal lands to private farmers alcoholism is a serious problem 
others have turned to drug trafficking 
protestant sects have translated the bible into native 
languages finding fertile ground in the hopeless poverty of 
landless peasants and those who have moved to neighborhoods of 
shacks in the cities 
in tuxtla gutierrez the pope encouraged indians not to lose 
hope in the face of poverty or the continuous assalt on your 
cultural traditions 
he added that the indians traditional emphasis on the paradise 
of the afterlife was admirable but you also have the obligation 
to improve your own human situation 
everyone must act in accordance with his own responsibility 
without waiting for all the political assistential and social 
structures the pontiff said 
six million people here speak only indian dialects and ancient 
mayan is a growing language the pope greeted indians in the 
indigenous tzotzil and zoque tongues drawing roars of laughter and 
cheers as he joked about his own pronunciation 
now i have a difficult task john paul remarked as he was 
about to embark on a few lines of tzotzil saying jesus loves 
you as he loves all his disciples who are the salt of the earth 
and the light of the world 
a rhyming spanish chant of indians friends the pope is with 
you went up the pope said yes and repeated the line as 
cheering continued the pope remarked your shouting is very good 
for the pope because he can rest a little

west germany disclosed friday that the 
price for german unification may include temporarily picking up 
part of the tab for soviet troops based in east germany 
in another development west germanys chief government 
spokesman accused east german communists of inciting labor unrest 
in that country he also said the two germanys are close to 
agreeing on the final terms of a treaty that would merge their 
economies in two months 
the economic merger which will make the west german mark the 
official currency of east germany will cause financial problems 
for the soviet union which keeps 380000 troops in east germany 
a west german government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said sovietwest german talks began this week in bonn 
over how to cover the living costs of the red army troops in east 
germany 
it appears that soviet soldiers in east germany could start 
receiving west german marks for their living costs in exchange for 
soviet rubles after the economic merger 
such an arrangement would mark the first time a nato country 
ended up paying in its own currency for the stationing of soviet 
troops 
under current troopstationing agreements with east germany the 
soviet union buys east german marks in exchange for socalled 
transfer rubles at a preferential rate 
the east marks are then used to pay for goods and services for 
soviet soldiers stationed in east germany these are relatively 
inexpensive because of state subsidies 
but west german officials say two complex problems have to be 
worked out in the talks on covering the troop costs 
when the west german mark becomes the east german currency some 
sort of an exchange rate will have to be established with the 
soviet transfer ruble which now is not convertible to western 
currencies 
also the economic merger will result in the scrapping of east 
german subsidies and the steep price rises that are anticipated 
will also have to be taken into account 
the west german official said the bilateral talks with moscow 
are just starting and that it is not clear what kind of arrangement 
covering the red armys stationing costs will be worked out 
it also remains unclear how much west germany would end up 
paying in deutsche marks to maintain the soviet troops or whether 
the average soviet soldier would come out ahead 
the official said he did not know what the current costs for the 
soviet troops are 
any arrangement would be seen as temporary by west germany bonn 
has said it is willing to let soviet troops remain on what is now 
east german territory but only during a transition phase in the 
unification process 
bonn has insisted that a unified germany belong only to nato 
moscow has opposed this saying that after reunification germany 
should be neutral or temporarily belong to both nato and the warsaw 
pact 
east german foreign minister markus meckel on friday said the 
idea of united germany belonging to both alliances was absurd 
meckel also said he expects a substantial reduction in soviet 
troops soon 
west german chancellor helmut kohl trying to win soviet support 
for his unification plans has offered expanded economic ties as an 
inducement to moscow to back down on its resistance to nato 
membership 
west german government spokeman dieter vogel said that finance 
minister theodor waigel will travel to east berlin on monday to 
discuss the soviet troops issue with east german officials 
meanwhile west germanys chief government spokesman hans 
klein accused east german communists of inciting thursdays labor 
unrest in east germany 
tens of thousands of teachers textile workers and farmers 
staged brief protests and strikes on thursday to demand protection 
from the widespread unemployment expected as east germany moves to 
a free market economy 
klein said the strike organizers are to some extent exactly 
the forces who caused east germanys dire economic problems 
before last falls democratic upheaval ousted the communists from 
power

a ban on imports of diamonds mined in south 
africa could be ineffective and probably would be widely evaded 
according to a a congressional study released friday 
such a ban would have little effect on south africas economy 
said the study by the general accounting office the investigating 
arm of congress because diamonds are only about 2 percent of the 
countrys exports 
diamonds are not covered by the 1986 law that imposed various 
trade sanctions on south africa in an action against the countrys 
racial separation policy apartheid sen edward m kennedy 
dmass asked the general accounting office for a report on the 
feasibility of banning imports of south african diamonds 
diamonds cannot be physically distinguished by country of 
origin the debeers central selling organization which buys most 
of the worlds diamonds and markets 75 percent to 85 percent of all 
diamonds sold in the world already has refused to cooperate in 
keeping track of south african diamonds 
debeers mines in south africa botswana and namimbia account 
for 36 percent of world production and 17 percent of the value of 
the sales of the selling organization come from diamonds mined in 
south africa the gao report noted 
diamonds are traded so often before reaching the major consuming 
countries that many opportunities would arise to create false 
certificates of origins for diamonds of south african or unknown 
origin gao said false certificates already are reported used 
for sales to india which bans diamond imports from south africa 
the agency said 
the only possibility of an effective ban would come through 
agreements between the united states and other nations with major 
diamond cutting indusrtries belgium india and israel the report 
said 
in such a case gao said cutters could be forced to chose 
between buying from debeers and direct purchases from producing 
countries and the producers might not sell to them because they 
derive advantages from their debeers connection notably the 
companys marketing expertise and policy of buying diamonds even 
when the market is weak 
but if the producers broke loose they could capture some of 
debeers profits either independently or in a cartel at the cost 
of assuming the risks of market fluctuations gao said

a regionally divided federal appeals court on 
friday issued an emergency order allowing release of water from a 
reservoir in the dakotas into the droughtshrunken missouri river 
the order by the 8th us circuit court of appeals is the latest 
development in a battle between upstream and downstream states over 
water from lake oahe which stretches through the central dakotas 
it allows the army corps of engineers to let water out of the 
lake to raise levels in the missouri a move the corps and the 
downstream states contend is needed to maintain shipping on the 
river 
the 8th circuit order stays a previous ruling by a us district 
judge in bismarck nd which ordered the corps to maintain lake 
levels through june 1 after the spring hatch of walleye pike 
the stay was issued by a threejudge panel of the 8th circuit 
until arguments can be heard on the case the court scheduled those 
arguments for may 16 in st paul minn 
judges george fagg of des moines iowa and pasco bowman of 
kansas city were in favor of granting the emergency stay judge 
roger wollman of pierre sd dissented 
montana and the dakotas want to keep the water where it is in 
lake oahe a 232mile long reservoir that cuts through north and 
south dakota they contend the release would cripple their fishing 
industry and tourism 
iowa nebraska kansas and missouri want the pent up water 
turned loose to keep barge traffic moving and the wheels of 
commerce turning in their states officials from the downstream 
states maintain that drinking water wildlife and power plants 
would suffer in addition to shipping companies 
a spokesman for the corps said releases into the missouri would 
be increased again from both lake oahe and the last dam downriver 
gavins point which is on the south dakotanebraska border 
because of the rain were getting the effect on lake oahe 
will be very modest said paul johnston a spokesman for the 
corps missouri river division in omaha neb 
attorneys from the justice department asked for the stay 
thursday a day after us district judge patrick conmy in 
bismarck nd issued an order to curtail the flow of water into 
the river at the request of the three northern states

racial conflicts mayor david dinkins on friday called on new 
yorkers to end the citys long history of ethnic conflict

heal the pain dinkins said in the 27minute speech broadcast by 
several of the citys television and radio stations

intervene personally in a confrontational 4monthlong boycott by 
blacks of two grocery stores owned by koreanamericans 
all of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity free 
to walk any street and shop in any store at any time in any 
neighborhood without fear of force or violence the citys first

we will never allow any group or any person to turn to 
violence or the threat of violence to intimidate others no matter 
how legitimate their anger or frustration may be dinkins said 
he mentioned several racial conflicts including the boycott in 
brooklyn that controversy has spilled over into the courts where 
a judge chastised dinkins for not intervening 
also a brawl erupted last week at a brooklyn college during a 
speech by a professor who believes in white superiority a columbia 
university sports banquet was disrupted by a soccer players verbal 
attack on gays and jews pulitzer prizewinning columnist jimmy

slurring an asianamerican coworker 
guests at the speech including religious leaders city 
officials and representatives of the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith listened as dinkins spoke in city council chambers 
dinkins noted that new york has many problems including 
expensive housing crack aids and a faltering economy 
unfortunately some smallminded people prey upon these 
pressures spreading a message not of unity but of division he 
said i challenge all of the people of this city to reject these 
calls to bigotry 
dinkins said blacks jews and immigrants from ireland italy and 
other countries faced violence as they arrived here its an old 
story a cycle of immigration and discrimination thats as old as 
this city itself he said 
dinkins outlined a plan to heal the racial divisions including 
formation of a bias strike force at the city commission of human 
rights and a study by the commission of discrimination in bank 
lending practices 
hours before the speech a black construction worker was beaten 
with bats and billy clubs by as many as five white men in the 
brighton beach section of brooklyn the man was found wandering in 
bensonhurst about a mile away from the attack and was treated for 
cuts and bruises police spokesman lt ray odonnell said 
police said they didnt know whether the beating was racially 
motivated since the victim said no words were exchanged 
in downtown brooklyn two juries deliberated for another day in 
the case of two white teenagers accused of murdering yusuf 
hawkins a black 16yearold who came to their mostly white 
bensonhurst neighborhood to look at a used car 
outside the courthouse 200 to 300 demonstrators and spectators 
had gathered by midafternoon earlier a small cluster of people 
hung a banner reading civil rights or civil war 
both juries recessed for the evening and were to resume 
deliberations saturday 
emotions at the trial boiled over wednesday when defense lawyer 
stephen murphy was punched in the face by one of several hundred 
demonstrators demanding murder convictions 
demonstrators tried to hit murphy again thursday but he was 
surrounded by police and apparently escaped injury 
murphy also represented a client in the howard beach case the 
last major trial that stirred tensions between blacks and whites in 
the city 
dinkins at his jan 1 inauguration described the city as a 
gorgeous mosaic of different nationalities colors and sexual 
preferences in recent weeks supporters and reporters harshly 
questioned why he had not rallied to the defense of the mosaic 
he believes in what he refers to as quiet diplomacy he thinks 
it will work and i hope it will said former mayor edward i 
koch 
but the rev calvin butts of abyssinian baptist church in harlem 
said we dont need a quiet diplomat we need strong forthright 
leadership

police on friday sought a 12yearold girl 
needing heart surgery and her mother who authorities said abducted 
the girl from a hospital because the womans religion forbids blood 
transfusions 
the girl kimberly winfield was believed to have left 
childrens memorial hospital about 1 am thursday said police lt 
edmund beazley 
the mother caroline winfield called relatives to say she 
wanted to return her daughter said dave schneidman spokesman for 
the illinois department of children and family services but she 
was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted 
police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35yearold mother on 
a charge of child abduction because kimberly is a ward of the 
state beazley said 
were not real interested in catching the mother if she 
doesnt want to be caught but we do want the child back so we can 
save the childs life schneidman said 
police and the state department of children and family services 
said they were reasonably certain the mother was responsible for 
the childs disappearance 
there doesnt seem to be any doubt of it right now beazley 
said 
before the child was discovered missing the mother had told 
relatives that she was going to take the child from the hospital 
because she did not approve of the surgery said department 
spokesman schneidman 
schneidman said the child needed openheart surgery to survive 
the prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live 
without the surgery he said 
however childrens memorial hospital spokeswoman jan benzies 
said kimberly who was admitted wednesday was not critically ill 
she was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her 
heart problem the spokeswoman said her doctor does not 
believe her life is in immediate danger 
however it is clinically advisable that she be located and 
treated within a month she said 
no one at the hospital saw the mother or child leave beazley 
said 
apparently she just got her dressed and walked out he 
said they were allowing the mother to stay in the room with her 
which is pretty common with young children the nurse came back to 
check on them and they were both gone 
the mother is a jehovahs witness beazley said 
jehovahs witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against 
the teachings of the bible 
you cant do surgery without a transfusion of blood 
schneidman said 
the department of children and family services waited about 34 
hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could 
check leads on winfields whereabouts schneidman said those leads 
were exhausted he said 
the agency was named temporary custodian of kimberly and two 
brothers ages 2 and 8 about a month ago because winfield was 
unable to care for them schneidman said 
they were living on the streets without proper housing or any 
evident means of support schneidman said 
the boys whose names were not released are now living with 
their paternal grandmother in chicago beazley said 
a department caseworker noticed kimberly was ill and took her to 
the hospital schneidman said 
larry winfield kimberlys father had been notified and was 
very concerned schneidman said he maintains a permanent residence 
and is employed but the mother and children have not lived with 
him for some time schneidman said

nasa should buy at least one more space 
shuttle because theres a 5050 chance a craft will be lost in the 
next several years a congressional report suggested today 
a new shuttle like the one being built to replace the destroyed 
challenger would cost 2 billion to 25 billion 
the office of technology assessment said nasas goal of 14 
launches a year poses increased risks to astronauts and that the 
schedule could be limited to a regular sustainable rate of eight 
to 10 launches by limiting flights to payloads requiring human 
crews 
the actual reliability of the shuttle system is unknown but 
may lie between 97 percent and 99 percent the report said if 
reliability is 98 percent the nation faces a 5050 chance of 
losing an additional orbiter in the next 34 flights

malaysia started taking tourism 
seriously only three years ago but learned fast 
one million foreign visitors arrived in the first three months 
of 1990 designated visit malaysia year more than double the same 
period of 1989 
that doesnt count 2 million people who dropped in from 
singapore the prosperous citystate next door 
the numbers may not be large compared with renowned vacation 
spots but are impressive for a place that almost had to be coaxed 
into putting out the welcome mat 
for a long time there was no political will to develop the 
industry said sabbaruddin chik culture and tourism minister 
malaysia remained aloof for years while its neighbors wooed 
freespending foreigners it is comfortably cushioned by an array 
of resources and is developing manufacturing to supplement exports 
of natural rubber palm oil cocoa pepper tropical hardwoods 
tin petroleum and natural gas 
tourisms status as a major international industry finally 
prompted the government to create a ministry of tourism and culture 
in 1987 
chauvinists immediately demanded the names be reversed to give 
culture precedence over selling the country to foreigners for 
profit something that might be tolerated but not particularly 
liked they prevailed 
a speaker told a forum in january the visit malaysia year 
campaign is making a mockery of malaysian society something 
for which the people are not socially prepared 
minister sabbaruddins response to that if you wait until 
everything is ready before you promote tourism we will never ever 
be ready 
promoters try to reconcile their goals with the conservative 
habits of a country that has islam as its official religion 
while the culture has no tradition of tourism it does put a 
premium on hospitality both social dictates and islam enjoin 
malaysians to treat guests better than themselves 
there are limits however without consulting sabbaruddin the 
culture division of his ministry banned a valentines day 
performance by pop singer latoya jackson elder sister of michael 
jackson 
she posed seminude for playboy magazine last year kuala lumpur 
newspapers reported and an official said her presence was 
against the values and norms of the local culture 
visit malaysia year launched with much hoopla in 1988 was 
designed to attract foreigners and get them to stay longer foster 
the arts and culture and encourage locals to see malaysia first 
before they venture abroad 
appointed mascot was wira the orangutan representing an 
endangered species of ape found only in borneo and sumatra 
independence day aug 31 is the anchor for 84 major events 14 
festivals and nine exhibitions 
malaysia offers distinctive malay chinese and indian cultures 
along with the architectural heritage of its portuguese dutch and 
british colonizers 
there are unspoiled jungles spectacular coral clean beaches 
and hill resorts above the tropical heat one resort has a casino 
sightseers can watch rubber trees being tapped and monkeys 
helping harvest coconuts from tall palms in borneo they can spend 
the night in the longhouses of former headhunters 
the official target for the year is more than 42 million 
tourists and earnings of 926 million compared to 39 million 
people and 741 million last year malaysia was fourth in the 
region in 1989 after hong kong thailand and singapore 
before the campaign began tourism promoters worried that 
malaysia had no readily identifiable image abroad except perhaps 
as the country that had sentenced 250 people to death for drug 
trafficking since 1975 and hanged 84 so far 
simple possession of more than 15 grams 0529 ounces of heroin 
or 100 grams 353 ounces of marijuana is regarded as trafficking 
and the death penalty is mandatory 
officials were not amused when comedian steve martin an 
announcer on the academy awards telecast in march told an 
international live audience 
we would have liked to have gone live from malaysia but the

saturday night a night to dance make love 
commit murder get drunk watch television go cruising rent a 
video go out to dinner or read a book about what people do on 
saturday night 
author susan orlean hopes a lot of people will chose the latter 
and pick up her new book saturday night alfred a knopf 
1995 
orlean a former boston globe columnist and freelance writer 
explores the magic of saturday night in an episodic journey through 
the lives of such diverse people as wellesley coeds bowery drug 
addicts a park avenue socialite and a suburban baby sitter 
the writer traveled to 16 spots across the country she went 
cruising with car enthusiasts in elkhart ind watched diners at 
the nations busiest restaurant in saugus mass and even spent a 
saturday night locked in the bowels of an mx missile silo outside 
cheyenne wyo 
fundamentally its a travel book that does travel through an 
idea rather than a landscape orlean said in an interview at her 
manhattan apartment 
the sociological question of what makes saturday night special 
is neatly folded into each chapter orlean cites saturday night 
facts its the night the fewest longdistance phone calls are 
made the fewest suicides occur the fewest airplane flights are 
scheduled 
it also is the night when most murders occur the most liquor is 
sold by the glass and the highest number of reported incidents of 
cow toppling in rural pennsylvania occurs cow toppling involves 
pushing a cow over as it sleeps cows sleep standing up local 
college kids think this is a zany prank the cows do not 
but it is sociology offered in a nonacademic way thanks to 
orleans witty and descriptive writing 
in a chapter on polka dancing at blobs polka park in jessup 
md orlean highlights a sprightly 82yearold named cecelia 
kostler who has 350 polka outfits and lives for her saturday night 
polka fix 
on one saturday night orlean writes that cecelia was feeling 
more original than traditional 
so she dressed herself in a ruffled white blouse black 
bellbottomed stretch pants a silver vinyl belt with a large 
square buckle silver spikeheeled sandals a gold chain with 
walnutsized links and as the most eyecatching addition a 
sidevented backbelted zipperfronted vest made of red chinese 
satin and blackandwhite artificial pony fur 
orlean also conveys the frustration of jailed criminals the 
expectations of recovering drug addicts the merriment at a texas 
zydeco social and the hopefulness of 15yearold hispanic 
debutantes 
my theory does saturday night matter to people got 
proved fast the answer was yeah so i decided to use saturday 
night as my net orlean said and i think what i caught was 
interesting 
orlean was amazed that none of her wouldbe subjects turned her 
down that really goes against my own premise that saturday night 
is a very private time here i was asking total strangers to let me 
intrude and they did i would probably turn me down 
she did experience one rejection of sorts she was asked to 
leave socialite nan kempners park avenue home by the rear door 
of course before guests arrived for a formal dinner party 
that struck me as interesting it was the only place that 
people drew the curtain it was a more private world than a nuclear 
missile silo 
another subject a drug dealer who was supposed to take orlean 
along on his saturday night rounds never panned out 
we tried to get together about six different times and i 
finally gave up because he said he was just too busy i later found 
out he got out of the drug business to sell aluminum siding 
she also learned after completing the book that one of the 
convicted criminals she quoted liberally in a chapter titled 
killing came to an abrupt end he murdered a federal drug 
agent in new york after being paroled and was later himself 
mysteriously gunned down 
that certainly made me feel creepy she said 
the only normal saturday night activities orlean didnt get to 
explore were going on a first date and staying home watching 
television with a couple i just couldnt figure out a way to do 
that insert myself in the situation without changing it she 
said 
those are the private type of saturday night moments that are 
just going to have to remain that way 
one of the most difficult tasks in researching the book was 
deciding what to wear at each stop 
i guessed wrong a lot of times orlean said like the time 
she went club hopping with a pair of los angeles teens who had a 
different outfit for every stop orlean chose a simple black 
outfit they were horrified and told me to make sure i told 
everyone i was from out of town 
but without a doubt the hardest thing for orlean was giving up 
three years of her own saturday nights 
i never got used to being away and working on the weekend 
she says it mattered i suffered i hated it

in a new threepart series arabia sand sea amp sky debuting 
tuesday on cable tvs discovery channel 
the series by british producerdirector michael mckinnon 
should give viewers a new perspective on a region mostly associated 
with sand dunes oil fields and lawrence of arabia 
mckinnon was researching his 1985 documentary on the arabian 
culture treasure of the gulf when he discovered that the 
western end of saudi arabia along the red sea harbored a wonderful 
abundance of wildlife vegetation and strange geological forms 
coral reefs sheltered fish eels and sharks on land there were 
mangroves in the foothills forests of junipers acacias and palms 
were inhabited by birds bats lizards butterflies and large 
mammals including hundreds of thousands of baboons mountain 
camels and small herds of the rare ibex farther north the 
remnants of extinct volcanoes created a pseudolunar landscape 
i said my god this is a completely unknown thing 
mckinnon recalled in a recent interview 
his documentary series has proved to be an eyeopener not only 
to westerners but to arabs as well 
i think it will be a surprise for most arabian viewers 
mckinnon said 
at preview showings of the series he said its been a 
consistent reaction among people of the peninsula that there was 
this diversity of wildlife in the peninsula 
the first episode the mountain barrier focuses on the 
relatively lush foothills along the western and southwestern coasts 
of the saudi peninsula the greenery owes its existence primarily 
to a 1000mile string of western mountains reaching 13000 feet 
high that wring most of the moisture out of eastwardsailing red 
sea clouds 
at the same time oilfinanced irrigation projects seem to be 
creating a new ecological order migratory birds have changed their 
routes to take advantage of newly created wetlands from irrigation 
projects that are pumping fossil waters from 3000 feet beneath the 
parched surface 
cinematographers john bulmor and tony bomford do a fine job in 
capturing these images and richard kiley provides suitably spare 
narration 
the second episode red sea rift deals with the rich 
underwater flora and fauna along the red sea coast the final 
segment eye of the camel focuses on the mammoth southeastern 
sand desert the rub al khali and the traditional bedouin 
lifestyle that is under siege from agribusiness oil and 
superhighways 
mckinnon noted that conservation is making a comeback in saudi 
arabia after traditional means of preserving the fragile landscape 
were swept aside as petrodollars transformed saudi life virtually 
overnight 
the saudis created the national commission for wildlife 
conservation five years ago as improved transportation and 
irrigation systems pushed crops and livestock into areas that never 
before would have supported farming or grazing 
wheat and sorghum fields seem to be a boon to wildlife but 
grazing isnt 
mckinnon said the future of the peninsulas wildlife will depend 
on how well the saudis preserve vegetation from herds of goats and 
sheep 
theres a big move now to protect flyways for birds to 
fund new breeding grounds for gazelle ibex to set aside areas for 
conservation he said 
there are other hopeful signs he said that in some protected 
areas botanists are finding desert plants they didnt know 
existed

slowly deliberately richard davis loads his 
44caliber magnum handgun he grasps the pistol with both hands 
points it at his abdomen and stares ahead grimly he fires his 
body jerks with the impact 
a grin spreads across his ruddy weatherbeaten face nothing 
to it folks he says with the satisfaction of a man who has shot 
himself more than 130 times as a sales pitch for the bulletproof 
vests his company manufactures 
but despite davis confidence in his product the federal 
government is pushing national standards for body armor that he and 
other producers consider unreasonable the feud has become so 
bitter that some law enforcement groups for whom vest quality is a 
lifeordeath matter are asking congress to intervene 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said he expects to introduce a 
bill to establish mandatory standards this month sen carl levin 
dmich has written attorney general dick thornburgh urging him to 
mediate a compromise the increasing uncertainty can only hurt 
law enforcement officers levin wrote 
the highly technical debate boils down to four issues how the 
vests should be designed particularly the amount of stuffing 
needed to stop bullets how they should be tested for 
effectiveness who should set the standards and whether they 
should be voluntary or mandatory 
the national institute of justice a branch of the justice 
department has set voluntary standards for vests and tested them 
for quality since the early 1970s 
during testing vests are mounted on clay blocks and bullets are 
fired into them from varying distances and angles to meet nij 
standards a vest must not only stop bullets it must also prevent 
them from making an excessively large dent in the clay thats 
because a bullet can strike with enough force to damage internal 
organs even if it doesnt penetrate the vest 
the government toughened its standards in 1987 to keep pace with 
changes in weapons and ammunition said lester shubin science and 
technology director for the nij 
suddenly more than 50 percent of the vests were flunking the 
tests 
manufacturers including davis second chance body armor of 
central lake mich cried foul saying the only way to ensure 
that their vests consistently passed was to make them so thick and 
bulky that police wouldnt wear them 
police officers dont really want to wear the stuff anyway 
give them any excuse to take it off and they will said ed 
bachner ballistics manager for ei du pont de nemours amp co his 
company manufactures kevlar the synthetic fiber used in most 
bulletproof armor the past 20 years 
police are dying because they arent wearing vests not 
because the vests are bad bachner said 
surveys show that only about 30 percent of police wear vests 
even though many law enforcement agencies require it said george 
austin jr national executive officer of the fraternal order of 
police manufacturers say the number may be lower 
du pont has documented more than 1000 saves or incidents 
in which wearing kevlar body armor prevented death or serious 
injury bachner said most are shootings but many saves have 
involved stabbings auto accidents and even a couple of bull 
gorings 
a single vest retails for about 350 davis says although he 
recently sold 4000 to the detroit police department for 175 
apiece 
larry gates executive director of the personal protective armor 
association an industry group says no vest has ever failed to 
protect a wearer from bullets it was designed to stop 
theyve performed flawlessly in the field where it counts 
he said but in the laboratory tests under the nij standards 
over half the vests fail the test is flawed but the nij wont 
budge 
shubin counters that vests have a good field record because his 
agencys tests have kept duds off the market 
we believe a lot of their armor is marginal he said but 
we believe if it passes our standard its going to work 100 percent 
on the street and it has were being faulted for being 
successful 
last year du pont and the personal protective armor association 
established their own standards which they say produce more 
consistent test results while meeting wearers comfort requirements 
shubin and many police leaders arent convinced 
i could put up with a little discomfort in exchange for extra 
protection said austin the fop officer and a poquoson va 
beat cop and im the one out there on the street getting shot 
at 
police generally have sided with the government in the dispute 
although not unanimously 
new york city police commissioner lee brown who favors the nij 
standards calls the debate over vest design and testing procedures 
a smoke screen 
the issue is whos going to develop the standards brown 
said i want them developed by someone who has no vested interest 
in selling a product 
the fraternal order of police wants congress to designate a 
nonindustry body such as the nij to set national standards and 
the international association of chiefs of police has taken a 
similar position 
but the state association of chiefs of police a division of 
iacp voted last month to oppose congressional intervention and to 
ask the manufacturers and the nij to accept binding arbitration 
one vest manufacturer that supports the government standards is 
point blank body armor of amityville ny company president 
richard stone says the industrys primary motive is to protect 
kevlars dominance of the bulletproof vest market 
this is basically a commercial situation stone said du 
ponts had a virtual monopoly on body armor for 20 years and they 
want to keep it that way 
du ponts bachner disagrees saying the controversy arose before 
the recent emergence of competing synthetic fibers i tell police 
if they can find a better product they ought to buy it he said

he may not be as famous as jim henson but 
in his own way frank ballard has done as much to advance the art 
of puppetry in the united states as the man who brought us kermit 
the frog and miss piggy 
for 23 years ballard has directed the puppetry program at the 
university of connecticut the first school in the united states to 
offer a bachelor of fine arts degree in puppetry and the only one 
with bachelors and masters programs still in existence 
in a series of basement rooms overrun by scraps of cloth 
woodworking tools sewing machines and an endless supply of 
puppets ballard has taught students how to design and make 
marionettes hand puppets and stick puppets he shows them how to 
operate the dolls write scripts and stage largescale puppet 
productions 
ballards students have gone on to work for henson on various 
muppets projects movie production companies in hollywood and their 
own traveling tours one former student is a psychologist using 
puppetry in therapy and another designs toys for fisher price 
i guess ive worked all my life trying to upgrade the 
standards of puppetry said ballard 60 who plans to stop 
teaching this year and devote his time to creating a museum for the 
thousands of puppets he and his students have created from tiny 
hand puppets wearing intricate clothing to largerthanlife 
monsters with wagging tongues and rolling eyeballs 
id like to see the art respected and accepted as a true 
art form rather than kiddies play 
to do that part of it is the responsibility of the 
puppeteers who have to upgrade the quality of their work part of 
the problem is theres no formal training in puppetry 
in europe and asia puppetry has a strong tradition with 
countries in eastern europe offering subsidized puppetry training 
to students and then often providing them with jobs 
puppetry doesnt enjoy such status in the united states where 
puppets are generally thought of as the cute and cuddly domain of 
children several of ballards students say they had trouble 
convincing their parents that it was worth spending four years in 
college for a puppetry degree 
ballard has worked to change that image through his classes and 
the grandiose adult productions his students have staged such as 
macbeth peer gynt the fantasticks and hms 
pinafore 
we do large productions here because nobody else can to give 
as many students an opportunity to work in productions as possible 
and to teach the audience because the preconceived notion of what 
a puppet is so squared in ballard said sitting with five 
students at a table covered with glue droppings saw dust and 
puppet eyes 
in the world of puppetry ballard and his program are well 
known his students have performed a puppet opera at the kennedy 
center for the performing arts in washington and ballard has 
addressed the united nations general assembly 
ballard has served as president of the puppeteers of america and 
lunion internationale de la marionette he has been honored by the 
new england theatre conference and by the connecticut commission on 
the arts last year president bush saluted ballard in a letter 
praising him for his contribution to the arts 
perhaps the best testament to ballards fame came a few years 
ago when one of his students was traveling in the soviet union 
where puppeteering enjoys great popularity 
the student was pulled aside and interrogated by police who 
wanted to know what he was doing in the soviet union all the 
student had to do was mention frank ballard and the university of 
connecticut and he was immediately released by some very impressed 
and friendly soviet security agents 
ballards love for the craft began when he attended a puppet 
show at age 5 he received a puppet for his birthday and began 
staging his own shows eventually putting himself through college 
he came to uconn in 1956 to teach in the dramatic arts department 
within a few years he was teaching puppetry and in 1966 began 
offering bachelors degrees 
the university of california at los angeles and the university 
of hawaii eventually began puppetry programs but both have since 
folded 
ballard is not giving up the helm of uconns puppetry program 
because he wants to but because his health requires it he has 
parkinsons disease a degenerative neurological disorder that 
causes tremors and muscular rigidity 
i cant manipulate my hands anymore and i cant perform he 
said it gets harder id rather stop now than be carried out 
technically ballard retired last fall but he continued to 
teach this year because he didnt want to see the puppetry program 
end while the school searched for his replacement 
for rolande duprey one of two graduate students in the program 
ending the puppetry program would have been a disaster 
starting last spring duprey began preparing for a performance 
she finally staged a few weeks ago first she chose a 15thcentury 
french farce called pierre pathelin then she translated it 
into english and rewrote it in verse adding a few more characters 
and deleting some of the monologue to make it more appropriate for 
a puppet show 
last summer she began molding heads for the main characters 
then she began making bodies and stitching costumes and a curtain 
she also trained puppeteers some of whom were newcomers 
you have to do it because you love it something like this 
which can be so difficult so demanding you have to love it 
duprey said showing off one of her lifesize and lifelike 
creations an old man handandstick puppet whose haughty eyelids 
open and close and jowls droop to perfection 
sandy bellock a uconn senior and puppetry major agreed that 
the puppetry program was demanding because it requires students to 
design create act and write but thats why she likes it 
all my life ive been interested in the arts as a whole 
dance acting music and i discovered puppetry was an art form 
that would allow me to combine my interests she said 
plus i like the idea of creating a whole reality instead of 
just casting a bunch of characters you get to create characters i 
call it the god complex

the peace corps is undergoing an impressive 
revival as increasing numbers of foreign governments seek the kind 
of lowcost expertise the volunteer agency provides 
in the next 18 months we will enter more countries than were 
entered in the last 18 years combined says paul coverdell the 
former georgia state legislator who has served as peace corps 
director for the past year 
president bush who has stressed the importance of volunteerism 
is a big booster of the peace corps at a time of budget austerity 
bush is showing his commitment by asking for 181 million for the 
peace corps for 1991 a record 16 million increase 
congress also has been supportive partly because of the 20 
former volunteers who have since become lawmakers 
everything seems to be going the peace corps way lately 
internationally governments are showing less interest in ideology 
and more concern about solving human problems for many of them 
the peace corps is a logical place to turn 
the anticommunist evolution in eastern europe last year opened 
up a whole new region from which the peace corps had previously 
been excluded when the agency was created in 1961 east bloc 
countries were asked whether volunteers would be welcome the 
answer no thanks 
with english becoming increasingly accepted as the language of 
international business what better agency than the peace corps to 
fill the need for classes 
everybody wants to learn english coverdell said the peace 
corps also sends out experts in agriculture urban development 
engineering health nutrition and a new area suddenly in vogue 
the environment 
theres no institution ready to do so much for so many for so 
little said coverdell an atlanta businessman and longtime bush 
backer 
after an auspicious beginning under president john f kennedy 
almost 30 years ago the peace corps eventually fell into disfavor 
in the mid 1970s 
enrollment dropped along with the budget watergate and the war 
in vietnam made many qualified young people cynical about serving 
in a government agency and applications fell some volunteers were 
haunted by charges they were cia operatives disguised as dogooders 
even though kennedy early on ordered the cia to stay away from 
the agency 
president nixon stripped the peace corps of its independent 
status making it a part of an umbrella volunteer agency in the 
process the corps lost some of its unique identity the agency 
became independent again in 1982 
the current enrollment 6500 volunteers and trainees is still 
far below the late 1960s high of more than 15000 but coverdell 
predicts that almost 7300 will be serving by the end of 1992 
when coverdell 50 took over in may of 1989 the peace corps 
was operating in 64 countries by the end of this year he expects 
that figure to rise to 76 
volunteers will be at work in hungary and poland in the coming 
weeks and in czechoslovakia in a few months initial contacts with 
bulgaria and romania have been made and even mongolia one of the 
worlds most isolated countries has shown interest latin american 
countries that once shunned the peace corps are now welcoming 
volunteers 
there is broad expansion on every continent coverdell said 
obviously the peace corps can have only a marginal impact on a 
given country the philippines historically has had the largest 
number of volunteers there are about 300 there now but poverty 
remains pervasive afflicting well over half the population 
and as the first peace corps director sargent shriver sees it 
the volunteers not the host country get more out of the 
experience than anyone 
as always peace corps performance is impaired by some 
volunteers who view their twoyear stint less as a commitment to 
the poor than as a chance to see exotic places but not since the 
halcyon days of 1961 has the agencys image been as favorable as it 
is now 
compared with those early years when the ranks of the peace 
corps were dominated by young liberal arts graduates the agency 
projects a grayer appearance nowadays thanks to the 12 percent who 
are over 50 
the average age of all volunteers is 31 a more mature force 
than the one envisioned by nixon who campaigning against kennedy 
in 1960 said the peace corps would become a discredited haven for 
restless youth a kiddy corps as nixon described it

thurgood marshalls place in history was 
assured before he became a member of the supreme court in 1967 now 
his conservative critics long distressed by marshalls liberal 
record say its time for the first black justice to step aside for 
a more youthful energetic successor 
marshall a civil rights pioneer who as a lawyer helped changed 
the nation will be 82 in july he shrugs off questions about 
retirement with customary curmudgeonly humor 
i have a lifetime appointment and i intend to serve it he 
has said numerous times he once told the washington post i 
expect to die at 110 shot by a jealous husband 
for decades before president johnson named him to the high 
court marshall had traveled the nation as the recognized legal 
champion of the poor and the powerless some say he ranks with the 
rev martin luther king jr as a leader in the battle for racial 
equality 
over 23 years as legal director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people and then as the federal 
governments solicitor general marshall argued 32 cases before the 
supreme court he won 29 
his biggest naacp victory came in the 1954 ruling that declared 
racially segregated public schools unconstitutional 
he changed america said erwin griswold the onetime harvard 
university law school dean and himself a former solicitor general 
when i think of great american lawyers i think of thurgood 
marshall abe lincoln and daniel webster said georgetown 
university law school dean thomas g krattenmaker 
experts agree marshalls legal accomplishments before joining 
the high court far surpass those of any fellow justice it is his 
stature as a justice that has been questioned of late by 
conservative critics 
they say he is losing interest in much of the courts daytoday 
work and delegates too much responsibility to his young law clerks 
former clerks deny it marshall declined to be interviewed for 
this article 
one of the harshest attacks on marshall was penned by terry 
eastland onetime aide to former attorney general edwin k meese 
iii eastland last year wrote in the conservative national review 
one joke has it that if marshall retired at least he wouldnt be 
paid for watching television 
the reference apparently was prompted by earlier reports that 
marshall is a fan of the peoples court and watches the tv show 
in his court office the justice has denied the reports saying 
thats an awful program 
criticism of marshalls supposed work habits are often 
accompanied by questions of his health 
standing 6 feet 2 and overweight marshall shuns exercise he 
had a heart attack in 1976 has suffered from bouts of pneumonia 
and bronchitis he was hospitalized in 1987 with a potentially 
dangerous blood clot in his right foot 
marshall walks slowly and with apparent difficulty family 
members reportedly convinced him a few years ago to stop driving 
he now gets to work in a chauffeurdriven limousine 
former clerks however insist his health is not deteriorating 
georgetown law professor mark tushnet a marshall clerk in 1972 
said he did not look in good health then he doesnt look any 
different now 
tushnet who is writing a biography of marshall also dismissed 
the idea that the increasing dominance of the courts conservatives 
has soured marshall 
he seemed grumpy when i worked with him and he seems grumpy 
now tushnet said 
legal scholars say a succession of conservative court 
appointments has denied the old civil rights fighter the chance 
that was briefly his to shape the law within two years of 
marshalls appointment to a predominantly liberal court chief 
justice warren burger replaced earl warren and the courts 
evolution toward conservatism had begun 
but marshall has been very important in providing visions of 
where the law should go said krattenmaker he has written 
several dissenting opinions that may prove to be persuasive 
marshall and justice william j brennan are the courts most 
consistent liberals and most frequent dissenters 
they stand alone in opposing capital punishment in all 
circumstances press for broader protection for criminal defendants 
and lead the way in supporting affirmative action for minorities 
and women 
marshalls former law clerks call him the courts conscience and 
say his role is one of making sure the other justices realize their 
decisions are affecting real fleshandblood people 
marshall suffers from glaucoma at times it seems he has 
trouble reading summaries of his opinions from the bench at a 
celebration of his 80th birthday he insisted that television 
camera lights be turned off because the glare bothered his eyes 
rumors of declining alertness were fed by an incident last fall 
during an oral argument session before the court 
marshall posed several questions to a lawyer he seemingly 
believed was representing the government when in fact the lawyer 
was representing the other side 
if i appear confused i am marshall said at one point when 
another justice noted whom the lawyer represented marshall 
recovered by telling the lawyer well there is no bar to you 
giving me some help 
marshalls public appearances away from the bench are rare but 
when he does appear he doesnt mince words 
in televised interviews in 1987 he said president reagans 
civil rights record ranks at the bottom and accused meeses 
justice department of trying to undermine the supreme court 
itself 
in a speech to a conference of lawyers and judges that year he 
said he was not about to quit fighting rightwingers 
dont worry im going to outlive those bastards he said

edwin coopermans successes at american express 
co are recounted nightly in commercial television scenes 
theres the toddler who feeds the new videocassette recorder 
gloppy breakfast cereal the traveling executive who loses his 
charge card just before trying to check into a hotel for the night 
the yuppie dad who cancels all appointments and buys a fishing boat 
to take his kid on vacation 
they are stories with happy endings thanks to american express 
and cooperman who as president of the travel related services 
division is the man behind those scenes 
during coopermans three years at the helm of the card division 
american express has introduced such innovations as a global 
assist 24hour help line for cardmembers the optima extended 
payment card and buyer assurance plans guaranteeing charged items 
against loss theft or damage 
the ads pitching these extras arent concocted by copy writers 
they are based on real calls and letters to american express which 
has made service a cornerstone of the card division under cooperman 
trim and slightly graying at 46 cooperman spends a majority of 
his time on the road or in the air visiting the companys 
farflung ofices from beijing to berlin singapore to st louis 
hes not a mastercard or visa holder but keeps five american 
express cards in his wallet platinum gold green corporate and 
optima 
each one has a different use he said my daughter of 
course now she wants five but thats a whole different story 
shell stick with her two 
a lawyer by profession cooperman has been with the company for 
nearly two decades he has an 18yearold cardcarrying daughter in 
college and another 15yearold daughter in high school 
when hes in his 40thfloor corner office overlooking southern 
manhattan cooperman studies the competition intensely collecting 
newspaper and magazine articles about the card business 
he especially enjoys showing visitors a yellowed clipping by 
financial columnist dan dorfman portending the demise of american 
expresss growth it was written 10 years ago 
since that time weve had the greatest growth in our 
history cooperman said 
there has been speculation that coopermans division may feel 
increased pressure to perform now because of weaker sister 
businesses notably shearson lehman hutton inc which has been 
pinched by the recession on wall street and freshly bankrolled by 
its american express parent 
cooperman said hes not overly concerned 
i think were going to run our business as usual but you know 
all the employees and myself we stand a little taller these days 
we want to show the strength of the company he said so i 
guess in that respect we put pressure on ourselves 
coopermans division spends a lot of money by some estimates 
the companys advertising budget is about 250 million more than 
visa and mastercard combined but cooperman is no moneyloser 
rising from relative obscurity in the companys general counsel 
office he has helped make travel related services the most 
profitable part of the company last year for example the 
division earned 830 million on revenue of 84 billion 
by contrast the companys ids financial services unit earned 
175 million american express bank earned 122 million 
information services 83 million and shearson 110 million 
cooperman helped pioneer the push into hightech advancements 
that american express uses to battle visa and mastercard american 
express computers enable it to replace a card anywhere within 24 
hours check a cardmembers credit history instantly and provide 
help ranging from airline tickets to bail money 
even in mundane monthly billing cooperman said american 
express has introduced an imaging technology that provides 
customers with copies of each charge receipt theyve signed 
our competitors give you nothing he said theyve moved 
to just telling you what you bought but not giving you the copy 
back 
competitors have watched the number of american express cards in 
the united states grow to more than 243 million up more than 50 
percent since late 1985 when cooperman took command the card is 
accepted at more than 3 million establishments worldwide more than 
double the number at the end of 1985 
still visa and mastercard remain the dominant plastic in the 
united states with a combined total of about 90 percent of the 
market or more than 200 million cards 
american express may give more they concede but customers pay 
more in membership fees and cannot finance payments unless they 
have an optima card 
financial services analysts say theyre not sure how many 
inroads american express will make into visa and mastercard 
territory nonetheless most express admiration for the card 
division and cooperman 
when you call up american express with a problem you get much 
better service said gary hovis who follows the company for 
argus research corp in new york cooperman he said seems to be 
a very good executive a very hard worker i think hes a plus for 
the business 
bruce brittain head of an atlantabased market research firm 
that studies creditcard use said the quality of service likely 
will remain an advantage for american express over bankissued 
credit cards 
no matter what visa or mastercard promise it boils down to 
what kind of service you get from the issuing bank brittain 
said you always hear about the horror stories theres a real 
advantage to having one central issuer 
the highprofile television ads are a hit with cooperman who 
stresses the factual base for the companys service claims the vcr 
ad for example was based on a letter from the mother of this 
child who told us this incredible story it was a positive letter 
of how pleased she was and how quickly american express helped her 
out and got a new vcr 
not all cardmember feedback is so effusive but cooperman 
displays a sense of humor about the limits of some services such 
as the loststolendamaged guarantee 
obviously anytime you launch a new program like this youre 
not going to think of everything he said 
a farmers demand that american express compensate him for a 
milkless cow purchased with a card led to a noanimal proviso 
cooperman said in another instance later excepted from the policy 
a cardmember billed american express for a dozen golf balls whacked 
off a fairway 
under our policy at that time that was not excluded so we 
sent the gentleman a funny letter back and a check and told him 
the next time perhaps he ought to tie a string to each golf 
ball cooperman said 
just imagine every golfer in america buying their golf balls 
with the american express card great business but the way i play 
golf wed lose a lot of money

in the longrunning debate over whether the 
economy is growing too fast or too slowly wall street has begun to 
entertain the possibility that neither side is right 
a surprising run of statistical reports in recent days has 
prompted some analysts to toy with the idea that conditions are 
close to a happy medium favoring continued slow but steady growth 
without any drastic change in inflation 
few people in the forecasting business are content simply to 
proclaim clear skies ahead and flip the switches off on their 
computerpowered crystal balls as practitioners of the dismal 
science they are paid to worry continuously about whatever might 
go wrong 
still just a few hints that the economy might be maintaining a 
healthy sustainable momentum have been enough to lift the stock 
market to nearrecord levels of late 
for the moment neither the inflation nor the recession worries 
that have beset the financial world in recent months appear to have 
come to fruition 
some economists are convinced that the economy could fall into 
a recession because there is a credit crunch in the financial 
markets said edward yardeni at prudentialbache securities 
weve argued that this is just another scare which will soon blow 
away 
so far the optimistic approach seems to be outperforming the 
pessimistic approach to investing although we admit that the first 
four months of the year were not kind to bond investors 
we believe the inflation scare which unnerved the bond market 
is just about over and the credit crunch scare may soon be over as 
well 
the mood in the markets began to brighten early this month with 
interest rates having hit their highest levels in a year 
the labor departments report on april employment showing much 
slower than expected growth in jobs seemed to signal that the pace 
of business wasnt strong enough to support the kind of 
inflationary expectations that had been building 
that positive view took on some fresh urgency friday when word 
came of a 03 percent drop in the producer price index of finished 
goods and a 06 percent decline in retail sales last month 
that helped the dow jones average of 30 industrials post a 
9122point gain for the past week to 280158 not far short of 
the record closing high of 281015 reached on jan 2 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 683 at 19224 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 949 at 43810 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 677 at 35250 
volume on the big board averaged 16434 million shares a day up 
from 13990 million the week before 
the revival of optimism in the stock market by no means reflects 
a unanimously rosy view of the outlook 
indeed some economists on the street lately have lowered their 
estimates of growth for the spring and summer months at the same 
time that others are raising their projections 
inflation fears die hard especially in the bond market 
furthermore analysts remain mindful of how frequently and rapidly 
sentiment has shifted among investors recently 
the economy and inflation have given false signals in the 
past says the value line investment survey in its current 
appraisal of business prospects volatility is likely to remain 
the order of the day

shareholders of some of the nations biggest 
companies angry over lower profits higher debts and rising pay 
for executives are using the annual meeting season to vent their 
displeasure at management 
discontent was particularly evident this past week as executives 
of cbs inc and pan am corp were put on the defensive at raucous 
meetings at the time warner inc and usx corp gatherings 
shareholders used votes on stock incentive plans for management to 
express their dissatisfaction 
at cbs the issue was the thirdplace finish for the companys 
television network over the past three seasons shareholders 
criticized the dearth of directors with broadcasting experience on 
the cbs board and the poor quality of the networks programming 
chairman laurence a tisch was forced to concede the companys 
primetime tv performance has been a total disaster but he 
tried to mollify shareholders by pointing out cbs is no 1 in 
daytime and sports ratings 
we are not a total disaster he said 
the angry shareholders at pan ams meeting were employees of the 
airline which hasnt made money since 1980 
teamsters union members furious because they have been working 
under conditions imposed by the company for two years since 
federally mediated contract talks failed repeatedly interrupted 
pan american corp chairman thomas plaskett at the meeting in miami 
the usx annual meeting had been expected to be one of this 
seasons most dramatic as shareholders there considered takeover 
strategist carl icahns proposal to split up the steelenergy 
company 
but icahns plan didnt stir up shareholders as much as 
managements proposal for its new stock incentive plan for 
employees shareholders who took the floor at the meeting 
including several retirees of usx subsidiaries angrily questioned 
why management was lining its own pockets at the expense of 
stockholders and pensioners 
results of the voting on icahns proposal the stock plan and 
other issues were not expected until this coming week at the 
earliest icahn however has already conceded his idea which 
would have spun off the companys us steel subsidiary from its 
marathon oil co division was likely to fail 
time warner executives found themselves answering the same 
question they were faced with a year ago why didnt time inc 
accept a 200 a share buyout bid from paramount communications inc 
last year instead of buying warner communications inc and going 
heavily into debt 
several disgruntled shareholders criticized management because 
of the companys 108 billion debt load and losses attributed to 
the 14 billion warner acquisition they also were unhappy with a 
stock price that is now less than half the paramount bid 
but like the usx meeting the biggest expression of shareholder 
unhappiness was over the vote on managements stock incentive plan 
the proposal passed but onequarter of the shares voted were 
against it 
grumbling at annual meetings is nothing new although 
shareholders in particular the big institutions like pension 
funds have become more active in recent years 
dale gerboth a partner at the accounting and consulting firm 
ernst amp young said hes seen no overall increase in shareholder 
anger this season although particular companies with particular 
problems may have more irate stockholders than other firms 
although large shareholders including the institutions are 
able to communicate with management at other times over the course 
of the year the annual meeting is still an effective avenue for 
making a voice heard for stockholders gerboth said 
in other business developments this past week 
signs of an economic slowdown were evident in government 
reports of falling wholesale prices and a decline in retail sales 
the numbers were greeted jubilantly on wall street where stocks 
swept ahead bond prices rallied and interest rates dropped but 
the dollar tumbled 
president bush and congressional leaders announced talks to cut 
up to 100 billion from the rapidly expanding federal deficit tax 
increases as well as spending cuts will be considered 
southern californias aerospace industry took two big hits as 
mcdonnell douglas corp said it would lay off another 1000 workers 
at its long beach aircraft unit and lockheed corp said it would 
move its burbank aeronautics operations to georgia and palmdale 
calif the job losses reflected major cuts in defense spending 
resulting from the thaw in eastwest relations

the united states trade deficit is set to 
worsen significantly despite declining surpluses for japan south 
korea and other pacific nations according to a new forecast 
countries around the pacific rim also are poised for a modest 
rebound in growth next year after a selfimposed twoyear slowdown 
designed to rein in inflation said the report released thursday by 
the asia foundation 
japan saw its trade surplus narrow in 1989 despite a sharp 
depreciation in the yen relative to the dollar which makes its 
exports more competitive and imports more expensive 
the countrys trade surplus which declined to 573 billion 
last year from 788 billion in 1988 should drop to 427 billion 
this year before edging up to 455 billion in 1991 according to 
the foundations pacific economic outlook for 199091 
taiwans balance of payments surplus in the region is forecast 
to drop to 104 billion this year and 92 billion in 1991 from 
111 billion last year 
similarly south korea will see its surplus fall from 51 
billion last year to 1 billion this year and 300 million next 
year the report says 
the united states meanwhile is expected to move the other way 
after cutting its balance of payments deficit in the region from 
118 billion in 1988 to 966 billion in 1989 the deficit is 
expected to rise to 105 billion this year and 116 billion in 1991 
the united states can help itself by cutting its own budget 
deficit says lawrence b krause an economics professor at the 
university of californiasan diego who helped produce the report 
but krause sees no likelihood of america regaining a trade surplus 
with japan or the rest of the pacific region in the next few years 
the outlook an important tool used by planners in the region 
is based on analyses and predictions by economists from 15 
countries affiliated with the pacific economic cooperation 
conference 
the regions powerhouses all slowed their economies with tight 
monetary policies to curb inflation 
most countries in latin america africa and southern europe 
would have been happy with the 1989 inflation rates of the 
pacifics leading economies 23 percent in japan 44 percent in 
taiwan 57 percent in south korea and 49 percent in the united 
states as measured by the consumer price indexes 
overall the regions inflation rate was 65 percent a figure 
bloated by rates of 176 percent in china 101 percent in hong 
kong and 106 percent in the philippines 
the tight money policies are expected to bring inflation down in 
1991 to 15 percent in japan 33 percent in taiwan 60 percent in 
south korea and 48 percent in the united states 
the regions overall inflation rate should drop to 55 percent 
next year with china cutting its rate to 95 percent hong kong to 
70 percent and the philippines to 97 percent 
krause said the regions declining growth rate should moderate 
this year and pick up slightly in 1991 
the forecast calls for growth of 50 percent this year down 
from 53 percent in 1989 and 72 percent in 1988 
the forecast has a modest recovery in 1991 up to 52 percent 
so it will have taken two years to moderate the excesses and then 
have some recovery again krause said 
one notable exception from that growth forecast is japan where 
growth is expected to decline from 51 percent in 1989 to 43 
percent in 1990 and 31 percent in 1991 
the united states is expected to remain stuck with one of the 
regions lowest growth rates 30 percent in 1989 25 percent in 
1990 and 28 percent in 1991 
the regions growth leader thailand should slow from a rate of 
11 percent last year to 91 percent this year and 84 percent in 
1991 with singapore and malaysia slightly behind 
chinas political crackdown last year hurt its economy and hong 
kongs but did not have much impact on the rest of the region the 
report said

lawyers for three commodity traders facing 
federal fraud charges are keying their defense to the seeming 
bedlam of the futures markets 
they say the governments main witness an undercover fbi agent 
who observed and secretly taperecorded evidence of alleged 
wrongdoing at the chicago mercantile exchange was so befuddled by 
the frantic nature of commodity trading that he mistook the 
defendants legitimate actions for attempts to defraud customers 
its been referred to as organized chaos defense attorney 
alan blumenthal said of commodity trading during his opening 
statement thursday to the us district court jury 
it is within that confusion that you are going to question 
whether agent randall jannett had the opportunity to observe what 
he claims to have observed blumenthal said 
blumenthal is defending david zatz an independent trader of 
swiss franc futures who along with robert d mosky and danny l 
scheck faces multiple counts of mail or wire fraud and violating 
federal futurestrading rules 
mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy 
mosky worked as a floor broker filling customer orders from a 
number of brokerage firms as well as trading for his own account 
scheck was strictly an independent trader known as a local 
their trial before us district judge ann c williams is the 
first to result from an unprecedented fbi probe of trading fraud at 
the merc and the chicago board of trade the worlds two largest 
commodity futures markets 
prosecutors have portrayed the three as common criminals who 
conspired along with at least two other traders to divert to their 
own accounts profits that rightfully belonged to brokerage 
customers 
the government called its first witness thursday an 
investigator for the commodity futures trading commission who began 
the arduous task of educating the jury about commodity trading 
a swiss franc future is a contract to buy or sell a specified 
number of swiss francs at a future date at a price agreed upon in 
advance 
like other commodity futures swiss franc contracts are traded 
in a designated arena called a pit there traders stand shoulder 
to shoulder and strike deals through a rapidfire combination of 
hand signals and shouted bids and offers 
the governments case rests largely on conversations secretly 
recorded by jannett while he posed as a corrupt trader in the 
mercs swiss franc pit during the last 11 months of 1988 
prosecutors also plan to call as witnesses two other swiss franc 
traders william walsh and mark fuhrman who have pleaded guilty to 
fraud charges 
the defense lawyers discounted walsh and fuhrman as corrupt men 
who are seeking light sentences for their crimes 
and they portrayed jannett as determined to uncover trading 
fraud despite inadequate preparation for the frenzied confounding 
environment into which he was placed 
the fbi can send an agent into a trading pit but that wont 
make him a commodity trader said schecks lawyer harvey silets 
the government contends the fbi tapes reveal a variety of fraud 
schemes 
but silets and elliott samuels moskys lawyer said the tapes 
portray their clients proper attempts to verify trades they made 
with each other and jannett amid the hubbub of the trading pit 
prosecutors have stressed that the conversations jannett 
recorded were secretive which the government says indicates the 
traders were trying to conceal their actions 
but samuels said exchange and federal rules require traders to 
verbally confirm their trades immediately after they make them 
this tradechecking by nature has to be secret private 
oneonone samuels said 
thats what agent jannett recorded samuels said he 
recorded my clients compliance not violation of any rules 
the three men are the first suspects to be tried out of 47 
chicago futures traders and a clerk indicted last year as the 
result of the fbi sting operation 
sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
in return for their cooperation

two investment firms have formed a joint venture 
to manage the money utilities are required to set aside to pay for 
the eventual dismantling of nuclear power plants 
john nuveen amp co inc and duff amp phelps inc have announced 
they have formed nuveenduff amp phelps investment to offer 
investment management services to nuclear utilities 
nuveen spokesman jeff kratz said estimates of the cost of 
decommissioning the nations 110 nuclear power plants range from 
100 billion to 1 trillion 
the cost for an individual utility may not be very great he 
said but we are talking about a very substantial amount of money 
overall 
kratz said nuveenduff amp phelps would advise the utilities on 
how to invest their decommissioning funds 
he noted that nuveen amp co specializes in nontaxable 
investments such as municipal bonds and duff amp phelps specializes 
in taxable fixed income and equity securities the utilities will 
require both kinds of investments to finance the decommissionings 
he said 
we will appear at rate hearings to provide expert testimony on 
what rates of return the utilities are receiving kratz said 
we will act as advisors to utilities keeping them abreast of 
the market and in general be prepared to assist them to meet the 
decommission liabilities 
the nuclear regulatory commission only recently has required 
utilities to set up funds to pay for plant dismantling the 
utilities have until july 26 to show how they will finance the 
shutdowns 
nrc spokesman jan strasma in chicago said the federal agency 
requires the utilities to either prepay the entire decommissioning 
cost into an independent fund establish a sinking fund and pay 
into it gradually or establish a surety bond that guarantees 
payment of decommissioning 
depending on the size and type of plant the utility would have 
to set aside 105 million to 135 million for each reactor 
decommissioning involves taking the fuel out of the plant 
decontaminating the unit and removing the reactor 
the idea is to return the site to pristine condition for other 
uses said cathy roche spokeswoman for the us council of 
energy awareness an industry group based in washington dc it 
is a fairly longterm process 
decommissioning is an expensive process and we want the 
utilities to have sufficient funds to do it strasma said adding 
the funds cannot be used by the utilities for operating expenses 
he said laws vary from state to state on how funds can be 
invested 
under rules established by the illinois commerce commission 
illinoisbased commonwealth edison which operates 13 nuclear 
plants is limited to investing its decommissioning funds in us 
treasury bonds bank certificates of deposits and taxexempt bonds 
comed official debbie vestal noted that in 1989 the utility put 
66 million into the fund which is handled by four investment 
firms including brown brothers harriman amp co of new york 
before 1989 comed integrated its decommission funds into its 
operating fund from which it received a higher rate of return 
the new fund is covered by a different tax bracket which lowers 
the rate of return said ms vestal however she said it is 
difficult to judge how well the investment firms are doing with the 
account because there is nothing to compare it with 
scott peters a spokesman for the us council for energy 
awareness said there are currently no nuclear plants up for 
decommissioning although a number of plants are idle 
but he said the technology exists that could extend the lifetime 
of the plants utilities may find that it is cheaper to refurbish 
plants than replace them he said

buoyed by the popularity of this years easter and spring 
merchandise apparel retailers chalked up strong sales gains in 
april and continued to outperform the rest of the retailing 
industry according to results released by several big store chains 
analysts said department stores which have lagged specialty 
retailers for some time showed signs of improvement in the figures 
released thursday 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
posted a 16 percent gain at stores open at least a year and an 18 
percent overall increase 
gap inc another big apparel retailer reported its 
comparablestore sales jumped 25 percent last month as overall 
sales gained 31 percent 
clothing is the key item thats continuing sales growth 
said karen sack a retail industry analyst with standard amp poors 
corp 
results from stores open a year or longer known as same or 
comparablestore sales give a more accurate reading of a 
retailers performance 
retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the 
health of the industry and individual companies but also as an 
economic barometer consumer spending accounts for about twothirds 
of the gross national product 
among the big department stores dayton hudson corp whose 
holdings include daytons and hudsons department stores and target 
discount stores said its comparablestores sales rose 55 percent 
in april while overall sales picked up 117 percent 
may department stores co which owns lord amp taylor foleys 
filenes and other chains said its comparablestore sales rose 
88 percent as overall sales improved 143 percent 
many stores that had sluggish sales in march fared better in 
april as consumers shopped for easter and spring clothing 
k mart corp the nations largest discount chain recorded a 
63 percent comparablestore gain and a 159 percent rise overall 
in march k mart suffered a 11 percent drop in comparablestore 
sales 
calendar shifts such as easter falling on a different date 
from one year to another can affect retail sales inflating one 
months figure and detracting from another the industry tends to 
consider march and april together in assessing how well stores did 
kurt barnard a retailing consultant said the stores that have 
done the best cater to consumers seeking higherquality merchandise 
at a moderate price in a very attractive and exciting ambiance 
he cited limited and gap as examples of such retailers 
analysts said consumers burdened by high installment debt 
continue to be conservative and wary about more expensive purchases 
like large appliances retailers dependent on such items have had 
lackluster sales gains compared with the improvement by apparel 
stores 
analysts predict the trend will continue until later this year 
several of the nations biggest retailers including sears 
roebuck amp co walmart stores inc jc penney co inc and 
woolworth corp reported their april results a week ago and they 
also reflected the split between sales of apparel and more 
expensive items 
the figures released thursday differ from the federal 
governments monthly retail sales report besides stores the 
governments figures include sales at a range of establishments 
from auto dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie 
theaters

the nations top business leaders who 
just six months ago warned that a recession was a distinct threat 
said today the economy will continue to grow moderately at least 
through 1991 
the business council 100 chief executives of the countrys 
largest corporations forecast the economy will grow at a 2 
percent pace in 1990 and 26 percent in 1991 last october it had 
projected growth of only 18 percent for this year the slowest 
pace since the recession year of 1981 
there is remarkable unanimity among our consultants who drew 
up the forecast said lewis t preston chairman of jp morgan 
inc the giant new york bank and council vice chairman not a 
single one of the 19 is forecasting a recession to begin any time 
this year or next 
the dominant belief is that the federal reserve has 
successfully guided the economy into a moderate growth pattern that 
has an excellent chance of being extended for a very long time 
preston said in presenting the forecast on the eve of the councils 
semiannual meeting at the homestead resort 
the councils forecast last october warned that an outright 
recession was possible unless the federal reserve cut interest 
rates which it had boosted to slow the economy in its fight 
against inflation 
despite continuing high interest rates the council increased 
its inflation forecast to 48 percent from 42 percent for this 
year because of weather factors and other aberrations that 
pushed prices up 81 percent at an annual rate during the first 
quarter 
but the council said inflation as measured by the governments 
consumer price index will drop to 39 percent during the second 
half of the year and average 44 percent during 1991 the cpi was 
up 46 percent in 1989 
preston said the councils economists also expect no change in 
fed policy for an extended period ahead he added however 
that a significant reduction of the federal budget deficit would 
certainly change the forecast 
congressional and white house negotiators on tuesday are to 
start discussing ways to reduce the deficit for the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 if they fail to reach an agreement 
administration officials say the budget could be atomatically 
trimmed by 60 billion to 100 billion under the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
that would severely hurt the economy by taking funds away from 
corporations members of the public and other beneficiaries of 
government programs it also would lead to lower tax collections 
causing the deficit to rise again economists say 
todays forecast approximated the 19 percent consensus growth 
outlook in the latest survey of 51 top economists by blue chip 
economic indicators in sedona ariz 
the council projected economic growth to accelerate gradually 
from 19 percent in the first quarter to 23 percent in the second 
half of the year and 26 percent during 1991 the economy as 
measured by the gross national product grew 3 percent in 1989 
after slowing to 11 percent in the final quarter 
contributing most to the growth the forecast said will be 
consumer spending exports and business investments 
the forecast also suggested an improvement in the manufacturing 
sector of the economy saying industrial production will rise 21 
percent this year and 28 percent in 1991 
on the other hand preston said the forecast provides little 
hope that the sluggish housing industry will bounce back soon 
the combination of mortgage rates and a very slow 
appreciation of housing prices is viewed as very constraining he 
said

will stick with its decision to stop selling car insurance in 
pennsylvania despite a written admonition from gov robert p 
casey who called the giant insurer arrogant and callous 
on thursday casey sent a strongly worded threeparagraph 
letter to aetnas president david a kocher criticizing the 
companys decision wednesday to terminate business with its 200000 
pennsylvania customers 
casey said the companys withdrawal violated pennsylvania law 
and displayed an arrogant and callous disregard for our state and 
your policyholders 
if you persist in your decision i hereby put you on notice 
that pennsylvania will use all remedies against your company which 
the law allows to protect the 200000 aetna policyholders in our 
state and the broad public interest of all our citizens casey 
said in the letter 
aetna a sears roebuck and co unit and the states 
fifthlargest insurer said pennsylvanias new carinsurance law 
would cause it to lose 20 million during the next year 
the law enacted in february lowers all motorists rates by 10 
percent july 1 or by 22 percent if they give up their rights to sue 
in most cases 
aetna also has asked the courts to block the state insurance

the companys action was within its rights 
the company holds the position that its actions in 
pennsylvania to withdraw from the personal auto insurance market

us from taking this action 
at least two other companies harleysville mutual insurance co

the cost of luring car buyers into ford motor 
cos showrooms is running at an annual rate of about 4 billion 
double last years pace the no 2 automaker says 
ford president philip benton said after the companys annual 
meeting thursday that the automaker hopes that incentive spending 
which chews up profits will taper off later this year 
if the current pace continues ford will spend 4 billion on 
rebates in 1990 he said 
benton said the cost of cash rebates and lowinterest financing 
is rising however the company hopes the launch of its new escort 
subcompact and explorer sportutility vehicle will hold down the 
spending 
i would be hopeful with the reception of our new cars in the 
marketplace it would be less chairman harold poling said at a 
news conference following a quick and quiet shareholders meeting 
the day before general motors corp president robert stempel 
who takes over as chairman on aug 1 had the same message 
the rebates have just about run out their string he said 
theres no question that the companies want to get off them 
chrysler corp which relies heavily on incentives to boost 
sales also has said it would like to get away from them but 
doesnt see that happening soon 
fords meeting was the first of the big three this year 
chrysler holds its annual meeting next week in los angeles and gm 
shareholders meet a week after that in detroit 
ford like gm and chrysler said last week that incentive costs 
were part of the reason for severely depressed firstquarter 
earnings ford said it was spending an average of 1000 on every 
vehicle it sells now 
the company earned 5062 million during the first three months 
of this year down 69 percent from last years companyrecord 
firstquarter earnings gms quarterly earnings fell 54 percent and 
chryslers dropped 80 percent 
we believe the increased marketing and product expenditures 
will continue to affect profits throughout the year poling told 
shareholders in the first annual meeting he has run he succeeded 
donald petersen as chairman march 1 
if incentives work they boost a companys sales pace but they 
cut directly into profits fords share of the us market for 
domestically built cars was 286 percent at the end of april 
compared with gms 46 percent and chryslers 11 percent 
also at fords annual meeting 
benton said ford spent about 12 billion on its worldwide 
advertising in 1989 about 9 percent more than it spent in the 
previous year 
a 17member slate of directors nominated by the board was 
elected unopposed 
executives fielded repeated questions about the location of 
next years annual meeting ford auditorium where the company has 
held 27 shareholder meetings will be torn down to make way for a 
bank office building if a proposal before the detroit city council 
is approved 
poling said the board would decide on a meeting site later

retail sales slumped 06 percent in april 
posting the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest 
setback in six months the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales fell by 907 million last 
month to a seasonally adjusted 14864 billion 
the april decrease was a disappointment to economists who had 
been looking for a small rebound following a 02 percent decline in 
march and no change in february 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of total 
economic activity continued weakness in the area of retail sales 
was likely to intensify concerns about the countrys future 
economic prospects especially in light of last weeks report that 
unemployment climbed in april to 54 percent 
growing joblessness could promote worries among consumers about 
the future causing them to shut off spending especially for 
bigticket items such as autos 
the 06 percent april decline was the largest since a 14 
percent plunge last october 
the backtoback declines in march and april marked the first 
time that has occurred in moe than three years 
originally the government reported february posted a sales 
decline as well but sales activity during that month was revised 
upward in the current report to show no change 
for april the biggest drag on activity came from auto sales 
which dropped 27 percent it marked the sixth time in the last 
seven months that car sales have fallen 
without the big drop in auto sales total retail sales would 
have been unchanged last month 
sales at general department stores were off 07 percent in april 
following an even bigger 12 percent drop in march a survey 
focusing only on the countrys largest chain department stores 
showed sales had generally rebounded in april when compared to a 
year ago boosted by late easter shopping 
sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 26 percent 
in april following an 08 percent decrease the previous month 
there was basic weakness across the board sales at gasoline 
stations fell by 1 percent restaurant sales were off by 02 
percent while sales at speciality clothing stores were down 19 
percent 
drug stores were the only retail establishments showing an 
increase a gain of 12 percent

other manufacturers to offer similar systems for desktop computers

at xeroxs palo alto research center about 30 miles south of san 
francisco in the 1970s the suit sought 150 million in damages 
and asked to have apples copyrights on the macintosh display 
technology cancelled 
on march 23 walker dismissed five of xeroxs six counts against 
apple on procedural grounds the remaining count sought a 
declaratory judgement stating that xerox owns the copyright to its

president bush said today he is 
willing to discuss everything at next weeks budget summit but 
declared im not going to show you my hand in advance on new 
taxes 
bush speaking to reporters aboard air force one on his way from 
washington to texas insisted that nothing was off the bargaining 
table despite comments from a senior aide suggesting he might rule 
out any proposed tax increase 
why dont you just listen to what i say and see what we do 
bush said there are no conditions and thats the way it is 
thats the way its going to be and thats the way it must be 
it was the first time bush himself has spoken out on the subject 
since he appeared to open the door to a possible tax increase last 
sunday by proposing a nopreconditions budget summit with congress 
the first negotiations will take place next tuesday at the white 
house 
bushs comments came as administration and congressional leaders 
struggled to impose a verbal ceasefire on democrats and 
republicans who are bickering over whether next weeks budget 
summit will consider new taxes 
top democrats criticized white house chief of staf john sununu 
for saying that bush would never accept tax increases as part of a 
12 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
asked if sununu was in trouble for his remarks bush said 
thats silly so stupid 
and in a reference to members of congress who have joined in 
the fray bush said none of these congressmen are in trouble 
either 
however the president conceded that house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash was concerned over sununus remarks bush called 
foley on thursday to assure him that he had no preconditions for 
the budget summit talks 
yes he did express concern bush said but i think he 
sees the need to go forward on the basis i have called for and i 
respect him for that 
pressed on whether he would consider tax increases if they were 
put on the table bush said you can come at me all day long it 
would not be dealing in good faith if i started going into these 
details im not going to do it 
im not going to show you my hand and i havent seen a lot of 
hands being laid down up on the hill bush said but thats the 
way it ought to be there are some tough decisions out there and 
weve got to do something 
still bush declined to characterize the widening deficit gap as 
a crisis no were not dealing in a crisis mentality he said 
but weve got a major deficit problem we need cooperation 
because it isnt going to be easy its going to be very 
difficult 
could the budget be balanced without some form of tax hike 
see what happens the president said we just go there and 
discuss everything thats the only way you can get 
strongwilled people to the table in good faith the way it will 
be 
bush spoke on his way to a texas where he was to deliver a 
commencement address at texas aampi university at kingsville 
although democrats reacted angrily thursday to sununus remarks 
they stopped short of any action that could imperil the toplevel 
bargaining which is supposed to have no preconditions and is set 
to begin tuesday 
we view this incident as an extremely serious one because it 
could if repeated threaten the success of these talks foley 
said on thursday 
acknowledging the intense political pressure ignited by a need 
for perhaps 100 billion in budget cuts next year lawmakers of 
both parties begged for a truce 
one way to make certain we dont succeed is to continue 
statements that might throw us off course said senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan 
we just cant continue to have this kind of sniping and 
political warfare going on at the same time were trying to deal 
with a serious problem said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif 
sununu said his controversial comments were designed to make 
sure that people did not misinterpret no conditions as implying 
that there was a condition for what had to be in the final 
agreement 
white house budget chief richard darman has told lawmakers that 
there could be a need to slash next years federal shortfall by 60 
billion to 100 billion an astronomical amount even by government 
standards the goal is to obey the grammrudman laws requirement 
that the 1991 budget gap not exceed 64 billion

a second steep drop in vegetable costs helped 
push wholesale prices down 03 percent overall in april the 
government said today 
it was the sharpest decline since august and the third 
consecutive moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices 
spiraling 18 percent in january a 15year record 
the labor departments producer price index for finished goods 
one stop short of retail had fallen 02 percent in march and 
showed no change in february the monthly numbers are all adjusted 
for seasonal variations 
for the first four months of the year wholesale inflation was 
running at a 42 percent annual rate down from 48 percent for all 
of 1989 
in a separate report today the commerce department said retail 
sales last month slumped 06 percent the third consecutive month 
without an increase 
stock and bond markets rallied in response to both reports 
traders took them as a sign that the federal reserve board in the 
near term would not need to push up interest rates to fight 
inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 1397 to 
275248 in the first half hour of trading 
the numbers are increasingly ratifying the fact that weve 
dodged the inflationary bullet at least for a while said dirk 
van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors the bad news is that maybe the soft 
landing economic slowdown is a little softer than we would like 
in april food prices fell 06 percent after an identical 06 
percent decline a month earlier prices rose for eggs rice pasta 
and pork they fell for fruit chicken cooking oils and candy 
vegetable prices which fell 255 percent in march after record 
increases the previous two months fell another 311 percent last 
month it was the biggest drop since the government began tracking 
those costs in 1967 tomato prices fell 733 percent 
they are no longer boxing tomatoes in florida because the 
boxes are worth more than the tomatoes thus the winter freeze 
is nothing more than a bad memory said economist donald 
ratajczak of georgia state university 
energy prices dropped 17 percent after declining the two 
previous months gasoline prices with the start of the warm 
weather driving season climbed 22 percent however fuel oil fell 
19 percent while natural gas dropped 55 percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
modest 02 percent after rising a moderate 03 percent in march 
economists said this core number is often a better indicator of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
automobile prices fell 09 percent in april clothing price 
inflation recovered from increases a month earlier womens mens 
and boys clothing costs were unchanged girls and infants 
clothing fell 02 percent 
prices rose for medicines soap floor coverings and toys they 
fell for alcoholic beverages jewelry and magazines 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods at 
1170 in april that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in 1982 cost 117 last month up from 113 a year earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were 
moderate in april intermediate goods rose a slight 01 percent 
while crude goods fell 31 percent an example of the three 
processing stages would be bread for finished goods flour for 
intermediate and wheat for crude 
despite the moderate report for april prices at the wholesale 
level economists are still concerned that inflation may be 
accelerating this year 
consumer prices up at an annual rate of 85 percent in the 
first quarter are rising at a steeper pace than wholesale costs 
april consumer numbers are due out next week 
why the divergence between the two sets of prices 
producer prices reflect only the cost of goods while consumer 
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services which have 
been less affected by the economic slowdown of recent months 
economic growth has slowed enough to soften demand and hold down 
goods prices but not enough to greatly affect employment and thus 
the cost of services 
the federal reserve board which aims its monetary policy at 
reducing inflation meets tuesday to consider interest rate policy 
for the next six weeks 
with april wholesale inflation much better than the 02 percent 
rise forecast by most economists the fed may be less inclined to 
cool the economy by nudging interest rates higher something it 
hasnt done since march 1989 
however financial markets in recent weeks had nevertheless 
anticipated fed tightening by pushing up rates outside the central 
banks direct control in the governments quarterly auction of 
threeyear and 10year notes and 30year bonds this week interest 
rates were up about a third of a percentage point from three months 
ago

a couple of decades after they first caught on 
in the world of professional money management index funds are 
bidding to win a new generation of converts among individual 
investors 
the recruitment drive is being led by such prominent mutualfund 
sponsors as dreyfus corp and fidelity investments which lately 
have introduced funds based on stockmarket indexes 
vanguard group a singular early success in the field with its 
index trust500 portfolio is extending the idea to a series of new 
fund offerings 
at the very least a minifad is developing says sheldon 
jacobs publisher of the monthly newsletter noload fund investor 
in hastingsonhudson ny 
if the strategy proves as popular with the public as it has 
among managers of pension funds and other institutional pools of 
money it could turn out to be substantially more than a fad 
index funds are set up to duplicate the performance of some 
popular market yardstick such as standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index by holding a portfolio of issues that closely 
matches the makeup of the index 
this often strikes those who first encounter the concept as 
playing for a tie rather than shooting for allout victory in 
the battle for investment profits 
indeed indexing has never had a big fan club among securities 
analysts economists and market forecasters who compete to 
outguess each other after all the theory behind it pretty much 
dismisses their work as a waste of time and money 
regardless of who is right in this academic debate however 
indexed moneymanagement strategies do appear to have benefited 
from the makeup of the modern marketplace 
when institutions by virtue of their increasingly dominant 
role in effect become synonymous with the market it stands to 
reason that they cannot as a group outperform that market 
also says jacobs over the long run the costs of investing 
can offset managerial skill index funds gain an edge by 
minimizing or eliminating the costs of research and frequent 
trading 
the vanguard 500 portfolio which was started in 1976 has 
attracted assets approaching 2 billion even in todays 1 
trillion fund industry any fund over 1 billion still ranks as a 
big success 
whether you count the 500 portfolio as a growth or growth 
and income fund jacobs says its 165 percent average annual 
return over the past five years is good enough to rank it among the 
top 20 percent of its class 
damning as it may look to the managed competition that showing 
may exaggerate the virtues of indexing to some degree 
the big stocks that make up the sampp 500 have been outpacing 
their smaller counterparts in recent years jacobs notes in part 
because of their popularity among foreign investors and because of 
the spreading use of indexing itself 
whether the bluechip 500 will stay at the head of the pack in 
the 1990s remains an open question some analysts say smaller 
secondary stocks some of which are now being grouped into new 
specialized index funds are due for a comeback 
while the odds favor a change in market leadership it is very 
difficult to say just when this will occur jacobs observes 
to investors shopping for an indexfund investment jacobs 
offers a couple of suggestions first of all he says pay special 
attention to all costs including management fees operating 
expenses and any entrance or exit charges 
the whole point of index fund investing is to minimize 
expenses he says 
secondly he recommends spreading your money among funds based 
on indexes of both large and small stocks that way he 
concludes you really will be guaranteed a market return

britains annual inflation rate reached an 
eightyear high of 94 percent in april the government reported 
friday 
but the financial markets took the news well with the pound and 
stock prices both firming since many investors had expected an 
even higher 97 percent rate 
fighting inflation is prime minister margaret thatchers no 1 
economic priority and her conservative government has increased 
interest rates to 15 percent to try an slow down demand 
however a new percapita tax increases in excise duties and 
higher utility charges combined to push the inflation rate to its 
highest level since may 1982 when it stood at 95 percent the 
central statistical office said 
in march the rate stood at 81 percent 
the office said its retail price index rose 3 percent in april 
from march the monthly rise was the largest since april 1980 when 
the index gained 34 percent 
the index which uses a january 1987 base of 100 stood at 1251 
in april 1214 in march and 1143 in april 1989 
everyone was sure it was going to double figures said a 
trader at a major british bank speaking anonymously now people 
are going to say thats not too bad 
the bank of england on thursday forecast inflation at about 10 
percent for the nearterm with a peak in the third quarter 
british chancellor of the exchequer john major said there was 
nothing unexpected in the latest rise speaking in broadcast 
interviews after the figures were released major said the increase

while banks in some areas might be pruning their 
lists of qualified borrowers they are still shoveling out the 
money on credit cards 
the latest federal reserve figures show that revolving credit 
most of it run up at retail stores and through bank cards rose at 
a 121 percent annual rate in march a rather large figure for a 
sluggish economy 
that increase means that in the first quarter of this year the 
amount of consumer debt outstanding was 706 billion or roughly 
24 billion more than existed a year earlier 
most of this credit it is presumed went to pay for new 
consumer items although some cynics will tell you that a good many 
americans these days have become accustomed to meeting ordinary 
expenses through borrowing 
meanwhile business loans socalled commercial and industrial 
loans have been slowing in the first 14 weeks of 1988 campi loans 
rose 101 billion in the same period of 1989 they rose 12 
billion in 1990 they rose just 54 billion 
the federal reserve and other federal regulators leave no 
misimpressions about their goal which is to keep the economy cool 
and collected that is to say they seek to avoid inflation avoid 
recession and get the bills paid 
because of this policy the fed concedes there are pockets of 
tight money a rather odd turn of phrase for what are in effect 
empty pockets but it declines to say that a general credit crunch 
exists 
nevertheless complaints are rising in some areas from small 
businesses especially developers who claim their lines of credit 
are being withdrawn or reduced home mortgage applications also are 
being scrutinized more closely 
while there might or might not be a credit crunch the situation 
obviously concerns the fed which last week advised bankers to act 
like bankers that is to assume prudent risks rather than attempt 
to reduce risk to zero 
meanwhile those bank cards seem to be an exception to the new 
conservatism of lenders banks continue to expand their bank card 
lists and credit limits for customers who pay on time may even be 
raised no questions asked 
the explanation isnt complex bank cards are profitable 
the major reason is that interest charges are often double those 
of home equity loans when some home mortgages are in single 
digits for example many bank card rates are 195 percent plus an 
annual fee 
moreover while the total amount of credit extended on bank 
cards might be sizeable for any particular bank the separate loans 
are relatively small the banks exposure on any one loan is 
limited 
in contrast a home equity loan can be large millions of 
americans own homes that have doubled in value in the past decade 
or less and they are tempted to use that equity home equity loans 
are the least expensive and the expense is made still lower at tax 
time when interest paid can be deducted 
in lending to small businesses meanwhile bankers are 
confronted with this situation smallbusiness loans often are 
risky that risk is made even more so when the economy is sluggish 
many such loans have gone bad in recent years 
confronted with regulatory restraints poor business conditions 
and recent bad experience on loans to small businesses many 
bankers seem to be retreating to the security the limited risk and 
the high returns of bank card credit

the latest slide in dollar reflects a rebound in the value of

a drop in interest rates would encourage borrowing but also

the dollars value is the most visible symbol of confidence in 
the health of the us economy the dollars worth relative to

while shortterm rises or drops in the dollars worth dont 
necessarily signal profound economic changes they are nonetheless 
monitored closely by economists and governments 
over the longer term a weaker dollar is thought to help us 
trade by making exports relatively less expensive and therefore

leaders of top us businesses said 
friday the economy will grow only moderately this year and next but 
will manage to stave off a recession 
inflation is on the way down they say predicting that the 
firstquarter annual inflation rate of 81 percent will be cut 
nearly in half 
economic growth will total about 2 percent in 1990 as it 
accelerates gradually from 19 percent in the first half of the 
year to 23 percent in the second according to the business 
council 100 chief executives of the nations largest corporations 
it will rise to 26 percent in 1991 
the bush administration forecast in january that the economy 
would grow 24 percent in 1990 although many economists expect 
that to be lowered in the july review it projects 32 percent 
growth in 1991 
the councils latest forecast presented at its semiannual 
meeting at this mountain resort contrasted with a report released 
at its october meeting that predicted a meager 18 percent growth 
rate in 1990 and warned of an outright recession if the federal 
reserve failed to cut interest rates 
the fed which had boosted rates to slow the economy in its 
fight against inflation did permit rates to drop several times 
after the october meeting but it has kept a firm hand on credit 
since december despite calls for easing by administration officials 
and some economists to allow stronger economic growth 
lewis t preston business council vice chairman and chairman of 
jp morgan inc the giant new york bank said the 19 council 
economists who drew up the report expected no change in fed policy 
for an extended period of ahead 
nevertheless preston said not a single one of the 19 is 
forecasting a recession to begin any time this year or next 
the dominant belief is that the fed has successfully guided 
the economy into a moderate growth pattern that has an excellent 
chance of being extended for a very long time preston told 
reporters 
the business council forecast mirrored the 2 percent consensus 
growth rate in a may survey of 51 leading economists by blue chip 
economic indicators in sedona ariz 
the economy grew 3 percent last year but had slowed to 11 
percent rate during the fourth quarter it grew at a 19 percent 
clip in the first quarter of 1990 
looking at the steep price increases early this year the 
council said the disappointingly high inflation readings in the 
first quarter are generally viewed as an aberration by the 
consultants they now expect the 81 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter to slow to 33 percent in the second 
the groups cpi inflation forecast for the second half of the 
year has been slightly lowered from 41 percent at the time of the 
last survey to 39 percent in the current survey the council 
said 
despite the slowdown inflation for the full year is projected 
to be 48 percent thats up from a 42 percent rate the council 
forecast in october 
inflation should moderate next year to a rate of 44 percent 
the council said 
the adminstrations january forecast calls for inflation to rise 
39 percent this year and 4 percent in 1991 it was 46 percent in 
1989 
preston said the economy is fragile and the growth forecast 
could be skewed by special factors and by federal deficitreduction 
talks beginning tuesday between congressional and white house 
negotiators 
the administration contends that if the deficit is not cut to 
the 64 billion limit set by the grammrudman balanced budget law 
it could mean automatic spending cuts of between 60 billion and 
100 billion in fiscal 1991 that begins oct 1 
such huge cuts would severely hurt the economy economists say 
nevertheless the council is forecasting 1990 growth based on 
continued consumer spending exports and business investment 
it also said the manufacturing sector would pick up with 
industrial production rising 21 percent this year and 28 percent 
during 1991 the optimism didnt extend to housing however 
our advisory group has little hope that housing will show any 
buoyancy any time soon preston said the combination of 
mortgage rates and a very slow appreciation of housing prices 
is viewed as very constraining

source perrier sa said friday that the costs 
associated with the recent recall of its popular bottled sparkling 
water were assessed to last years account resulting in a 75 
percent plunge in earnings for 1989 
the company said net profit totaled 47 million for the year 
compared with 185 million in 1988 
perrier recalled its bottled water worldwide in february after 
tests showed traces of benzene a cancercausing chemical in its 
product in several countries the contamination came from improper 
infiltration of carbon dioxide gas added to the water according to 
the company 
perrier put the cost of the recall at 78 million 
the company said it put aside part of its 1989 profit to cover 
the recall expense which is permitted under french law 
perrier said it had expected to cover most of the recall costs 
with nonrecurring gains from the sale of assets but these totaled 
only 45 million for 1989 
in addition perriers 1988 results were swelled by much more 
substantial nonrecurring gains of 154 million reflecting the 
sale of assets that included television confectionary and milk 
interests 
perrier recently began resupplying its distributorss with 
bottles marked new production 
perrier officials said they were optimistic about 1990 results 
perrier is again present on all markets and the current pace 
of production should allow us to meet the enormous worldwide demand 
for perrier relatively quickly the company said in a statement 
it said sales of mineral water were up 12 percent in the first 
quarter from a year earlier but didnt provide a specific figure

dozens of central florida newspaper readers 
knew they spotted a bargain when they saw the pan am ad offering a 
oneway flight to nuremberg west germany for 109 
oops the advertisement should have said 409 
but never mind pan am went ahead and honored the erroneously 
advertised price for about 75 people who wanted tickets wednesday 
and thursday 
after all the ad promised a lot of europe for not a lot of 
money 
pan am ticket agents discovered the error wednesday morning when 
the first bargain hunters appeared 
it was very embarrassing said fergus kelly pan ams 
general manager in orlando we said thatll be 409 and the 
customer said uhuh 
the deal on the fare made possible by the mistake of a new york 
printing company ended at noon thursday company officials said 
the error appeared only in the ad that ran in the orlando sentinel 
at the local office of the law firm of holland amp knight 
secretary julie mcdaniels husband dave called her wednesday to 
tell her about the fare and ask her if she wanted to go to germany 
she thought about it for about two seconds she said 
mrs mcdaniels asked her boss for the time off her boss asked 
about the fare 
when i told him he jumped for it she said my boss is 
going too 
officials at floridas department of agriculture and consumer 
affairs said the company wasnt under any legal obligation to honor 
the lower fare since it was a typographical error 
but pamela hanlon a new york spokeswoman for pan am said 
friday the airline decided it was only fair to do so particularly 
since it wont be out any money 
the printers have acknowledged it was their error and will 
pick up the cost to pan am ms hanlon said

the union representing american 
airlines flight attendants has filed suit over the companys plan 
to use foreign nationals on latin american routes newly acquired 
from eastern airlines 
in a lawsuit filed thursday in miami the association of 
professional flight attendants claims the plan violates americans 
contract with the 14500member union 
earlier this week american asked a fort worth federal judge to 
rule that the railway labor act does not apply to flight attendants 
outside the united states and international flights to and from 
us gateway cities 
american the nations largest airline has agreed to pay 
eastern 335 million for its routes between miami and 15 latin 
american nations the sale is a key part of easterns 
reorganization plan 
american plans to hire all of easterns employees outside the 
united states including flight attendants who are not us 
citizens and who apparently will not be members of the airlines 
independent flight attendants union 
the union also sought a preliminary injunction barring american 
from going ahead with its plans until the matter is put to 
arbitration the fort worthbased airline is to begin serving some 
of the routes by july 1 and to serve them all by late august 
what is at stake here is not only international flying in and 
out of latin america to us cities such as miami but 
international flying throughout the world said cheryle leon 
president of the flight attendants union 
ms leon said the union had made an offer that would have 
allowed american to employ temporarily the foreign flight 
attendants coming from eastern but american rejected the offer 
maureen moore an american attorney said the airline has no 
choice but to hire those latin american attendants now flying with 
eastern because it agreed to do so as part of the acquisition 
eastern had been held to the same obligation when it acquired 
those routes from the old braniff international airways in 1982 
shortly before braniff filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and 
ceased operating for nearly two years 
ms moore said the flight attendants union does not have a 
clause in its contract defining the extent of union coverage and 
since american contends that the railway labor act does not apply 
outside the united states the airline believes the apfa has no 
right to represent citizens of foreign nations who work only on 
american international flights 
besides some of these people are in their own unions ms 
moore said

company plans to dig out of its problems 
stephen l pistner ames new chief executive officer had

office an arm of the bankruptcy court to choose a committee of 
creditors to participate in the case

to approve that financing is scheduled for next tuesday in new 
york alvarez said 
pistner said ames intends to use the money to restock its

to determine which items the company will continue to sell he said 
they also will decide how many stores to close

a federal commission studying the nations 
povertyblighted mississipi delta has recommended development of a 
regional bank to get capital to the areas small and minorityowned 
businesses 
its one of many recommendations in the final report of the 
lower mississippi delta development commission formed by congress 
in 1988 to determine why the resourcerich delta is the poorest in 
the united states the report is to be presented to congress monday 
section iii of the foursection report deals with the problems 
of private enterprise and how best to develop business in the 
region which covers 219 counties in the states of arkansas 
louisiana mississippi missouri illinois tennessee and kentucky 
the delta region as a whole has substantial assets in its 
banking system and these assets currently total about 78 
billion the report noted 
but that money isnt getting to the entrepreneurs who need it 
according to the report 
bank deposits in the region totalled 5992 billion for 1989 
while loans totalled 442 billion for a loandeposit ratio of 736 
percent the report said 
improving that ratio to the national level of 795 percent would 
spur 35 billion in additional investment the report said 
in each of the commissions public hearings delta business 
persons addressed the need for greater access to capital and 
encouraged the delta commission to recommend the establishment of a 
regional funding entity to work with banks to increase the amount 
of capital available for regional investment the report said 
a regional bank could guarantee local bank loans provide equity 
loans and various other types of financing to help small and 
minorityowned businesses get started and help existing businesses 
expand the report said 
the report encourages state and federal governments 
universities chambers of commerce and others to share knowledge 
resources and technology 
and it says too few delta business managers recognize the need 
for or have access to the kind of technology training and 
resources that will strengthen their skills and expertise as 
managers 
the report decries the lack of black business people in the 
delta 
approximately 40 percent of the total population is african 
american yet the involvement of african americans in the business 
sector is far less substantial the report said 
the report also noted that industries in the delta rely too 
heavily on harvesting its rich agricultural and mineral resources 
and too little on making products out of them 
the report notes arkansas success in developing retirement 
communities and suggests other parts of the delta region could do 
the same it also touts tourism for the region suggesting 
development of a tourism entity that could promote the cultural 
diversity and natural beauty of the area and work with amtrak to 
develop a major passenger train corridor through the delta

dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and 
inflationary pressures were subdued

as the trial of three commodities brokers charged in a 
wideranging probe of corruption commenced in a chicago courtroom 
a group of floor traders in new york engaged in an effort to redeem 
the tainted image of their profession 
the floor brokers and traders association formed a year after 
the futures industry came under intense scrutiny for suspected 
trading abuses wants to administer its own ethics pledge to 
traders 
in addition the organization wants to encourage members to 
attend ethics classes tailored to the moral choices and challenges 
of trading in which fortunes can be made and lost in a few 
minutes time 
although image is a major concern the groups president michael 
wilner says the organization will address other issues such as the 
controversial practice of dual trading which it favors and 
working conditions on the floor of new yorks commodity exchanges 
the association has attracted about 520 members in the past two 
months among them traders at the new york mercantile exchange 
the commodity exchange and the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
wilner president of hilltop trading co said they all have one 
thing in common they are hardworking down to earth guys 
our belief is that the majority of traders are aboveboard 
professionals wilner said and we dont want our image 
hammered by the misdeeds of a few 
in chicago danny l scheck robert d mosky and david zatz are 
on trial in us district court on charges stemming from an fbi 
probe of trading fraud at the chicago mercantile exchange and 
chicago board of trade 
the governments case rests partly on tapes made by an fbi agent 
who secretly recorded conversations while posing in 1988 as a 
corrupt trader in the swiss franc futures trading pit at the 
mercantile exchange 
the government contends the tape recordings reveal a variety of 
schemes employed by the trio to divert customer profits to their 
own accounts 
but defense lawyers say the tapes portray their clients proper 
attempts to verify trades they made with each other and the agent 
amid the hubbub that is typical of a futures trading pit 
wilner said the association wants to change the image of floor 
traders from the public perception of them as brash rich gamblers 
who bet on the future prices of basics ranging from soybeans to 
pork bellies 
the association plans a newsletter to keep traders educated 
about regulatory issues to assure they are in compliance with the 
rules wilner said 
but image is only one concern of the association 
wilner said the group plans to defend dual trading in which 
floor traders execute customer orders and trade for themselves at 
the same time critics say the practice creates enormous 
opportunities for cheating and enables traders to executive 
profitable dealers for themselves before they take care of clients 
the commodity futures trading commission the federal agency 
responsible for policing the futures pits has proposed phasing in 
a dualtrading ban 
dual trading is appropriate wilner said adding that he has 
found that most customers are comfortable with it 
the reason it is an advantage is it ensures a high caliber of 
experience and compensation comes not only from salary and 
commission but from ones own trading account 
quality of life issues are also a concern for the group 
the comex nymex coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange as well as the 
new york futures exchange and the cotton exchange all share the 
same floor space in the world trade center 
the cramped floor space stunts the growth of the exchanges and 
makes the traders jobs more difficult the association hopes to 
have input in the search for larger quarters as well as find 
affordable health insurance for traders wilner said

investors showed by their vigorous bidding for 
the treasurys auction of 305 billion in new notes and bonds this 
past week that they think interest rates have peaked 
moreover new evidence of moderating inflation and slow economic 
growth on friday helped the market end the week with an impressive 
rally that drove yields on 30year treasury bonds toward 865 
percent that is a huge move from the 905 percent yields that 
prevailed only two weeks earlier 
market watchers remained divided however on whether rates are 
going to continue to fall and how soon the decline will be 
reflected in rates for mortghage and consumer loans 
mortgage rates tend to follow treasury rates with a lag 
said lincoln anderson economist for bear stearns amp co there is 
a connection but the linkage is not tight 
anderson who thinks longterm treasury rates are going to fall 
by another percentage point or more by the end of the year said 
those making mortgage and other consumer loans are going to wait to 
make sure rates dont bounce higher before they adjust their own 
lending rate schedules 
mickey levy chief economist for first fidelity bancorporation 
of newark nj said he thinks treasury rates have peaked and 
mortgage rates will decline modestly within a month 
but other analysts said yields ran up so quickly in april after 
the governments march consumer price report indicated inflation 
was accelerating that mortgage lenders did not fully reflect the 
increase in their rates 
as a result they said there may be less room for mortgage 
rates to fall 
chief economist lyle e gramley of the mortgage bankers 
association said the potential for further increases in bond prices 
and rate declines is rather limited 
the former federal reserve board governor said the effective 
rate on mortgage loans including special charges was close to 11 
percent two weeks ago and may have fallen to 1075 percent in 
recent days with the potential to drop to 1050 percent were 
not likely to see much better than that he said 
aubrey h zaffuto economist of ibj schroder bank amp trust said 
she expects there will be only minimal impact on consumer rates as 
a result of the drop in treasury yields 
she said the governments borrowing needs are likely to 
accelerate this summer while credit demands from eastern europe 
will grow both putting more pressure on interest rates 
i cant see that we have a clear shot at lower rates i think 
they are going to stay where they are now in a trading range she 
said 
the sharp declines in interest rates cut the governments 
potential borrowing costs considerably from what they had been 10 
days earlier 
yields on 30year bonds had risen as high as 905 percent in 
late april mainly because reports on march consumer prices 
indicated to some traders that the economy and inflation were 
accelerating to the detriment of bond prices 
but the government caught a break on may 4 when the employmnet 
report for april indicated the economy ands inflation were weaker 
than expected 
bond prices staged one of the biggest rallies of the year that 
day dropping yields as low as 881 percent on 30year treasury 
bonds 
the backdrop for the treasury refunding auction could not have 
been better 
on tuesday investors snapped up 105 billion in threeyear 
notes at an average yield of 874 percent and turned in more than 
353 in bids for each 1 in notes sold the biggest imbalance of 
that sort since august 1985 
there was similarly strong demand for 10 billion in 10year 
notes which were sold on wednesday at an average yield of 888 
percent the ratio of 3 in bids for every 1 in notes sold was the 
second largest on record for a 10year note auction according to 
the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
the auction concluded thursday as 10 billion in 30year bonds 
were sold for an average yield of 884 percent lower than the 
yield commanded by the 10year notes and another indication of 
healthy demand 
the governments reports on friday that its producer price index 
fell 03 percent in april as retail sales fell 06 percent touched 
off a rousing rally 
by midafternoon yields on 30year treasury bonds were as low as 
866 percent or nearly fourtenths of a percentage point below 
their peaks two weeks earlier that is an extraordinary move in 
that time frame 
they indicated moderating inflation and moderate maybe 
slowing economic activity that is music to a bond investors 
ears said elliott platt who follows the credit markets for 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
we were off to the races it was incredible he said

gasoline prices declined and carried the rest of 
the energy market lower as supply concerns abated friday 
the contract for june delivery of unleaded regular gasoline fell 
179 cents to 6189 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
earlier in the week gasoline rose sharply as traders worried 
that supplies would run tight in the gulf of mexico 
a pipeline that serves 36 drilling platforms and handles 95000 
barrels of oil a day was shut down raising the possibility of 
disruptions to refineries just as they were preparing to process 
large quantities of crude for the summer driving season 
however concerns eased as fuel cargoes destined for the 
atlantic coast were diverted to the gulf coast and traders 
consequently sold gasoline lower said andrew lebow an analyst 
with edampf man international futures inc 
the slide in gasoline brought other futures down the june 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude declined 7 cents to 1895 a 42gallon barrel 
heating oil for june delivery dropped 079 cent to 5092 cents a

one of the most valuable investments these 
days may be a flipper lookalike 
dolphin prices are soaring one reason is an unexplained dolphin 
illness in the gulf of mexico a prime frolicking ground for the 
intelligent mammals which has forced a ban on dolphin captures 
there 
moreover demand for flipper lookalikes has jumped markedly from 
tourist businesses which range from swimwiththedolphin theme 
park attractions to aquariums and even a casino 
federal officials say theyve recently heard of offers made for 
top performing dolphins from 50000 to 100000 apiece but exact 
figures are guarded industry secrets 
so long as they are captured and cared for under the law i 
dont care how much money they make said chuck oravetz 
protected species coordinator for the national marine fisheries 
service branch in st petersburg economics is not something we 
delve into 
but the stakes could keep climbing because the gulf of mexico 
where nearly all dolphins for display are captured is off limits 
until scientists can determine what has caused the 237 known 
dolphin deaths so far this year 
a 90day federal moratorium on captures was scheduled to last 
through midjune but may be extended if the dolphin deaths continue 
even when captures are resumed new quotas will be in effect to 
further restrict how many dolphins can be taken from the wild that 
will make those in captivity much more valuable 
its a matter of the laws of supply and demand said nick 
brown director of the nonprofit national aquarium in baltimore 
which plans to open a 35 million marine mammal facility by this 
fall were having a hard time keeping up 
in the past year the national aquariums budget to procure 
dolphins has jumped from 300000 to more than 1 million because 
of increased demand brown said 
nine facilities which also include disney world and the 
indianapolis zoo have permits to capture a total of 36 dolphins 
from the gulf this year those plans are on hold 
but its the latest entry into the business that is causing the 
most controversy dolphins will soon compete with showgirls and 
slot machines at the mirage hotel and casino on the shimmering las 
vegas strip 
whenever a facility has never held dolphins before theres 
controversy especially when it has a lot of money to spend said 
ann terbush chief of the fisheries services permit division in 
silver spring md i think the mirage has had an effect on 
increasing the price of dolphins 
behind the mirage swimming pool workers are putting the 
finishing touches on a 15 million gallon display that is set to 
open with six dolphins in september 
we have a 20000gallon tropical fish tank a rain forest and 
a display of tigers now well have a stateofthe art facility 
for dolphins said mirage spokesman alan feldman its another 
attraction that makes the mirage a special place 
he emphasized there are no plans for the dolphins to perform 
tricks and it will not be a swimwiththedolphins attraction 
the primary purpose is to help educate the public about 
dolphins 
as a new dolphin display the mirage has a federal permit 
restricting its acquisition to animals already in captivity 
although feldman would not elaborate on the bids the mirage is 
making for dolphins he said money wasnt the prime concern 
its not like something you walk into sears and buy feldman 
said yes its expensive to the extent we are willing to buy 
dolphins that have been well cared for and that are healthy 
in april the mirage purchased its first dolphin an 8yearold 
female performer named sigma from the recently closed seaarama in 
galveston texas fisheries service officials said 
price is confidential said seaarama dolphin supervisor john 
dellanera adding that it was less than the rumored 100000 it 
was a more than fair price 
the trading of dolphins as just another marketable commodity 
galls activists such as richard obarry a former trainer for the 
flipper television series who now runs the miamibased dolphin 
project an organization dedicated to protecting dolphins 
its a very sleazy business said obarry who has protested 
the mirage facility 
a casino is no place for dolphins he said its going to 
be dolphins for the rich and famous 
the dolphin project follows the activities of known dolphin 
trappers and attempts to track the prices paid for dolphins 
obarry said some marine veterinarians routinely charge approved 
facilities 20000 to capture dolphins from the wild while dolphin 
stars trained to leap for fish and jump through hoops command 
prices up to 100000 
jay sweeney a san diego marine mammal veterinarian who has 
trapped dolphins for several facilities said the price he charges 
for the service varies but it is around 10000 plus expenses for 
his boats and crew of eight opponents of dolphin trading say 
regulation is not tight enough because of the inherent conflict of 
interest in the marine mammal protection act the commerce 
department and the national marine fisheries service empowered to 
protect the interests of business are also in charge of protecting 
dolphins 
but the fisheries service contends there is a misperception 
about how many dolphins are actually captured and in captivity 
of the estimated 45000 dolphins in the gulf of mexico the 
fisheries service reported only 25 captured last year the quota 
allowed to be taken this year if the capture ban is lifted will 
be lowered from 91 to 35 there are 351 dolphins in captivity in 
the united states fisheries service figures show 
those numbers pale in comparison to the estimated 100000 
dolphins that have died annually in the nets of tuna fleets fishing 
in the eastern tropical pacific tuna companies selling brands such 
as starkist chicken of the sea and bumble bee have recently 
announced theyve switched to fishing methods that wont kill the 
dolphins 
regardless of the emphasis on commercialization the national 
aquariums brown says dolphin displays not only satisfy the 
national fascination for the creatures but also promote 
understanding 
i dont see the silent majority out there jumping on this 
bandwagon that targets dolphin displays as an issue like the 
homeless or abortion he said being able to go some place and 
see dolphins goes a long way toward making people aware of their 
environment and conservation efforts

the dollar went into a tailspin against the 
japanese yen friday as investors reassessed the health of the 
japanese and us economies 
the yens dramatic advance began overnight in tokyo where 
recordsetting trading volume in the japanese currency signaled 
that investor confidence in japans economy was being renewed 
the move was hastened later in the united states on fresh 
government reports indicating the economy is weakening and 
inflation is being curbed but by the close of domestic trading 
the dollar had recovered against all currencies except the yen and 
the british pound 
nearly 22 billion worth of yen changed hands friday in tokyo 
more than double an average days volume of around 8 billion to 9 
billion said james mcgroarty senior vice president at greenwich 
capital markets inc in greenwich conn 
as the yen soared the dollar spiraled down in tokyo the 
dollar closed at 15415 yen off 260 yen from thursday it fell 
further in london where it settled at 15375 yen and later closed 
at 15270 yen in new york off sharply from late thursdays 15650 
yen 
fridays trading in new york represented a roughly 35 percent 
drop from a week earlier when the dollar traded at about 15830 
yen in new york 
traders were quite surprised by the significant drop in the 
value of the dollar overnight which precipitated further selling 
when trading shifted to us markets mcgroarty said 
a labor department report showing an unexpected 03 percent 
decline in april wholesale prices coupled with a 06 decline in 
retail sales during the month accelerated the dollars fall 
the reports fueled the notion that the federal reserve will not 
need to raise interest rates to cool the economy higher interest 
rates increase the relative attractiveness of returns on 
dollardenominated securities 
that helped spark rallies in other us markets stock prices 
shot higher with the dow jones industrial average finishing up 
more than 63 points and bond prices rising more than 1750 per 
1000 in face value 
but despite the speculation of lower us interest rates the 
days foreign exchange activity was more of a yen story than a 
dollar story said robert brusca chief economist at nikko 
securities co international inc 
he said investors were beginning to react to the group of 
sevens contention that japans economic fundamentals do not 
justify such a low yen 
earlier this month in washington finance ministers of the seven 
leading industrialized nations agreed to support a higher yen to 
prevent undesirable consequences for the world economy 
while there has not been any evidence of central bank 
intervention to push the yen higher heavy yenbuying implies 
major investors have had another reassessment and said maybe 
things arent that bad in japan mcgroarty said 
analysts note the japanese stock market which had lost 30 
percent in value since january is beginning to recover and japans 
bond market remains strong 
on the surface the dollars decline against the yen appeared to 
be a logical progression because the us currency traded at 
twoyear lows against the swiss franc and the west german mark this 
week 
but some market observers are bearish on dollars nearterm 
future as well 
the market is losing its enthusiasm for speculating in favor 
of the dollar brusca said over the past few days investors 
have been acutely aware of the pressure on the fed to ease 
rates and the potential for a tax hike to occur 
in london the british pound rose to 16817 from 16770 late 
thursday in new york the dollar rose to 16790 from thursdays 
16775 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with thursdays 
late rates included 16378 west german marks up from 16325 
13995 swiss francs up from 13915 55295 french francs up from 
55115 120775 italian lire up from 120275 and 11758 
canadian dollars up from 11703 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with thursdays late 
rates included 16300 west german marks down from 16368 13955

gold prices fell worldwide on the new york commodity exchange

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower friday on 
the chicago board of trade as traders reacted negatively to us 
agriculture department crop figures 
on other markets precious metals futures were lower livestock 
prices were mostly higher pork was mixed and energy prices fell 
wheat settled a cent to 5 cents lower with the contract for 
may delivery at 381 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 3 
cents higher with may at 287 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 6 
cents lower with may at 160 a bushel soybeans were 14 cents to 
17 cents lower with may at 632 a bushel 
traders gave a bearish interpretation to the figures released 
thursday by the agriculture department 
the usda estimated winter wheat production at a nineyear high 
of 209 billion bushels that was up 44 percent from last years 
droughtreduced harvest of 145 billion bushels 
this years corn harvest was projected at 81 billion bushels 
and soybean production was pegged at 192 billion bushels 
the size of the projected wheat harvest was larger than 
expected triggering fridays selloff thoughts that the large crop 
could spur export sales gave some support to the market though 
analysts said 
soybean prices were pressured by heavy professional selling 
although soyoil offered some support because of the agriculture 
departments forecast of a drop in soyoil inventory 
the decline of soybean futures spilled into corn although 
newcrop corn was boosted by positive figures in usdas supply and 
demand report 
precious metals prices were lower on the new york commodity 
exchange 
selling of gold was a continuation of selling on the overnight 
markets said peter caudillo an analyst with josephthal amp co in 
new york 
the market also was pressured by the release of figures from the 
labor department that showed inflation at the wholesale level was 
running at a 42 percent annual rate down from 48 percent for all 
of 1989 wholesale prices actually fell in april investors usually 
buy gold as a hedge against inflation 
the malaise in the market also is due to the heavy producer 
selling by australia and south africa and the threat of gold sales 
by the soviet union to finance grain purchases caudillo said 
gold was 140 to 170 lower with june at 37050 a troy ounce 
silver was 45 cents to 5 cents lower with may at 5065 a troy 
ounce 
energy futures were mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
there was little news to influence the market said robert 
baker an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
however crude oil gained support during its fall from a report 
kuwait was cutting back on spot sales an indication it was 
complying with opec efforts to cut back production 
gasoline prices plunged as the market realized the tightness in 
gasoline stocks was not as severe as first believed baker said 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 14 cents lower 
with june at 1895 a barrel heating oil was 27 cent to 92 cent 
lower with june at 5092 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 55 
cent to 179 cents lower with june at 6189 cents a gallon 
livestock futures were mostly higher and pork futures mixed in 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle prices received support from expectations the number of 
cattle going into feed lots in coming months will decline said tom 
morgan of sterling research corp in arlington ill 
pork prices were pressured by lower cash prices and the belief 
the market is overbought after a run up in prices in recent weeks 
morgan said 
live cattle were 13 cent lower to 22 cent higher with june at 
7407 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent lower to 22 cent 
higher with may at 8482 cents a pound hogs were 67 cent lower to

a record drop in vegetable costs contributed 
to a second straight decline in wholesale prices last month the 
government said friday sparking rallies in the stock and bond 
markets 
the labor departments producer price index for finished goods 
one stop short of retail fell a seasonally adjusted 03 percent 
last month 
it was the sharpest decline since august and the third 
consecutive moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices 
spiraling 18 percent in january the index fell 02 percent in 
march and was unchanged in february 
the inflation scare is over declared economist lawrence a 
hunter of the us chamber of commerce 
for the first four months of the year inflation at the 
wholesale level was running at a 42 percent annual rate down from 
48 percent for all of 1989 
separately the commerce department said retail sales 
unexpectedly slumped 06 percent in april the third month without 
an increase 
financial markets rallied and interest rates fell in response to 
the reports traders said the figures provided a double dose of 
evidence that economic growth and inflation remain subdued 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 6307 to 
280158 its third highest closing ever the price of the 
treasurys benchmark 30year bond surged 1 points driving the 
yield down more than an eighth of a percentage point to 866 
percent 
lower rates knocked the dollar however it dropped to 15270 
japanese yen off 380 yen from thursday 
the reports along with one last week showing the april 
unemployment rate rising to 54 percent likely will convince 
federal reserve monetary policy makers to leave interest rates 
unchanged when they meet tuesday economists said 
prior to the april figures many economists believed the fed 
would nudge interest rates higher out of concern that growth was 
rebounding too strongly and inflation was reigniting 
we started the year worrying about a recession then we 
worried about inflation and now theres worry about a recession 
again people are zigzagging on this said economist donald 
ratajczak of georgia state university 
a panel of 19 economists employed by the nations largest 
corporations on friday predicted slow but sustained economic growth 
through 1991 the economy as measured by the gross national 
product will grow 2 percent in 1990 and 26 percent in 1991 down 
from 3 percent in 1989 they said 
the forecast was released in hot springs va where the 
nations top corporate executives are gathering for a meeting of 
the business council 
the labor department said food prices fell 06 percent in april 
after an identical decline a month earlier prices rose for eggs 
rice pasta and pork they fell for fruit chicken cooking oils 
and candy 
vegetable prices which fell 255 percent in march after record 
increases in the preceding two months fell an additional 311 
percent last month it was the biggest drop since the government 
began tracking those costs in 1967 tomato prices fell 733 percent 
energy prices dropped 17 percent after declining in the two 
previous months gasoline prices with the start of the warm 
weather driving season climbed 22 percent fuel oil prices 
however fell 19 percent while natural gas costs dropped 55 
percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
modest 02 percent after rising a 03 percent advance in march 
economists said this core number is often a better indicator of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy than the 
calculation that includes food and energy expenses 
automobile prices fell 09 percent in april clothing price 
inflation recovered from increases a month earlier womens mens 
and boys clothing costs were unchanged girls and infants 
clothing prices fell 02 percent 
prices rose for medicines soap floor coverings and toys they 
fell for alcoholic beverages jewelry and magazines 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods at 
1170 in april that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in 1982 would have cost 117 last month up from 113 a 
year earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were 
moderate in april prices for intermediate goods rose a slight 01 
percent crude good prices fell 31 percent pulled down by a 12 
percent drop for crude oil the largest in four years 
an example of the three processing stages finished 
intermediate and crude would be clothing cloth and cotton 
despite the moderate report for wholesale prices last month 
some economists remain concerned that inflation may accelerate this 
year 
consumer prices up at an annual rate of 85 percent in the 
first quarter are rising at a steeper pace than wholesale costs 
why the divergence between the two sets of prices 
wholesale prices reflect only the cost of goods while consumer 
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services which have 
been less affected by the economic slowdown of recent months 
economic growth has slowed enough to soften demand and hold down 
goods prices but not enough to greatly affect employment and thus 
the cost of services 
whatever inflationary pressures there are in the economy are 
stemming from the relative scarcity of labor said economist 
sandra shaber of the futures group a washington consulting firm

at mcdonnell douglas corp in long beach at 
lockheed corp in burbank at companies that employ a 
quartermillion workers in los angeles county alone the question 
is the same 
how much worse can the aerospace business get in california 
aerospace for decades one of the biggest cogs in the states 
700 billion economy is now threatened on one side by defense 
cuts on the other by the high costs of living and doing business 
in california 
layoffs are suddenly a neardaily event 
on friday gencorp incs aerojet division said it would merge 
two rocket propulsion units in sacramento cutting 200 jobs a week 
earlier aerojet announced more than 200 layoffs at its chino and 
downey plants after losing a key contract total aerojet employment 
was 7977 at the end of 1988 7237 at the end of 1989 and 7028 
at the end of april before the latest cuts 
on thursday mcdonnell douglas increased its estimate of layoffs 
this summer at its lossplagued long beach aircraft unit from 3000 
to 4000 
also during the week lockheed said it would close its historic 
burbank operations by mid1990 it will move much of the work to an 
atlanta suburb to save 75 million a year and make the company a 
leaner competitor for dwindling government contract work 
lockheeds skunk works where topsecret researchers dreamed 
up the u2 and sr71 spy planes and the stealth fighter will stay 
in southern california in the desert city of palmdale but a total 
of 4500 lockheed jobs are expected to be lost 
most business analysts say the economies of the state and of the 
greater los angeles area where aerospace is centered are far more 
diversified than during the last big round of defense cuts in 
197071 that means the aerospace woes wont trigger an allout 
regional recession like the one in the late 1980s in the oil 
states they say 
the latest data available to the los angeles area chamber of 
commerce showed that in the first quarter of 1990 aerospace jobs 
in the county totaled 270000 down 14800 from the first quarter 
of 1989 yet in the same year the total nonfarm jobs in the 
county rose by 99000 to 43 million 
so that to me indicates that yes weve been having some 
major hits from aerospace but the economy has a little more 
resilience that the naysayers would lead you to believe said 
jack kyser the chambers chief economist 
kyser acknowledged though that many of the aerospace job 
losses came in a category thats hard to replace highpaying 
bluecollar jobs at a time when the cost of housing has skyrocketed 
david hensley of the ucla business forecasting project expects 
that in the next few years californias economy will grow at only 
about the national rate of 2 percent down from the 7 percent 
yearly clip of the mid1980s 
the latest ucla forecast released in march predicted 
california aerospace employment would fall from 361000 in 1989 to 
316000 in 1992 hensley says hed put the number even lower today 
not only is the aerospace pie shrinking but bigger pieces of it 
are being carved up out of state where land and labor costs are 
cheaper 
in the 1980s we opened a lot of facilities out of state 
said richard h dore a spokesman for general motors corps hughes 
aircraft co unit in el segundo still the biggest employer in 
southern california 
hughes employment which peaked at 80000 in 1985 has now 
stabilized at about 68000 after 9000 layoffs last year the loss 
of jobs in southern california though is greater than 12000 
because of the growth in outofstate employment

disastrous and catastrophic are the words most 
frequently used to describe the possible us suspension of chinas 
trade status as a mostfavored nation and thats just american 
businessmen talking 
one senior chinese executive wei mingyi of the staterun china 
international trust and investment corp said it would set 
relations back 20 years in 1970 the two countries did not even 
have diplomatic ties 
the issue may not be decided for weeks president bush must 
decide by june 3 whether to renew chinas mfn status for another 
year and he is expected to act in chinas favor 
but critics in congress may try to overrrule him as part of 
their attempt to ostracize china for its suppression of political 
dissenters symbolized by the army attack on student protestors 
last june 4 the critics argue economic retaliation is an important 
weapon to pressure china into reform 
this means the battle over chinas trade status with the united 
states a crucial part of their relationship could be prolonged 
china and its allies on this issue in the american business 
community have begun readying for the fray only the latest round 
in washingtons debate over whether sanctions help or hurt the 
cause of democracy in china 
the united states imposed limited economic sanctions last year 
but bush has eased several such as a ban on hightech exports 
signaling how seriously china takes the threat to mfn in the 
past two weeks it lifted martial law in the tibetan city of lhasa 
and announced the release of 211 prodemocracy protesters both 
moves were widely seen as an effort to counter criticism of its 
human rights record 
it also disclosed that authorities allowed 238000 people go 
abroad on private business last year which it said was up 11 
percent from the previous year us law bars giving mfn status to 
any country that denies residents freedom of emigration 
american businessmen in beijing and hong kong meanwhile have 
begun a letterwriting campaign to their congressmen urging that 
mfn be extended the american chamber of commerce in beijing issued 
a ninepage position paper arguing that revoking mfn would be 
catastrophic to american business interests in china and american 
consumers of chinese products 
the chambers hong kong branch worried because most uschina 
trade passes through the territory sent a delegation to testify on 
capitol hill this past week 
to revoke mfn would be an act of economic warfare and its an 
act on the chinese people not the chinese government said an 
american businessmen who has lived in beijing for several years 
i was here last june its been a sad time to be here in 
china he said but lets not slam the door on them i know 
many chinese people and i have yet to find one who thinks it would 
be helpful to lift mfn 
mostfavorednation status which the united states grants to 
all but a few nations substantially reduces tariffs on goods 
exported to the united states 
without it the us tariff on chinesemade sweaters would rise 
from the current 6 percent to 60 percent the duty on chinese toys 
would go from less than 7 percent to 70 percent the 
washingtonbased uschina business council has estimated 
toys sweaters and other garments accounted for most of chinas 
12 billion in exports to the united states last year which in 
turn comprised nearly onethird of chinas total exports 
with higher tariffs chinese sales to the united states would 
drop at least 50 percent the council predicted 
most us toy and clothing merchandisers could find alternate 
suppliers but for chinese manufacturers there really isnt 
another market said a western economist in beijing speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
their exports to japan and the european community are growing 
very slowly theyre just not going to sell much of this stuff to 
south korea and indonesia he said 
the impact on the chinese economy could be serious especially 
in the exportdriven coastal areas analysts agree 
china has not said how it would retaliate but at a minimum it 
likely would suspend reciprocal preferential tariffs that could 
affect us wheat farmers and fertilizer and airplane 
manufacturers leaders in the united states 57 billion worth of 
exports to china 
us joint ventures in china fear suspending mfn could create so 
much hostility that they would be unable to operate the american 
chamber of commerce predicted problems in getting chinese 
government cooperation essential to obtain loans contracts raw 
materials and even electricity 
recent commentaries in chinas official media have warned that 
political relations would suffer as well 
the us business communitys outcry over the prospect of losing 
the china market comes in sharp contrast to its usual complaints 
about the slowness and expense of doing business in china 
chinas always been a difficult place to do business 
acknowledged a representative for a major american sportswear 
importer you have to make a lot of trips to the factories to 
guarantee quality you really have to do a high volume to make a 
profit 
but he added china has onefourth of the worlds people even 
if you have to go through a lot of hassles no other place can 
replace china

bond prices rocketed higher friday swept up by 
new evidence that the economy is not overheating and by relief that 
the treasury successfully has completed its quarterly auctions of 
new securities 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond climbed 1 points or 
about 1750 per 1000 in face value its yield tumbled to 866 
percent from 883 percent late thursday 
the big rally reflected a marked change in market psychology 
only two weeks ago yields on 30year treasury bonds were pushed 
over 9 percent because of worries that the econonmy and inflation 
were moving at such a rapid clip that the federal reserve would 
push interest rates higher 
but over the past six sessions a series of new government 
reports have convinced many traders that the economy is growing 
only moderately and inflationary pressures are subsiding 
the markets have had a fairly remarkable six days said 
steven a wood economist for bankamerica capital markets group in 
san francisco 
fridays rally came a day after the completion of the 
governments threeday quarterly refunding in which a record 305 
billion in new notes and bonds were auctioned to finance government 
operations 
in whenissued trading the yield on the treasurys new 30year 
bond tumbled to 864 percent from an average yield of 884 percent 
at auction on thursday 
trading was described as fairly active on friday after the 
government released a pair of economic reports that indicated the 
federal reserve will not be inclined to raise interest rates which 
would erode the value of bonds

percent while many analysts had expected a 02 percent increase

that traders drew from last fridays april employment report 
showing lower than expected job creation and wage inflation 
over the past three days the treasury found investors 
enthusiastic about buying new threeyear and 10year notes and 
30year bonds evidently in an effort to lock in current yields 
because they expected rates to fall 
wood said he thinks there is room for further rate declines next 
week when the government reports on industrial production and 
consumer prices for april 
i think the market has room to do little better and even if 
those reports are wore i dont think it will give all of these 
gains back he said 
but other analysts warn that the market has gained so much 
ground so quickly a reversal could lie ahead 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose by point to point intermediate maturities 
gained by between point and 1 332 points and longterm issues 
rose as much as 1 points according to telerate inc the

measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 861 to 114932

regulators in 11 states on thursday approved 
recommendations aimed at limiting insurance companies holdings of 
junk bonds a newspaper reported 
the restrictions on the highyield highrisk bonds are expected 
to be approved by regulators from all 50 states next month and 
would be binding on insurers the new york times said in an early 
edition of fridays paper 
our motivation is to prevent companies from concentrating 
their investments in these bonds the times quoted terence 
lennon assistant deputy superintendent of the new york state 
insurance department as saying 
lennon headed the subcommittee of the national association of 
insurance commissioners that issued the recommendations 
regulators are proposing to phase in the guidelines over five 
years beginning in 1991 in an effort to prevent a selloff in the 
distressed junk bond market lennon said that schedule shouldnt 
force insurers to dump their holdings 
i believe were taking a very rational position he was 
quoted as saying 
the recommendations would require insurers to set aside higher 
reserves against some of their junk bond holdings to cover the risk 
of possible losses it also would shorten the length of time 
companies can take to accumulate reserves 
the times said it wasnt clear if insurance companies would set 
aside higher reserves to meet the guidelines or sell their 
holdings it estimated insurance company holdings at 50 billion to 
60 billion or about a quarter of the 225 billion market 
the junk bond market has been depressed in recent months in part 
because of federal rules last year that required savings and loans 
to sell their holdings by 1994 defaults by several major issuers 
and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc which dominated 
the issuing and trading of junk bonds also have hurt the market

the worlds largest manufacturer of aircraft 
bolts and fasteners pleaded guilty friday to charges of conspiring 
to falsify test reports on the parts and agreed to pay 18 million 
in penalties and costs 
two former employees of the company vsi corp also pleaded 
guilty to one count each of conspiracy 
the case part of a continuing investigation into wrongdoing in 
the aerospace industry recovered the most money of any action 
stemming from information received under the federal whistleblower 
law us attorney mike mckay said 
under the law three former vsi employees who complained about 
the phony tests will be entitled to share at least 21 million 
mckay said 
for at least 14 years vsi intentionally deceived its 
customers including the us government mckay told a news 
conference vsi did this to cut corners and line its pockets 
parts manufactured by vsi are used throughout the civilian and 
military aircraft industry with about half the companys products 
sold to the government or defense contractors 
mckay said the falsified reports covered millions of fasteners 
including some bought for the b2 b1 and b52 bombers c5b 
transport plane and f18 f15 and f16 fighters 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the fasterners are used on 
virtually every boeing product including civilian airliners 
no accidents have been traced to faulty fasteners said 
assistant us attorney bruce carter who prosecuted the case 
before us district judge barbara rothstein vsi pleaded guilty 
to three counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit 
mail fraud provide false statements to the government and defraud 
the united states the pleas were entered by company vice president 
donald s parker 
james e ryan a former quality assurance manager at vsis 
voishan plant in chatsworth calif and aram marderian a former 
metallurgical laboratory supervisor for voishan also pleaded 
guilty to one count each of conspiracy 
rothstein set sentencing for aug 17 ryan and marderian both 
of whom have agreed to cooperate in further government 
investigations each face up to five years in prison and up to 
250000 in fines 
as part of the plea agreement vsi agreed to pay a fine of 25 
million and the estimated 1 million for the costs of the 
investigation 
to resolve a separate civil whistleblower case vsi will make an 
additional payment of 145 million the three whistleblowers will 
share 15 percent to 25 percent of that mckay said 
vsi a subsidiary of fairchild industries inc and ryan and 
marderian were charged wednesday 
the government alleged that from 1975 or earlier to february 
1989 some required tests were omitted test results were altered 
parts were reworked in violation of specifications and falsified 
reports were given by vsi to boeing northrop mcdonnell douglas 
lockheed general electric pratt amp whitney the defense department 
and other customers 
the stamp of a fictitious inspector 11 was used to indicate 
that some tests had been completed successfully the complaint said 
some bolts that failed tests were delivered with documents 
indicating they met specifications and other required tests 
werent performed the complaint said in other instances tests 
were performed on fewer parts than required 
the mail fraud charges involved phony test results provided to 
boeing at seattle and wichita kan general dynamics in fort 
worth texas and northrop in los angeles carter said 
vsi will cooperate fully with the government and wants to put 
all this behind it parker said 
if anyone out there is not identified as a wrongdoer were 
going to cooperate to bring them to justice he said 
parker said senior management at the company didnt find out 
about the fraud until february 1989 when federal agents raided the 
voishan plant 
but lawrence finegold an attorney for ryan said his client had 
been following an inherited practice that had gone on for years 
carter said evidence in the case indicated quality control 
fraud really was a way of life at the chatsworth plant 
the probe was triggered by a complaint from whistleblower tom 
runion shortly after he left his job in the metallurgical 
laboratory at the chatsworth facility carter said runion and two 
others are plaintiffs in the whistleblower suit that was unsealed 
friday in us district court in los angeles carter said 
he said inadequate voishan parts were found during aircraft 
assembly and installation and were returned to the manufacturer but 
investigators do not know whether there have been any imminent 
safety threats 
investigators learned that of the government and civilian buyers 
of voishan fasteners boeing and northrop corp especially had 
been rejecting substantial deliveries after doing their own tests 
boeing said it has inspected and tested the fasteners and 
retested certain lots of materials it said voishan materials met 
all boeing specifications and requirements and use of them has 
not compromised the integrity of boeing products

amax inc the nations thirdlargest coal 
producer made a 125 billion offer friday for industry leader 
peabody holding co raising the possibility of a bidding war with 
a major peabody investor 
he bid was rejected immediately by hanson industries which owns 
45 percent of peabody and is attempting to buy the rest hanson 
responded by raising its offer for the peabody shares it doesnt 
own 
the remaining 55 percent of st louisbased peabody is owned by 
newmont mining corp of denver hanson in turn owns 49 percent of 
newmont 
hanson in march offered to buy newmonts stake in peabody for 
715 million but under terms of the sale agreement between hanson 
and newmont the companies agreed to consider outside bids for all 
of peabody until the deal with hanson closed 
closing tentatively was scheduled for sometime next month said 
newmont spokesman james hill 
after new yorkbased amax disclosed its bid friday hanson 
immediately increased its offer for newmonts peabody stake to 
7256 million that tops the 7185 million that newmonts stake 
is worth under the amax offer hanson said 
hill said newmonts agreement to sell its peabody stake to 
hanson remained in effect but that the amax bid started an auction 
process for peabody 
it is to ensure that the highest bidder gets it he said 
hanson the us arm of britains hanson plc conglomerate 
acquired its peabody stake in february for about 504 million from 
boeing co bechtel investments inc and the energy company eastern 
enterprises 
although their amaxs bid would benefit hanson by providing 
a premium for the stake which we already own we are determined to 
complete our acquisition of peabody said sir gordon white 
chairman of hanson industries 
hanson industries acquired its 49 percent stake in newmont 
through its purchase of consolidated gold fields plc the british 
gold mining company in 1989 
amax which also is a major aluminum producer has said for some 
time that it plans to increase its coal holdings said spokesman 
mitchell badler 
he said peabody would help boost amaxs already substantial 
reserves in lowsulfur coal which is in demand because it pollutes 
less than highsulfur varieties 
we thought it was a good fit he said 
he said amax envisioned no antitrust concerns in its bid because 
of the fragmented nature of the coal industry an amaxpeabody 
combination would control less than 12 percent of the nations coal 
production he said 
badler said he did not know whether amax would increase its bid 
in light of hanson raising its offer 
newmont decided to put peabody up for sale after it failed to 
carry out a restructuring of the coal company hill said 
newmont took on a heavy debt load in 1987 after it paid out a 
special 22 billion dividend to shareholders to avoid a takeover 
from t boone pickens it has been selling assets to reduce the 
debt and also planned to have peabody issue junk bonds and pass 
along some of the proceeds to newmont hill said 
but that plan fell through when the junk bond market went sour 
last year he said 
in consolidated trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
hanson plcs american depositary receipts rose 62 cents to 
1887 newmont shares rose 62 cents to 46 and amax shares fell 
12 cents to 2525
