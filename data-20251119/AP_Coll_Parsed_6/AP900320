prowestern afghan rebels say they are in 
grave need of us weapons and food and they have attracted 
backers in congress 
were very desperate said mohamad saljuqi of the national 
islamic front of afghanistan or nifa a moderate sunni faction 
among the coalition of mujahedeen rebels i dont know how long 
we can go on 
saljuqis comments in a telephone interview monday from tehran 
iran came as us and soviet diplomats prepare to discuss the 
stalemated war in afghanistan they will explore a possible 
political solution to remove the sovietinstalled kabul government 
from power during a meeting in helsinki finland on wednesday 
saljuqis complaint highlights the growing controversy over the 
10year us aid program to the mujahedeen support in congress has 
been eroding following the soviet military pullout from afghanistan 
last year 
while conservatives believe the united states should increase 
supervision of its aid and make sure it gets to the right groups 
liberals advocate a us cutoff of aid for the rebels coupled with 
an end to soviet aid for the afghan government 
robert peck until june 1989 the bush administrations top 
analyst on afghanistan said in recent congressional testimony that 
the united states had become entangled in factional fighting among 
the mujahedeen and should disengage 
other experts say pakistans secret service which is in charge 
of distributing us weapons to the guerrillas discriminates 
against nifa and other prowestern factions in favor of 
fundamentalist moslem groups 
saljuqi said nifa guerrillas have not received any ammunition or 
other supplies from the united states since last summer the state 
department rejects the complaint saying each of the seven 
mujahedeen groups receives what it should 
but some members of congress are championing nifas cause in 
two recent letters to president bush a group of lawmakers led by 
rep don ritter rpa urged the administration to investigate 
in response to the lawmakers first letter national security 
adviser brent scowcroft wrote in december that the allegations of 
discrimination against certain factions had been investigated and 
to the extent they existed were corrected 
the lawmakers disagreed the picture we are receiving from 
official us government channels appears to be different than 
the many reliable reports fresh from the field that are coming 
from important segments of the afghan resistance they wrote back 
they urged an end to the pakistanis control over the weapons 
and an equitable distribution of military supplies to the most 
strategic combateffective and moderate elements of the afghan 
resistance 
saljuqi said that in order to break the stalemate in the 
fighting against the kabul government his guerrillas need 
ammunition mortar shells and shoulderfired stinger antiaircraft 
missiles 
administration officials say they prefer to look for a political 
solution to the stalemate 
barnett rubin an afghanistan specialist at the congressionally 
funded us institute of peace said nifa has been getting a bad 
deal both from the pakistanis and the saudis he said saudi arabia 
which provides about twothirds of the estimated 700 million the 
mujahedeen got last year does not like nifa because the saudis 
believe it is too close to iran the saudis archenemy 
the situation is further complicated by the continued suspension 
of us food aid to nifa and other guerrillas in western 
afghanistan us officials said monday they are still trying to 
reach agreement with the rebel leaders on an effective monitoring 
system for the program which last year provided about 33 million 
worth of food 
the program administered by the agency for international 
development was suspended last november and resumed once in 
january only to be stopped again last month the officials said 
the united states is concerned that without effective 
monitoring the food mostly sacks of wheat could be diverted by 
rebel leaders and sold for profit

if japan has a national obsession its the cherry 
blossom 
during the first days of spring when the cool of winter still 
envelops much of the nation the coming of the pink mist is 
impatiently awaited 
its progress up the archipelago from subtropical okinawa to 
snowy hokkaido is closely watched 
when the cherry trees bloom millions of japanese young and 
old head to the parks to practice the ancient art of 
flowerviewing a spirited mixture of song sake and with 
luck sunshine 
many companies arrange large and sometimes lavish outdoor 
parties for their employees stalls in the parks sell tasty treats 
from squidonastick to cotton candy 
since the cherry blossoms beauty is a fleeting pleasure 
lasting only a few days careful attention to weather trends is 
required to catch them in their full splendor 
this years official announcement came today the state 
meteorological agency declared that the wait this year should be 
shorter than usual 
flower viewers said one agency official may even be able to 
savor their rice wine before april fools day 
several cherries are already in bloom because the weather has 
been relatively warm he said requesting anonymity in fact 
this year is tied with 1989 and 1966 as the earliest for blossoms 
rumors to that effect had been circulating for quite some time 
evening television news broadcasts already have begun their 
periodic updates on the sakura zensen or cherry blossom front 
line giving special attention to those harbingers of spring that 
burst into bloom earlier than the rest 
signs have been posted at rest areas along the nations highways 
informing motorists of when to expect the local blossoms to be at 
their peak and the public japan highway corp has set up a hotline 
for cherry information 
some 150000 cherry trees grace the 100 or so service areas 
nationwide said motoki mori a corporation spokesman 
the japanese have a very strong fondness for the cherry 
blossom he said its just something about our national 
character 
mori said the front line was still down in the southwestern 
island of kyushu but probably would hit tokyo suddenly 
police meanwhile geared up for the onslaught of picnickers on 
japans normally sedate parks the heaviesthit is likely to be 
tokyos ueno park where 450000 people or 505 people per tree 
viewed the blossoms on a sunny april 2 1989 
a park official said flower viewers already had begun setting up 
for picnics today though only a few trees had blossomed

for a man whose animated classroom lectures 
include leaping onto desktops its no wonder that rice university 
professor dennis huston offers an unorthodox solution to an 
impending teacher shortage 
i think that the answer is some kind of system for drafting 
young people just out of college who are in the process of deciding 
what they want to do said huston an english professor at the 
houston university who was named national professor of the year 
by an education group 
huston shared his ideas during an interview after meeting with 
president bush earlier this year 
we need to put a lot of these kids into the high schools and 
let them teach for one or two years as a kind of service to the 
country said huston 
the education department predicted the annual demand for new 
public school teachers will rise from 128000 in 1988 to 174000 in 
1995 but only 88 percent of the 1988 firstyear college students 
plan to pursue careers in elementary or secondary education 
linda darlinghammond professor of education at the teachers 
college of columbia university said only about threefourths of 
those who prepare to teach actually enter teaching after 
graduation of those who do enter about half leave during their 
first five years she said 
to get more teachers into the classroom huston said new college 
graduates should be selected in a militarytype draft or 
encouraged through propaganda like we once did for the peace 
corps they would teach their college major solely as a service 
to the country he said 
if president bush emphasized how important the draft program 
was to the nation it would work because lots of students feel 
a missionary zeal huston said 
the new graduates would be trained in a special program that is 
only a few weeks long because thats all you need when you know 
the subject matter said huston who joined the rice faculty in 
1969 
he said his teacher draft idea would provide really qualified 
inexpensive labor to schools 
the president is fond of talking about wars on drugs wars on 
this this is a place where we need a draft of a different group 
of people the people who have profited the most from their 
upbringing either by their own initiative or by the fact that they 
were fortunate enough to come out of a successful family said 
huston 
those people owe this society they owe this country the most 
seems to me the least we can expect of them is two years of service 
in a much more important cause right now than war the cause of 
education and it is of course finally in the end selfserving 
the recruits would have the energy and optimism of youth and 
the knowledge of a wonderful education to convey to students in 
high school said huston and he added classroom size could be 
reduced because wed suddenly have a lot more teachers 
the professor of the year program is sponsored by the council 
for advancement and support of education the nations largest 
education association in terms of institutional membership 
including about 2850 colleges universities and independent 
schools 
huston won the title from 500 nominations nationwide he 
received a 5000 cash award sponsored by the carnegie foundation 
for the advancement of teaching 
the council launched the competition in 1981 to recognize 
undergraduate faculty members for their contributions to the lives 
and careers of students since its inception eight other national 
professors of the year and more than 160 finalists have been 
honored

the bush administration is asking congress to 
raise taxes on aviation fuel and airline tickets and allow a new 
airport tax as part of a fiveyear plan for commercial aviation 
transportation secretary samuel skinner included the 22 billion 
proposal in the federal aviation administrations reauthorization 
bill sent to congress on monday 
the plan would add up to 12 in airport fees to a roundtrip 
airline ticket increase the tax on tickets from 8 percent to 10 
percent and hike aviation fuel taxes by 25 percent which also 
likely would be passed along in higher fares congress is likely to 
make modifications however 
it is the first proposal arising out of the administrations new 
national transportation policy which calls for travelers to 
finance a greater share of national transportation systems 
the administration makes a distinction between user fees and 
taxes which president bush has promised not to increase skinner 
acknowledged last week however that transportation budget 
proposals include boosts in both local and federal levies 
the increases would add to an aviation trust fund that the faa 
proposes to tap for 85 percent of aeronautical needs through fiscal 
1995 currently 57 percent of federal aviation costs are covered 
by users via the taxfed trust fund with the remainder from 
general tax revenue 
faa administrator james b busey said the reauthorization bill 
would help meet the growing demand for aviation allow 
modernization of the air traffic control system and increase 
aviation safety 
overall it would boost federal funding for aviation projects by 
73 percent in the next five years busey said 
in addition to the plan for improvements the faa expects to 
spend between 22 billion and 24 billion on operations and 
maintenance over the next five years including salaries of air 
traffic controllers agency budget officials said 
i believe this administration has put forward a comprehensive 
proposal to deal with aviation in the 1990s busey told a meeting 
of airport officials 
if approved by congress the plan would allow airports to impose 
taxes for the first time since the early 1970s 
the maximum initial tax would be 3 per departure with 
travelers who make connecting flights paying at no more than one 
additional airport each way the legislation would give the 
transportation secretary power to increase the maximum tax after 
fiscal 1991 
after the first year collection of the tax would automatically 
decrease other federal funding available to airports some smaller 
regional airports might elect not to levy the fee so it would not 
reduce funding under the federal airport improvement program said 
mike moffet an faa assistant administrator 
each 1 collected in departure taxes would reduce federal funds 
available to an airport by 50 cents improvement funds that were 
freed as a result of the new tax revenues would go into a 
discretionary fund to help airports that need additional money 
moffet said 
if the nations largest 45 airports imposed the ticket tax 
collections would total an estimated 1 billion a year he said 
the collections could be used to obtain bonds for about 10 billion 
in airport projects over the five years 
federal support for airport improvements would total 77 
billion over five years a 28 percent increase over amounts made 
available during the past five years 
other funds under the reauthorization program would include 
135 billion for facilities and equipment programs a 130 percent 
increase over the previous five years and 970 million for 
research and development a 13 percent increase 
the aviation trust fund is expected to have a 76 billion 
balance by the end of fiscal 1990 on sept 30 the spending plan 
would decrease the fund to about 3 billion by the end of the 
fiveyear period officials said

speedier injections of clotbusting drugs to 
heart attack victims improves their chances of escaping permanent 
damage suggesting that ambulance crews can save lives by 
administering this medicine on the way to the hospital a study 
concludes 
even when hospitals are prepared to offer this treatment hours 
may pass before patients reach the emergency ward are evaluated by 
heart specialists and eventually hooked up to lines that drip the 
medicine into their bloodstreams 
the new research supports the growing belief that for this 
approach to work well it must be offered fast perhaps even before 
heart attack victims leave their homes 
the research found that 92 percent of clogged arteries could be 
reopened if the medicine was given immediately as a shot currently 
hospitals administer the medicine as a continuous drip infusion 
which takes longer to set up and is impractical for use by 
paramedics 
in past studies clotdissolving drugs have been about 60 
percent to 70 percent effective in opening up clotblocked heart 
arteries 
the new study meant to simulate ambulance administration of the 
drug tissue plasminogen activator or tpa was conducted by dr 
george r mckendall of rhode island hospital he presented the 
findings monday at a meeting of the american college of cardiology 
they achieved what appears to be a startling patency or 
reopening of closed arteries of more than 90 percent said dr 
carl j pepine of the university of florida this is striking 
mckendall said that ambulance crews in providence will begin 
carrying tpa within a few weeks emergency teams in at least seven 
other cities are already doing this or planning similar programs 
dr c richard conti president of the college of cardiology 
said that in light of the lastest research we ought to think 
about giving the first dose in the home by paramedics 
in the latest study patients with heart attacks were given an 
injection of tpa as soon as they arrived at the hospital doctors 
waited a half hour to mimic an ambulance trip and then set them up 
on a continuous drip to deliver the rest of a standard dose of tpa 
we wanted to see what happens if you give a quick shot and 
then take the patient to the hospital mckendall said it 
suggests that this may be a more effective way of achieving 
patency 
heart attacks usually occur when an obstruction typically a 
blood clot gets stuck in an artery that feeds the heart muscle 
unless the blockage is removed within a few hours a section of 
muscle is starved of oxygen and dies permanently weakening the 
heart 
while tpa and similar drugs are effective they also are risky 
because they can cause uncontrolled bleeding if the bleeding 
occurs in the brain the result can be a crippling stroke 
to make sure that during emergencies the medicines are given 
only to people who truly are having heart attacks the ambulance 
crew typically sends electrocardiogram readings back to the 
hospital over a cellular telephone a doctor there gives 
instructions about what medicines to administer 
several clotdissolving drugs are now on the market and others 
are being tested many studies are under way to determine which is 
the best 
in the united states many physicians consider tpa to be the 
preferred drug this medicine produced through genetic 
engineering costs a hospital about 2300 for a single dose a 
competing drug streptokinase which is made from bacteria costs 
87 
a recent italian study concluded that the far cheaper 
stroptokinase works just as well as tpa however another new 
study also presented at the meeting monday suggests that a 
combination of the two may be the best approach 
dr cindy l grines of the university of kentucky compared the 
combination with straight tpa in 111 heart attack patients she 
found that clogged arteries reopened in 70 percent of those who got 
the combination combined with 58 percent in those getting tpa 
alone 
she said that the combination approach costs only about half as 
much as pure tpa and appears to work better

house republicans are accusing democrats of 
rushing to the floor for a quick vote this week on a tentative 
compromise over competing versions of new childcare legislation 
theyve gone behind closed doors theyve cut their deals 
rep bob walker rpa charged monday now theyre ready to rush 
it to the floor 
the childcare legislation which has been stalled for months 
because of differences among democrats was the object of weeks of 
private negotiations that were continuing today 
democratic leaders who control the house agenda scheduled the 
bill for floor debate wednesday and thursday 
but rep david nagle diowa one of the sponsors told the 
house on monday that not all issues had been resolved and that 
democrats didnt have copies of the bill either 
democratic leaders hoped to work out details of their bill in 
time to seek a special rule from the rules committee today limiting 
floor amendments opponents wanted no limit 
the tentative version worked out among democratic leaders would 
combine elements of competing childcare proposals it would expand 
tax credits for lowincome families and increase funding for block 
grants under title xx of the social security act as well as expand 
head start and create a schoolbased program for before and 
afterschool care 
it would drop a proposed new program of grants to the states to 
subsidize child care which had been pushed by liberals including 
rep gus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education and 
labor committee 
the compromise was expected to face challenges on the house 
floor however from some republicans and conservative democrats 
total cost of the democrats version has been estimated at as 
much as 5 billion a year 
nagle said democrats were seeking resolution of final 
differences over how to provide financial aid to religious 
institutions that provide child care 
republican whip newt gingrich of georgia predicted that 
president bush would veto the democrats plan if it wins passage 
house speaker thomas foley dwash has promised floor action 
and has long said he hoped for a vote by the end of march his 
deadline put pressure on democrats to resolve their differences or 
risk losing entirely on the floor

with todays arrival of spring and the 
observance of national agriculture day its also time for some 
serious economic forecasting 
just in time the agriculture departments seers have unveiled a 
new set of numbers for the nations farmers in 1990 generally 
things are looking pretty good 
not everything will be rosy but usdas latest economic outlook 
made it a lot easier for president bush agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter and other leaders to smile as they pay tribute to 
the nations farmers at a scheduled white house ceremony today 
the picture is subject to change of course theres always the 
possibility of unexpected catastrophe when crops and livestock are 
involved 
combined with continuing strong demand for agricultural 
products currently higher prices due to tighter corn stocks and 
smaller hog inventories have brightened the outlook the outlook 
report said 
the report a digest of one to be issued later in usdas 
agricultural outlook magazine also had some encouraging news for 
consumers this spring 
increasing poultry supplies may push retail prices below last 
summer giving consumers relief from rising pork prices it said 
retail beef prices likely will remain near last years highs 
through the second and third quarters milk and egg prices probably 
will decline in 1990 as recent favorable returns stimulate 
production 
analysts also said the bulk of federal payments which figure 
prominently in annual farm income statistics continue to go to a 
relative handful of larger farming operations 
overall the net cash income of farmers was forecast at 54 
billion to 58 billion this year up from 53 billion in 1989 but 
likely below the record of 572 billion in 1988 previously 
usdas economic research service had put 1990 income in the range 
of 52 billion to 57 billion 
as used by the agency net cash income measures the value of 
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments less 
outofpocket costs commodities sold may actually have been 
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm 
income is expected to be in the range of 45 billion to 49 
billion steady to down 8 percent from last years 49 billion 
previously it was forecast at 44 billion to 49 billion 
economists use net farm income to measure the value of 
agricultural production whether sold or stored in a calendar 
year plus government payments minus all costs including 
depreciation and other factors 
net farm income may drop as feed grain prices ease from the 
spikes caused by the 1988 drought the report said the lower 
prices will dampen the value of the fall harvest much of the fall 
1990 harvest will be sold in 1991 
the report said an analysis of usdas 1988 farm costs and 
returns survey showed that direct payments to farmers have been 
distributed on the basis of production as prescribed by current 
farm law 
of farms receiving direct government payments 32 percent 
received 90 percent of the payments the report said since 64 
percent of all farm receive no direct payments 90 percent of the 
payments go to only 12 percent of all farms 
greg gajewski senior editor of the report said there was no 
surprise in the breakdown of federal subsidies and that the 
pattern fit the trend 
direct federal payments to farmers peaked at about 167 billion 
in 1987 according to the study then dropped to 145 billion in 
1988 and to around 11 million in 1989 as market prices improved 
thus reducing many of the subsidy rates a further reduction to as 
low as 8 billion is expected this year 
the report also said that improved weather has brightened 
prospects for the us winter wheat crop 
early indicators in western europe canada and australia point 
to wheat production gains there as well it said wheat prices 
are falling 
in asia a bumper 198990 rice crop is being harvested with 
record or nearrecord output forecast for china bangladesh 
vietnam thailand and india 
but us stocks are low and the thais are holding stocks back 
for sale later in the year the report added so prices remain 
strong and us exports are slowing

the us antimissile program is destined to 
play a major role in preventing a nuclear war even as the 
superpowers prepare to slash their weapons arsenals a senior 
presidential adviser said today 
the strategic defense initiative known popularly as star wars 
has been under attack by arms control experts as farfetched ever 
since it was unveiled by former president reagan 
but edward l rowny a retired army general who advised reagan 
and now president bush on arms control challenged those critics as 
wizards of armageddon 
in a speech prepared for a defense association rowny said the 
critics foolishly rely on an outmoded approach to deter soviet 
nuclear attack 
that doctrine known as mad for mutually assured destruction 
is based on the theory that a potential aggressor would not launch 
a first strike if its lack of a defense exposed itself to massive 
retaliation 
rowny said the technology of sdi offers a better guarantee 
against soviet or accidental nuclear attack it would use nuclear 
weapons and other advanced technology to intercept and destroy 
ballistic missiles aimed at the united states 
bush is asking congress to boost research spending on sdi by 1 
billion beginning in october to 41 billion 
in the meantime the united states and the soviet union are 
moving closer to treaties to reduce their longrange nuclear 
weapons and their arsenals of tanks and other conventional arms in 
europe 
rowny said a strategic defense gradually becomes more critical 
as these weapons are scaled down he called sdi an insurance policy 
for a treaty to cut longrange missiles by 30 to 50 percent 
with sdi he said a fateful soviet decision to initiate a 
first strike for whatever reason will almost certainly never be 
made should deterrence fail though strategic defense will help 
protect our society 
ussoviet negotiations in geneva on strategic defenses have 
not kept pace with progress in other arms control areas 
in fact rowny said the soviets were using the negotiations to 
try to block the us program 
he said the bush administration had proposed that both sides 
have a strategic defense after signing a treaty they would have 
three years to decide whether to deploy systems that are not 
permitted under the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
rowny was speaking to the american defense preparedness 
association

millions of gallons of oil will be spilled on 
land and water year after year unless the united states changes its 
approach to oil says the wilderness society in a report called 
100 spills 1000 excuses 
the report released monday details the 100 worst spills since 
the exxon valdez accident broke all records when the tanker ran 
aground march 24 1989 dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil 
into prince william sound alaska 
the sad fact is that while the past 12 months have featured a 
number of large and widely publicized spills this has been in 
most respects a typical year said george frampton president of 
the society 
no one has final figures but experts estimate that there have 
been roughly 10000 spills since the exxon valdez tore open said 
the report those spills have caused the loss of 15 million to 20 
million gallons of oil it said 
the past years spills include three in one weekend in june when 
a liberian tanker left a 20foot by 2mile sheen in delaware bay 
del an amoco pipeline spilled 96000 gallons of gasoline at knox 
county ill and 34700 gallons of diesel fuel were dumped from a 
pipeline near newtown nd 
on new years day an exxon refinery pipeline ruptured sending 
567000 gallons of heating oil into the arthur kill waterway near 
linden nj on feb 7 a tanker ran into its own anchor and spewed 
397000 gallons of crude into the waters of huntington beach calif 
the wilderness society said the report is based on its own 
records and those of the coast guard the alaska department of 
conservation the national park service the us bureau of land 
management and world information systems of cambridge mass 
oil is inherently messy business accidents lots of accidents 
will happen said the report 
it said there should be stronger incentives for oil and shipping 
industries to extract transport and refine oil more safely 
stepped up government enforcement of laws relating to oil 
production and the environment and an end to us addiction to 
oil 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house interior 
subcommittee on water and power resources starts hearings thursday 
to continue congress investigation of the exxon valdez spills 
impact 
miller said the hearing will consider the extent of oil 
pollution in alaska due to the valdez future cleanup options and 
whether industry can handle another spill of the same magnitude 
miller plans another hearing next week to look into 
environmental problems associated with operation of the 
transalaska pipeline including corrosion of the pipeline 
congress is working on a liability bill that will determine who 
should pay for future spills the legislation now in a 
housesenate conference committee also would establish regulations 
for handling oil 
the most hotly contested issue is a house proposal to require 
all tankers calling on us ports to have double bottoms within 
seven years and double hulls within 15 years all new tankers would 
have to be built with double hulls 
senate conference committee members want new tankers and barges 
to have double hulls or any alternative that the national academy 
of sciences decides would provide protection 
they also have proposed a phaseout of the existing singlehull 
tanker and barge fleet about onefifteenth of the fleet would be 
retired each year with the oldest and largest going first

secretaries dealt with moving their agendas he said 
joseph califano jr who headed hew from 197779 and margaret 
heckler hhs secretary from 198385 said the former officials 
uniformly supported sullivans campaign against smoking and tobacco 
company advertising practices 
califano the only democrat among them said they agreed that 
he ought to keep going and get even tougher 
we gave him quite a lot of advice heckler said in 
general we like the course hes plotted we also feel he can 
do a great deal more simply because hes captured the attention of 
the american people on the smoking issue and its relationship to 
minorities and women 
sullivan said he intends to use the smoking issue as a platform 
to emphasize the importance of health promotion and disease 
prevention 
the other former secretaries at the meeting were bowen

anyone in that position he lives in bremen ind with his wife

man of integrity a man committed to his family and all the 
people of the nation 
sullivan praised bowens work addressing the aids epidemic

despite predictions of more thefts like the 100 
millionplus raid of the isabella stewart gardner museum many 
museums and galleries have inexperienced poorly paid guards and 
inadequate security systems experts say 
to make matters worse there are only a handful of investigators 
trained to probe such crimes officials said 
guards are considered the weakest link in the security chain 
most are young and receive little better than the minimum wage to 
protect milliondollar paintings and sculptures 
weve got to begin to hire career security people said 
steven keller a security consultant who was brought in to 
supervise security at the art institute of chicago after thieves 
stole three cezanne paintings in 1979 
in israel and some european countries security guards are 
typically highlytrained wellpaid professionals keller said 
its the exact opposite here security guards here are hired 
at the entrylevel and leave their jobs to work at mcdonalds or 
become janitors keller said 
in the robbery early sunday at the gardner museum two men 
dressed as police officers persuaded the two guards on duty to let 
them into the museum then bound them with tape and disabled the 
security system 
the thieves made off with a dozen artworks including priceless 
old master paintings in the biggest theft in modern times since 
the looting of germanys national bank at the end of world war ii 
several of the pictures and at least one rembrandt were cut out 
of their frames which were connected to an alarm system 
the pilfered works included two paintings and an etching by 
rembrandt three paintings and two charcoals by edgar degas one 
painting each by edouard manet jan vermeer and govaert flinck and 
a bronze beaker dating from the chinese shang dynasty 12001100 
bc 
the thieves also tried but failed to take a third rembrandt a 
selfportrait said museum spokesman barry wanger he would not 
give details 
museum director anne hawley said the guards who had worked at 
the gardner less than a year were only doing their job and would 
not be disciplined 
many museums have a lax attitude toward security said robert 
spiel a private security consultant and former fbi agent 
specializing in art theft 
youre seeing a mentality where people assume that because an 
artwork is either too obscure or too famous no one will steal 
it spiel said that leads to a low level of security 
curators and security experts said that as the value of art 
soars at auction houses like sothebys thefts are bound to 
increase as the illegal art market grows to a billiondollar 
international trade 
the average person thinks an art theft is an exotic thing that 
happens once every few years said donald mason a private 
security consultant for museums thats just not so 
mason who headed art theft investigations for the fbi 
nationwide from 1965 to 1976 said when he began he was the only 
agent in the united states assigned to probe incidents of stolen 
art 
eventually he assembled a squad of five agents to probe art 
thefts but the fbi has since disbanded the group 
they said they wanted to concentrate on other things like 
whitecollar and organized crime mason said but a lot of art 
investigations involve both of those 
some improvements may be on the way keller chairman of the 
american society of industrial security said the security 
professionals association has spent the past two years drawing up 
more than 100 guidelines on how to tighten museum security 
the guidelines include such measures as tighter screening of 
potential guards and making alarm systems immune to power failures 
keller said 
compliance will not be mandatory but pressure from insurance 
companies will force most major museums to adopt the measures 
keller predicted 
consultants agreed however that prevention of art theft will 
probably continue to get a low priority 
theres a perception that people who have art stolen can 
afford it spiel said but i think the public is the loser

the 12 works taken from the isabella stewart 
gardner museum in one of the biggest thefts in history were not 
insured and authorities were not optimistic the stolen 
masterpieces would be recovered 
the sad part is this may wind up in a vault somewhere 
unfortunately on valuable art objects the track record on 
recovery isnt really good said fbi agent dennis ocallaghan 
the fbi searched the world monday for the ancient chinese vase 
and 11 paintings and drawings by artists such as rembrandt degas 
and vermeer taken early sunday from the museum 
police put the value of the missing paintings at a minimum of 
100 million the museum said they were worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars and most art experts agreed no exact value can be put 
on the paintings because they have not been on the market for 
nearly 100 years 
mrs gardners collection of paintings books religious 
artifacts sculptures and rare books were only insured for 
restoration and conservation museum officials said there was no 
insurance for theft 
the costs of such insurance would be prohibitive said 
museum spokesman barry wangerit would be more than the operating 
budget of 28 million a year 
futhermore mrs gardners will bars the museum curators from 
buying and installing replacements he said so if we lose a 
painting by theft or another way we cant buy another one 
the two thieves dressed as policeman talked their way into the 
museum by telling the two security guards on duty there was a 
disturbance in the area police said they bound the guards with 
tape and spent the next two hours removing the works 
the crime was discovered when the morning cleaning crew arrived 
the pilfered works included two paintings and an etching by 
rembrandt three paintings and two charcoals by edgar degas one 
painting each by edouard manet jan vermeer and govaert flinck and 
a bronze beaker dating from the chinese shang dynasty 12001100 
bc 
ocallaghan said no ransom demands had been received 
he said he couldnt discuss any leads the fbi might have 
uncovered 
there are sources around the world we would reach out for in 
the effort to recover the works the agent said 
the gardner theft was exceeded only by the looting of germanys 
national bank at the end of world war ii 
the guinness book of world records lists the looting of 
germanys national bank the reichsbank in the spring of 1945 as 
the most lucrative robbery in modern history worth 3 billion in 
contemporary dollars 
guinness also notes that the philippines government has accused 
former president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda of 
pilfering 5 billion to 10 billion while in power 
probably the most celebrated art heist of all time was the 1911 
theft of the mona lisa from the louvre in paris it was recovered 
in italy in 1913 because no price has ever been established for 
the painting the value of the theft has never been determined 
in addition to a bid for ransom speculation about the motive 
for the crime includes a collector paying the thieves to steal what 
the collector couldnt buy 
the works are so famous they are worthless on the open market 
but authorities said it was urgent that the works be found quickly 
the first 48 hours are very crucial and the next two weeks 
said robert volpe a former new york city detective who is a 
private consultant specializing in the recovery of art works if 
nothing happens then we have a very different situation going 
down 
volpe was confident the works could be recovered however 
because of what was taken and how 
its not a smart theft volpe said the pieces are too 
well documented theyre too well known 
the fact that they came in and used violence this is a little 
out of the realm of the normal art thief he said most art 
thieves fashion themselves that they know how to steal

a retired army brigadier general and a former 
air force colonel have enlisted in the fight for passage of 
legislation to open army combat jobs to women for a fouryear trial 
if we do have a test within the army i think finally there 
will be documentation to prove that women can perform as 
competently as men in the infantry and other combat areas 
retired brig gen evelyn foote said monday at a news conference 
sponsored by the national organization for women 
the combat exclusion act approved by congress in 1948 bars 
women in the air force the marines corps and the navy from serving 
in combat positions the army has regulations similar to the law 
women comprise about 11 percent of the total armed forces of 21 
million 
the call for reexamination of the policy has grown louder since 
army capt linda bray led troops fighting panamanian forces during 
the us invasion last december 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo and a senior member of the 
house armed services committee proposed legislation in january 
that directs the army to conduct a test study allowing women 
assignment to combat positions 
although the legislation faces an uphill fight in congress 
officials of now foote and retired col diane ordes called for a 
change in policy starting with passage of schroeders bill

the savings and loan bailout enacted last year 
will fall at least 30 billion and possibly as much as 162 billion 
short of the amount needed to clean up the industry says a 
congressional report 
the bill passed last august provided 50 billion to close or 
sell failed thrift associations through 1992 however 48 billion 
of that will be needed to cover losses at the 383 institutions 
seized by the government through march 5 concluded a report 
submitted by rep bruce vento dminn 
vento is chairman of an 18member house banking committee task 
force tracking the performance of the new bailout agency the 
resolution trust corp 
regulators expect the failure of an additional 225 to 295 sampls 
with losses of at least 32 billion to 40 billion according to 
the report in addition 295 to 325 sampls are weak and may not 
recover on their own it said 
depending on the severity of the losses the shortfall could 
rise as high as 162 billion vento said 
bailout officials however say there is enough money to last 
into next year if theres a shortfall after that money intended 
to cover sampl losses after 1992 could be reallocated to cover 
earlier failures they say

us district judge robert aguilar the 
first federal judge charged with racketeering was acquitted of one 
obstructionofjustice charge but a jury deadlocked on seven other 
felony charges after seven days of deliberations 
justice department prosecutor william keefer said aguilar would 
be retried on the seven charges 
one juror joan mcerlean of san francisco said after mondays 
verdict that the majority felt that the prosecution did not prove 
its case 
there was no motive they could not prove there was a meeting 
of the minds between the judge and anybody else 
aguilar was acquitted of a charge that he improperly approached 
another federal judge samuel conti to seek favorable treatment 
for a friend and creditor ronald cloud in a pending bank fraud 
trial 
the jury reported it could not reach a verdict on the other 
charges us district judge louis bechtle declared a mistrial and 
scheduled proceedings on a possible retrial for june 4 
aguilar did not change expression when the jurys verdict was 
read but puffed his cheeks as if to release tension he declined 
to comment afterward 
defense lawyer patrick hallinan said he was pleased that the 
jury did not buy the governments allegations of racketeering and 
corruption in our courts 
but hallinan said he was disappointed aguilar was not completely 
vindicated 
ms mcerlean said the vote was 93 to acquit aguilar of the 
charge that he used his office as a racketeering enterprise to 
obstruct justice it was the first such charge against a federal 
judge 
however she said nine of the jurors felt aguilar had committed 
one of the illegal acts that was a part of the alleged pattern of 
racketeering helping vera hoff his friend and former legal 
secretary remain a fugitive in mexico where she fled in 1979 
after being sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion 
the hoff allegation was not charged as a separate count of 
obstruction of justice because the fiveyear legal deadline for 
filing the charge had expired when mrs hoff was arrested in mexico 
last year but it was included in the racketeering charge which 
required proof that aguilar had misused his office to commit two 
specified criminal acts within 10 years 
aguilar remains free without bail pending a retrial the 
58yearold judge from san jose who was appointed to the federal 
bench in 1980 by president carter can be removed from office only 
by congress 
aguilars lawyers have accused the justice department of 
targeting him as a liberal who had ruled against the government in 
important cases the department denied any political motivation 
aguilar has issued rulings restricting factory sweeps by 
immigration agents limiting aerial raids on suspected marijuana 
fields and stopping the government from excluding people from the 
country because of homosexuality 
the counts on which the jury deadlocked included two against 
aguilars fellow defendants former teamster leader rudy tham and 
abe chapman an 83yearold exconvict who was formerly related to 
aguilar by marriage 
they and aguilar were charged with plotting to use the judges 
influence to seek a new trial for tham on a 1980 embezzlement 
conviction by having aguilar speak to us district judge stanley 
weigel who was hearing thams case 
aguilar said he only asked weigel about the status of the case 
testimony that weigel largely confirmed aguilar also said he was 
only bragging without foundation when he told a friend in a 
secretly taped conversation that weigel was indebted to him and 
would never reveal their contacts 
aguilar also denied trying to influence conti in clouds case 
the charge on which he was acquitted

chancellor helmut kohl guided his 
allies to victory in east german balloting he hopes the momentum 
will seal his reelection in west germanys vote in december 
but it could be a struggle kohl must balance the fervent hopes 
of east germans eager for prosperity with the worries of west 
germans who fear theyll have to pay for reunification 
the new leadership chosen by east german voters sunday supports 
kohls plans for swift unification with west germany and its 
election handed kohl a victory of his own 
kohl helped create the threeparty alliance for germany that won 
in east germany he advised them in their campaign and barnstormed 
across east germany promising unification would bring east germans 
western affluence 
newspapers in both german states recognized kohls coup 
the real winner is to be found there in bonn said east 
germanys communistrun newspaper the berliner zeitung the 
electorate here is trusting promises made by kohl and his friends 
from the big bonn sister party 
kohls political opponents in bonn made the same observation 
the decisive thought for east germans may have been if we 
vote for kohl the money will flow said social democrat oskar 
lafontaine announcing that hell challenge kohl in west germanys 
elections dec 2 
kohl hopes the momentum will last through the west german 
election 
the chancellor said monday he sees outstanding chances for 
his party when elections for a united germany finally come he 
indicated that would probably be sometime next year 
the latest polls give kohls coalition government a lead of 
about 6 percentage points over the social democrats but the polls 
indicate a close race if kohl loses the support of foreign minister 
hansdietrich genschers free democrats the coalitions junior 
partner 
political experts say that although kohl won an important 
political victory by helping the east german conservative alliance 
get elected theres a chance it could backfire 
after all the happiness and dancing over the results of this 
election we might also be seeing the opening of a pandoras box of 
complications said heinrich vogel head of the federal institute 
for eastern and international studies in cologne 
the real work starts right now this is ground zero vogel 
said in an interview he said the costs of unification could 
tarnish the west german voters views of kohl 
financial and political experts say the process of german 
unification will be complicated and expensive with west germans 
paying most of the bill 
in addition higher unemployment and rising prices for east 
germans are seen as nearly inevitable as the country undergoes 
economic metamorphosis kohl has told east germans his government 
will protect them from economic shock vogel has said this will be 
difficult 
the handelsblatt west germanys most respected financial 
newspaper said the east german election has set the course for 
an investment boom and an economic upswing but this upswing must 
be painstakingly acquired 
east german expectations have put kohls government under great 
pressure the newspaper said a belief in miracles would be of 
little help 
hansjochen vogel head of west germanys social democrats said 
it is too early to count his party out for either the december 
elections or as possible leaders of a united germany 
kohl had set a very high horizon of expectations he said 
by convincing east germans that reunification can be fast and by 
telling west germans it is possible without burdens 
but i think the soberingup will come very quickly he said

tightwire acrobat angel wallenda takes 
the scariest walk of her life today when she steps into an 
examination room to await word on an operation that may leave her 
tied to an oxygen tank for the rest of her life 
surgeons at the city of hope national medical center were 
scheduled to decide today when to start removing the tumorous 
sections of her lungs it could be the next day 
theyre kind of worried because if i wait any longer they 
wont be able to do it at all said angel who turns 22 today 
if they take out too much i wont have any left to breathe 
she was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1987 soon after doctors 
amputated her right leg below the knee they cut away diseased 
parts of both lungs in 1988 leaving her with about half the normal 
capacity 
back then though she was able to carry on with an artificial 
lower leg soon she was back on the wire with her husband steven 
part of the clan that has performed since the 1600s 
the most famous of all the flying wallendas karl the great 
died after a 1978 fall during a performance in puerto rico 
carrying on the tradition is their 3yearold son steven wallenda 
ii who first performed publicly on the trapeze at 11 months 
the family spent monday in a motel room near the hospital in 
duarte a largely residential suburb in the san gabriel valley east 
of los angeles 
she turns 22 tomorrow her 34yearold husband said we 
sure didnt plan it that way it just happened 
angel and steven met in new york almost five years ago she was 
working in an ice cream shop at a westchester county mall where he 
was performing although she didnt learn about his career 
immediately as they chatted 
later she was in the audience as he performed 
he was asking for a volunteer out of the audience she said 
i volunteered 
their working relationship blossomed first their romance later 
i was more fascinated with the wire angel said he asked 
me if id like to learn but before i could he went to jamaica 
when he left i didnt know if id ever hear from him again 
he called of course and the years since have been a storm of 
practices and performances marriage the birth of their son her 
illness and now the latest trip to california for lung cancer 
surgery 
what was billed as her final performance took place early this 
month at mansfield university near the familys home in tioga pa 
angel said her mind was on screwups in the lighting that made it 
hard to perform not on her problems 
the rehearsal went perfect and then everything went wrong 
she said it was like im sitting there saying turn up the 
lights guys come on 
but in the end it was funny we improvised and it made it more 
homey they thought it was part of the act 
the family said at the time that the latest surgery would end 
her career as an aerialist although her husband and son would 
continue the performing tradition 
the best angel can hope for now shes told is a life tied to 
an oxygen tank 
on monday she wasnt so sure so what if she has to breathe 
oxygen she already performs with a prosthetic leg 
who says i cant do it angel wallenda said

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange fell 
sharply to close below the 31000point mark tuesday while the 
dollar inched up against the japanese yen despite a raise in the 
bank of japans official discount rate 
the dollar closed at 15365 yen up 010 yen from mondays 
close it opened lower at 15270 yen and ranged between 
1524515375 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 45605 points or 148 
percent ending the day at 3080719 its lowest level since jan 
9 1989 
the index had regained some of its earlymorning plunge by the 
end of the morning session but it fell back in the afternoon as 
markets were discouraged by the yens meager recovery following the 
bank of japans discount rate hike dealers said 
japans central bank announced it raised its official discount 
rate by 1 percentage point to 525 percent effective immediately 
on monday in its thirdlargest singleday crash of 135320 
points or 415 percent the index ended at 3126324 its lowest 
since jan 20 1989 dealers attributed the plunge to a stronger 
dollar and the looming discount rate hike 
the official discount rate or the interest rate the central 
bank charges on loans to commercial banks and which has a strong 
impact on other interest rates had been 425 percent 
in currency dealings the market was little affected by the 
discount rate hike as it had been already factored into the market

schools throughout west virginia 
reopened after a nearly twoweek teacher strike some held 
counseling sessions to ease tensions between teachers who walked 
out and those who crossed picket lines 
i suspect theres a degree of animosity and maybe even 
bitterness for those who walked across the picket line bob 
brown executive director of the west virginia federation of 
teachers said as teachers returned monday if they can live with 
themselves we can live with them 
the 3000member federation and the 16000member west virginia 
education association began the states first teacher strike on 
march 7 another 3000 teachers in the state are not represented by 
unions 
the key issue in the strike was wages the average teacher 
salary of 21900 is higher than only south dakota and arkansas 
the national education association says 
teachers voted overwhelmingly sunday to return to work without 
settling the wage issue after legislative leaders promised to ask 
gov gaston caperton to call a special legislative session to 
consider a longterm plan for west virginias education system 
the strike had spread to 47 of the states 55 counties and 
affected more than 150000 pupils 
in some counties all the teachers stayed off the job but in 
others some teachers crossed the picket lines in raleigh county 
in southern west virginia for example about 30 percent of 900 
teachers crossed picket lines said dwight dials the county school 
superintendent 
state and union officials would not estimate how many teachers 
crossed picket lines 
on monday in berkeley county in the easternmost part of the 
state the county ministerial association sent counselors to the 
schools to help teachers work out any feelings of animosity toward 
each other said county school spokeswoman susan loveland 
most schools delayed classes for a few hours monday so teachers 
could prepare for their students no major problems were reported 
its over but its not over said lewis county school 
superintendent joe mace well do the best we can for the kids 
for the rest of this school year you try to mend some fences and 
put back the pieces 
some of the biggest headaches were from teachers trying to 
reschedule student trips that were canceled and determining what 
time would have to be made up school officials said 
the june 8 end of the school year will be extended two days to 
make up last thursday and friday when state school superintendent 
hank marockie canceled all classes in the state for a coolingoff 
period 
the average striking teacher will lose an estimated 660 in pay 
and the 6 percent of their pay that normally would be paid into the 
financially troubled teachers retirement system marockie said 
the finance chairmen of the state senate and house of delegates 
said monday there is no more money available for teacher pay raises 
delegate george farley dwood said the special session is 
going to raise a lot of expectations 
teachers received a 5 percent raise in february and a twoday 
special legislative session last week found 27 million for an 
additional 4 percent raise the teachers union said the latest 
legislative package was not enough 
we skimped and scraped to put together a 27 million package 
that made nobody happy and if we did that again it would not make 
them happy farley said 
a statewide poll released monday meanwhile showed the teachers 
enjoyed broad public support 
the poll of 405 state residents taken during the strike showed 
nearly twothirds opposed threats by state officials to fire 
striking teachers who did not return to work by monday the margin 
of error was 49 percentage points 
i think caperton sees how serious we can be and i dont 
think teachers will be hesitant to walk again said middle school 
teacher karen ash in bunker hill berkeley county

a powerful bomb carried by two 
suspected sikh extremists exploded at a busy intersection today 
blowing them apart and killing four bystanders police said at 
least 17 people were injured 
there was no immediate indication what the bombs intended 
target might have been but home minister mufti mohammad sayeed was 
due later in the day for a tour of punjab the rich farming state 
where sikh militants are waging a violent secessionist campaign 
the blast damaged vehicles and shattered windows of houses 300 
feet away police spokesman ashok kapur said the dead included two 
schoolchildren and three of the injured were in critical condition 
he said 
the explosion occurred in the most densely populated residential 
neighborhood of this joint capital of punjab and haryana northern 
states that abut each other most of the citys 500000 residents 
are government workers 
kapur said the two sikhs who were carrying the bomb on a motor 
scooter were believed to be hardcore terrorists he said 
identification was difficult because the bodies were blown to 
pieces 
their motor scooter was destroyed and parts of their bodies were 
flung 90 feet away he said press trust of india said 15 vehicles 
were damaged 
the last extremist attack in chandigarh occurred in october 
1988 when a senior government official was assassinated 
united news of india said sikh extremists had killed two people 
elsewhere in the state since monday night 
the killings came after a sharp rise in extremistlinked 
violence with police blaming militants for the killings of 26 
people across punjab during a 24hour period ending monday night 
the extremists in their eightyearold secessionist campaign 
have usually targeted residents in remote villages and travelers on 
deserted country roads 
sikh militants have killed more than 400 people mostly hindus 
and moderate sikhs since january to dramatize their demand for a 
separate state they want to carve out of punjab 
the separatists claim the sikh community is culturally and 
politically discriminated by the hindudominated government sikhs 
are in a slight majority in punjab but nationwide they comprise 
just 2 percent of indias 880 million population hindus account 
for 82 percent

twentieth century fox is banning film critics 
gene siskel and roger ebert from advance screenings of its movies 
over remarks they made during a tv interview about the companys 
flick nuns on the run 
from now on they can catch up with our films in the 
theater bob harper the film studios director of marketing 
said in an interview published monday in the hollywood reporter 
ebert a pulitzer prizewinning critic for the chicago 
suntimes responded i guess you could call it thumbs on the 
run 
the move marks the first time that ebert and siskel a chicago 
tribune film critic have been barred from special screenings of 
movies released by major studios said andi sporkin spokeswoman 
for buena vista television which produces siskel amp ebert 
buena vista is a subsidiary of the los angelesbased walt disney 
co 
ms sporkin said things got blown out of proportion after 
the duo lightheartedly said they didnt like nuns on the run 
during an appearance friday on live with regis and kathie lee 
in new york to tout their upcoming preacademy awards show 
siskel and ebert both gave the film a thumbs down last week 
on their television show and also panned the movie in syndicated 
columns ms sporkin said 
nuns on the run is a film about two gangsters who come into 
possession of a large sum of money which various bad guys want 
they dodge into a convent slip into nuns clothing and try to pass 
themselves off as sisters 
fox contends siskel and ebert overstepped their bounds on friday 
because they attacked not only the film but also the marketing 
campaign and reviewers who liked it 
during the broadcast ebert held up a newspaper ad for nuns on 
the run with a prominent quote from the village voice calling it 
the funniest anticlerical transvestite movie of the decade 
he then bantered with siskel about the fallacy in the ad 
yeah this is 1990 ebert said how many other 
transvestite anticlerical comedies have there been so far in this 
decade 
but fox officials were not amused 
we have no problem with them not liking the movie harper 
said but they were on the show promoting their preacademy 
awards show and to our thinking were acting in the capacity of 
entertainers not critics 
ebert said he isnt sure just what fox meant by that 
you might also wonder if this isnt a good way to get some 
extra publicity for the movie he said in todays editions of the 
suntimes other than that i have to ask wheres their sense of 
humor 
both critics predicted the ban wouldnt really affect them and 
would eventually be rescinded 
well just buy tickets and go to the movies for our newspaper 
reviews ebert said the only difference will be on our tv 
show well still review the fox movies but people wont be able 
to see any clips thats not very smart for fox so i wouldnt 
expect the ban to last too long 
invariably they are rescinded and no one learns anything 
about eight million people watch the siskel amp ebert program 
weekly ms sporkin said

the tokyo stock exchanges key index dived sharply 
again today as neither currency market intervention nor a interest 
rate boost by the central bank stopped the weakening of the 
japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which plunged 135320 
points or 415 percent on monday in its thirdlargest singleday 
fall tumbled another 45605 points or 148 percent today 
its closing of 3080719 was the lowest since 3067839 on jan 
9 1989 so far this year the index has dived more than 8100 
points or almost 21 percent 
meanwhile the dollar closed at 15365 yen up 010 yen from 
mondays close of 15355 yen it opened at 15270 yen and ranged 
between 15245 yen and 15375 yen its closing was the highest 
since 15369 yen on march 12 1987 
stock market investors were discouraged by the yens failure to 
recover after the bank of japan announced a 1 percentage point 
increase in its discount rate its charge for loans to commercial 
banks said yoshiro inoue an analyst with nomura securities co 
generally higher interest rates make a countrys currency more 
attractive to investors 
the stock index fell in the morning regained some ground on 
word of the impending rate increase then fell again in the 
afternoon after the increase to 525 percent was announced 
the index fell back again as the discount rate hike failed to 
boost yen buying inoue said 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said today the central 
banks preemptive discount rate increase would control latent 
inflationary pressures without appreciably slowing japans economic 
expansion 
he said however the raise would not provide a quick fix for 
recent instability in the foreign exchange and stock markets 
although he indicated the rate hike would help both in the long run 
inoue said the size of the raise was appropriate and the end of 
the long wait for the action meant elimination of one factor for 
instability 
but the stock markets stability is totally subject to 
currency movements from now on inoue said 
the rate increase had been expected since after national 
elections on feb 18 
the discount rate which has a strong impact on other interest 
rates had been at a historic low of 25 percent for nearly nine 
years until may 1989 when the central bank made the first of 
three increases that brought it to 425 percent by last december 
traders said that surprisingly market players bought the dollar 
even afdter the discount rate increase 
the market reaction to the discount rate hike was minimal 
because the rate increase already had been factored into the market 
for such a long time said mitsui bank trader shinichi kato 
he said many market players who anticipated the raise by keeping 
short or oversold dollar positions bought back dollars as soon as 
the rate actually was raised 
traders estimated that the bank of japan sold some 200 million 
today in efforts to prop up the yen the bank does not comment on 
its exchange market activity 
since many market players saw japans interest rate as having 
climbed as high as it could it discount rate increase will help 
the yen and the stock market recover in the long run kato said 
but there is nothing in the current economy to reverse the 
dollarbuying trend and prompt yenbuying 
the price of the benchmark no 119 japanese government bond 
ended trading at 8627 points down from mondays close of 8650 
its yield was 729 percent up from 724 percent

president mikhail s gorbachev will implement a 
drastic economic reforms in july that include selling stateowned 
enterprises and overhauling governmentset prices to reflect market 
forces media reports said 
the package of 17 measures aimed at ending a dire economic 
crisis is expected to be painful and unpopular the interfax news 
agency said 
the agency also quoted a close aide to gorbachev as saying the 
crisis is so prfound that the soviet union might no longer object 
to massive foreign aid soviet officials previously have appeared 
offended when western officials raised the possibility of aid 
i would like to underline that such aid would be in the 
interests of not only the soviet union but of the entire world 
community western countries included but they do not seem to be 
fully aware of that said the aide economist nikolai petrakov 
last month petrakov revealed that the soviet leadership had 
dropped its long opposition to private ownership of factories 
after his inauguration to the powerful new presidency on 
thursday gorbachev said he was planning harsh economic reforms 
that would require great sacrifices western analysts speculated 
that gorbachev felt he needed the enhanced power of the new post 
before going got ahead with a program that could provoke serious 
unrest 
economists say the soviet economy suffers from too much money in 
the hands of the people who have nothing spend it on 
central economic planning has proved a failure and the people 
want for food and consumer goods of decent quality 
prices are set by central planners and many are unrealistically 
low with state subsidies for housing transport and essential 
consumer items 
interfax said in its report monday that the reform package would 
take effect july 1 and provide for the selling off of many 
governmentowned factories it said another aspect was a plan for 
making the ruble convertible 
economists say real pricing and a move toward a ruble whose 
value is determined by world market forces would bring about 
immediate inflation accompanied by high unemployment 
but doing nothing could be more dangerous coal miners unhappy 
with the lack of improvement since their paralyzing strike last 
summer have threatened renew walkouts 
interfax said the plan was drafted by 60 soviet economists and 
modeled on the one that took effect jan 1 in poland which decided 
to leap directly into a market system in hopes of shortening the 
painful period of transition after decades of communist rule 
empty stores have been stocked and poles no longer have to 
stand in long lines to buy what they need the zloty has become 
partially convertible thanks to a massive western aid program 
which probably is impossible to duplicate for an economy the size 
of the soviet unions 
but unemployment is on the rise in poland and experts say it 
reach 1 million or more as inefficient enterprises are closed 
petrakov said the soviets hope to eliminate excess rubles by 
giving consumers the opportunity to buy goods that have been 
illegal or impossible including shares of stock houses 
apartments and garden plots 
western sources say that in recent weeks soviet trade 
organizations have not paid their bills giving the impression that 
the country is running out of hard western currency 
petrakov also hinted there might be a shakeup in key economic 
ministries now that gorbachev has become official leader of the 
government instead of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
petrakov did not say whether ryzhkovs job was in danger but 
the prime minister is responsible for the economy 
heads of ministries and departments are displaying sheer 
irresponsibility in all questions petrakov said 
gorbachevs economic plan will include decisive measures 
deadlines and the names of the people in charge he said

premier li peng opened chinas annual legislative 
session today by proclaiming that china will never yield to 
attempts to undermine its socialist system and communist rule 
in a speech of more than two hours to the nearly 3000 deputies 
of the national peoples congress li also said the state would 
exert more control over the economy but ease austerity measures 
that have stalled economic growth 
lis state of the nation address sets the tone of the 15day 
meeting which is expected to show unwavering support for the 
partys hardline political and economic policies 
li began by noting the soulstirring struggles of 1989 
including the victory over the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the governments term for the studentled prodemocracy movement 
crushed by military force in june 
he said the prodemocracy movement was led by hostile forces 
trying to turn china into a bourgeois republic dependent on 
capitalist countries 
only socialism can save china li said if china turns 
toward capitalism a polarization of classes would inevitably 
arise the overwhelming majority of people would sink into poverty 
and social unrest would prevail for a long time to come fraud 
degeneration and crime inherent in a society of exploiting 
classes would spread unchecked 
li wearing a western suit was only occasionally applauded as 
he plodded through the speech sitting behind him on the podium 
were about 150 senior officials including communist party general 
secretary jiang zemin president yang shangkun and members of the 
party politburo 
for the second straight year senior leader deng xiaoping did not 
appear at the opening session also missing was zhao ziyang the 
former party chief who was purged from all party posts last year 
after being accused of supporting the prodemocracy movement zhao 
is still a deputy from sichuan province 
li said china had also achieved victories last year in 
straightening out the economy and improving the ideological 
orientation of its citizens 
he said austerity measures instituted in late 1988 had succeeded 
in halving inflation while bringing economic growth down to a 
manageable level 
but he acknowledged that chinese industry is beset by rising 
debt factory closures and stockpiling of goods and said steps 
will be taken to ameliorate the present contradictions 
the steps include relaxing curbs on the money supply increasing 
loans to enterprises adjusting interest rates for loans and 
savings deposits increasing investment in key industries and 
housing and engaging in water conservation and other public works 
projects 
gross national product should rise by 5 percent in 1990 up from 
38 percent last year he said 
on the ideological front he said the influence of bourgeois 
liberalization thinking and repulsive social phenomena still need 
to be done away with 
universities and colleges must stress education in 
marxismleninism and maoist thought he said adding that 
intellectuals should become one with workers and peasants and 
the arts and television must be oriented towards serving 
socialism and the people 
he urged the government to boost agricultural production this 
year and to revive the stagnant economy 
but there was little hint of the marketoriented reforms 
initiated by deng in 1979 and responsible for chinas rapid 
economic growth through the 1980s 
chinas open door policy will continue li said but cautioned 
that china must maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat 
the trend of westernstyle democracy with a multiparty system 
on foreign affairs li said china is naturally concerned about 
the drastic political changes that have taken place in eastern 
europe but hopes to maintain normal friendly relations with 
those countries where communist rulers have been ousted in the past 
yeart 
he said china hopes for improved relations with the united 
states and the west he criticized western sanctions imposed after 
the chinese troops killed hundreds of civilians last june in 
breaking up prodemocracy protests 
china never yields to external pressure and no one can 
succeed in isolating china siad li 
he warned that china will not ignore the proindependence 
movement on taiwan and said china is on guard against those trying 
to make hong kong a base for overthrowing chinas socialist system 
during the 15day session the congress will approve a basic law 
that hong kong would observe after it reverts to chinese rule in 
1997 
it will also pass an amendment to a law guaranteeing that 
foreign enterprises in china will not be nationalized

morris bailey leaned forward from his 
lawn chair to his walker from the shade into the sun so his eyes 
could take in both diamonds at once 
baseball said the 74yearold bailey breaking into a wide 
grin real baseball is on the way 
and so it is after 32 days an agreement reached sunday night 
ended the lockout that had delayed the start of spring training for 
major league players 
teams immediately began assembling at their training camps to 
prepare for the start of the season which will begin april 9 a 
week later than scheduled exhibition games are scheduled to begin 
monday 
many fans who have had to make do with less also made plans to 
be on hand today when major league training camps open across 
arizona and florida 
in that regard bailey 74 was ahead of most he was assured 
tickets to the san francisco giants home contests at scottsdale 
stadium because his grandson catcher mark bailey was invited to 
training camp after playing with the new york mets triplea 
tidewater affiliate last season 
and starting tomorrow said morris bailey a springfield 
mo native who retired from his job as a production supervisor in 
a factory 15 years ago and took to wintering in scottsdale some 
nine years ago mark will start drawing bigleague pay 
the agreement between majorleague players and owners guarantees 
a minimum majorleague salary of 100000 a figure that only two 
decades ago was the subject of salary disputes by superstars such 
as willie mays 
another highlight of the pact was the owners promise of salary 
arbitration eligibility for 17 percent of the players with between 
two and three years of service 
with the lockout over few could restrain their joy at the 
prospect of again hearing the crack of the bat or gasping over a 
shoestring catch 
on the other side from bailey of those same diamonds at indian 
school park giants manager roger craig crossed one lizardskinned 
cowboy boot over the other uncrossed them and cast a more 
dispassionate eye on the minor league prospects working out on 
either side of them 
but like bailey he couldnt wait for the real thing when the 
major league stars took the field 
spring training is something special you could mark time by 
it he said his voice lowering until now 
you hear the bats popping the leather popping you smell the 
grass we had that he said but it didnt seem the same 
will hill understood he showed up at municipal stadium in 
nearby phoenix with 10yearold son marlos in tow monday to pick 
up tickets the 42yearold postal inspector and his son have made 
oakland as contests a rite of spring for the past five years and 
discouraged as both were by the lockout they werent about to let 
it go now 
little league kept him busy hill said but as soon as we 
heard this thing ended i knew wed wind up here today 
about a dozen others dotted the stands for the same reason and 
if the sounds of lawn mowers buzzing and sprinklers hissing wasnt 
quite as reassuring as the thwack of bat it seemed like the next 
best thing 
im still so mad i could burst 71yearold bernie bates 
said her hand resting on husband warrens shoulders but were 
suckers for baseball thats why were here

ozarks in august 1988 he spent 500000 renovating it and put on a 
halloween party attended by nearly 300 guests that year 
but since then he has abandoned his plan to turn the unusual 
structure into a luxury hideaway for the elite because he doesnt 
think the leaky cave home would be a suitable hotel peterson 
lawyer charles medley said medley said he had advised peterson 
against discussing the case 
in june 1989 hay called petersons lawsuit frivolous he said 
peterson had fallen out of love with the cave and that the suit 
was a case of buyers remorse more recently hay has refused 
to discuss the lawsuit 
during the mid1980s hay converted a series of caverns into the 
10000square foot fivebedroom fivebath bomb shelter with 
goldplated fixtures on bathroom equipment a kitchen with all the 
conveniences and other lavish digs 
outside are a manmade pond a helicopter pad and an expansive 
front deck with a jacuzzi 
but entering the cave visitors are sprinkled by what appears to 
be raindrops from the overhanging rock eave an indication of 
bigger problems inside in winter the droplets turn to icicles 
caretaker gerald causse said 
the cave is cold damp musty causse has set out dozens of 
plastic buckets and bottles of all sizes to trap the water that 
pours through the epoxylined roof huge sheets of plastic are hung 
to direct the flow and prevent flooding of the twotier tiled great 
room during heavy rain 
when you try to dry this place up it just gets worse he 
said my biggest headache is kicking buckets emptying buckets 
and slipping emptying buckets is a daily chore and when its 
raining you might as well sit up here 
in summer the battle is with mildew causse said and every 
cranny attracts lizards and creepy crawlers 
larry crane director of the state assessment coordination 
division said the cave house was valued at 17 million for tax 
purposes in 1989 
but that the value could drop as low as 150000 for 1990 crane 
said and the reality is that there are major water problems and 
that the cave house itself has little value if any

although the outcome of wednesdays 
presidential election is a foregone conclusion with the incumbent 
the only candidate a strong sense of political uncertainty has 
gripped taiwan 
president lee tenghui seems certain to win a sixyear term from 
the electoral college but the election may not end the political 
crisis that has enveloped taiwan in recent weeks 
lee 67 is facing pressure from the opposition democratic 
progressive party and the public to quickly scrap a political 
system largely dominated by elderly politicians from mainland china 
and give taiwanese a greater say in choosing their leaders 
lee also is facing an intense struggle within his ruling 
nationalist party where his rivals would like to dilute his power 
by changing from a strong presidency to a cabinetled government 
he has fallen into a den of wolves and is in the wilderness 
no wonder he often prays these days what else can he do the 
countrys most respected political magazine the journalist said 
in an editorial on the devout christian president 
indeed taiwan has resembled a threering political circus in 
the weeks leading to the electoral college vote 
this island of 20 million people witnessed an unprecedented 
challenge to lees candidacy from within his own party 
the challenge was triggered by lees decision to nominate his 
personal aide as the party candidate for vice president instead of 
chiang wego the sole surviving son of the late nationalist 
strongman chiang kaishek 
many aging nationalist politicians who fled to taiwan with 
chiang kaishek after losing the civil war to communist forces in 
1949 view his son as the main standardbearer of their unlikely 
dream to one day return victoriously to the chinese mainland 
the crisis was diffused only after eight nationalist elders 
intervened and convinced the partys old guard to drop plans to 
offer a rival ticket at the electoral college meeting 
but dissatisfaction with lee remains strong within the party and 
many nationalist leaders would like to increase the powers of the 
cabinet at the expense of the presidency 
lee a native taiwanese had no power base of his own when he 
was elevated to head of government two years ago after chiang 
chingkuo the eldest son of chiang kaishek died and four decades 
of family rule ended lee has managed to remain at the top largely 
because of his widespread public support 
meanwhile the presidential vote has led to intense public 
opposition to the electoral college which is dominated by 
politicians elected on the chinese mainland in 1947 who have not 
faced reelection since the elderly deputies remain in office in 
support of the claim that the nationalists are still the legitimate 
government of all china 
a majority of the lawmaking legislative yuan also is comprised 
of aging nationalists 
on sunday the main opposition party organized the largest 
protest in taiwan since the lifting of 38 years of martial law in 
1987 more than 20000 people protested the continued dominance of 
the electoral college by the elderly deputies 
about 5000 students staged a rally today at a downtown park for 
the second straight day to demand the dissolution of the electoral 
college nearly 50 of them were on hunger strike to press the 
demands and one was hospitalized with stomach problems the 
protest was significant because taiwan students rarely get involved 
in politics 
lee today responded to the outcry for democratic change by 
agreeing to convene an emergency conference of political and other 
leaders to discuss changing the countrys political system there 
was no elaboration on what changes he might have in mind and no 
date was specified top opposition officials said the conference 
would occur in may or june 
political observers said lee could not act on change until after 
his confirmation by the electoral college whose members are wary 
of any democratic change that would lessen their power 
we dont know what lee plans to do he never speaks out 
said chang chungtung professor of history at national taiwan 
university 
the president may not have clear ideas about the future 
redistribution of power and democratic reforms yet chang said 
even if he does he cannot speak about it before he consolidates 
his power

gov joseph ada said a fetus is a human being 
in signing a bill creating the most restrictive us abortion 
statute but abortion rights advocates already are challenging the 
measure 
janet benshoof an american civil liberties union lawyer 
immediately violated the law by telling women in a speech where to 
go to have an abortion and the territorys attorney general who 
personally opposes the measure pressed charges 
territorial attorney general elizabeth barrettanderson says 
prosecuting the case will be a heavy burden but a 
responsibility of her job 
benshoof made a court appearance tuesday guam time but 
superior court judge ramon v diaz said he could not hear the case 
because he did not feel he could render a fair and impartial 
decision 
benshoof is scheduled to be arraigned today 
the law which passed despite a ruling by barrettanderson that 
it is unconstitutional makes it a thirddegree felony for a person 
to perform or help in an abortion seeking or having an abortion or 
soliciting someone to have an abortion are misdemeanors 
the law also sets a referendum during the nov 6 general 
election for residents of this pacific ocean island about 1500 
miles east of the philippines to decide whether to keep the law 
in my heart i believe that a fetus is a human being ada 
the republican governor said in signing the bill which prohibits 
abortion except when the mothers health or life are endangered 
benshoof said she immediately violated a provision of the law by 
advising women in a speech at the guam press club later in the day 
to go to hawaii to have legal abortions 
i was very specific in my breaking of the law benshoof 
said the information that i gave which is now a crime came 
from the honolulu yellow pages 
barrettanderson filed a misdemeanor complaint charging benshoof 
with violating the ban on soliciting someone to have an abortion 
benshoof faces up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine if convicted 
its a matter of public record that i advised the guam 
legislature that in my opinion the bill was unconstitutional by 
operation of the supreme courts decision in roe v wade 
barrettanderson said later in a statement 
my advisory role has now shifted to one of enforcement this 
is a heavy burden but i will enforce this statute to the 
extent that the law allows 
benshoof who went to guam to try to persuade ada not to sign 
the bill was not arrested but appeared in court voluntarily 
guams 21member unicameral legislature unanimously approved the 
bill march 8 after archbishop anthony apuron threatened in an 
interview with a television reporter to excommunicate any roman 
catholic senator who voted against it all but one of the senators 
is catholic as is ada however most of the senators said they 
were unaware of the threat 
among those hailing the new law was the national right to life 
committee 
this is great news group spokeswoman nancy myers said in a 
telephone interview from her washington office the people of 
guam are largely prolife as reflected by the unanimous vote in the 
legislature and they have made a strong statement

human rights advocate natan sharansky today 
criticized israels censorship of reports on soviet immigration 
saying it was hurting efforts to settle the new arrivals 
sharansky a former soviet refusnik was joined by an official 
of a resettlement agency in complaining about excessive censorship 
the ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed march 
1 amid mounting arab protests the influx could lead to more jewish 
settlement in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip home 
to 17 million palestinians 
sharansky who heads the soviet jewry zionist forum said today 
some selfcensorship might be needed to ensure the security of the 
immigrants 
but he said we need more support from world jewry and to 
make bureaucrats work more effectively we need more public 
pressure we cant do it under conditions of censorship 
sharansky and other israeli activists have said the jewish state 
is not preparing enough housing and jobs for the arriving soviets 
gad benari spokesman for the jewish agency which shares 
responsibility with the government for resettling immigrants said 
his group appealed to prime minister yitzhak shamir to have the 
censorship guidelines limited to two issues longterm immigration 
projections and new transit routes 
the process of fundraising especially in our operation 
exodus campaign for the soviets depends a great deal on a constant 
flow of accurate information about the immigration benari said 
we are already having difficulties 
operation exodus aims to raise 200 million in each of the next 
three years from jews in the united states and europe 
in early march israels military censor declared all material 
on the immigration of soviet jews had to be submitted to the censor 
prior to publication 
yossi olmert head of the government press office said today 
despite that the broad wording of the censorship rule it was 
actually limited to two items the number of immigrants and routes 
of getting to israel 
american jewry knows full well we are speaking of a big drama 
a big operation olmert said whether the number is x or y 
isnt necessarily the most important item right now 
the immigration surge began last year when 12000 soviet jews 
came to israel spurred by eased exit policies in the soviet union 
and tighter us immigration rules israeli leaders have said they 
expect up to 750000 soviet immigrants this decade 
arab groups have protested the influx and the islamic jihad for 
the liberation of palestine said last week it would target airlines 
and airports involved in the immigration 
on monday the 46member organization of the islamic conference 
issued a statement in saudi arabia calling on arab states to use 
all possible means and methods to prevent soviet jews from moving 
to the occupied territories 
the arab outcry began after shamir said in midjanuary the wave 
of immigration required the land of israel a large and strong 
israel palestinians interpreted the statement as meaning israel 
intended to keep the occupied territories which were captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
shamir later said the immigrants were not being directed to the 
territories

chancellor helmut kohls cabinet today 
agreed to begin scrapping special benefits for east german settlers 
in an attempt to stop them from flooding into west germany a 
government official said 
the decision is aimed at encouraging east germans to stay home 
and help rebuild their country and to relieve the burden east 
german resettlers are putting on west german social services 
about 500000 east germans have settled in west germany in the 
past 14 months and the kohl government is under increasing 
political pressure to stem the continuing influx 
the cabinet move came two days after east germanys first free 
election in which a conservative alliance allied to kohls party 
won the winners are still negotiating on forming a coalition east 
german government that will help set the pace for unifying the two 
germanys 
the bonn government official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said that as of july 1 west germany will no longer 
have a special program for helping east germans who move west 
it was not immediately clear whether the decision means the 
settlers will receive absolutely no special benefits but a closing 
of dozens of reception centers appeared to be in the offing 
the government official said details would be released later in 
the day 
as part of the current program east germans register for 
special benefits such as unemployment and they also receive help 
in finding jobs and housing they also are put up at special 
reception centers as they look for housing 
the exodus has seriously bled east germanys economy and is 
straining west germanys own housing and job markets 
in sundays elections east germans gave 48 percent of the vote 
to a conservative coalition actively backed by kohl that promises 
quick unification after the victory kohl appealed to east germans 
to stay home he repeated the message monday night on west german 
television 
please stay home the chancellor said in an interview with 
the zdf network unpack your bags go back to the factories and 
offices and help in building up the country 
a new zdf poll released hours after east germanys election said 
only 13 percent of west germans still welcome their compatriots 
from the east now that they have freely chosen a government the 
poll showed 43 percent of west germans have no understanding for 
the continued exodus and more than half want to cut aid to the 
immigrants 
bremen one of the 11 west german states said monday it would 
not help east germans find housing the local government said its 
camps for east germans were overflowing and it would accept only 
thos who find their own housing 
bremen mayor herbert schmalstieg urged the federal government to 
close reception centers for the refugees and send back all east 
germans who cannot be housed by local communities 
last week the governors of all 11 west german states asked the 
federal government to cut benefits to stop the influx 
kohl told zdf that a monetary union between the two countries 
would come soon certainly before the end of the year he wants 
west germanys powerful mark to replace east germanys weak 
currency to prop up east germans buying power and induce them to 
stay home 
the chancellor said he hoped east germanys parliament would 
vote to merge with west germany under a provisison provided by west 
germanys constitution 
but i dont think the subject will be on tomorrow kohl said 
the conservatives victory was seen as a political triumph for 
kohl who campaigned hard on their behalf 
the threeparty coalition led by east germanys christian 
democratic union a sister party of kohls own party of the same 
name swept to victory by promising a quick monetary union and 
rapid unification 
but the alliance failed to gain an absolute majority in the new 
400seat parliament and will need to find a coalition partner to be 
able to govern the conservative alliance ended with a total of 193 
seats 
lothar de maiziere the christian democratic union chief likely 
to become east germanys new premier on monday offered to form an 
alliance with the leftleaning social democrats a move backed by 
kohl 
but the social democrats heavy losers in the election but still 
the secondstrongest party with 87 seats spurned the offer 
a threeparty centrist liberal alliance supported by west 
germanys free democrats the junior coalition partner in kohls 
government indicated it was ready to negotiate an alliance the 
liberals hold 21 seats in parliament

lithuanias president denied kremlin 
accusations that his baltic republic plans to seize state 
enterprises and sell them to private owners and called a harsh 
warning from moscow a negotiating ploy 
vytautas landsbergis speaking before the republics parliament 
on monday said he believed that the increasing tension between 
moscow and vilnius was part of the difficult beginning to talks 
on lithuanias independence 
in a nationally televised broadcast late monday the soviet 
government warned lithuania not to errect customs posts introduce 
its own currency or take over moscowrun factories without kremlin 
permission 
the announcement did not say what would happen if lithuania 
ignored the warning but soviet troops in the past day have carried 
out military maneuvers in the republic that lithuanians say are 
aimed at intimidation 
landsbergis said moscows statements were based on mistaken 
information according to television editor eduardas potashinskas 
who monitored the session 
it is not true that we are going to pass stateowned 
enterprises to private owners landsbergis was quoted as saying 
lithuanias parliament voted on march 11 to secede from the 
soviet union and restore the independence it enjoyed before being 
forcibly annexed in 1940 along with the other baltic states 
estonia and latvia 
four days later the soviet parliament declared the decree 
invalid but also did not specify measures moscow might take to 
prevent lithuanias succession 
i regard the statement as a difficult beginning of 
negotiations as an exchange of opinions that sometimes widely 
diverge and sometimes coincide landsbergis was quoted as saying 
in moscow egidius bickauskas a lithuanian legislator said 
president mikhail s gorbachev told him and other lithuanian 
representatives about the warning when he met with them for 30 
minutes late monday 
bickauskas and lithuanian legislator vaidotas antanaitis 
delivered a letter from landsbergis rejecting gorbachevs deadline 
which expired monday for returning to the soviet fold 
gorbachev has said he is willing to carry on a respectful 
dialogue with lithuanian representatives 
the kremlin on monday accused lithuania of trying to undermine 
its links with the rest of the soviet union which it said could 
have pernicious consequences for the national economy 
the soviet statement ordered police the kgb and customs agents 
to resist any attempts by lithuania to change the existing customs 
regime it also directed the management of soviet enterprises and 
agencies in lithuania not to hand over authority to local bodies 
the announcement said the government was especially concerned 
about atomic energy plants in lithuania and ordered the guard over 
them increased 
moscow said it sympathized with lithuanias strivings for 
greater sovereignty but this should be pursued only with strict 
observance of soviet laws and taking into consideration the mutual 
interests of the peoples of lithuania and other republics 
landsbergis said his government agreed with aspects of moscows 
statement including the benefits of retaining strong economic ties 
many lithuanians say they expected moscow to punish the republic 
by imposing an economic blockade and depriving it of fuel and raw 
materials but the kremlin on monday did not threaten such measures 
moscow leaders have also said they have ruled out the use of 
troops to force lithuania back into the soviet union 
however a spokesman for the lithuanian nationalist movement 
sajudis lionginas vasiliauskas said in moscow that 10 truckloads 
of soviet troops were moved monday from kaunas about 60 miles from 
vilnius to a military post just outside the capital 
residents said monday that the military maneuvers carried out 
over the weekend appeared over but radio vilnius said it had 
reliable information that its broadcasts to foreign countries 
had been blocked by radio moscow 
a loud hum could be heard during a radio vilnius broadcast 
monitored in washington on monday night 
lithuanian activist eduardas potashinskas said he thought most 
lithuanians would take the kremlins warning calmly 
we say the soviet empire is showing its teeth he said from 
vilnius but we think they cant threaten lithuania well be 
calm well fall and get up but well go on 
soviet television has shown several programs in the last two 
days focusing on discontent among lithuanias ethnic minorities 
who comprise about 20 percent of the republics 38 million people 
late monday the nightly news program vremya showed an 
antiindependence meeting in the lithuanian port of klaipeda at 
which one speaker said we dont want to live in bourgeois 
lithuania the baltic port is valuable to the soviet military 
a vremya anchorman also read an appeal from a demonstration 
sunday in vilnius that drew tens of thousands of ethnic russians 
and poles 
the appeal addressed to gorbachev said hypocritically and 
arrogantly the interests of many thousands of people who are 
categorically against being torn from the peoples of the ussr are 
being ignored

the district attorneys office bought a 
chinatown clothing factory used undercover police to run it and 
determined that organized crime has a stranglehold on the garment 
industry the new york times reported today 
the police who supervised 25 garment workers in the noisy loft 
factory found that mobaffiliated trucking companies were shaking 
down clothing manufacturers 
the investigators gathered evidence against two organized crime 
families the newspaper said no charges have been filed but 
authorities said evidence will be presented to a grand jury 
the evidence we have so far turned up shows that organized 
crime has a monopolistic stranglehold over trucking companies and 
the truckers are the lifeblood of the citys garment industry 
manhattan district attorney robert m morgenthau told the times 
threats and extortion demands by trucking representatives were 
secretly recorded during the setup unidentified investigators 
told the newspaper 
the trucking employees told the undercover agents which trucker 
would have the sole right to move their goods the newspaper said 
prices were not negotiable 
if the company used another trucking company it would still 
have to pay the one designated by the organized crime figures the 
times said 
records of 10 garment district truckers were seized jan 30 
unidentified officials said seven of the 10 are controlled by 
thomas gambino who has been identified by law enforcement 
officials as a captain in the gambino crime family and that two of 
the others are affiliated with figures in the lucchese crime family 
thomas gambinos attorney michael rosen said suggestions that 
gambino was connected to criminal activity were hysterical 
accusations by people in law enforcement who have to justify their 
existence the times said 
thomas gambino 60 is the son of the late carlo gambino 
reputed founder of the crime family that bears his name the 
gambino organization is said to be the most powerful organized 
crime group in the nation law enforcement officials believe it is 
now headed by john gotti 
thomas gambino is married to catherine lucchese the daughter of 
the late thomas lucchese who is said to have founded the lucchese 
crime family 
the district attorneys office paid 25000 for the garment 
contracting company in chinatown with sewing machines and other 
equipment said michael g cherkasky an assistant district 
attorney in charge of the inquiry 
the company which operated for most of last year sewed skirts 
and jeans and delivered them to jobbers or manufacturers who 
provided the fabric the firm lost 10000 last year 
the firms business was run by six state police officers state 
investigators were used instead of city police officers to reduce 
the chances that an undercover agent would be recognized cherkasky 
said 
cherkasky said he expected a grand jury will hear evidence of 
extortion pricefixing and racketeering in several months

two funeral directors left a casket with a 
body inside at a state social services office to protest government 
reimbursement rates for indigent burials 
pj kane and mark ferries who work with different sheridan 
funeral homes said they meant no disrespect to the deceased they 
said the ploy was needed to get the attention of the department of 
public assistance and social services which sets the limit for 
indigent burial expenses 
the two men left the casket at the office for two hours friday 
kane said the department will pay up to 995 for the burial of 
anyone who was receiving aid under the wyoming public assistance 
and social services act he said 995 doesnt come close to 
covering the cost of a burial 
we will not turn anybody away from a decent burial he said 
but being in private business we cannot buy a cemetery lot pay 
for burial costs and a vault out of our own pockets 
many wyoming counties cover the difference between the state 
limit and the actual expense however sheridan countys indigent 
burial fund has apparently run dry and county officials say there 
wont be any more money coming to cover the costs 
state social service officials the county attorneys office and 
the state attorney generals office all told the funeral directors 
to file a lawsuit to get the law changed 
the rev ray moss who accompanied the funeral directors and the 
casket to the office said the woman whose body was in the casket 
had no family in sheridan and her estate would not cover the cost 
of a burial

used to aid democracy in poland and nicaragua to support 
antiapartheid groups in south africa secretary of state james a 
baker iii said 
in washington a us official confirmed that the bush 
administration is seeking ways to aid the african national congress 
through the national endowment for democracy 
in a briefing sunday to reporters traveling with the secretary 
to namibia for its independence celebrations baker said the 
endowment may be employed to encourage democracy nonracial 
democracy in south africa 
the fund was created in 1983 and used most recently in nicaragua 
to support parties opposed to the sandinista government it also 
financed polands solidarity movement in its struggle against the 
former communist government 
its a little bit too early to tell how the endowment 
process would work in south africa baker said he added that the 
endowment itself would decide how to dispense funds in south africa 
a coalition of american black leaders has asked baker to give 
financial aid to the african national congress the main black 
nationalist group fighting whiteminority rule in south africa 
bakers suggestion of the endowments involvement appeared to be a 
response to the request to aid the anc 
the national endowment for democracy created by congress during 
the reagan administration is a publicly chartered but publicly 
and privately funded organization whose leadership includes the 
heads of both the republican and democratic parties the us 
chamber of commerce and the aflcio the group gives grants to 
organizations which can further democracy in other countries

they are mostly male and single the majority 
are minorities they have little education and many have histories 
of mental illness all are homeless and the census bureau aims to 
count as many of them as it can today 
the homeless are people and they deserve to be counted the 
rev del maxfield of denver said this morning on nbcs today 
show 
maxfield was critical of some advocates for the homeless who 
have opposed the census effort i think it is irresponsible of us 
as service providers and as advocates for the homeless to sit back 
now after we try to keep these people in the forefront all year 
long and now tell them to go back in the shadows 
mitch snyder of washingtons community for creative nonviolence 
has led the anticensus effort 
members of snyders group protested in front of the commerce 
department this morning carrying signs saying like grains of 
sand the homeless cant be counted and you cant count the 
homeless a pile of sand had been dumped in the street outside 
the department 
a number of and by itself isnt helpful i think it is 
politically naive not to understand that coming in with a small 
number is going to be misused its going to be used to try and 
drive down appropriations snyder said on cbs this morning 
i think that the politicians will do whatever they want to do 
regardless of whether or not they have specific information i 
think we as care providers and especially local government will 
do positive things with these figuresits their the homeless 
right as american citizens to be counted chicago shelter operator 
rick roberts said on the same broadcast 
the government needs to know about everyone and this is a 
chance for the homeless to say look we exist were part of this 
country cynthia taeuber special assistant for selected 
populations at the census bureau said monday 
tonight and early wednesday morning up to 15000 census workers 
will visit missions and shelters walk the streets and look down 
alleys they will even wait outside abandoned buildings to see if 
anyone emerges in the morning 
where possible workers will ask some basic questions too but 
they wont disturb sleeping people or those in no state of mind to 
be interviewed 
the plan is to take the measure of the homeless in a more 
thorough count than occurred a decade ago when census workers 
simply visited shelters and missions 
directing aid to the homeless has foundered on a lack of 
knowledge as estimates of their number vary from 250000 to 3 
million 
because of problems in finding all the homeless and concerns 
about worker safety taeuber admits that she expects the tally to 
be conservative 
officials already know something about the homeless through a 
survey of 1704 homeless people at soup kitchens in 20 cities taken 
by the urban institute 
the survey with a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points found that 81 percent of the homeless surveyed 
were men compared with just under half of the general population 
about 46 percent of the homeless were black 41 percent were 
nonhispanic whites and 10 percent were hispanic in the general 
population blacks make up about 12 percent and hispanics 8 percent 
about 55 percent of homeless had never married compared with 22 
percent of american adults overall fiftytwo percent of all 
homeless had completed high school compared with 81 percent of all 
american adults 
almost 20 percent of the homeless reported a history of mental 
hospitalization and onethird had been patients in a detoxification 
or alcohol or drug treatment center the survey found 
todays 27 million special count involves looking for the 
homeless in every city of 50000 people or more the census bureau 
also asked smaller communities if they have a homeless populations 
if local officials said yes ceusns workers will go there and make 
a count 
the bureau doesnt plan to announce a homeless population 
figure instead it will report that it found so many people in 
shelters so many in missions so many in flophouses so many 
walking or sleeping on the streets and so forth 
from about 6 pm to midnight workers will visit public and 
private emergency shelters hotels and motels used to shelter the 
homeless and other hotels costing less than 12 per night 
from 2 am to 4 am census workers will travel the streets 
checking places where homeless people may be found after that 
until about 8 am workers will wait outside abandoned buildings 
where homeless people may live 
because of safety questions the decision was made not to enter 
abandoned buildings even though people may be sleeping in them

that would allow all soviet citizens to travel abroad freely 
sending the measure to the supreme soviet for debate the official 
news agency tass said 
under provisions of the bill permission will not be required 
for soviets to leave and return either for short trips or 
permanent residence abroad tass said 
a passport for traveling abroad will be issued for a period of 
five years to whoever applies for it tass said the time 
abroad will be determined by the citizen himself 
only state security considerations criminal proceedings or 
incarceration could prevent a person from being issued a passport 
the news agency said 
additionaly access to classified materials would allow the 
soviet government to deny an individual a passport for only five 
years tass said 
a citizen may lodge an appeal with any authority up to the 
ussr supreme soviet against a refussal to issue a foreign 
travel passport tass said 
the bill was introduced by fyodor burlatsky a supreme soviet 
deputy and wellknown political commentator who called it a 
major indicator of democratization in the soviet union 
committee members said they would insist that the bill be 
adopted at the current session of the supreme soviet legislature 
which ends in late april 
members also warned against delay in solving issues related to 
the passport bill including rules on exchanging money and buying 
airline tickets 
unless flying on the staterun airline aeroflot or its joint 
ventue partner pan am soviets seeking to travel abroad must pay in 
hard currency 
under newly introduced tourist exchange rates a 1000 airline 
ticket would cost a soviet traveler about 6000 rubles on a foreign 
airline the aeroflot and pan am flights are sold out for more than 
a year in advance 
last year 235000 people left the country for permanent 
residence abroad and that 2 million soviets took short trips 
abroad including 300000 travelers to the west burlatsky said

union members who sue their union for 
allegedly denying fair representation are entitled to a jury trial 
if they also seek monetary compensation the supreme court ruled 
today 
we hold that the constitutions seventh amendment entitles 
such a plaintiff to a jury trial justice thurgood marshall wrote 
for the court in the 63 decision 
justices anthony m kennedy sandra day oconnor and antonin 
scalia dissented 
lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair 
representation usually are tried before judges without juries such 
suits generally seek to end some asserted unfair treatment or to 
force a union into taking some action 
but ruling in a case from north carolina last year the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals said a jury trial can be demanded 
when monetary compensation such as back pay is part of the relief 
sought 
other appeals courts had ruled differently 
todays decision resolving the issue is a victory for 27 truck 
drivers who in 1983 sued local 391 of the teamsters union 
the lawsuit stemmed from the drivers transfer from various 
locations to the mclean trucking cos terminal in winstonsalem 
nc after the transfers the 27 were laid off and recalled on 
several occasions 
the drivers contend that mclean breached a collectivebargaining 
agreement by manipulating recall procedures so it could give other 
drivers preference and that local 391 failed to represent them 
fairly in the resulting grievances 
the suit seeks among other things compensatory damages for 
lost wages and benefits as a result of todays ruling the suit 
now will reach a jury 
in a separate jurytrial decision the court unanimously 
reinstated a lawsuit by a black machinist from north carolina who 
said he was fired because of his race 
john s lytles suit also alleged that he was given an 
unfavorable job reference because he had filed a discrimination 
claim against his former boss 
todays ruling broadens the right to a jury trial in lawsuits by 
those who claim their civil rights have been violated 
lytle was fired in 1983 by schwitzer turbochargers in arden 
nc a subsidiary of household manufacturing inc 
he accused the company of racial bias in violation of two civil 
rights laws a 19th century statute first used to protect freed 
slaves and a 1964 law 
a federal judge ruled for the company and denied lytle a jury 
trial 
the high court today said lytles seventh amendment rights were 
violated 
the cases are chauffeurs teamsters and helpers vs terry 
881719 and lytle vs household manufacturing inc 88334

the country but agents say theres only so much they can do to 
protect themselves 
the dea and fbi which posted the reward havent named a 
suspect in the blast however the fbi has issued a nationwide 
alert for jeffrey a matthews 23 a drug suspect who allegedly 
threatened the dea after he was indicted thursday 
there have been no warrants issued yet for anyone in the 
explosion but we are following some good leads fbi spokesman 
brian kenscel said monday 
matthews halfbrother john lewis ciganek 22 gave himself up 
sunday in the florida keys and was questioned about the bombing

around the world have been told about the bombing but no new 
security measures have been taken

the agent in charge in minneapolis jim braseth says his office 
hasnt gotten any threats nor has it stepped up security 
in indianapolis david h mcdougal the resident agent in 
charge said that while the bombing appears local this just 
shows that it is a war 
in yakima wash dea agent in charge robert dreisbach said his 
office had taken certain security precautions as a result of fort 
myers and continuing threats to all dea offices from 
drugtrafficking organizations he wouldnt elaborate 
the bombing along with threats from colombian drug dealers and 
the slayings of agents around the world shows the agencys limits 
in protecting itself the dea acknowledged 
agents probably will be more careful miami dea spokesman john 
fernandes said but he said surrounding dea offices with armed 
guards for instance wouldnt work 
we cant shut ourselves off behind an iron wall fernandes

gov l douglas wilder of virginia called on 
his fellow democrats today to embrace the conservative economic 
principles he has adopted as the nations first elected black 
governor 
in presidential elections our candidates must take the plunge 
into the waters of americas new mainstream wilder said in a 
speech prepared for delivery to the national press club he said 
democrats should return to their heritage of opposition to high 
taxes and spending and warned that they had let republicans take 
those issues away from them 
wilder also urged democrats to stop fighting each other long 
after primary battles are decided 
were doing the other partys dirty work for them and it 
must stop if we are to ever again be more than mere guests at 1600 
pennsylvania avenue he said 
since his historymaking election in november 1989 wilder has 
been one of the hottest properties in the democratic party much in 
demand as a speaker 
he issued his call for unity at a party dinner in chicago last 
week and is a featured speaker on the agenda of the democratic 
leadership council meeting in new orleans later this week 
for many democrats wilder represents a mainstream alternative 
to jesse jackson who has twice run for the partys presidential 
nomination from a base of overwhelming support within the black 
community 
but during his first months as governor wilders politics have 
been as conservative as jacksons are liberal 
in his press club speech wilders emphasis was on economic 
development and tough anticrime measures 
i was pleased that the legislature passed an administration 
supported bill calling for the death penalty in certain 
drugrelated murders he said also citing legislation requiring 
criminal background checks for wouldbe buyers of automatic weapons 
wilder warned democrats that they cannot afford to 
underestimate or ignore the economic and housing needs of citizens 
living beyond our cities and suburbs 
americans everywhere want to hold the line on spending and on 
taxes there was a time when democrats were elected by campaigning 
against big government and high taxes but for too long we have let 
the other party take these issues away from us indeed we have 
allowed them to hammer us with these issues

the state supreme court ruled that cocaine 
possession is a crime of moral turpitude that raises questions 
about a persons basic honesty 
in its 41 ruling monday the court said a past conviction for 
cocaine possession might be used in legal proceedings to imply that 
a person would lie under oath 
any involvement with cocaine contributes to the destruction of 
an ordered society the court said in taking cocaine possession 
off the short list of crimes it considers selfdestructive but not 
harmful to others 
selfdestructive crimes including simple possession of 
marijuana bookmaking and public drunkenness cannot be used 
against people to convince juries in future court proceedings that 
they might be basically dishonest 
the decision reversed a 1987 ruling that cocaine possession was 
not a crime of moral turpitude and it could not be used to 
challenge a defendants truthfulness on other matters 
the change of heart on the states high court was directly tied 
to the justices view of cocaine 
the drug cocaine has torn at the very fabric of our nation 
associate justice jean toal wrote in the majority opinion 
families have been ripped apart minds have been ruined and 
lives have been lost it is common knowledge that the drug is 
highly addictive and potentially fatal 
associate justice ernest a finney dissented saying that the 
same reasoning could just as accurately be applied to alcohol 
nicotine and marijuana in the hands of abusers 
the legal point about cocaine did not affect the outcome of the 
trial that brought the issue before the court all the justices 
conceded there were other reasons to question the basic honesty of 
jimmy major a florence county drug dealer convicted of selling 
crack and distributing the drug within a mile of a school ground in 
1988 
the court affirmed majors conviction overruling his claims 
that a prior conviction was improperly entered into evidence

the government said today it will 
close an israeli mission that has been operating in colombo since 
1984 and it gave israeli officials one month to leave 
sri lanka severed diplomatic relations with israel after the 
1967 arabisraeli war 
president ranasinghe premadasas predecessor junius r 
jayewardene invited the israeli government to open an interest 
section in 1984 because israel provided military and intelligence 
assistance to help against a tamil secessionist campaign 
jayewardenes decision was criticized by arab nations and 
members of the nonaligned movement but he defended the action by 
saying israel was the only country that responded to his appeal for 
aid 
todays statement said premadasas decision to close the israeli 
office was the fulfillment of an election promise made before he 
took office 14 months ago 
sri lanka will resume diplomatic relations with israel once 
she recognizes the palestine liberation organization as the 
legitimate representative of the palestinian people withdraws from 
all occupied palestinian territory and agrees to participate in an 
international conference on the middle east convened by the un 
the statement said 
ori noy head of the israeli interest section in colombo could 
not be reached for comment 
the interest section operated under the auspices of the us 
embassy a us embassy official refused to comment on the closure 
order 
an interest section which operates under the flag of another 
country is a step below full diplomatic relations 
after the israeli interest section was set up israel sent 
agricultural experts to help in northcentral sri lanka scores of 
sri lankan soldiers maimed in the tamil insurrection were sent to 
israel to be fitted with artificial limbs 
tamils who make up 18 percent of the population began fighting 
in 1983 alleging discrimination by the majority sinhalese who 
control the government and the military sinhalese make up 75 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
some tamil guerrillas have acknowledged receiving support from

the dutch government is 
negotiating for the return of hundreds of art works that ended up 
in moscow museums after they were sold illegally to the nazis in 
world war ii officials said today 
the art works worth between an estimated 79 million to 105 
million are part of the konigs collection of 2200 drawings by old 
masters such as rembrandt van rijn peter paul rubens titian 
tintoretto and albrecht durer the works disappeared during the 
wartime occupation of the netherlands 
we have strong indications that about 500 drawings have been 
stored in the pushkin museum in moscow and the hermitage in 
leningrad said koos de jong of the netherlands office for fine 
arts a government agency charged with care of the dutch states 
huge art collections 
we have asked the soviet authorities to cooperate with us in 
locating the collection and in returning it to the netherlands 
de jong said 
de jong said that the soviet union has expressed willingness to 
return the drawings to the netherlands from where they were taken 
in 1941 by german scouts during world war ii many art works were 
taken from occupied europe for the private collections of third 
reich leaders 
the drawings were sold to german buyers by the rotterdams 
boymans van beuningen museum de jong said adding it was unknown 
whether it had been a forcible sale 
the museum acquired the full collection from a dutch bank that 
liquidated in the months before world war ii the bank had bought 
the 2200 drawings from dutch financier a konigs when he ran into 
financial trouble in 1931 
the drawings sold to the germans ended up in a museum in dresden 
and presumably were taken from there in 1945 by soviet occupying 
forces de jong said 
under a declaration signed by the four wartime allies all 
transactions with the nazi government were voided de jong said 
we base our claim on that declaration he said adding that he 
hoped the art would be returned to the boymans van beuningen museum 
tomorrow but it could also take decades from now

investigators looked for clues today 
in the wreckage of an apartment where a shoeboxsized package bomb 
killed a man who had just moved to florida a week before 
the victim 70yearold sherwin william finlay was returning to 
his apartment late monday with his wife and daughter when the blast 
occurred at about 8 pm 
the family stepped over the package in front of the apartment 
and went inside their firstfloor apartment authorities said 
he came back out picked it up and it exploded said 
police spokesman steve weintraub 
according to witnesses the package resembled a shoebox and was 
wrapped in brown paper it apparently was not sent through the 
mail weintraub said adding you cant tell theres no package 
left 
the blast was powerful enough to blow out the roof overhang of 
the twostory apartment building weintraub said 
willi ellison agent in charge of the jacksonville office of the 
us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the bomb was 
more or less a homemade device 
he said the remains of the device would be sent to the atf 
laboratory in atlanta for analysis 
investigators do not believe the explosion is related to recent 
mail bombings in alabama georgia and jacksonville which led to 
two deaths 
at this point i dont think there is a connection but were 
looking into all aspects ellison said 
authorities knew of no suspects or motive for the bombing the 
fbi was investigating but had no comment late monday 
finlays wife dorothy 67 and 35yearold daughter gay lynn 
meek were not injured the daughter was from illinois said 
ellison he said the finlays were from missouri but he didnt know 
exactly where 
theyve been here since dec 1 said weintraub i dont 
know if theyre down here to see if they wanted to live here or 
what 
according to the yearbook of the missouri highway department 
finlay was a highway engineer from gravois mills mo who retired 
10 years ago 
the family reportedly moved into the apartment complex about a 
week ago and neighbors knew little about them 
philip brown who lived in a nearby apartment said he was in 
his living room when he heard the blast 
i ran outside and all i could see was smoke he said 
thats when i saw someone lying under the stairs and heard a 
woman screaming

foreign leaders and diplomats streamed 
into windhoek today transforming the sleepy city into a 
miniunited nations as namibia counted down the final hours before 
independence 
seventyfive years of south african rule was to end with a 
speech by south african president fw de klerk before the south 
african flag was lowered for the last time and replaced by the red 
green and blue banner of a new nation 
un secretary general perez de cuellar was to swear in former 
resistance leader sam nujoma as namibias first president marking 
the midnight transition of africas last colony into its youngest 
state 
this is a great time it means we have freedom we are going 
to celebrate all night said nicholas van wyk 21 a hotel worker 
nujomas southwest africa peoples organization swapo had 
waged a 23year war to oust the south africans who captured the 
former german colony on africas southwest coast during world war 
i 
in december 1989 south africa agreed to grant the huge arid 
territory of 13 million people independence under a regional peace 
plan that also calls for cuba to withdraw its 50000 soldiers from 
neighboring angola by mid1991 
in november swapo captured 57 percent of the vote in free 
elections 
representatives of dozens of nations attending todays 
celebrations were also using the occasion for some 
behindthescenes consultations with the united states soviet 
union and others holding an elaborate series of meetings 
among the foreign guests attending the celebrations were us 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze egyptian president hosni mubarak libyan 
president moammar gadhafi the leaders of at least 10 african 
nations and the foreign ministers of britain west germany 
romania indonesia and other nations 
shops and main streets were festooned with namibian flags as 
workers put final touches on podiums banners and other 
decorations excited youngsters put up flags and decorated walls 
with murals depicting peace and prosperity in the new nation 
tens of thousands of namibians were expected to take part in the 
celebrations which include fireworks choirs and traditional 
dancing that was likely to last through the night 
a parade through downtown windhoek was expected to draw some 
50000 people wednesday morning 
shevardnadze told nujoma that gaining independence was just the 
first challenge facing the new nation and that namibia would have 
to work hard to avoid problems confronting other african nations 
the main work lies ahead we all know from experience and 
especially in fellow african states that there is often a more 
difficult struggle in development than in working toward 
independence he said on his arrival 
south african archbishop desmond tutu a leading antiapartheid 
activist said he hoped namibian independence would help speed the 
end of apartheid in south africa 
it is exciting to be here in namibia at this period in time 
it means a lot to us that a country can achieve independence in the 
face of such elements against them he said 
many namibians expressed hope that the new nation would solve 
past racial differences and overcome the economic and political 
problems facing many poor african nations 
other african countries have had disappointments after 
independence i hope we have learned from those economic and 
political mistakes said simon ekanjo a student 
some in the white minority expressed concern about the new black 
government but said they wanted to support the new nation 
said barney van der schynn a 41yearold businessman the 
economy could suffer and changes arent easy but we couldnt keep 
carrying on the way we were independence should have come 
earlier 
security for visiting guests was tight with police blocking off 
streets around the hotels where foreign delegations were staying 
windhoeks modest airport was thronged with police and security 
officers as officials prepared for the arrival of about 100 planes 
bearing guests 
sirens began wailing at dawn today as motorcades transported 
visiting leaders and diplomats across windhoek 
baker had six separate meetings planned today including talks 
with perez de cuellar and shevardnadze 
among other issues baker and shevardnadze expected to discuss a 
peace plan for angola which has suffered 15 years of civil war 
between the sovietbacked marxist government and ussupported 
insurgents 
the independence date was chosen to mark the 30th anniversary of 
the sharpeville massacre when 69 unarmed demonstrators were 
shot to death in south africa while protesting apartheid laws in a 
black township south of johannesburg 
the day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the 
people of namibia but also with the people of south africa said 
hifikepunye pohamba a swapo member who will become the home 
affairs minister in the new government 
namibia for decades has had the same apartheid laws of racial 
segregtion as south africa although most were scrapped in recent 
years

president bush urged congressional leaders 
today to enact his 800 million aid package for panama and 
nicaragua saying it would help increase pressure for democracy in 
fidel castros cuba 
bush speaking at the outset of a white house meeting with the 
house and senate leadership said im terribly disappointed that 
castro seems to be firming up his totalitarian position instead of 
moving toward free and fair elections 
id like to see him shift from that highly militarized island 
and let democracy have a chance said bush i think if we are 
helpful to nicaragua and panama it will simply increase the 
pressure in that marvelous island of cuba for change 
bush is pressing for passage of 500 million to help panama 
rebuild following the ouster of manuel antonio noriega and 300 
million for nicaragua where citizens last month voted to replace 
sandinista president daniel ortega with publisher violeta chamorro 
who is strongly backed by the united states 
bush addressing the congressional leaders and top 
administration officials gathered in the cabinet room said he 
called the meeting to discuss the dramatic shifts toward 
democracy in panama and nicaragua 
i know that the senate and the house will come to grips with 
this problem said bush 
house speaker thomas foley said after the meeting were going 
to do whatever we can to expedite this process of enacting the 
aid package but it may take a few weeks 
with last weeks ouster of a military ruler in haiti the united 
states regards cuba as the sole holdout against democracy in the 
western hemisphere 
bush in an interview monday with media general newspapers 
criticized castro for keeping some troops in africa and for human 
rights abuses in cuba 
asked what castro could do to secure normal relations with the 
united states bush said i think free and fair elections and a 
recognition of the democratic changes taking place and a shifting 
from a highly militarized island to something that would be more 
helpful to his own people 
he also called for economic changes including shifting the 
highly socialized cuban economy to market forces 
he said castro was digging himself in further almost in 
splendid isolation against the changes that are taking place 
around the world 
several lawmakers said the real pressure on castro is emanating 
not from the white house but from the dramatic changes elsewhere 
in central america and eastern europe 
sen patrick leahy dvt said cuba is being squeezed by 
world events just like weve seen in eastern europe i think 
change is inevitable in cuba no matter what we do 
leahy chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee that 
dispenses foreign aid also questioned the importance of cuba 
we should be helping to stabilize and encourage the emerging 
democracies in eastern europe cuba is interesting to us 
because its 90 miles offshore but does it really involve the 
strategic interest of the united states leahy said its a 
tiny little island country 
rep newt gingrich rga the house republican whip said 
castro is a man who is denying the reality of history 
were not getting any tougher with castro were staying where 
we are and hoping that castro will decide to allow the people of 
cuba to choose freely said gingrich

makes money laundering a crime punishable by fines of up to 
666000 and five years imprisonment 
the legislation which takes effect july 1 was approved by the 
upper house council of states late monday and was hailed by a 
deputy as an international pacesetter the national council or

unanimous 
professionals in the financial sector who fail to exercise due 
care in obtaining the identification of customers risk drawing 
unspecified fines or terms of up to one year in jail 
rene rhinow head of the commission that wrote the bill told 
the council of states that the law would give switzerland a leading 
position in the fight against organized crime 
justice minister arnold koller said the government was examining 
measures that would require people crossing into switzerland with 
large amounts of cash to declare the money to customs he said this 
may involve amounts between 33300 and 66600 
switzerland has been rocked by several money laundering cases in 
the past two years last november a parliamentary commission

president bush said today he hopes the 
breakaway republic of lithuania will experience peaceful change and 
selfdetermination 
bush was asked by reporters at the outset of a meeting with 
congressional leaders if he was concerned that president mikhail s 
gorbachev might order a military crackdown on the breakaway 
republic 
im glad that theyre still talking peaceful change thats 
essential bush said thats what everybody wants to see is 
peaceful evolution in lithuania 
we want to see democracy and freedom we want to see 
selfdetermination and we also want to see peacful evolution and 
that is in the interest of eastern europe as they begin to solidify 
their democracy said bush who is welcoming the new 
noncommunist prime minister of poland tadeusz mazowiecki to the 
white house on wednesday 
after the meeting house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
praised bushs response to the lithuanian independence movement 
i think the presidents approaching that matter with caution 
and discretion he said i think the president and the united 
states has made it clear that we expect the soviets to hold to 
their promise not to use force with reference to eastern europe or 
with reference to the balkan states 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip said it 
would be utterly stupid for bush to be lecturing gorbachev in 
public about what to do on lithuania 
the united states has never recognized the soviet conquest of 
lithuania i presume that we are prepared to help those folks 
but that we also recognize that militarily theyre only going to 
become as free as the russian military and the soviet government 
permit said gingrich a leading conservative 
if the soviets decide on force if they decide on military 
occupation then there is plenty of time to react but as long as 
you have a hope that gorbachev is genuinely maneuvering to find 
a way to accommodate lithuanian desires without destroying the 
soviet union i think its prudent for us to be a little calm and a 
little patient 
this guys been amazing so far gingrich said and i dont 
think we ought to try to pretend either that we have the military 
power to force anything or that we are dramatically smarter than 
the lithuanians and russians 
the united states has urged the soviet union to respect the will 
of the lithuanian people but it has not formally recognized the 
breakaway republic it says it will delay a decision on recognition 
until the new government in lithuania establishes control over its 
territory 
the soviet government warned lithuania monday not to erect 
customs posts introduce its own currency or take over moscowrun 
factories without kremlin permission 
the televised announcement did not say what would happen if 
lithuania ignored the warning but soviet troops in the past day 
have carried out military maneuvers in the republic that 
lithuanians say are aimed at intimidation 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis denied that his baltic 
republic plans to seize state enterprises and sell them to private 
owners and called the harsh warning from moscow a negotiating ploy

thought arabs dealt drugs had poor hygiene habits or avoided taxes 
school officials issued a letter of apology monday following an 
outcry from arabamerican students parents and community leaders

measure antiarabic prejudice among nonarabic students at dearborn

about 30 antiabortion protesters were led 
away by police tuesday after forcing their way into the operating 
section of a hospital where abortions are performed 
about half the protesters shut themselves inside an operating 
room of huriez hospital and wrote antiabortion graffiti on the 
walls while their comrades blocked the entrance to the room 
after more than two hours police removed the protesters and 
took them to a police station in the northern industrial city they 
later were released but hospital officials said they planned to 
file charges of vandalism 
the officials said surgery had to be postponed because the 
protest required the operating room to be sterilized again 
abortion has been legal in france since 1975 despite opposition 
from the countrys powerful roman catholic church antiabortion 
groups have been active politically but there have been few 
previous incidents involving forced entry into hospitals 
harassment of abortion recipients or other aggressive tactics such 
as those used by some antiabortion activists in the united states

premier li peng on tuesday reaffirmed chinas 
hardline policies stemming from last years crushing of the 
prodemocracy movement attacking western ideas and praising the 
superiority of socialsm 
as we confront pressure from abroad and difficulties at home 
preservation of the countrys stability is a matter of paramount 
importance li said in a state of the nation address to open 
chinas annual legislative session 
li stressed the importance of maintaining correct ideology to 
combat bourgeois liberalism or western ideas and the need for 
more central planning and control of the economy 
a trend toward bourgeoisliberalization thinking had run 
rampant during previous years he told the 2705 delegates to the 
national peoples congress but he said importance has been 
attached afresh to ideological and political work 
li noted the soulstirring struggles of 1989 including the 
victory over the counterrevolutionary rebellion the 
governments term for the studentled prodemocracy movement 
crushed by military force in june hundreds and perhaps thousands 
of people were killed in the crackdown 
he said the prodemocracy movement was led by hostile forces 
trying to turn china into a bourgeois republic dependent on 
capitalist countries 
in contrast to recent developments in the soviet union and 
eastern europe li proclaimed that come what may socialist china 
will stand rock firm in the east and reaffirmed the leading role 
of the communist party 
upholding socialism is inseparable from upholding leadership 
by the party he said equating it with national stability and 
unity 
li said class struggle would continue for a long time and may 
even become acute under certain condition he called for 
intensive education especially of young people in ideology 
and political thought 
it is essential to distinguish clearly between socialist 
democracy and bourgeois democracy he said we must 
maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat this corrosive trend 
of thought 
there was little response from the floor as li droned through 
the 59page 2hour speech raising his voice at a few key points 
to elicit applause a few delegates clearly had fallen asleep 
chins propped on chests while other struggled to stay awake 
wiping their faces with wet towels yawning and rubbing their eyes 
behind li on the podium chinas aged leadership held whispered 
conversations with each other during the speech 
senior leader deng xiaoping was missing from the rostrum his 
seat conspicuously empty beside party chief jiang zemin 
zhao ziyan jiangs predecessor who was purged from all party 
posts last summer after being accused of supporting the studentled 
democracy movement also was missing zhao is a deputy from sichuan 
province and reportedly had asked for leave from the congress 
much of lis speech was devoted to chinas struggling economy 
which flourished and then overheated under dengs economic reforms 
of the past decade li imposed tough austerity measures in 1988 to 
combat excessive growth and runaway inflation 
he reported that those measures had cut the inflation rate to 7 
percent from 30 percent a year ago and brought economic growth to 
a manageable level but said many problems including stockpiling 
rising debt and factory closures remain 
we must not look for quick success in either economic 
development or reform similarly we must not look for quick 
success in current economic improvement and rectification li 
said 
he announced some austerity measures would be eased including 
relaxing curbs on the money supply increasing loans to 
enterprises adjusting interest rates for loans and savings 
deposits and increasing investment in housing and key industries 
several times li said economic reforms would continue but he 
also called for more state control on prices and money markets 
construction projects and distribution of valuable materials rather 
than allowing market forces to rule 
li stressed the reforms are designed to demonstrate the 
superiority of the socialist system 
one of lis final points was that a clean and honest 
government that has the faith and respect of the masses was needed 
to achieve the goals set forth in his report 
corruption and bureaucracy has been a major complaint of the 
chinese people and was one of the rallying cries of last years 
democracy movement

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi today urged a 
moslem economic boycott against the united states britain and west 
germany and said no islamic country should have diplomatic ties 
with those nations 
libya has said it suspects the united states israel and west 
germany are behind last wednesdays fire at a libyan plant that 
allegedly produced poison gas the three countries have denied any 
involvement 
gadhafis remarks carried by the official libyan news agency 
jana and monitored in rome made no mention of the fire but the 
report said gadhafi accused the united states and its allies of 
conducting a campaign of subversion against islamic countries 
it quoted gadhafi as saying that any peace with the united 
states is deception and hypocrisy he also said there should be no 
us british or west german embassies in any islamic state 
libya has diplomatic relations with west germany but the united 
states and britain severed ties with libya years ago 
gadhafi was quoted as saying the moslem world is facing a 
historic struggle with a hostile satanic force and that no 
islamic country should establish relations with the us government 
and its allies rather we should have a decisive and perpetual 
boycott against them 
libya contends the plant near rabta about 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli produced pharmaceuticals but the united states and west 
germany say it produced poison gas 
libyas ambassador to italy rahman shalgam told italian 
journalists in rome monday that several people suspected of causing 
the fire had been detained he also said a member of the 
technical staff apparently set the fire which he said caused 
damage of great proportions 
us officials say the plant is now inoperable 
jana quoted gadhafi as saying no ship or plane from the united 
states britain or west germany should be allowed in the land of 
islam he appealed to islamic countries to boycott completely 
the forces of evil on this planet 
the united states attacked libyan targets three times in the 
1980s twice shooting down libyan fighter planes and in 1986 
bombing tripoli and benghazi to retaliate for what it called 
libyas support of international terrorism 
some of the us warplanes that attacked libya in 1986 came from 
bases in britain 
britain broke diplomatic ties with libya in april 1984 after a 
london policewoman was shot to death during a libyan dissident 
demonstration britain said she was killed by a libyan firing from 
inside the libyan embassy 
president reagan ordered economic sanctions against libya in 
january 1986 president bush citing libyas continued support for 
terrorism extended those sanctions last jan 4

supporters of democratic reform won victories 
across the soviet union defeating oldguard communists in runoff 
elections in the slavic heartland and choosing independence 
activists in the baltic republics 
in latvia the peoples front claimed victory monday in the 
republics first free elections in 50 years and a spokesman said 
the group came close to achieving the parliamentary majority needed 
to press for independence 
in estonia proindependence parties won at least 54 of the 105 
seats in the republics new parliament 
activists in latvia and estonia had hoped sundays parliamentary 
elections in the baltics annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
would follow the lead of nearby lithuania and bring independence 
supporters to power 
but a spokesman for the latvian opposition group kristian 
rozenvald said the peoples front will probably gain a majority in 
the next election round in april 
the victories of the popular movements were a blow to president 
mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to slow their drives for 
independence he has repeatedly condemned separatists and has 
refused to recognize lithuanias selfproclaimed independence 
reformers also claimed victories in crucial runoffs sunday in 
russia byelorussia and the ukraine the soviet unions slavic 
heartland accounts for 80 percent of the countrys territory and 
twothirds of its population the reformers unseated local 
communist officials who have been accused of blocking reforms 
advocated by gorbachev 
there were no immediate results from most towns in russia or 
from the ukraine and official tallies were not expected for 
several days 
in estonia the estonian peoples front won at least 38 of the 
105 seats in the republics new parliament said rina lohmus a 
correspondent for estonian radio 
the radio said the estonian committee a more radical 
independence group won at least 16 seats and deputies from several 
small parties supporting the peoples front platform won several 
seats 
results from about 15 seats had still not been determined 
lohmus said 
although officials results were not expected until friday lempi 
tekone a spokeswoman for the estonian peoples front said the 
party expected to have the support of about threequarters of the 
deputies 
she said the yedinstvo organization representing 
russianspeaking residents would probably have about 25 percent of 
the seats and free estonia formed by the republics communist 
party won about 10 seats 
many activists said they expect the former communist party to 
cautiously support moves for independence 
throughout the slavic republics voters chose between candidates 
in 1610 runoffs held after no candidate gained 50 percent of the 
vote in the main round of parliament and local council elections 
march 4 
according to moscows electoral commission 55 out of the 
capitals 65 seats in russias parliament were won by candidates 
representing the reformist democratic russia alliance the group 
also won 281 seats out of 498 in the city council said interfax a 
news agency of radio moscow 
in leningrad reformists from the democratic elections90 bloc 
won 60 percent to 70 percent of the contested seats the official 
tass news agency said 
elena zelinskaya of the northwest information agency an 
independent forprofit news agency focusing on the leningrad area 
said communist party members also scored some victories they were 
mostly in the socalled closed electoral districts such as army 
units where campaigning was not allowed 
initial results in byelorussia showed gains for democrats but 
new elections were expected in about onequarter of the districts 
since none of the candidates gained 50 percent of the vote in the 
runoffs tass said 
in latvia the peoples front said it won 118 spots in the 
201seat parliament a large majority among the 171 delegates 
elected rozenvald said the front could get the support of 12 
candidates from other parties and control 130 seats in parliament 
still that would fall short of the twothirds majority or 134 
seats needed to change latvias constitution and declare 
independence tass reported that initial results showed the front 
only won 108 seats 
lithuanias parliament declared the republic independent on 
march 11 ever since lithuania has been engaged in a bitter 
conflict with moscow which declared the move illegal and on monday 
warned it would not tolerate attempts to act on the independence 
declaration 
latvia followed lithuanias example and legalized alternative 
political parties several months ago no such move was made in 
estonia but several parties competed there the soviet congress 
legalized multiple political parties for the whole country last 
week

the independence of namibia 
the last colony in africa marks the end of colonial rule on a 
continent once carved up and ruled by european powers hungry for 
imperial glory 
tuesdays end of south african rule in the vast arid territory 
after 75 years also marks the end of a process that began in 1957 
when ghana became the first european colony in africa to become 
independent in the years since some 50 african nations have 
emerged from colonial rule to become independent 
namibias peaceful independence after a 23year bush war between 
south african forces and nationalist black guerrillas has added to 
hopes that south africas racial divisions may also be resolved 
peacefully 
nearly all of africa except for ethiopia and liberia was divided 
up between the european powers in what historians call the 
scramble for africa mainly in the 19th century 
the colonization of africa according to the historian basil 
davidson meant africans had lost their independence and with 
this their capacity to develop along their own lines 
they had lost in short the command of their own history 
he wrote 
while european colonization of africa began with the portugese 
in the 15th century most of the continent was carved up by britain 
and france in the late 19th century the two imperial powers took 
over huge tracts of territory across the continent sweeping aside 
african resistance 
even minor powers such as belgium spain and portugal carved out 
colonies far larger than their own size the king of belgium ran 
the huge belgian congo as a private enterprise 
much of the territory gobbled up by the european powers was 
jungle desert and swamps of little value few of the colonies ever 
did more than consume the funds of the colonial mother country and 
never produced the wealth predicted by colonial officials 
the european officials and soldiers who served in these 
farflung colonies in the early days had notoriously short lives 
british officials in some feverridden west african colonies never 
booked return ship tickets because so few completed their tours of 
duty west africa was called the white mans grave 
death was accepted as part of the days work said one 
british colonial civil servant 
despite the worthlessness of many of these colonies the 
european powers competed frantically to snap up african territory 
empires and colonies gave enormous prestige and europeans of all 
classes gloried in their nations foreign possessions 
the pursuit of colonies added to the international tensions that 
dragged europe into world war i in 1914 when the war came little 
colonial armies fought each other in africa with british and 
french troops seizing germanys colonies 
a german army of a few thousand men mainly african troops held 
out in east africa until the end of the war in 1918 fighting off 
much larger english indian south african belgian and portuguese 
forces 
namibia then called south west africa was a german colony 
captured by south african forces during the war 
but the european powers gave up their african colonies 
relatively easily after world war ii when colonialism started to go 
out of fashion and liberation movements sprang up in africa 
britain and france released most of their african colonies only 
portugal put up a long bitter fight to try to retain angola 
mozambique and its other possessions but conceded defeat in the 
mid1970s 
south africa also fought for years to retain namibia until its 
leaders concluded the war against the south west african peoples 
organization was no longer feasible swapo won subsequent elections 
in 1989 
now south africa is the sole portion of africa that remains 
under white rule but white south africans reject radicals 
assertions that their nation also is a colony white settlement in 
south africa dates back 350 years and the politically dominant 
afrikaners of dutch descent regard themselves as africans with no 
other home 
recognizing the change in african history south african 
president fw de klerk has said whites must find a new way to live 
in their country and he has started to work toward the end of 
whiteminority rule 
de klerk says south africans must seek a peaceful solution as 
in namibia or face the threat of a race war he warns would last 
for generations

irancontra prosecutors wrapped up their 
criminal case against former national security adviser john 
poindexter today after 7 days of testimony from 10 witnesses 
lawyers for poindexter were to open their defense this afternoon 
videotaped testimony by former president reagan obtained at the 
request of poindexters lawyers is expected to be shown in court 
the governments last witness a senate staffer said it seemed 
strange that poindexter knew so little about a november 1985 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress the us role 
in the hawks shipment and oliver norths military assistance and 
fund raising for the contras 
north was the governments main witness against poindexter but 
testified reluctantly against his old boss the former white house 
aide said he watched poindexter tear up a presidential document 
ratifying the 1985 hawks shipment 
poindexter told sens david durenberger and patrick leahy that 
he had learned of the hawks shipment only in january 1986 senate 
staffer eric newsome testified 
poindexters discussion with durenberger and leahy took place 
just hours before the national security adviser destroyed the 
finding a politically embarrassing document which depicted us 
involvement in iran arms sales as a straight armsforhostages deal 
it did seem strange to me that he didnt know more than he did 
about the hawks shipment testified newsome who took notes in an 
hourlong discussion in poindexters white house office on nov 21 
1986 
poindexter also told durenberger and leahy that it was unclear 
whether there was prior knowledge of the shipment by us 
officials testified newsome reading from a memo he typed up after 
the meeting 
durenberger rminn was chairman at the time of the senate 
intelligence committee leahy dvt was vice chairman of the 
panel 
on monday rep lee hamilton testified that poindexter failed to 
tell the house intelligence committee about a presidential document 
that approved the missile shipment to iran thencia director 
william casey said the document didnt exist said hamilton 
poindexter said the us government had not approved and 
did not know about the shipment said hamilton he was chairman 
of the house intelligence committee which met with poindexter just 
before he met with durenberger and leahy 
the trial was continuing today with the governments final 
witnesses us district judge harold greene denied a defense 
motion for a mistrial monday after some of hamiltons testimony 
touched on statements that poindexter gave congress in 1987 under 
immunity from prosecution 
hamilton said monday that almost the first words that admiral 
poindexter said when he walked into the meeting were that 
president reagan wanted to tell the full story 
when mr poindexter was making statements about iran arms you 
believed him asked irancontra prosecutor dan webb 
i did hamilton replied 
webb questioned the congressman about the presidential 
authorization document called a finding 
he didnt tell you at all about the 1985 document webb 
asked 
i didnt know there was such a finding hamilton replied 
in a separate meeting the same day casey told the intelligence 
committee there was no document authorizing the shipment of hawk 
antiaircraft missiles to iran hamilton said 
do you remember casey in that testimony actually telling you 
there was no finding for that 1985 shipment webb asked hamilton 
i do the congressman replied 
a year before casey had sent the finding directly to poindexter 
for president reagans signature casey attached a note to 
poindexter saying the finding should not be passed around in any 
hands below our level 
hours after caseys and poindexters discussions with congress 
poindexter destroyed the politically embarrassing presidential 
document it depicted us involvement in iran arms sales as a 
straight armsforhostages deal 
the former national security adviser is accused of concealing 
from congress oliver norths military assistance to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua and the us role in the missile shipment to 
iran 
earlier in the day webb inadvertently brought out some of 
poindexters immunized congressional testimony in questioning 
hamilton about the presidential finding 
had poindexter ever reported destroying the document webb asked 
he did hamilton said in front of the jury 
the congressman cchairman of a special congressional committee 
that investigated the irancontra affair was referring to 
poindexters july 1987 testimony to the committee during which he 
said he tore up the document 
no part of the case against poindexter may be derived from his 
testimony to congress given under a grant of immunity from 
prosecution 
webb rephrased the question but defense attorney richard 
beckler asked for a mistrial saying that hamilton had specifically 
been instructed not to refer to poindexters immunized testimony 
greene denied the motion saying that north testified last week 
that he watched poindexter tear up the finding 
greene said hamiltons testimony was cumulative rather than 
harmful 
beckler suggested the jury might not find norths testimony 
credible but greene also noted that both the government and the 
defense referred to tearing up of the finding in their opening 
statements to the jury 
and you have great credibility the judge told beckler 
the information about tearing up the finding is not new at 
all greene concluded 
in his opening statement beckler said poindexter tore up the 
document because it was not accurate in portraying the arms 
shipments solely as an attempt to free american hostages held in 
lebanon 
beckler noted that it was replaced by another finding that 
portrayed the arms shipments as an attempt to establish a more 
moderate government in iran as well as to further the release of 
the hostages

a former federal drug agent accused of 
narcotics trafficking and money laundering was denied bail pending 
his trial 
us district judge terry j hatter jr ruled monday that 
darnell garcia was likely to flee and a danger to the community if 
bail were set 
a sept 4 trial date was set for garcia and two other former 
us drug enforcement administration agents john jackson and wayne 
countryman 
prosecutors contend the agents stole drugs confiscated during 
dea raids authorities say the agents sold the drugs laundered 
narcotics profits and leaked information to drug dealers about 
federal investigations against them 
garcia of rancho palos verdes traveled around the world after 
he was suspended in 1987 during a corruption investigation 
authorities said 
garcia reportedly spent time in rio de janeiro madrid paris 
frankfurt and luxembourg before he was arrested last july for a 
passport violation he was extradited from luxembourg in february 
garcia originally was charged in 26 of the 42 counts in the 
indictment but was extradited on six counts 
he pleaded innocent monday to one count of stealing heroin from 
the dea and one of possession with intent to distribute heroin 
defense attorney mary gibbons said she will challenge the other 
counts involving money laundering and conspiracy because they were 
not within the extradition treaty between the us and the tiny 
western european country 
in january a judge ordered jackson held without bail and set 
bond for countryman at 120000

a white briton quit his job in london 
to fly to namibia a black namibian rose before dawn tuesday to 
drive six hours across the desert a teacher used the new 
constitution to instruct students 
independence in africas last colony drew tens of thousands of 
celebrants in windhoek each for their own reasons 
independence doesnt mean you can be lazy it means hard work 
taking responsibility so that you can be a leader said usko 
shivute a history teacher 
he uses namibias democratic westernstyle constitution to 
teach the values of free speech and respect for the opinions of 
others he said he also tries to keep a lid on the rising 
expectations that come with independence 
nothing will be free shivute tells his students but now 
we will have more opportunity 
shivute helped plan the weeklong independence celebrations in 
windhoek the modern capital and largest city with about 120000 
people nightly parties were planned the new red blue and green 
flag with a golden sun in one corner waved from virtually every 
shop on kaiser street the main throughfare 
namibia free at last said bumper stickers 
posters on the roadside showed black and white children arm in 
arm under the heading our free nation 
dozens of foreign leaders and thousands of diplomats and 
journalists arrived in windhoek a city with less than 500 hotel 
rooms 
the small airport about 30 miles outside windhoek in the scrub 
brush of the namibian countryside was expected to handle nearly 
100 flights tuesday up from the usual average of six 
due to lack of space planes dropped their passengers then took 
off again to park in neighboring countries 
i want to see libyan leader moammar gadhafi said ben 
goagoseb 26 we have heard so much about him and he has always 
identified with our struggle for independence 
goagoseb and other young black men said gadhafi was the foreign 
figure they most wanted to see even more so than south african 
black leader nelson mandela 
gadhafi was invited but it was uncertain whether he would 
attend 
dokes tjitombo and his brother alex rose before dawn tuesday 
and drove six hours from namibias northeast corner to windhoek for 
the celebrations 
we just came for a day because we wanted to see 
independence said tjitombo a 35yearold driver wearing a 
tshirt with the new national flag emblazoned on the chest 
david maxwell quit his job at a london brokerage firm in october 
and came to namibia to witness the independence process 
theres a spirit of good will from blacks and whites i think 
both sides are willing to bury the past said maxwell 
maxwell 29 was living in south africa in 1980 when 
neighboring whiteruled rhodesia became blackruled zimbabwe 
there was much more hostility there than in namibia said 
maxwell whites are a bit nervous in namibia but they are much 
more positive about the future

a federal regulation that prohibits 
governmentfunded family planning clinics from discussing abortion 
with clients is an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of 
speech an appeals court has ruled 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals said in a ruling released 
late monday that the speech at issue involves telling a woman about 
an activity abortion in which she has a constitutional right 
to engage 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon and attorneys for 
various family planning groups challenged the us department of 
health and human services for enforcing the family planning 
regulations in 1988 
the regulations prohibited people in medical facilities that 
received money under the federal title x program from counseling 
women about abortion and from referring pregnant women to any 
facilities that perform abortion 
the court said in its 41 decision that the secretary of health 
and human services has tried to use funding to limit public 
discussion on abortion rights it is by now black letter law that 
such a restriction is a violation of the first amendment 
lucy eddinger a spokeswoman for the hhs office of population 
affairs said this morning that the federal government had not had 
time to review the case we understand there has been a decision 
but no one has seen that decision so we wont have a comment until 
we have read it eddinger said 
the ruling is binding only in the 1st circuit which has 
jurisdiction over maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island 
and puerto rico other circuits can be expected to be influenced by 
it however 
the appeals court affirmed a decision by us district court 
judge walter skinner 
in may three judges of the 1st circuit ruled in favor of the 
state upholding the injunction that blocked the ban on referrals 
from taking effect 
but when the us supreme court handed down a decision in the 
missouri case of webster vs reproductive health services two 
months later the federal government asked the 1st circuit to 
rehear the arguments 
the webster decision gave states broader discretion to set 
limits on abortion 
judge juan torruella who dissented in mondays ruling cited 
the webster decision 
in my opinion the secretary has merely refused to fund an 
activity which the government is not constitutionally required to 
support without imposing legal obstacles to a citizens choice of 
action in a protected area torruella said 
ruling in favor of the state were chief judge levin campbell and 
judges hugh bownes stephen breyer and bruce selya

many heart attack victims are being denied 
lifesaving new treatment because doctors fear they will be sued if 
their patients suffer strokes a rare but devastating complication 
of the therapy specialists say 
new clotdissolving medicines can literally stop a heart attack 
if given within a few hours after the start of chest pains but 
many heart doctors believe this treatment has been too slow to 
catch on in the united states 
heart attack victims often wait too long before going to the 
hospital to be able to benefit from the treatment however many 
others dont get the medicine even when they arrive at the 
emergency room in time 
the reasons vary but some advocates of aggressive treatment say 
their colleagues fear of malpractice suits has played an important 
role 
this has been one of the main impediments to the proliferation 
of treatment in the united states said dr robert califf of duke 
university 
califf raised the issue at this weeks meeting of the american 
college of cardiology many other heart specialists said they 
agreed 
there is no doubt in my mind that it affects physicians 
choice of therapy said dr william b smith of tulane 
university the fear of lawsuits is real 
when all goes well the new drugs known as thrombolytic agents 
clearly save lives a heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot 
gets stuck in the arteries that feed the heart within a few hours 
a section of the heart muscle dies 
but if given quickly the drugs can dissolve the clot 
preventing most of the damage in studies the treatment typically 
has reduced the heart attack death rate from 12 percent to 6 
percent 
but because the therapy interferes with the bodys normal 
tendency to make blood clots the treatment can trigger a major 
side effect unwanted bleeding in most parts of the body such 
bleeding can be controlled but if a blood vessel spews blood 
inside the brain doctors are powerless to stop it and the result 
is often a crippling stroke 
such strokes occur in about one in 200 or 300 people who receive 
the clotdissolving drugs 
doctors routinely exclude people at high risk of bleeding from 
receiving the treatment these include those with high blood 
pressure the elderly and victims of prior strokes 
under current guidelines about 25 percent of all heart attack 
victims are considered to be good candidates for clotdissolving 
therapy estimates vary but experts say that probably only about 5 
percent actually get this treatment in the united states 
califf said he already has been sued because of a stroke 
resulting from the heart attack treatment he added that many other 
doctors have said they are reluctant to offer the therapy because 
of fear of lawsuits 
you simply cant have a bad outcome in the united states 
without someone asking was it the doctors fault he said 
dr peter rentrop of st vincents hospital in new york noted 
that a malpractice lawsuit can be professionally and financially 
damaging so doctors consider the legal as well as the medical 
risks of clotdissolving therapy 
you always have to ask if the patient has a complication do 
i have a strong defense rentrop said if i have a weak 
defense i have an obligation to myself and my family not to 
treat 
surgeons routinely accept the risk that some proportion of their 
patients will not survive operations dr jeremy swan of the 
university of california los angeles said internists too should 
be able to live with a small risk that their therapy will be lethal 
they will not suffer malpractice suits if they can show that 
they followed accepted standards he said 
dr keith fox of the university of edinburgh in scotland 
cautioned that doctors who dont offer clotdissolving drugs also 
may be sued for failure to properly treat heart attacks and 
several such lawsuits have been filed in europe 
the evidence in relation to benefit is very clear he said 
and we are seeing this on both sides of the atlantic

the supreme court ruled tuesday that workers 
who sue their unions for allegedly failing to represent them fairly 
may be entitled to jury trials to settle the issue 
by a 63 vote the court said union members must be given jury 
trials if their suits seek monetary compensation such as back pay 
the decision is a victory for 27 truck drivers who sued a north 
carolina local of the teamsters union 
the money damages the drivers seek are the type of relief 
traditionally awarded by courts of law justice thurgood marshall 
wrote for the court thus the constitutions seventh amendment 
entitles them to a jury trial 
justices anthony m kennedy sandra day oconnor and antonin 
scalia dissented 
lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair 
representation usually are tried before judges without juries such 
suits generally seek to end some asserted unfair treatment or to 
force a union into taking some action 
in most such cases an employer also is sued and charged with 
breaching a collectivebargaining agreement to win money damages 
a union member generally must prove the employer violated the union 
contract and that the union breached its fairrepresentation duty 
local 391 of the teamsters union was sued by 27 truck drivers in 
1983 after they had been transferred from various locations to the 
mclean trucking cos terminal in winstonsalem nc 
the 27 had been laid off and recalled on several occasions after 
their move to winstonsalem 
their lawsuit contends that mclean breached a 
collectivebargaining agreement by manipulating recall procedures 
so it could give other drivers preference and that local 391 
failed to represent them fairly in the resulting grievances 
mclean went bankrupt after the suit was filed and was dropped as 
a defendant 
the suit seeks from the teamsters among other things 
compensatory damages for lost wages and benefits as a result of 
tuesdays ruling the suit will reach a jury 
in a separate decision the court unanimously reinstated a 
lawsuit by a black machinist who says he was fired illegally from 
his arden nc job in 1983 because of his race 
the high court said john s lytles seventh amendment rights 
were violated when he was denied a jury trial 
the court also split 63 in ruling that frances dalm of michigan 
waited too long to sue the government over 20262 in tax 
overpayments 
kennedy wrote for the court in that case justices john paul 
stevens william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented

president chaim herzog today named labor party 
leader shimon peres as israels prime ministerdesignate and gave 
him the difficult task of trying to form a new government 
israel television broadcast live coverage of herzog giving a 
letter of nomination to the 66yearold peres who headed israels 
government in 19846 
israeli law left herzog with the authority to choose a candidate 
for prime minister peres has six weeks to form a new ruling 
coalition but it was not certain he would be able to bring 
together his leftist allies and conservative religiousd factions 
herzog met over the past two days with leaders of israels two 
major parties to decide who has the best chance of forming a new 
governing coalition a reversal by a key religious faction monday 
left labor and the rightwing likud at a draw with 6060 support 
in the 120member parliament 
the labor party is technically parliaments largest faction 
with 39 legislators 
caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir whose likud bloc has 35 
seats fell in a parliamentary vote of no confidence last thursday 
triggered by a dispute over middle east peace moves 
an official in herzogs office who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the presidents office has been inundated with 
phone calls from israelis complaining that the wheeling and dealing 
has paralyzed the government 
people say it is impossible to bear the political situation 
the official said 
israel radio said herzog mirroring these sentiments told some 
politicians monday that the israeli public is fed up with 
politicians 
the radio said herzogs office also received a number of 
anonymous telephone threats today including one bomb threat 
police searched and found no explosives the radio said 
much of the maneuvering has involved small ultraorthodox 
religious parties notably the shas faction whose spiritual leader 
69yearold rabbi ovadia yosef caused the fall of shamirs 
likudlabor coaltion last week 
yosef said he ordered shas to withhold support from shamir 
because his government was unable to move forward in the peace 
process 
but he reversed his stand monday after a talk with his mentor 
92yearold rabbi eliezer shach and a scolding from the nations 
two chief rabbis 
in another development israel monday welcomed the idea of peace 
talks with its most implacable foe syria but said the goal should 
be an overall peace treaty rather than a proposed demilitarized 
zone in the occupied golan heights 
former president jimmy carter who met syrian president hafez 
assad last week told reporters sunday that syria was ready for 
bilateral talks with israel including the golan heights 
peres told parliament last week that he received information the 
syrians are proposing peace negotiations demilitarizing the 
golan heights 
israel seized the golan heights from syria in the 1967 sixday 
war and annexed the 700squaremile plateau in 1981 about 7000 
israelis and 12000 druse arabs live there 
the strategic plateau overlooks northern israel and the approach 
to syrias capital damascus prior to the 1967 war syrian gunners 
used their positions on the heights to shell israeli settlements in 
the northern galilee 
syria has previously demanded the return of all the territory 
but the latest hints raised the possibility of a troop withdrawal 
as an interim solution

l douglas wilder catapulted to national 
prominence as the nations first black elected governor said 
tuesday that if the democrats fail to put up a strong mainstream 
presidential candidate in 1992 well be locked out of the white 
house for a long long time 
the virginia governor told the associated press that in the 
democratic presidential primary campaign he would actively support 
a candidate who espouses mainstream values 
wilder never mentioned jesse jackson by name but he made clear 
he does not believe jackson shares those mainstream values 
there isnt any single voice commanding the loyalty of 
blacks wilder said adding there isnt going to be 
wilder also spoke to the national press club calling on 
democrats to embrace the conservative economic policies he has 
pursued in his first few months as governor 
americans everywhere want to hold the line on spending and on 
taxes he said 
there was a time when democrats were elected by campaigning 
against big government and high taxes but for too long we have let 
the other party take these issues away from us indeed we have 
allowed them to hammer us with these issues 
in his speech wilder also urged democrats to stop fighting 
each other long after primary battles are decided 
were doing the other partys dirty work for them and it 
must stop if we are to ever again be more than mere guests at 1600 
pennsylvania avenue 
wilder has been one of the hottest properties in the democratic 
party much in demand as a speaker since his historymaking 
election in november 
he spoke at a party dinner in chicago last week and is a 
featured speaker on the agenda of the democratic leadership council 
meeting in new orleans later this week 
many democrats view wilder as a mainstream alternative to 
jackson who has twice run for the partys presidential nomination 
from a base of overwhelming support within the black community 
in the interview wilder suggested it was unlikely republican 
sen john warner would face strong opposition for reelection this 
fall 
if you have somebody who is credible and can raise funds and 
attract people for a winning campaign fine lets do that he 
said when asked about the prospects for a strong democratic 
challenge to warner 
we have a committee out looking for those persons he said 
then laughing he added they havent come back yet 
as for the next presidential election wilder said its 
essential that the democrats put a strong candidate up in 1992 
he said that whomever the party nominates would have to be 
someone who is close to mainstream values if the party fails 
to do that he said well be locked out of the white house for a 
long long time

parents have become a lot smarter about 
keeping medicines and hazardous chemicals from the mouths of their 
children but even the bestmeaning parents can do something dumb 
like those who cajole junior into taking his medicine by telling 
him its candy thats an invitation to disaster and it drives the 
poison prevention folks right up the wall as they made clear at a 
news conference tuesday marking the 29th national poison prevention 
week 
an even worse mistake storing paint thinners antifreeze 
lighter fluid for the outdoor barbecue or household chemicals in a 
soda bottle cup or drinking glass 
overall however the news regarding the threat to small 
children is good as noted by president bush in his annual 
proclamation marking the public awareness campaign which began 
sunday there has been a 93 percent decrease since 1961 in the 
accidental poisoning deaths of children under the age of five 
that year the last before congress enacted legislation creating 
poison prevention week 450 youngsters aged four and younger died 
in 1987 the last year for which complete statistics are available 
31 perished 
the decline has been especially dramatic since the advent of 
mandatory childresistant closures beginning with those for 
aspirin products in 1972 since then childresistant caps have 
been required for various types of furniture polish drain 
cleaners oven cleaners lighter fluids turpentine paint 
solvents windshield washer solutions antifreeze and 
ironcontaining vitamins and dietary supplements 
in addition drug manufacturers and pharmacists are required to 
deliver all oral prescription drugs in childresistant packages 
unless an adult specifically requests an easyopen container all 
too many including grandparents do just that officials complain 
at a news conference at georgetown university hospital 
jacqueline jonessmith chairman of the us consumer product 
safety commission credited the childresitant caps on oral 
medications with saving the lives of an estimated 340 children 
since 1974 
still hundreds of thousands of children have what she termed 
near misses with poisons each year in 1987 about 100000 
children were treated in emergency rooms for accidental ingestion 
of hazardous materials and poison control centers received more 
than half a million calls involving children 
toby litovitz poison control director at georgetown and 
presidentelect of the american association of poison control 
centers said the 70 member centers reported 15 million poisonings 
last year just a fraction of the number believed to have 
actually occurred 
she estimated the total at 47 million of which she said 62 
percent involved children 
litovitz said prescription medications including 
antidepressants cardiac medications asthma therapies and iron 
especially iron in prenatal vitamins are a continuing cause of 
needless deaths in small children 
the poison prevention week council headed by david almquist of 
the american society of hospital pharmacists urged parents to keep 
on hand a oneounce bottle of syrup of ipecac which induces 
vomiting for each child in the home but the substance should 
never be administered without first consulting a poison control 
center or physician the group cautioned it also warned that humco 
brand ipecac syrup should be replaced with another brand because 
that company has mistakenly labeled potentially deadly eucalyptus 
oil as syrup of ipecac 
the council also urged adults who have no children in their 
homes to avoid the temptation to use easyopen containers for their 
medications accidents have happened when youngsters have visited 
homes where no children live it noted 
according to a safety commission study 23 percent of the oral 
prescription drugs that were accidentally ingested by children 
belonged to someone who did not live with the child about 17 
percent involved drugs belonging to a grandparent or 
greatgrandparent

the prosecutor at joseph hazelwoods 
trial suggested to jurors today that exxon pressured crew members 
to give testimony favorable to the tanker captain blamed for the 
nations worst oil spill 
assistant district attorney brent cole in his final argument at 
hazelwoods criminal trial told jurors to notice the presence of 
exxon in this case and recalled the testimony of an exxon 
executive who said that the company has an interest in the outcome 
of hazelwoods trial 
it doesnt take a brain surgeon to see exxons interest in 
this matter cole said its seeing captain hazelwood get 
acquitted 
the prosecutor reminded jurors that crew members who testified 
supported their captain on many issues and sometimes changed the 
stories they had originally given about the grounding of the exxon 
valdez 
its easy to see the pressure they were putting on these crew 
members cole said 
exxon lawyers have been present in the courtroom throughout the 
trial and were seated in the front row as cole spoke 
cole portrayed hazelwood as a gambler who took the risk of 
drinking before boarding the exxon valdez only to lose his ship 
captain joseph hazelwood chose to be a gambler cole said 
he chose to be a risk taker he chose to sit in the pipeline club 
and drink most of the afternoon before he sailed 
cole the first attorney to speak in closing arguments at the 
7weekold trial said hazelwood risked his ship and the lives of 
his crew and should be found guilty of reckless conduct 
he gambled that drinking would not affect his judgment cole 
said he was wrong ladies and gentlemen because alcohol never 
improves judgment captain joseph hazelwood gambled and lost and 
it resulted in a captains worst nightmare 
as cole spoke hazelwood sat calmly at the defense table his 
wife and father who recently arrived at the trial sat in backrow 
seats of the crowded courtroom 
using a large blackboard on which he mounted a blowup picture 
of the exxon valdez cole reminded jurors how the tanker ran 
aground bubbling oil into prince william sound 
and he told them to remember that a tanker captains concern 
should be safety first 
captain hazelwood did not have safety first in his mind when 
he sat in the pipeline club or he wouldnt have been there cole 
said 
he recounted hazelwoods actions in the hours preceding the 
tankers grounding they were the actions and judgments of a 
person whose mind was clouded with alcohol 
defense attorney dick madson was to argue for the skippers 
total acquittal 
hazelwood is charged with a felony criminal mischief and three 
misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if convicted he could 
receive 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef on march 24 spilling 
almost 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil that wreaked 
devastation over hundreds of miles of shoreline rich with fish 
birds and other wildlife 
the intoxication charge is one of the most bitterly disputed 
points of the trial 
when officials tested hazelwood 10 hours after the grounding 
his bloodalcohol level was 061 below the 10 alaska minimum to 
be considered a drunken driver 
superior court judge karl johnstone on monday sided with the 
prosecution in ruling that the jury would consider only whether the 
43yearold huntington ny man was impaired by alcohol the 
defense wanted jurors to decide whether hazelwood was noticeably 
impaired 
the judge refused to add a proposed prosecution instruction in 
which jurors would be told the coast guards bloodalcohol limit 
for operating a commercial vessel is 04 well below the state law 
johnstone said the coast guard standard is a federal regulation 
not state law and has not been admitted into evidence at the trial 
every crew member and investigator who saw hazelwood on the 
crucial night was asked about his sobriety they testified he did 
not stagger slur his words or show any signs of intoxication

the pentagon urged congress tuesday to give 
the military the authority to revise the way personnel are laid 
off saying changes are needed so that forces remain balanced as a 
leaner defense department cuts back 
we need to work together to get some package put together to 
provide us with the flexibility we need to manage the force 
drawdown we all know is coming said christopher jehn assistant 
secretary of defense for force management and personnel 
jehn and representatives of the military services stressed 
before a senate armed services subcommittee the importance of quick 
approval of legislation the defense department proposed in july 
1989 
the bill revises certain restrictions involving voluntary and 
involuntary separation of commissioned officers 
among the proposed changes would be allowing military 
secretaries to convene selective early retirement boards to force 
retirement of lieutenant colonels and commanders who have failed to 
receive a promotion on one occasion 
previously officers had to fail to gain promotion twice before 
they would be considered by the board for retirement 
we are asking for additional flexibility to allow us to shape 
the officer corps in a balanced and equitable way said army lt 
gen allen k ono deputy chief of staff for personnel 
sens john glenn dohio chairman of the armed services 
subcommittee on manpower and personnel and john mccain rariz 
said congress needs a report on the pentagons policy plans for its 
forces as it weighs the defense department request 
jehn said the report wont be completed until the end of the 
year but the pentagon will try to make much of the information 
available to congress before it finishes its work on the fiscal 
1991 defense budget 
theres a sense of frustration here mccain said its 
very difficult to enact these measures unless we have a blueprint 
for the future

a majority of irans parliament members 
has demanded that the government not negotiate to gain freedom for 
western hostages in lebanon tehran radio reported tuesday 
the radio monitored in cyprus said parliament issued a 
statement monday night saying the fate of the captives should 
depend only on the lebanese 
the statement signed by 170 members of the 270member 
parliament was the latest sign of a power struggle in tehran over 
the captives 
moderates led by president hashemi rafsanjani have said the 
issue is moving toward a solution hardliners whose stance was 
reflected in the parliament statement oppose freeing the hostages 
the fate of the western hostages in lebanon depends on what 
the moslem people of lebanon want an end to the us plots in 
lebanon and the clarification of the fate of the lebanese and 
palestinian hostages in prisons in the west the statement said 
the proiranian lebanese shiite moslem groups that hold most of 
the 18 westerners have in the past demanded freedom for hundreds of 
palestinian and lebanese prisoners held in israeli jails 
many middle eastern countries consider israel part of the west 
the arrogant mass medias propaganda on separating the fate of 
the western hostages from the problems of lebanon is strongly 
condemned the radio quoted the statement as saying 
the reference was to reports that a release of hostages may be 
imminent following alleged secret talks between tehran and 
washington no concrete signs have emerged to support the 
speculation 
the radio said parliament called on irans foreign ministry to 
deny clearly what the radio called rumors that iran was involved in 
secret talks 
rafsanjani said march 7 there were no direct contacts with the 
united states on the hostages and foreign ministry officials 
repeatedly have stressed that iran is not directly involved 
the united states also has denied any direct talks 
the parliament statement urged the ministry to step up efforts 
to determine the fate of four iranians who went missing in north 
lebanon in 1982 
iran has ignored repeated statements by the lebanese forces the 
main christian militia in lebanon that the four are dead although 
rafsanjani has said if they were no longer alive their bodies 
should be returned to iran 
the statement by the members of the majlis or parliament was 
the latest in a series reflecting an increasingly public fight in 
iran over the fate of the hostages 
the debate started with a newspaper editorial in the tehran 
times in february saying the hostages should be released without 
conditions 
the parliament statement reflected the stance taken in a recent 
newspaper editorial by its leading hardline member ali mohammad 
mohtashemi saying iran would not interfere in lebanon and 
encouraging the kidnappers to retain their captives 
hardliners have said the rumours of usiran contacts over the 
hostages are an attempt to sow domestic discord in iran they 
consider confronting the united states a cornerstone of the 1979 
islamic revolution 
rafsanjanis faction however seeks to improve contacts with 
the west in part to gain muchneeded foreign investment for irans 
postwar reconstruction 
most of the 18 hostages are believed held by groups linked to 
hezbollah or party of god a shiite organization heavily financed 
by iran the hostages are eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who marked his fifth year 
in captivity on friday 
lebanons 12 million shiite moslem population the largest of 
the 17 religious sects among the 4 million lebanese is related to 
that in iran 
the shiite moslems never achieved the political and economic 
power built into the government structure by the maronite catholics 
and sunni moslems the structure cracked in 1975 with the start of 
the civil war

heres a look at tuesdays effort to count the 
nations homeless 
who 
about 15000 census bureau workers visit an estimated 11000 
shelters and an equal number of identified street locations 
what 
they interview homeless people if possible and at the very 
least count them for inclusion with all other americans in the 1990 
census this special homeless count is costing about 27 million 
when 
from 6 pm to midnight enumerators will visit shelters and 
lowcost hotels and motels from 2 am to 4 am they go to 
predetermined street and other outdoor sites where the homeless are 
known to congregate from 4 am to 8 am they are outside 
abandoned buildings to count those coming out 
where 
the effort includes every city of 50000 or more residents and 
smaller towns and rural areas where local officials reported having 
a homeless population 
why 
homelessness has become an increasingly noticed problem in 
america but there are no good statistics showing the extent 
estimates of the number of homeless vary from 250000 to 3 million 
results 
the effort is to find out how many people are homeless but the 
bureau will not try and define that term instead it will simply 
report finding so many people on the streets so many in shelters 
or hotels so many doubled up in apartments etc 
the results will be part of the general national population and 
housing analysis expected to published in late 1991

the us trade deficit widened sharply to 93 
billion in january as record demand for foreign oil offset an 
alltime high in sales of american products overseas the 
government reported tuesday 
the january gap between imports and exports was 205 percent 
larger than decembers 77 billion deficit which had been the 
best monthly showing in five years 
the bush administration which is counting on further 
improvement in trade to boost economic growth this year sought to 
play down the huge decembertojanuary swing 
but private economists were more pessimistic warning that 
americas trade woes could deepen this year due to a growing 
dependence on foreign oil and a stronger us dollar the rise in 
the dollar makes imports less expensive and therefore more 
attractive to us consumers while making american products less 
competitive on overseas markets 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
emphasized the robust growth in exports while minimizing the 
overall deficit figure 
everyone seemed to realize they couldnt maintain that low 
deficit level and so it was expected that there would be an 
increase in january he said 
exports climbed to a record high of 3207 billion in january 4 
percent above the december level however that gain was swamped by 
a 73 percent rise in imports which increased to 4132 billion 
the increase in imports came primarily from a 44 percent surge 
in oil shipments reflecting a rush by oil companies to replenish 
storage tanks depleted by unusually cold weather in december 
the total volume of oil imports hit an alltime high of 291278 
barrels surpassing the previous record set just last august with 
the price per barrel rising as well the total oil bill climbed to 
586 billion the highest total dollar amount since august 1982 
when the volume was less but the price per barrel was higher 
foreign oil accounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in 
january and with domestic production now at its lowest level in a 
quarter century analysts are concerned that rising dependence on 
oil imports will make it increasingly difficult to reduce the trade 
deficit further 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm predicted 
that this years trade deficit could top 120 billion up from a 
109 billion deficit in 1989 
without a weaker dollar we are just not going to get an 
improvement in trade he said 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said the growing 
trade deficit would increase calls for protectionist trade 
legislation especially in view of weakness in the overall economy 
we are going nowhere in trade and with the economy slowing 
down people arent willing to tolerate trade problems he said 
the administration has tried to fight off protectionist 
legislation with vows to open markets overseas focusing on tokyo 
because of americas 49 billion deficit with japan representing 
almost half of last years total 
president bush met with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
last month to press the administrations case that japan must do 
more to open its markets to american goods 
the deficit with japan did decline in january to 29 billion 
its lowest level in five years but it still remained by far the 
biggest imbalance with a single country the january improvement 
came from a drop in imports to this country not from a rise in 
us exports 
other big deficits in january included a 11 billion imbalance 
with taiwan an 840 million deficit with china and a 628 million 
deficit with canada americas largest trading partner 
analysts were encouraged that the increase in exports stemmed in 
large part from a 13 percent jump in sales of manufactured capital 
goods an area where the united states is regaining ground 
previously lost to foreign competitors 
but on the import side another factor swelling the deficit was 
a 31 percent jump in clothing shipments which totaled 31 billion 
in january

the government is examining a plan to 
stem the flow of third world refugees arriving through poland on 
phony documents officials said tuesday 
the proposed plan submitted to a government committee would 
make entry more difficult for refugees who arrive on their own 
initiative rather than on un refugee programs and quotas 
it also called for increased diplomatic pressure on poland to 
check travel documents more closely sweden also may start 
returning refugees to poland after receiving assurances they are 
treated in accordance with un conventions 
hundreds of people from the middle east and africa have come to 
sweden from poland in recent weeks requesting asylum virtually all 
of them carry false documents according to press reports 
they are put in refugee camps pending individual handling of 
their case which unfortunately takes as much six to eight weeks 
said police duty officer carita stahl 
these people are ruthlessly exploited by refugee organizations 
who have lured them into coming to sweden at horrendous prices 
said the dagens nyheter newspaper 
the report said some refugees from lebanon ethiopia somalia 
and iran had bought blurred photocopies of swedish visas for 
6001000 in egypt turkey or poland 
in october the government introduced visa requirements for 
bulgarians to halt a stream of thousands of ethnic bulgarian turks 
that raised the number of asylum seekers in sweden to the highest 
level since world war ii 
under swedens traditionally liberal immigration policies 
nearly 20000 refugees move to sweden every year

the house approved legislation tuesday 
authorizing the national park service to determine whether the 
route of the 1965 voting rights march from selma to montgomery 
should be designated a national historic trail 
rep john lewis of atlanta who was severely beaten by alabama 
state troopers at the outset of the march said the designation 
would demonstrate our commitment to voting rights and 
dramatize the importance of going to the polls and voting 
the legislation which now goes to the senate was sponsored by 
lewis and endorsed by the bush administration it was approved 
4000 just one day before the 25th anniversary of the start of the 
54mile march from browns chapel church in selma to the alabama 
state capitol in montgomery 
the march led by the late dr martin luther king jr began 
three weeks after lewis and a group of 525 demonstrators were 
attacked by alabama state troopers as they reached the edmund 
pettus bridge in selma while attempting to march to the state 
capitol 
we were confronted by billy clubs bullwhips and tear gas 
lewis said women and children were trampled by deputies on 
horseback 
this day which became known as bloody sunday sent shock 
waves around the world raised the nations consciousness and 
convinced the political leaders that the time had come for voting 
rights legislation he said 
congress normally insists that at least 50 years must pass 
before an event can be considered for historic designation but 
rep bruce vento dminn said bloody sunday was one of those 
events whose history while infamous was also instantaneous 
vento chairman of the house interior subcommittee on national 
parks and public lands said the selmatomontgomery march marks 
a passage in the social history of our nation 
national park service officials enthusiastically endorsed lewis 
bill at a hearing before ventos panel three weeks ago they 
promised to find 150000 in their existing budget to pay for the 
study so it can be completed within one year 
the law creating the national historic trail system requires 
that the national park service conduct a study to determine if a 
trail is of sufficient historical value to be marked and included 
in the system before it can be so designated by congress 
herbert cables deputy director of the park service said the 
agency wants to explore the possibility of putting together an oral 
history of the march and creating exhibits and markers along the 
route to interpret its significance to the public

former president jimmy carter said 
tuesday that settling soviet jews in the occupied territories could 
result in an international backlash that would hinder future 
immigration 
also tuesday soviet emigre and human rights activist natan 
sharansky urged the government to end its censorship of soviet 
immigration figures saying it was interfering with fund raising 
and publicity efforts 
asked about settling some of the thousands of soviet immigrants 
coming to israel in the occupied territories carter said 
i believe that the number of soviet jews that will be 
permitted to come to israel is going to be dramatically reduced in 
the future if these hopeful people coming to freedom are used to 
establish facts of israeli presence in occupied territories 
carter added that he was concerned because such settlement was 
arousing animosity and opposition throughout the arab world and 
other places in the soviet union and even in the united states 
israel captured the west bank and arab east jerusalem along 
with the gaza strip from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war israel annexed east jerusalem as part of its capital and has 
set up a military government to rule the 17 million palestinians 
in the west bank and gaza 
israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750000 soviet 
immigrants in the next few years 
carter made his comments at a news conference at bengurion 
airport at the end of a threeday visit to israel he visited 
egypt syria and jordan earlier as part of a middle east tour 
sharansky a former soviet refusenik who heads the soviet 
jewry zionist forum said some selfcensorship might be necessary 
to ensure the security of the immigrants 
but he added we need more support from world jewry and to 
make israeli bureaucrats work more effectively we need more 
public pressure we cant do it under conditions of censorship 
sharansky was joined in his appeal against censorship by 
officials from the jewish agency a quasigovernment body that 
shares responsibility for resettling immigrants 
the agencys spokesman gad benari said the organization was 
appealing to prime minister yitzhak shamir to have the broad 
censorship guidelines limited to two key issues longterm 
immigration projections and new transit routes 
the process of fund raising especially in our operation 
exodus campaign for the soviets depends a great deal on a constant 
flow of accurate information about the immigration benari said 
we are already having difficulties not in fund raising but in 
being able to deliver necessary information 
operation exodus aims to raise 200 million in each of the next 
three years from jews in the united states and europe 
the ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed by the 
government on march 1 amid mounting arab protests that the influx 
could lead to more jewish settlement in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip home to 17 million palestinians 
israeli officials said the arab statements raised the prospect 
of guerrilla attacks against the immigrants making censorship 
necessary 
officials have said that soviet jews are not being directed to 
settle in the occupied territories about 200 soviets settled in 
the west bank last year

the chairman of polands largest press 
cooperative said tuesday the solidarityled government had acted 
unfairly in deciding to liquidate it 
under communist rule the workers publishing cooperative 
muzzled unauthorized publications on monday the cabinet decided 
to do away with the group because it was seen as an organ of the 
nowdefunct communist party 
parliament must still pass the law dismantling the group 
slawomir tabkowski chairman of the cooperative said the 
government commission that developed the law had submitted to 
neobolshevik pressure aimed at attaining political revenge 
he said the cooperative had gotten only a brief chance to 
display its plans to reform itself and the government had taken an 
arbitrary decision 
under communist rule the party owned 95 percent of the 
cooperative those assets were turned over to the social democracy 
party which was created in january after the communist party 
dissolved itself 
a government statement carried by the pap news agency said the 
cooperative was an element of the structure of the political 
monopoly of a single party 
an often unobjective and manipulatory impact on the 
consciousness of the great masses of society was one of the 
basic elements of that system it said 
to maintin the cooperative in the hands of the social democracy 
party would put it in a privileged position over the other 
currently existing parties unions and associations it said 
the cooperative published the vast majority of newspapers on the 
market controlled the sale of newspapers through its monopoly on 
more than 20000 kiosks in the country and owned several important 
publishing houses 
last year the popularity of the cooperatives publications 
began to drop as new independent newspapers and dailies emerged in 
polands changing political climate 
in a report published monday in the social democracy partys 
newspaper trybuna the cooperative said that in january it 
published 44 daily newspapers and a wide array of other 
publications in the provinces 
its profits were a steady source of revenue for the communists 
and subsequently the social democracy party tabkowski said the 
cooperative had posted a profit of 10 million in 1989 and had 13 
printing plants 
its monopoly on newspapers along with censorship prevented the 
sale of underground literature which flourished after the 1981 
martial law crackdown that crushed solidarity 
the kiosks began to distribute some independent publications 
but their shelves are still covered by the cooperatives newspapers 
and magazines 
tabkowski said tuesday that its abolition would reduce the array 
of titles available to polish readers 
he said he would seek to retain some titles and would continue 
business as usual but he did not appear to have the support of the 
workers who run the kiosks 
tabkowski said the cooperative has 39000 employees and another 
38000 work in the kiosks 
as for the fate of the trybuna newspaper the social democracy 
partys official organ party secretary krzysztof janik said it 
might have to start publishing underground

gov terry branstad apologized for 
joking that one solution to child poverty is for the rich to have 
more kids but insisted he is not insensitive to the plight of the 
poor 
the republican governor said he doesnt regret having a sense of 
humor but he told reporters monday it was wrong to say the rich 
get richer and the poor have children 
he made the crack several weeks ago during a kiwanis club 
meeting after he gave a more serious response about what could be 
done for children living in poverty 
a columnist for the des moines register publicized branstads 
joke friday after initially defending his remark at his weekly 
news conference monday branstad changed gears minutes later 
in retrospect i think it was a mistake said branstad who 
is running for reelection in november its not a funny topic 
im sorry that i said that in humor 
democratic gubernatorial candidate don avenson claimed the 
remark reflected branstads lack of concern for the poor 
but branstad said his administration has started welfare reform 
programs and directed money to school programs for poor children 
im committed to seeing thats done branstad said i think 
we need to do all that we can 
the state has taken significant action and will continue to 
take action to help people move from poverty and dependency to job 
opportunities and a higher standard of living branstad said 
thats what this system is all about to help people

the colorado department of health has cited the 
federal drug enforcement administration for violating state air 
pollution standards by burning a half ton of cocaine in an 
incinerator last month 
dea officials expressed outrage monday at being issued a 
notice of violation for burning 1042 pounds of contraband 
cocaine on feb 23 in a us department of agriculture incinerator 
in lakewood a suburb of denver 
what do they think were going to do with it ship it back to 
colombia asked dea spokesman ron hollingshead 
hollingshead said at first he thought a phone call about the 
alleged violation was a joke 
harry collier a state air pollution control specialist said 
the department acted after receiving several complaints about a 
dense column of smoke when the cocaine was burned 
the dea used the incinerator because it could burn the drug at a 
temperature exceeding 800 degrees hollingshead said the high 
temperature was needed to keep the cocaine burn from turning into 
the worlds biggest crack cookout he said 
collier said the dea could have found other incinerators that 
would have complied with the clean air law

eleven years later than they hoped 
operators of the seabrook nuclear power plant turned on its reactor 
tuesday to begin running it up to full power 
at 359 am the 1150megawatt reactor achieved its first 
sustained chain reaction since lowpower tests in 1989 spokesman 
ron sher said he said the reactor operated at a fraction of 1 
percent of full power shortly after engineers partially withdrew 
some of the 57 control rods 
there is a real sense of accomplishment because everyone at 
seabrook station who has worked so hard can now continue the job 
that we have been organized to do thats prepare to generate 
muchneeded electricity for more than 1 million new england 
homes sher said 
in a nuclear chain reaction neutrons released by spontaneously 
dividing uranium atoms split other uranium atoms releasing more 
energy and more neutrons control rods interrupt that process by 
absorbing neutrons 
the reactor will be allowed to increase power to 100 percent 
during the next two to three months sher said a limited amount of 
electricity will be produced at about 10 percent but until then 
operators will shunt steam past the turbines that eventually will 
drive electrical generators 
the 65 billion plant finished in mid1986 after years of 
protests got its nuclear regulatory commission operating license 
last week following lengthy regulatory battles and a preliminary 
court skirmish decided in seabrooks favor 
the us court of appeals in washington declined last week to 
block the license pending further court action but still has 
before it an appeal filed by the massachusetts attorney general 
seacoast antipollution league and new england coalition on nuclear 
pollution 
public service co of new hampshire proposed building a nuclear 
power plant on the new hampshire seacoast in 1968 the company 
revived the project in 1972 with a plan to build two 1150megawatt 
reactors at seabrook for a total cost of 973 million the first 
was to operate in 1979 the second in 1981 
beset by construction delays increased safety requirements 
after the partial meltdown of the three mile island reactor in 
1979 regulatory snags and opposition by neighboring massachusetts 
owners mothballed seabrooks second reactor in the mid1980s

the army is gambling that congress will agree 
to end tank production while also approving money for controversial 
new weapons systems such as the lh attack helicopter senior 
pentagon officials said tuesday 
steven conver assistant army secretary for research and 
acquisition told a house panel that the army reluctantly proposed 
abandoning the m1 abrams tank production line and the apache attak 
helicopter because of the overall squeeze on defense spending 
conver said he recognized that it might be difficult persuading 
congress to halt tank production while also spending on new weapons 
systems such as the lh or light helicopter which the pentagon 
itself has begun reassessing 
i realize the political difficulty conver told the house 
armed services subcommittee on procurement were really throwing 
the dice on that one 
the difficulty made itself apparent during the hearing 
legislators who stand to lose coveted military contracts for their 
districts protested the cuts in current army programs others 
concerned about the costs involved in new weapons programs 
questioned the need for developing new tanks and helicopters 
i sense a disconnect between where the administration is going 
and where the congress is going on modernization said armed 
services committee chairman les aspin dwis 
rep marvin leath dtexas who said he had no parochial 
interest in the cancellation of the m1 or apache said i dont 
know how you think its fine to just destroy a production base 
gen donald pihl the armys top acquisition officer responded 
it is not comforting to think about the united states of america 
not producing tanks 
rep john rowland rconn suggested that rather than spending 
400 million to mothball the two existing tank factories in the 
united states one in detroit and the other in lima ohio the 
army should continue to make a small number of m1s and promote 
tank sales to foreign countries 
the lh program would last into the next century and cost about 
3 billion per year each helicopter with the latest in 
targetseeking and radaravoiding technology would cost about 75 
million defense secretary dick cheney last week ordered a 
highlevel pentagon review of the need for the lh 
some members of congress also are uncertain about the need for 
new light helicopters 
how can you realistically expect the congress to approve these 
levels of funding for a single helicopter program particularly one 
of questionable value asked rep larry hopkins rky 
conver replied that we are not even a little bit apologetic 
about asking congress for this program

former writers 1300 and the diminutive actor was jubilant 
the 65yearold barty who has starred in such films as 
rumpelstiltskin and willow said he was happy with mondays 
ruling because he didnt have to award 10 percent of future 
syndication profits for his show short ribbs to writerproducer

judges decision barty said being ordered to pay winckler 1300 
in disputed salary and 28 in court costs 
barty said the publicity hadnt hurt his career 
this has gotten about as much publicity as zsa zsa and i 
didnt even slap anybody he said but i wouldnt slap anybody 
id hit them in the knee 
winckler who sued barty in small claims court for 2000 said

but im not overly upset about it because i dont know how 
marketable the show is now he said 
thirteen episodes of short ribbs described as a saturday 
night live for little people were televised last fall on 
orange countybased cable station kdoc 
winckler a writer for television cartoons said he agreed to 
the relatively paltry fee of 100 per episode because he figured he 
stood to make a good deal more with 10 percent of the syndication 
fee but he said barty wouldnt pay him anything after the two fell 
out over creative differences

countries havel said at a news conference near the end of his

economists so there is a divergence of points of view 
havel promised that a draft bill will be submitted to the 
countrys assembly for approval in coming weeks dealing with 
economic readjustment and the tricky question of private property 
mitterrand announced no new aid or foreign policy programs for 
czechoslovakia beyond saying that france will without doubt

providing health care for all pregnant women 
and children would lead to healthier babies with fewer needs for 
costly special care later in life witnesses told a house 
subcommittee tuesday 
the shortterm costs of expanding care would be high medical 
and health policy experts agreed but the longterm payoff would be 
lower costs for expensive hightech care later on 
it costs taxpayers and private businesses more money if 
pregnant woman cant get medical care said former sen lawton 
chiles dfla chairman of the national commission to prevent 
infant mortality 
without adequate prenatal care a woman is more likely to 
deliver a low birthweight baby that might need costly medical 
services to survive 
increasing the birthweight of one such infant from two pounds to 
25 pounds would save 17000 in acute inpatient hospital care 
chiles told the house ways and means subcommittee on health 
extending that savings to the entire us population would 
result in immediate savings of as much as 90 billion he said 
and that does not even begin to address the longterm savings in 
health care school failure and lost productivity 
sen pete stark dcalif subcommittee chairman has introduced 
a bill that would provide publiclyfinanced health insurance to all 
children through age 22 and pregnancyrelated health services for 
all women 
the net cost of the package would be about 50 billion a year 
when medicare was passed in 1965 it provided 
publiclyfinanced health insurance for the elderly stark said 
the time has come to provide similar coverage for the other most 
vulnerable groups within our society children and mothers 
fifteen percent of the 37 million women who give birth each 
year have no health insurance to pay for maternity care richard 
schwarz vice president of the american college of obstetricians 
and gynecologists said in testimony submitted to the panel of 
those who do have insurance about 330000 of them have policies 
that dont cover maternity services he said 
an estimated 11 million children lack health insurance studies 
have shown that these children are about 20 percent more likely to 
be reported in poor health as are children who are insured or on 
medicaid birt harvey president of the american academy of 
pediatrics said in his testimony 
about 300000 infants die or are born with low birthweight every 
year said rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house 
select committee on children youth and families 
the answer is not difficult miller said in testimony before 
the subcommittee this isnt a secret formula were groping for 
its an attitude that pregnant women and children are entitled to 
health care he said

four republican senators say the american bar 
association by endorsing abortion rights has forfeited its role 
in selecting federal judges 
the time has come to end the abas preferred role in judicial 
selection we hereby strongly urge you take steps to terminate 
the official relationship with the aba the senators said in a 
letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
the letter signed by sens charles grassley of iowa orrin hatch 
of utah gordon humphrey of new hampshire and alan simpson of 
wyoming was written monday but was not made public until tuesday 
the aba is the nations largest lawyers organization its 
policymaking house of delegates voted last month to oppose 
legislattal action threatening a womans right to 
abortion 
thornburgh subsequentlion or governmeny said the resolution could bias 
the abas 
ability to judge the professsional competence of judicial nominees 
we share your publicly expressed view that positions such as 
these call into question the abas privileged role on judicial 
selection the senators told thornburgh 
the four all conservative members of the senate judiciary 
committee have been critical of the abas role in the fight over 
robert h bork nominated to the supreme court in 1987 by premaine lawyer 
who heads the 
aba federal judiciary panel rejected the letters premise 
our evaluation focuses as it always has only on three 
factors professional competence judicial temperament and 
integrity he said 
we have no litmus test and do not consider the views of the 
potential nominees on particular policy issues lancaster said 
the aba has adopted over 750 policy positions on legislative 
issues none of these is now or will be a factor in the 
standing committees evaluation of nominees 
there was no immediate reaction from thornburgh but when 
justice department spokesman david runkel was asked monday to 
comment he told reporters the controversy created by the aba 
abortion vote is still an open issue

environmental protection agency auditors are 
reviewing the agencys handling of an unusual case that put the 
bite on dozens of dentists because they sold old fillings whose 
toxic ingredients ended up in the soil 
the case has attracted the attention of lawmakers because it 
tests how far the government can reach to hold parties accountable 
for toxic waste contamination 
last week the epa inspector generals office said it was 
assigning auditors to conduct a 60day review of the case before 
determining whether additional study was necessary the review 
comes at the request of a pittsburgh dental supplier who claims the 
agency overstepped its authority 
the case hinges on amalgam the stuff that fillings are made of 
and whether it can be considered a hazardous substance after 
it has been removed from peoples teeth 
amalgam is a hard durable alloy dentists often save old 
fillings or leftover amalgam and sell it to processors who break 
it down into mercury or silver 
the epa alleged in 1987 and 1988 that pittsburgh dental 
suppliers roy ott his son ken and other companies sold amalgam to 
metal processor eugene bourdeaudhui as a result of bourdeaudhuis 
efforts to break the amalgam down the agency said soil in 
willington conn became so polluted with toxic mercury that it 
required a 710000 cleanup in 1985 
in seeking out responsible parties to pay for the cleanup the 
epa stunned the nationwide dental community by going after not only 
bourdeaudhui but also 58 dentists and several dental suppliers who 
did business with him 
all the parties have settled with epa according to attorney 
robert ging of confluence pa his clients the otts agreed last 
november to pay the government 30000 because they said the 
expense of further legal challenges was too great 
in announcing several of the settlements last year the epa said 
the agreements demonstrate that members of the dental community 
understand that they have a responsibility to make themselves aware 
of dental amalgams ultimate disposal method and that the dental 
community which controls the disposition of waste amalgam 
rather than taxpayers should bear the cost of cleanup 
but ging said in an interview tuesday that the principle 
involved compelled the otts last month to ask epa inspector general 
john c martin to review the case 
mr ott and his son were so offended by the waste and the 
injustice of the whole procedure that they felt it ws worth their 
time and effort to bring this to the attention of the congress and 
the people ging said 
several lawmakers agreed with the otts that the case raised 
basic fairness questions 
the fact that dental amalgam is considered a hazardous waste 
under superfund comes as a surprise to many said rep doug 
walgren dpa in a letter last year to epa a substance which 
is in my mouth and the mouths of millions of americans and is 
deemed safe by dentists and the american dental association 
hardly seems a candidate for superfund coverage 
walgren also said it ignored a common sense standard of 
reasonableness to hold ott and the dentists responsible for the 
actions of a third party in connecticut 
through the freedom of information act the otts obtained epa 
documents they said demonstrated excessive charges by contractors 
for the cleanup 
we share your concern that contractors may be charging 
excessive fees under the superfund law rep john dingell 
dmich and chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
said in a letter to the family several weeks ago

former secretary of state george p 
shultz has joined critics of the bush administration who say the 
united states should take a more active role in shaping the future 
of eastern europe 
but shultz cautioned against promoting independence movements in 
the soviet union beyond the baltic states 
in an interview at his oncampus office last week he also 
warned against the united states aggravating the middle east peace 
process saying president bush must make it clear he does not 
support dividing jerusalem 
reluctant to criticize the bush administration since leaving 
office last year shultz 69 has busied himself on several 
projects at the hoover institution in stanford university 
he lives here with his wife and still carries the worn brown 
leather briefcase bulging with papers that he hauled around the 
globe during 6 years as president reagans secretary of state 
instead of meeting daily with world leaders shultz is writing 
about his years in washington discussing political and economic 
events with other hoover scholars and stanford students and 
developing material for a book and some television documentaries on 
foreign policy called statecraft 
in a discussion of recent developments in foreign affairs 
shultz did not directly criticize secretary of state james bakers 
plan to allow participation of east jerusalem arabs in talks with 
israel 
but he indicated some dissatisfaction with the plan which 
triggered a dispute and shakeup in the israeli government and 
comments by bush suggesting east jerusalem was part of occupied 
territory with israeli settlers 
i think its very important for us not to condition the 
atmosphere by taking stands that tend to aggravate the situation 
unnecessarily shultz said there is no point in giving anyone 
the sense that we in any way support dividing jerusalem 
shultz said diplomacy has become a neglected dimension of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
he suggested the united states take a lead in shaping events in 
eastern europe 
it seems to me when things are changing in directions that are 
congenial to us and the balls are up in the air in great 
multitude it is a time to be leaning forward into the task of 
diplomacy and engaging with these problems shultz said 
the united states has had a great part in creating these 
changes and we have a great stake in the way they work out he 
said so were not an onlooker only we have been a participant 
and we want to retain our ability to affect what goes on 
several democratic leaders have complained the bush 
administration has not responded vigorously enough to changes in 
eastern europe shultz said us and european officials should heed 
the lessons of history 
we should remember that at the end of world war i the 
statesmen then designed a system in europe that didnt work he 
said after world war ii the statesmen who were the most 
influential and they were from the united states designed a 
system that did work 
that doesnt mean we have to thump our chests about it our 
friends had a lot to do with it too shultz said but the us 
influence has been a very positive one we have paid our dues 
shultz said the united states must tread delicately over whether 
to encourage independence movements among the soviet republics the 
united states has long encouraged or supported freedom efforts in 
other countries he said 
that doesnt mean we go around supporting armed insurrection 
everywhere but we promote freedom he said thats what we 
stand for i suppose thats one reason why the chinese are always 
edgy about us 
aside from the baltic republics where the united states has a 
longstanding position of not recognizing their incorporation into 
the soviet union its not for us to promote any particular 
rearrangement of the soviet union he said but the people 
there will be better served if they have a right to 
selfexpression about these matters 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev has a whole set of 
tremendous problems shultz said he clearly has to create a 
looser federal system in the soviet union than the one theyve 
got

police and federal agents hunted for 
clues tuesday in the wreckage of an apartment where a shoeboxsize 
package bomb killed a 70yearold man wintering in florida with his 
family 
sherwin william finlay a boating enthusiast from missouri was 
killed when a package left at the door of his rented apartment 
exploded when he picked it up said sgt steve weintraub of the 
jacksonville sheriffs office 
finlay had just moved to the apartment about a week before with 
his 67yearold wife dorothy and daughter gay lynn meek 35 who 
were not injured they said they had no idea why anyone would want 
to kill finlay 
investigators do not believe the explosion is related to recent 
mail bombings that killed two people in alabama georgia and 
jacksonville 
the blast monday was powerful enough to blow out the roof 
overhang of the twostory apartment building 
willi ellison agent in charge of the jacksonville office of the 
us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the bomb was 
more or less a homemade device its remains were to be sent to 
the atf laboratory in atlanta for analysis he said 
all 10 agents at his office were investigating the bombing 
along with the sheriffs office he said 
we want to find out who committed this crime ellison said 
the brownpaper package was not delivered by the us post 
office as were package bombs that killed a federal appeals court 
judge robert vance and savannah ga alderman robert robinson 
last december ellison said 
at this point i dont think there is a connection but were 
looking into all aspects ellison said 
unlike the bombs that killed vance and robinson the device did 
not contain nails as shrapnel he said shrapnel devices also were 
sent to the jacksonville office of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta but both were disarmed 
the family is from gravois mills mo where finlay worked for 
the missouri highway department for 20 years before retiring 10 
years ago 
a friend bryan taylor said he and finlay had sailed together 
for more than two decades as members of the lake of the ozarks 
yachting association taylor described him as an unlikely target 
and said the finlays had planned a boat trip through the 
intracoastal waterway to jacksonville where their son doug is a 
boat salesman 
weintraub said the couple had been in jacksonville since dec 1 
they moved into the apartment complex about a week ago and 
neighbors knew little about them 
the fbi is monitoring the case said george wisnovsky an agency 
spokesman

president bush pressed congress tuesday to 
move quickly on his 800 million aid package for panama and 
nicaragua but it became increasingly clear that there were serious 
obstacles to action before the presidents easter deadline 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger told a senate 
appropriations subcommittee that the aid is crucial to the survival 
of new democratic governments headed by president guillermo endara 
in panama and presidentelect violeta chamorro in nicaragua 
early success is going to be fundamental to whether mr 
endara and mrs chamorro are going to make it eagleburger told 
the foreign aid subcommittee 
at the white house bush gave visiting congressional leaders 
another reason to act quickly to turn up heat on cubas fidel 
castro the hemispheres lone communist holdout 
im terribly disappointed that castro seems to be firming up 
his totalitarian position instead of moving toward free and fair 
elections bush said while reporters were present for a 
picturetaking session 
id like to see him shift from that highly militarized island 
and let democracy have a chance said bush i think if we are 
helpful to nicaragua and panama it will simply increase the 
pressure in that marvelous island of cuba for change 
on capitol hill eagleburger sought to reassure senators about 
the need for the aid package and to press them on its urgency 
for panama where the administration is seeking 500 million 
the money is a oneshot economic boost he said the administration 
does not expect to come back next year for still more money 
eagleburger told them 
nicaraguas 300 million would not begin to flow until the 
current leftist government of sandinista president daniel ortega 
fully turns over power to chamorro he added 
but he seemed to acknowledge the tough job ahead and several 
members of the panel pointed to a thicket of potential problems 
that could delay the package beyond april 5 when congress recesses 
for easter 
we won we got what we wanted in nicaragua and panama 
eagleburger said now we are going to see if we have what it 
takes to sustain what we helped to start we may be about to learn 
that winning was the easy part 
the most immediate problem is how the package will be paid for 
the administration has proposed a list of cuts in pentagon spending 
to free money for the aid bill but is still negotiating with 
congress over which programs should be cut sen robert kasten 
rwis said he believed those talks would be completed in the next 
two days 
sen patrick leahy dvt the subcommittee chairman said it 
was almost certain that opponents of us military aid to el 
salvador would seek cuts in aid as a signal of displeasure over 
that governments failure so far to bring to justice the killers of

nicaragua itself still must find a way to reintegrate the contra 
rebels who have fought the government for the past decade into 
peaceful society the us government says there now are 15000 
contra fighters and 45000 family members most of them in 
honduras who need to be repatriated 
eagleburger acknowledged that suspicions are deep on both sides 
and that all the rebels are unlikely to lay down their weapons and 
move back by chamorros april 25 inauguration the package includes 
some 42 million for contra repatriation and anticontra lawmakers 
will likely want to debate that issue 
and leahy accused the administration of having its priorities 
wrong suggesting he might seek to divert some of the money to help 
bolster fledgling democracies in eastern europe nicaragua and 
panama are of slight economic security and foreign policy 
importance compared to europe he asserted 
a spate of other amendments also awaits the bill including a 
kastenleahy proposal to offer 400 million in housing loan 
guarantees to israel to build accommodations for soviet jews moving 
there under the soviet unions relaxed emigration policies 
eagleburger seemed to soften the administrations position on 
that proposal saying it would support the idea on the assumption 
that we can obtain adequate assurances with regard to those funds 
on israels plans for settlements in the occupied territories the 
statement was less categorical about needed assurances than recent 
statements by bush and by secretary of state james a baker iii 
in addition as the first mustpass legislation to come along in 
this years congressional session the panamanicaragua bill will 
become a popular target for pet projects of lawmakers dozens of 
members already have indicated an interest in offering amendments 
it seems to me we have to establish the emergency nature of 
this in a stronger way said kasten right now there is not 
enough of an emergency nature to this total package

the white house expressed concern tuesday 
about soviet troop movements around the breakaway republic of 
lithuania urging the kremlin to avoid creating an atmosphere of 
intimidation and increasing tension 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we dont 
have any indication of forcible control being exerted however 
he added the troop movements are cause for concern and they do 
precipitate a little higher level of interest on our part 
the statement was triggered by soviet military maneuvers in and 
around lithuania and the beefing up of soviet security around 
staterun factories and power plants 
the soviet moves apparently were designed to prevent lithuanian 
leaders from carrying out their declared intention of taking full 
control of government property 
the bush administrations statement was met by a new pledge from 
moscow that it would not use force in the baltic republics even 
though it rejects lithuanias vote to secede from the soviet union 
we are against the use of force in any region and particularly 
against the use of force domestically said soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze standing alongside secretary of state 
james a baker iii in namibia during a celebration of its 
independence from south africa 
baker commented the minister has said that on a number of 
occasions 
the united states has never recognized the forced incorporation 
of lithuanian or the baltic states of estonia and latvia into the 
soviet union in 1940 
on the other hand the united states has not responded to 
lithuanias declaration of independence by granting formal 
diplomatic recognition fitzwater referred in his statement to 
the lithuanian government but said that was not intended to 
imply a change in policy 
the us course has been to urge lithuania and the soviet union 
to negotiate a peaceful settlement for the future of the republic 
in contrast to the expression of concern voiced by fitzwater 
over the troop movements president bush praised soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev for his restraint on lithuania 
im glad that theyre the soviets still talking peaceful 
change bush said replying to reporters questions during a 
meeting with congressional leaders thats essential and theyve 
been very good about it the soviets have all through eastern 
europe 
bush added we want to see democracy and freedom we want to 
see selfdetermination and we also want to see peaceful 
evolution 
he said he had discussed the issue previously with gorbachev an 
administration official said bush and gorbachev at their summit in 
malta talked about soviet nonuse of force in the baltics and 
eastern europe the official said gorbachev assured bush that 
force would not be used 
the press secretary reading from a prepared statement said 
we continue to urge a constructive dialogue between lithuanian 
and soviet leaders 
this would be complicated by an atmosphere of intimidation and 
increasing tension he said in this regard the activities and 
statements of the soviet government over the past few days are 
cause for concern we are watching the situation closely 
fitzwater said he did not expect the issue to mar prospects for 
a summit between bush and gorbachev this summer i dont 
anticipate any cloud at this time in any way

opponents of the most restrictive us 
abortion law are organizing in hopes of persuading voters in this 
territory to overturn the measure in november 
a court test of a section of the new law already was under way 
wednesday less than 48 hours after gov joseph ada signed the 
bill which was unanimously passed march 8 by the pacific ocean 
islands legislature 
the law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the mother it makes it a thirddegree felony to 
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure a misdemeanor for a 
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person 
to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
janet benshoof director of the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project in new york was to be arraigned 
wednesday on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit 
abortion 
during a speech tuesday at the guam press club benshoof urged 
woman needing an abortion to travel to honolulu for the procedure 
i was very specific in my breaking of the law benshoof 
said the information that i gave which is now a crime came 
from the honolulu yellow pages 
two investigators from the territorial attorney generals office 
taped the speech and attorney general elizabeth barrettanderson 
filed the charge later in the day benshoof faces up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine if convicted 
the attorney general had advised the legislature before the vote 
that the measure is unconstitutional after the governor signed it 
she said it is not my duty to decide the statutes 
constitutionality but to enforce it 
a prochoice group guamanians for selfdetermination set an 
organizational meeting for thursday and pledged to fight the law 
the meeting was scheduled by about 35 women who met following 
benshoofs speech tuesday 
the law sets a referendum for the 130000 residents of this 
island about 1500 miles east of the philippines to decide whether 
to keep the law 
the issue of giving advice about abortions also was involved in 
a federal appeals court ruling in boston on tuesday 
the 1st circuit us court of appeals ruled that a federal 
regulation that prohibits governmentfunded family planning clinics 
from discussing abortion with clients is an unconstitutional 
infringement on freedom of speech 
the court said the speech at issue involves telling a woman 
about an activity in which she has a constitutional right to 
engage 
elsewhere idahos state senate put off until thursday a vote on 
what could become the most restrictive abortion law of any state 
supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass gov cecil andrus 
has said he is antiabortion but has refused to say whether he will 
sign or veto the measure 
a filibuster in the maryland senate against an abortionrights 
bill continued for sixth day on tuesday the bill would allow 
unrestricted abotions until a fetus is old enough to survive 
outside the womb 
in laredo texas the city council on monday passed a resolution 
stating that life begins at conception while a resolution is 
merely an expression of the councils opinion an antiabortion 
activist said hell push for a city antiabortion ordinance 
benshoof came to guam on sunday in hopes of dissuading ada from 
signing the bill she was unable to arrange a meeting with the 
governor 
this is an issue that effects all women in the united states 
not just guam she said 
guam residents are us citizens but cannot vote in us 
elections it has an appointed governor and elected legislature

savings and loan regulators are considering a 
controversial program that would pump taxpayer dollars into ailing 
thrift institutions before they fail 
the federal deposit insurance corp on tuesday chose eight 
states whose institutions would be eligible for open thrift 
assistance but postponed until next week approval of the program 
itself 
the states picked because they are economically depressed are 
alaska arizona arkansas colorado louisiana new mexico 
oklahoma and texas 
even if the fdic adopts the program the money for it would have 
to come from the resolution trust corp oversight board a treasury 
departmentled panel that controls the policy and pursestrings of 
president bushs sampl bailout 
the board has said in policy directives that it prefers bailout 
money be spent on closing failed sampls although it has not entirely 
ruled out open thrift assistance the board was reportedly unhappy 
with the fdics draft proposal because in some cases the old 
managers of the assisted thrift would have been allowed to keep 
their jobs 
congress in last years sampl law specifically authorized 
regulators to aid open thrifts in depressed states but some 
members of congress argue that propping up the institutions wastes 
money and does little more than postpone failure 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house banking committee 
task force on the sampl bailout and rep charles schumer dny a 
member of the banking committee have written in opposition to the 
plan 
a similar program in the past actually increased the ultimate 
cost of resolution and created unhealthy incentives in the 
entire industry they wrote 
however seidman said regulators would consider the assistance 
only i repeat only when the cost of the assistance is clearly 
less than the cost of closing the institution or any other 
alternative available 
he said the fdic would require that new capital be raised from 
private sources in addition to the federal money and that 
stockholders and creditors of an assisted institution be left no 
better off than if the institution were shut down the managers if 
they contributed to the institutions problems would be thrown out 
in the past seidman has argued that open thrift assistance is 
sometimes cheaper because seizing and selling an sampl so tarnishes 
its reputation that new buyers demand more government aid than 
would be required to revitalize the thrift under the old owners 
in a separate development the treasury departments office of 
thrift supervision demoted its top supervisory official 
transferring him to the agencys indianapolis office darrel 
dochow who had been the thrift offices director of supervision 
is swapping jobs with indianapolis director john downey 
dochow had been criticized by the house banking committee for 
his part in handling the failure of lincoln savings and loan 
association irvine calif 
the top official of the thrift office m danny wall left 
earlier this month he had been preceded by the agencys senior 
attorney jordan luke who also was criticized in the lincoln 
matter

namibia became the worlds newest 
nation tuesday ending 75 years of south african rule as africas 
last colony with traditional tribal dances and choirs singing 
liberation songs 
the south african flag was lowered for the last time at midnight 
local time and the new blue red and green namibian flag was raised 
as thousands of blacks and whites cheered and clapped at 
independence ceremonies 
the huge arid territory of 13 million people on africas 
southwest coast was a german colony until it was captured by south 
africa during world war i 
representatives of dozens of nations attending the celebrations 
were using the occasion for some behindthescenes consultations 
with the united states the soviet union and others holding an 
elaborate series of meetings 
among the foreign guests attending the celebrations are us 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze egyptian president hosni mubarak the leaders 
of at least 12 african nations and the foreign ministers of 
britain west germany romania indonesia and other nations 
south africa agreed in december 1988 to grant independence to 
namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for cuba to 
withdraw its 50000 soldiers from angola by mid1991 
the independence date was chosen to mark the 30th anniversary of 
the sharpeville massacre when 69 unarmed demonstrators were 
shot and killed in south africa while protesting apartheid laws in 
a black township south of johannesburg 
the day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the 
people of namibia but also with the people of south africa said 
hifikepunye pohamba who will become the home affairs minister in 
the new government 
pohamba is a member of the southwest africa peoples 
organization the group that waged a 23year war against south 
african rule and captured 57 percent of the vote in elections last 
november 
namibia for decades has had the same apartheid laws of racial 
segregtion as south africa although most were scrapped in recent 
years

angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
presented secretary of state james baker with a ninepoint peace 
proposal on tuesday including a call for a ceasefire and direct 
talks with usbacked rebels sources said 
the meeting took place as cuba warned it would retaliate against 
the usarmed rebels for an attack against a cuban supply column 
in angola last week the rebels say the cuban troops were escorting 
a resupply unit of the angolan government 
in its statement issued tuesday cuba said one soldier was 
killed and six wounded in the march 17 attack this new 
aggression against cuban troops will not be left without 
punishment the statement said us officials say cuba is 
complying with an agreement to withdraw its troops from angola by 
next year 
in namibia where the meeting took place on the sidelines of 
independence celebrations for the former south african colony a 
us official said dos santos appeared more flexible on the 
ceasefire proposal than he had until now 
baker is expected to discuss the angolan proposal with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze at meetings in windhoek 
tuesday and wednesday shevardnadze whose government provides 
angola with weapons to fight the usarmed union for the total 
independence of angola unita also met tuesday with dos santos in 
windhoek 
the ninepoint proposal has not been made public but was 
obtained from sources on condition they not be identified it 
appears loosely based on a peace plan dos santos outlined earlier 
this year 
the plan appears to have some of the same problems that caused 
unita to reject it in the past it fails to allow for 
incorporation of the organization in angolas political life 
instead the proposal envisages the right of citizens to 
participate in political and social life 
it also calls for the recognition of the legitimacy of the 
government and the state a proviso that unita also has rejected 
as a precondition for talks the rebels want the government to be 
determined by elections in which unita can participate as a group 
the change appears to stem from the plans ninthpoint which 
calls for direct contacts with a view to achieving a ceasefire 
and mechanisms of direct negotiations 
in windhoek a us official said dos santos appeared more 
inclined toward an early ceasefire than three months ago 
a ceasefire negotiated last june by zaires president mobutu 
sese seko broke down last summer and the angolan government 
attacked inside unita territory in february the sides have been 
locked in combat around the town of mavinga in recent weeks 
the angolan plan also calls for 
the neutrality and the positive attitude of third party 
governments this appears to be a reference to ending arms 
supplies by the united states and soviet union 
special and adequate treatment of jonas savimbis case 
savimbi has rejected past angolan demands that he go into exile

pillows and mattresses well its legal in colorado 
gov roy romer put to rest consumer fears by signing a law 
monday that deregulates the mattress and bedding industry making 
it legal to tear the tags off bedding items 
he formalized the law by gleefully tearing a label off a pillow 
at his state capitol office 
ken mesch a legislative liaison for the colorado department of 
health said the laws were enacted half a century ago to certify 
that bedding materials were sterile 
we have learned in the last 50 years a lot more about how 
people get sick mesch said and we know now that they dont 
get sick from mattresses 
rep jim pierson who introduced the bill told romer that as a 
child he was concerned i might get in trouble by accidentally 
tearing that label off 
ive been worrying about the mattress inspector jumping 
through the window for years and i hope this removes that the

hundreds of lithuanian youths 
volunteered tuesday to serve as the breakaway republics customs 
and frontier guards despite a kremlin warning not to change border 
security operations 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said the warning from 
moscow actually marked the beginning of negotiations on the baltic 
republics demand for independence he said lithuania agreed with 
much of the kremlin statement including the order to maintain 
trade ties 
lithuania declared itself independent on march 11 50 years 
after it was occupied by the red army and annexed to the soviet 
union the soviet parliament declared the decree invalid but did 
not say what steps it would take to stop the republic from seceding 
in a stern warning to lithuania on monday the kremlin ordered 
its own ministries to ensure there were no interruptions in customs 
and frontier procedures and in trade transport and communications 
lithuania tuesday moved ahead with plans to take charge of its 
borders however and youths volunteered to help 
i served two years in the occupying army and now i want to 
serve in my own countrys said a young man as he rushed to turn 
in his application in a cramped office in the lithuanian capitals 
center 
lithuanian officials said there were no plans to arm the border 
force 
the symbolic value of the force may help convince other 
governments that lithuania is controlling its territory and should 
be formally recognized as a fullfledged country said edward 
tuskenis of the republic parliaments information center 
the small baltic republic was quiet tuesday with none of the 
disturbing signs of soviet troop movements that intimidated the 
population over the weekend officials said there also were no 
signs of an economic blockade by moscow 
we are still receiving gas and oil lithuanias two most 
critical imports from the soviet union said prime minister 
kazimera prunskiene 
telephone communications between lithuania and the west were 
restored on monday after being cut off for 2 days due to what 
soviet officials said was maintenance work 
however lithuanian deputy prime minister kazimieras motieka 
said soviet military airfields in the republic have an excessive 
number of helicopters and perhaps also military units 
lithuania on the soviet unions western front line contains 
eight military bases and tens if not hundreds of thousands of 
troops according to emigre sources 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said he does not 
intend to use force against the rebellious republic 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze speaking tuesday in 
windhoek namibia reiterated that position we are against the 
use of force in any region and particularly against the use of 
force domestically he said 
the white house voiced concern about soviet troop movements on 
lithuanias borders but spokesman marlin fitzwater said gorbachev 
had offered assurances the kremlin would not resort to force 
a lithuanian activist said people still were worried that an 
attack might be staged on soviet soldiers or their families to 
create an excuse for a military takeover 
we are concerned for the safety of russian officers and their 
families said virgilius cepaitis who served as a lithuanian 
representative in the soviet parliament until the declaration of 
independence 
he claimed that a provocateur attacked soviet soldiers in 
azerbaijan in january helping set off a military invasion of baku 
in which hundreds died as troops tried to end ethnic strife and 
restore soviet power 
we have knowledge that similar troops are in lithuania he 
said but will they be used or not 
cepaitis said lithuanians also feared an embargo and that 
individual soviets in positions of power would cut off supplies 
with the soviet economy already experiencing extreme shortages 
of nearly everything he said it would be very easy for a manager 
who cannot fulfill all his orders to send his goods to the ukraine 
rather than lithuania 
lithuanian officials said the border force was intended largely 
to keep soviet shoppers from stripping lithuanian shelves bare in 
case of shortages 
mrs prunskiene said the government hoped to have 37 border 
posts within 10 days in spots where there are now traffic police on 
the soviet boundaries and kgb troops on the frontier with poland 
it will be a very gentle regime said mrs prunskiene 
there will be no visas on the soviet side or great demands but 
it will show there is a border already being observed and protected 
by our country 
many of the hundreds of youths who signed up serve on the force 
are recent deserters from the red army said ludwiga pociuniene 
who was taking the applications at the lithuanian parliament 
building 
lithuanians have been complaining since the push for 
independence began two years ago that their young men had been 
harassed and tortured and faced death in the ranks of the army 
motieka said the lithuanian government was registering the 
deserters in hopes of protecting them from forcible return to their 
units however he said military authorities had warned the 
government that steps would be taken to arrest the soldiers and 
return them to the army beginning on saturday 
in another development mrs prunskiene said she and deputy 
prime minister algirdas brazauskas met tuesday with factory 
directors to assure them that lithuania wants business to proceed 
as usual 
the kremlin order had warned lithuania not to seize state 
enterprises and sell them to private businesses and landsbergis 
said the government had no intention of doing that

labor party leader shimon peres pledged to make 
peace talks with palestinians his first priority after president 
chaim herzog chose him on tuesday to take on the arduous task of 
forming a new government 
peres said that if he succeeds he will accept us secretary of 
state james a baker iiis proposal to open a palestinianisraeli 
dialogue in cairo 
peres hardline rival prime minister yitzhak shamir of the 
likud bloc rejected bakers plan 
i think there is a majority in the knesset parliament for 
peace peres said i will try to form a government as quickly 
as possible 
the selection of peres as prime ministerdesignate gave 
centerleft labor a distinct advantage over shamir whose refusal 
to accept the us proposals led to the breakup of the likudlabor 
coalition 
shamir 74 remains head of a caretaker government until a new 
governing coalition is assembled he could get a crack at putting 
together a government if peres fails to complete the task within 
the sixweek limit 
a statement from his office said shamir respected the 
presidents decision but would not give up his campaign to set up a 
likudled government 
we will still make efforts to form a government under likud 
after peres definitely fails to form his own government shamir 
spokesman yossi ahimeir said 
peres 66 conceded that he and shamir each controlled 60 seats 
in the 120member parliament but said he believed he could win 
more support 
there is no doubt that we need to make up with people we need 
to find common ground peres said 
he left open the possibility of joining hands with almost any 
parliament faction even likud 
to do so he must oversee a shotgun wedding of small leftist 
factions and ultraorthodox religious groups that could undercut 
his ability to make the concessions needed to advance peace 
negotiations 
herzogs position as head of state is largely ceremonial 
israeli law left him with the task of breaking the tie between 
peres and shamir 
herzog said in a televised address after picking peres that 
labor was the largest faction and had the best chance after winning 
a noconfidence vote against shamir in parliament 6055 last 
thursday 
herzog said he saw no prospect for another laborlikud 
government because neither party would accept the others 
leadership 
common sense obligates us to give a chance to a new direction 
one other that which fell to a noconfidence vote he said 
he called for electoral reform to create more stable government 
noting that the prime ministry changed five times or once every 16 
months since he became president in 1983 
labor and likud have shared power in a broad coalition since 
1984 which was headed by peres as prime minister for the first two 
years 
peres needs the backing of 61 members of parliament to form a 
new coalition 
no candidate nominated by the president failed to assemble a 
government although peres in 1984 and shamir in 1988 had to share 
the power 
peres had looked like a shooin to be tapped as 
premierdesignated but a lastminute switch by a small religious 
faction threw the nomination into doubt until the last moment 
israel television said shamir had the edge because he was the 
incumbent and the religious factions would fit more readily with 
the conservative likud 
but israeli newspapers said peres remained herzogs likely 
choice because the party was technically the largest faction with 
39 legislators to likuds 35

a plan to create an international lending 
agency to aid the economic recovery of eastern europe may be 
completed by july treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
tuesday 
there is a sense of urgency among our european colleagues 
to get this job done by the economic summit this summer 
brady told a senate appropriations subcommittee 
the summit is scheduled for july 911 in houston the leaders of 
the group of seven nations britain canada france italy japan

said the meeting would be in california but did not give a 
specific date or location 
brady did not say what he and hashimoto would discuss but there 
was speculation the agenda might include efforts to defuse the 
growing trade friction between the united states and japan 
brady told the subcommittee that the united states would 
contribute between 8 percent and 10 percent of the 10 billion 
capital for the european bank for reconstruction and redevelopment 
the united states wants most of the funds aimed at 
privatesector initiatives for the emerging democracies of eastern 
europe he said 
participation by the soviet union should be limited to the 
amount of its contribution brady said the soviets tentatively are 
scheduled to contribute 6 percent to the banks capital 
brady has said the united states would refuse to participate 
unless the soviets are barred from borrowing any more money than 
they contribute 
we feel the purpose should to be assist and aid eastern 
bloc countries brady said we dont want to crowd out the 
needs of those eastern bloc countries by having an enormous 
participation by the soviet union 
representatives of the 39 nations involved in creating the 
agency plan to resume negotiations april 9 in paris 
one of the issues to be settled is the amount of capital the 
united states will contribute which will determine us influence 
on the banks decisions 
the europeans will have 51 percent of the banks votes brady

us district judge harold greene denied john 
poindexters motion for acquittal tuesday after the prosecution 
closed out its case against the man who was once president reagans 
national security adviser 
poindexters lawyers said they would begin playing seven hours 
of videotaped testimony from reagan on wednesday in an effort to 
bolster their clients defense poindexter is accused of 
obstructing and lying to congress to cover up the irancontra 
affair 
greene said evidence garnered from 10 witnesses called by the 
prosecution in its 7day presentation against poindexter suggests 
he adopted false information designed to obstruct congress 
poindexter sent oliver north to meet with the house 
intelligence committee where north lied by denying he was 
assisting the contras militarily the judge said in rejecting the 
motion for a acquittal 
there is evidence that the defendant destroyed a 
presidential finding as well as 5000 notes in his computer 
on the iran initiative said greene 
in addition the judge said the jury has heard evidence that 
oliver north got permission from admiral poindexter to check out 
and cover up five memos showing norths military assistance to 
the contras 
poindexter attorney richard beckler told greene there is no 
evidence congress had inquiries pending at the time poindexter 
supplied information on the contras and a november 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles 
in urging acquittal beckler said poindexters destruction of a 
presidential document on the iran initiative is the epicenter 
of the governments case yet the destruction of the document is 
never mentioned in the indictment said beckler 
greene replied that it isnt necessary for the document a 
presidential finding to be mentioned in the indictment 
poindexter is accused of covering up the us role in the 1985 
missile shipment and norths secret contra resupply operation he 
is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and 
two counts of making false statements 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb said there is overwhelming 
evidence to proceed with the five criminal charges against 
poindexter 
people like admiral poindexter who engage in conspiracies 
ordinarily dont speak out dont discuss what they are 
doing said webb he asserted that a trail of documents shows 
that poindexter conspired obstructed congress and made false 
statements 
the prosecutions final witness senate staff member eric 
newsom testified that it did seem strange how little 
poindexter said he knew about the missile shipment when questioned 
a year afterward by members of congress 
the defenses first witness former white house lawyer dean 
mcgrath said on crossexamination that he wouldnt have 
cleared letters signed by poindexter if he had known they were 
false 
the letters embraced statements made the previous year by robert 
mcfarlane denying that north was raising money for or assisting the 
contras militarily 
you would have stopped the letters ultimately signed by 
poindexter if they were false asked prosecutor louise radin 
i would have tried to replied mcgrath 
the governments primary witness was north who testified with 
evident reluctance for 3 days against his former boss 
last week north testified that he had watched poindexter 
destroy the presidential finding which ratified the missile 
shipment 
in highlights of the governments case against poindexter 
poindexter told the fbi three days after resigning his white 
house post as the irancontra affair was becoming public in 
november 1986 and after the meeting with senators that figured in 
tuesdays testimony that he had no working knowledge of early 
iran arms shipments and no direct knowledge that profits had 
been diverted to the contras fbi agent ellen glasser testified 
rep lee hamilton testified monday that poindexter failed to 
tell the house intelligence committee about the reagan finding 
relating to the missile shipment and thencia director william 
casey told the committee the document didnt exist casey sent 
poindexter a copy of the finding a year before the cia director 
denied its existence according to documents introduced at 
poindexters trial 
north testified he was reluctant to go to an aug 6 1986 
meeting to answer lawmakers questions but that poindexter sent 
him anyway telling his aide that you can handle it or you 
can take care of it north lied at the meeting by denying he was 
assisting the contras militarily north testified the decision to 
lie was his own

washington by polands prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who is 
expected to raise the border issue with bush

endorsed the idea of keeping the current borders 
bush called the german leader to talk about the move to reunify 
east and west germany and to discuss sundays election in east 
germany said press secretary marlin fitzwater

party in a unified germany 
kohls government recently agreed that the poles can be 
represented in the unification talks among the two germanys and the 
world war ii victors who divided germany and ceded part of its 
territory to poland 
poland has been worried that the looming reunification could 
mean a new unified germany will demand its prewar borders 
fitzwater said the administration is confident that kohls 
position is in line with what bush has said initially kohl 
refused to endorse the current borders of poland as permanent 
saying that question could only be answered by a unified germany 
despite his new position fitzwater noted the polish still 
have questions he said mazowiecki would raise the matter with 
bush during his state visit on wednesday 
when that happens the spokesman said we listen to his 
concerns very closely and we look forward to talking with him and 
well just have to see what the discussion leads to 
a senior administration official who briefed white house 
reporters on the mazowiecki visit said tuesday that administration 
officials are delighted that west germany is endorsing having 
the poles in on the unification talks regarding border issues 
what has been done meets the concern of the united states 
said the official who spoke on condition his name not be used

plate but he got a big kick tuesday out of seeing a lobbyist 
wearing a stalk of broccoli as a boutonniere 
bush broke into laughter when he spotted george s dunlop 
president of the united fresh fruit and vegetable association 
wearing the leafy green vegetable dressed up like a carnation on 
his lapel 
it was a jocular protest against bushs reported edict banning 
broccoli from the menu aboard air force one the presidential 
aircraft

and lobbyists attending a ceremony at the white house where bush 
signed a proclamation designating tuesday as national agriculture 
day and urged congress to help us pass a good fair farm bill 
when he came to dunlop bush did a doubletake laughed and 
insisted his photographer get a picture of him with the broccoli 
fellow 
reporters at the ceremony could not hear the presidents 
exchange with dunlop but the lobbyist said afterward that bush 
told him hey i like that thats good 
he said bush added that folks who like the taste of broccoli 
really ought to eat it its good for them just because i dont 
care to eat it it doesnt mean that others shouldnt 
bushs taste in food runs to pork rinds taco salads with 
hotpepper sauce and chocolate bars mixed with oat bran 
dunlop a former senate agriculture committee chief of staff who 
now represents the 60 billion produce industry said he had a 
florist at a local supermarket make up the boutonniere 
broccoli is a 400 million crop for american farmers in 
california the carolinas and other vegetablegrowing states said 
dunlop 
but the produce pusher said he harbors no ill feelings at the 
presidents disdain for the vegetable 
its a free country the lobbyist said theres plenty of 
things the president does like if he doesnt care for broccoli 
maybe he likes carrots or apples or potatoes 
and what did dunlop plan to do with his boutonniere 
well i think ill go home and eat it he said

independence supporters won estonias 
parliamentary elections giving secessionist movements a sweep of 
the three baltic republics according to preliminary results 
released tuesday 
in moscow activists of the democratic russia bloc that took 
control of the city council in sundays runoffs debated what to do 
with their power but they appeared divided and lacked a platform 
estonias initial results indicated candidates from the peoples 
front won at least 38 of the 105 seats in the republics new 
parliament said rina lohmus a correspondent for official estonian 
radio at least 16 seats were taken by the estonian committee a 
more radical independence group 
a group of small parties supporting the peoples front platform 
also won several seats according to the radio results from about 
15 seats still had not been determined lohmus said 
the secessionists win followed the electoral victories of 
independence movements in the neighboring baltic republics of 
latvia and lithuania 
in lithuania proindependence lawmakers declared their 
republics independence from the soviet union about two weeks after 
feb 24 balloting widening their split with moscow 
latvias elections were sunday and the proindependence 
movement won a majority however it remained unclear whether it 
could muster the twothirds vote needed to declare independence 
more people supported the peoples front than we expected 
said lempi tekone a spokeswoman for the estonian group 
she said the peoples front anticipated having the support of 
about threequarters of the deputies official results were not 
expected until friday 
yedinstvo a group representing primarily russianspeaking 
residents who strongly oppose the baltic independence drive would 
have about 25 percent of the seats she said 
ms lohmus said free estonia an election group created by the 
republics communist party had won about 10 seats among those who 
won seats from free estonia were the party leader vaino vyalyas and 
premier indrik toome she said 
the estonian communist party has not worked as hard for 
independence as many estonian activists would like but it is 
expected to support independence in any important legislative votes 
however estonia is unlikely to follow lithuania in pushing hard 
and fast for independence activists say the parliament is likely 
to discuss sharing power with the estonian congress a citizens 
gathering demanding independence and press for talks with the 
kremlin 
reformers also claimed victories in key runoff elections held 
sunday in russia byelorussia and the ukraine the slavic heartland 
that accounts for about 80 percent of soviet territory and 
twothirds of its population 
some 1610 runoffs were held in these republics after no 
candidate polled 50 percent of the vote march 4 in the main round 
of elections for local parliaments and councils 
the moscow electoral commission said 55 of the capitals 65 
seats in russias parliament were dominated by candidates of the 
reformist democratic russia alliance 
democratic russia won 263 seats in the 465seat moscow city 
council ensuring itself a 60 percent majority but it was unclear 
whether members of the alliance would be able to agree on a joint 
program 
we came to the bloc from various groups because we all shared 
some democratic views a councilman who gave his name as fadeyev 
told a meeting of democratic russia activists at moscow state 
university but now this stage is over we see that there are 
communists socialists social democrats and even christian 
socialists among us 
we must be united the only hope of the old party apparatus is 
to cause a split among us said sergei sukhorukov another 
councilman 
russian parliament member gavriil popov who presided over the 
tense gathering of about 150 activists suggested the alliance 
appoint committees to work out the groups platform and proposals 
for reforms 
the only immediate measures were a request to moscows 
prosecutor to investigate antisemitic leaflets that appeared 
during the elections and called democratic russia a united jewish 
front and a demand that local newspapers include party 
affiliation when naming election winners 
in leningrad reformists of a group called the democratic 
elections90 bloc won 60 percent to 70 percent of the city council 
seats the official tass news agency said

ted landsmark cant forget the bloody antibusing 
riots of the 1970s any more than people can forget the pulitzer 
prizewinning photograph taken of him under attack outside city 
hall by angry whites wielding an american flag 
but after previewing a television recreation of the nightmare 
the young black attorney and others are asking how well have we 
remembered 
a brief silence spread over the audience after a private 
screening monday of common ground based on the bestselling 
book by anthony lukas the docudrama will be broadcast sunday and 
tuesday on cbstv 
the group of about 60 people sat quietly perhaps fatigued by 
the 192minute hollywood recreation of the racial drama that tore 
this city apart 15 years ago 
then the talk started the voices many still bitter belonged 
to the people who inhabit common ground the story of three 
families caught up in the riots that broke out when black students 
were bused into the white neighborhood of charlestown 
i dont think anyone views this as pure entertainment but 
it could be an opportunity for the commmunity to disuss what 
remains to be done said landsmark who now directs the mayors 
office of jobs and community services 
not everyone who attended the showing was of that mind 
this is nothing but pornography said elveira pixie 
palladino an antibusing activist 
it could have been any boston high school auditorium more than a 
decade ago but it was not and thats what some found troubling 
its a shame that some people cant live with the pain and the 
same of the past said george walker whose halfsister 
cassandra twymon was bused to charlestown and whose family is 
featured in lukas pulitzer prizewinning book 
cassandra and i were just kids guinea pigs said lisa 
mcgoff whose charlestown familys story was also chronicled im 
not going to apologize to anyone for what this book is about 
the book is about alice mcgoff and her stand against the forced 
desegration she felt threatened her children and mostly irish 
community its also about rachel twymon and her belief that 
education could secure for her children a life better than that 
theyd known in the citys roxbury section 
those two strongly held beliefs came at an enormous cost to the 
families and to the city the public school system has never 
recovered and the racial battle lines though at times less stark 
remain intact 
i dont think its any stigma to boston but even the mayor 
didnt come out as well as hed like to and maybe the city didnt 
either said kevin white who was mayor during the riots 
funny none us were ever the same after the war was over 
it was a war and like any historic passage should be examined 
with the distance only time provides the producers said 
obviously theres a feeling among some of these people that 
they dont want this picture shown said daniel h blatt who 
produced the miniseries for lorimar telepictures co but what 
occurred has to be faced 
the producers and families featured in the film all of whom had 
veto rights on the script testified to its accuracy lukas said he 
only regretted that his 661page book had been condensed to a 
fourhour script that largely overlooks his third family the 
divers who tried to promote social justice amid a city in tumult 
mayor raymond flynn who was an antibusing activist in the 
1970s did not attend the private showing or return repeated 
telephone calls to discuss it the producers said he refused to let 
the production company film the more incendiary scenes on location 
he felt that shooting here would incite violence said 
blatt i cant put myself into his shoes but this problem of 
race and class and education is with us today its a reality

vice presidentelect virgilio godoy 
said tuesday that the sandinista front was engineering a campaign 
to discredit him by having him accused of fraud the case could 
prevent his taking office next month 
the allegations involve research foundation funds 
judge ramon rojas mendez of 4th district criminal court rejected 
the charge on a technicality tuesday but the charge could be filed 
again 
the judge said the accusers failed to inform police as required 
before accusations can be presented in court 
godoy hinted that forces in his own united national opposition 
coaliation were involved in what he called a campaign of 
calumny in an internal power struggle to weaken his position 
when the government takes office april 25 
he said he believes his life might be in danger if he is cleared 
in court 
this shows the the sandinista fronts interest in saying 
goodbye by kicking virgilio godoy and also the involvement of 
people from the private sector in this matter godoy said 
he said later when asked to expand on the private sector 
remark its an attempt on their part to weaken the figure of the 
vice president in order to obtain positions of power within the 
new government 
he named no names 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro and godoy were the 
winning ticket of uno a coalition of 14 parties and one native 
indian organization 
the uno swept general elections on feb 25 unseating the 
sandinistas after 10 years in power 
four men filed a document in court monday accusing godoy of 
fraud two of them joaquin mejia and juan manuel gutierrez belong 
to the liberal independent party godoy is president of the party 
the four allege godoy failed to account for funds donated to a 
research center by the west german friedrichnaumann foundation 
in rejecting the charge godoy cites a letter from the 
foundation that brands the accusations as false 
this is a new campaign to slander me godoy said in an 
interview on radio catolica 
in expressing fear for his life the vice presidentelect said 
while im under attack the danger of a physical aggression is 
still on the sidelines but when this media terrorism ends ill 
have to take better care of myself because then ill be closer to 
an attempt at personal aggression including physical elimination 
should godoy be arrested and tried he could not take office 
until the judicial matter is settled if convicted and imprisoned 
he also could not take office 
last november godoy was stripped of his legislative immunity as 
a deputy of the sandinistadominated national assembly as a result 
of the same accusations that action opened the way for legal 
charges to be filed

a former official of a baltimore bank said 
tuesday he has filed a revised lawsuit which seeks 4 million from 
the bank the cia and other federal officials for allegedly ruining 
his life after he balked at handling arms transactions for a cia 
front 
robert maxwell charges that he was threatened was forced to 
resign and suffered a nervous breakdown after he questioned the 
legality of certain dealings relating to an account held by the 
nowdefunct associated traders corp at the first national bank of 
maryland in baltimore 
maxwell left the bank in late 1985 taking with him several 
documents which he told a news conference tuesday linked 
associated traders with at least 23 million in covert arms 
shipments to central america angola and afghanistan 
published accounts by columnist jack anderson and others dating 
to 1986 have identified associated traders dissolved in the wake 
of that publicity as a cia front according to maxwells suit

more than a year ago maxwell brought a 19 million damage suit 
against the bank in state court the banks attorneys who 
succeeded in moving the case to federal court filed legal briefs

the armys top personnel officer said tuesday 
he opposes a proposed fouryear test of whether women can hold 
combatrelated jobs his air force counterpart disagreed saying 
there probably isnt a wartime job in his service that women 
couldnt do 
the test has been proposed in legislation put forward by rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo 
i dont feel that a test is necessary army lt gen allen 
k ono testified before the house armed services subcommittee on 
military personnel 
the fundamental issue is one of national policy theres 
no ducking that whether women should serve in direct combat and 
thats for you to decide ono told the lawmakers in the first 
subcommittee hearing on women in the military 
ono argued that other nations such as canada have wrestled 
with the issue of using women in combatrelated jobs and that the 
united states can learn from their experiences although canada 
recently offered infantry training to 80 women only one became 
qualified the panel was told 
the general said that it would also be difficult to conduct such 
a test in peace time and that there is no military need to bring 
women into combat fields 
the army cant operate without its women soldiers but in 
regards to combat arms we are able to recruit sufficient numbers 
of males ono said 
however lt gen thomas a hickey the air forces personnel 
chief told the lawmakers that there probably isnt a combat job 
in the air force that women couldnt do 
theyre physically capable theyre emotionally capable if 
you want us to put them there its up to you hickey said 
by us law women in the navy and air force are barred from 
serving in combat jobs the army is not covered under the same 
statute and has written its own policy to comply with the law 
ms schroeder submitted her legislation following the us 
invasion of panama in light of the fact that some of the 600 women 
who took part in the initial operation came under fire even though 
they were not detailed to units considered combatrelated 
ms schroeder who testified about her bill before the panel 
argued that excluding women from combatrelated jobs doesnt 
protect them from coming under fire on the battlefield and actually 
shuts off many routes of advancement for women who want to make 
the military a career 
the congresswoman pointed out that one army advertisement 
highlights a female soldier working in a communications van 
directing other soldiers in the front lines of battle 
mrs schroeder said that even though women are allowed to enter 
communications jobs they could be posted to one of the first sites 
targeted by an enemy eager to cut off an opponents communications 
it appears that women can be the first killed but theyre not 
allowed to be in the front lines ms schroeder said i think 
that really shows you how tenuous many of these classifications 
really are 
the congresswoman has proposed legislation directing the army to 
conduct a fouryear test of women to see how they would perform in 
the combatrelated units 
rep beverly byron dmd the chairman of the subcommittee 
said she is not in favor of opening combat jobs to women but is 
interested in making sure that women in the military have promotion 
opportunities in their selected fields 
ive got some misgivings about any change in the combat

a consumer group complained tuesday that 
supermarket displays putting sugarladen cereals at kidseye level 
are attracting children with candy ads masquerading as cereal 
such displays add to the problems of getting children to eat 
more nutritious foods said the center for science in the public 
interest 
victoria leonard said the center surveyed supermarket cereal 
displays and found childoriented cereals in colorful packages 
generally lower than the more nutritious cereals marketed for 
adults 
that makes it more likely to catch the attention of a child 
walking by said leonard children are being bombarded by candy 
ads that are masquerading as cereal 
cspi volunteers last november looked at the location of cereals 
displayed in 27 grocery stores in the boston san francisco 
chicago baltimore and washington dc metropolitan areas 
the average position of ten childoriented brands was the 
nexttobottom shelf while the average position of ten adult 
brands was the nexttotop shelf of a typical fourshelfdisplay 
the center said 
all 27 stores displayed adult cereals such as grape nuts or 
nutrigrain which have an average of 10 percent sugar content on 
higher shelves than childoriented products such as froot loops or 
capn crunch which contain an average 44 percent sugar content the 
center said 
surveyors shopped at stores of several supermarket chains 
including giant food inc safeway and lucky stores inc 
officials of luckys had not received a copy of the survey but 
spokeswoman judy decker said the company has never had an 
objective to place cereals on shelves to attract childrens 
attention 
decker said cereals are grouped according to manufacturer and 
how quickly they sell in the stores 
the lower shelves usually have the fastest moving items she 
said explaining that the lower shelves are spaced farther apart 
and allow stock personnel to stack more cereal than in the middle 
and upper shelves 
officials of other stores and food marketing industry 
representatives did not immediately return phone calls 
leonard said the center has written the stores asking that they 
change the displays and elevate the childrens cereals 
children are attracted by the brand names and flashy packaging 
and then plead with their parents to buy them she said we 
want parents to make the choice 
she said display techniques and intense television advertising 
of sugary cereals during saturday morning childrens programming 
compound problems of parents 
cspi is a nonprofit 200000member organization founded in 1971

pieces of a spy satellite put into orbit over 
the soviet union by the space shuttle last month are falling back 
to earth and burning up as they pass through the atmosphere the 
defense department indicated tuesday 
two of the items have already entered the earths 
atmosphere said spokesman pete williams the remainder are 
expected to decay within two to seven weeks 
williams did not identify the items as a satellite but said they 
were associated with last months secret mission of the space 
shuttle atlantis nasa sources have said astronauts aboard atlantis 
put a sophisticated 500 million spy satellite into an orbit that 
carried it over much of the soviet union 
the defense department said one piece burned up on reentry on 
march 15 but it did not say where a second piece made its fiery 
dive over the gulf of alaska on march 19 
there were reports from the soviets last week that the satellite 
had broken into four big pieces which were being tracked by radar 
the defense department acknowledged then that some debris from 
the shuttle mission would be coming back to earth us officials 
would not confirm the specifics of the soviet reports saying 
merely that the atlantis mission has achieved its goal 
on the average one to two items in space from the hundreds of 
space launches each year reenter the atmosphere each day 
williams said tuesday he refused to answer more questions

chinas request for a 150 million loan for 
road improvements wont be presented to representatives of the 
world bank a bank spokesman said tuesday 
peter riddleberger declined to say why bank president barber b 
conable decided to hold back the loan 
a source familiar with the banks work said conable decided 
monday to withhold consideration of the loan when it became 
apparent it would not be approved 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said last week that the 
united states would oppose world bank loans that were not for basic 
human needs 
the 150 million loan would have been used to improve roads and 
inland ways in jiangsu province in the east central part of china 
decisions on loans are made behind closed doors by the 22 
members of the banks board of executive directors most of whom 
represent several countries 
the united states controls only 19 percent of the vote but that 
is the largest single block usually enough other governments 
support the us view to give it the needed majority 
in june conable withheld consideration of nearly 800 million 
worth of loans to china after troops suppressed the prodemocracy 
movement he said that decision was made on economic grounds 
president bush asked that loans be held up as part of the us 
sanctions against the chinese government 
the board last month approved two loans to china worth 90 
million including one that had been delayed in june the us 
representative voted for approval the treasury department said 
the world bank with 152 member governments is the largest 
single source of aid to the third world making loans of more than 
22 billion a year

leaders of the national liberation army 
derided another leftist rebel group for surrendering to the 
government and pledged to keep up a sabotage campaign against the 
oil industry and us businesses 
at a meeting deep in the andes mountains last saturday with 
eight reporters eln commanders chided the april 19 movement known 
as the m19 for laying down its arms and transforming itself into 
a political party this month the m19 won seats on city councils 
and one mayors office in nationwide municipal elections on march 
11 its participation was considered a victory for president 
virgilio barcos peace plan barco has repeatedly exhorted other 
rebel groups to accept the plan 
we were always uncertain about the m19s ideological 
position said one eln commander identifying himself only as 
james now it seems our doubts were justified 
eln colombias most active leftist guerrilla organization says 
it will never negotiate with the government and holds fast to a 
marxistleninist plan to take and hold power 
its members denigrated the m19 
they fought for 16 years to win a mayors office said 
ernesto an eln operative in bogota we control large sections of 
the countryside who is more intellegent 
the eln has long wreaked havoc in the rural areas through 
ambushes of security forces and sabotage campaigns 
now it appears to be launching a news media offensive 
we are planning to increase our contacts with the press in 
order to clarify our positions and correct the lies of the 
government said commander argemiro 
the reporters contacted by eln operatives at cafes and other 
public places in bogota were taken by different routes to a 
dropoff point where rebels led them into the hills 
to reach the camp an associated press reporter accompanied by 
two rebels hiked nine hours in the dark across terrain ranging 
from dense jungle to rocky mountains 
at the camp on cleared land tilting down into thick mountain 
vegetation 12 eln soldiers shouted slogans as they raised uzi 
submachine guns and assault rifles toward a television camara 
they later performed training exercises for the cameras benefit 
before posing arminarm with the television crew 
after feeding the exhausted journalists soup made of animal 
intestines and dirty water eln commanders gathered them around a 
rickety table 
they demanded a national commission be formed to accept the 
release of 14 soldiers kidnapped by the eln in february 
the commanders said freeing the soldiers would prove elns 
commitment to humane treatment of prisoners of war and challenged 
the government to follow suit 
they accused the military of murdering rebels captured in 
combat a charge the government denies 
they invited reporters to return to the mountains to witness the 
soldiers releases at the end of this month 
although the eln is still learning how to deal with the news 
media it is highly skilled when it comes to attacking government 
security forces kidnapping opponents and sabotaging colombias 
oil industry 
for years local radio has peppered colombians with news of eln 
attacks on army and police patrols 
the groups armed forces are estimated at 1000 to 2000 rebels 
eln is said to finance part of its activities by ransoms paid by 
hundreds of cattle ranchers it kidnaps every year 
the commanders would not discuss the elns strength or its 
financing 
they had a simple message regarding petroleum facilities they 
plan to keep attacking them until the government nationalizes the 
industry 
the eln has pulled off eight dynamite attacks this year against 
colombias main oil pipeline running 500 miles from the border with 
venezuela to the caribbean port of covenas 
the commanders bristled when asked about the governments view 
of them as terrorists costing the nation millions of dollars in 
foreign exchange each year 
we are patriots who are saving the country money by preventing 
the export of petroleum that belongs to our people said a 
commander called dario the crumbs given to the government by the 
foreign oil companies are just a fraction of the money the country 
could earn if the industry were nationalized 
a month ago the eln swore to attack us business interests here 
as part of a sovereignty campaign to defend national interests 
the eln was founded in 1965 and took its inspiration from the 
cuban revolution 
now it says it is tired of being linked to fidel castro

a closed session of parliament tuesday 
charged 20 prominent jordanians including seven former cabinet 
members with financial and administrative corruption lawmakers 
said 
one lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity said those 
accused included four members of the parliament which was elected 
in november 
the names were made available to the associated press and were 
confirmed by four deputies who attended tuesdays session 
they cannot be disclosed under a law that prohibits open 
allegations against private and public figures unless they are 
convicted by jordanian courts 
state television said the parliament turned the case said to 
involve 37 projects including construction of a desert highway and 
expired food projects over to the attorney general to pursue 
those who were responsible for mismanagement 
the parliament has the power to charge officials with crimes 
if convicted the accused will face prison sentences and fines 
and the government will permanently confiscate their property and 
cash 
seven of the former cabinet members are members of parliament 
the sources said they confirmed an eighth person accused is a 
wellplaced politician 
also accused were a former senior security official two former 
senior central bank officials three prominent merchants a leading 
banker and five senior government department officials among whom 
one is member of parliament 
the deputy who discussed the case said the 37 projects were 
recently investigated by the parliament and ruled as tampering 
with public funds 
he said a previous government spent 935 million on the 
construction of a desert highway while the actual cost of the bid 
was 51 million 
another case involved selling expired food products the lab 
tests proved that these expired products caused cancer if consumed 
such as red meat canned food and coffee which were sold to 
jordanian citizens for many years the deputy said 
the government of prime minister mudar badran backed the 
parliaments decision to bring charges and the motion was adopted 
by a vote of 760 with four abstentions one deputy said 
the deputy said the abstentions in the 80member chamber were 
the four deputies who were accused 
badran has promised to heed parliaments demands to fight the 
alleged corruption of the government of his predecessor zeid rifai 
four days of rioting erupted in the kindom last april after 
rifais government raised the prices of basic food commodities and 
fuel this led to the downfall of rifais government which then 
was accused of corruption and restriction of political freedoms

secretary of state james a baker iii 
met tuesday with angolan president jose eduardo dos santos to find 
ways to end the african nations 15yearold civil war and a us 
official said dos santos appeared more flexible on a proposed 
ceasefire 
the administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it was the first meeting between a us secretary 
of state and an angolan president since independence from portugal 
in 1975 
president dos santos appeared more inclined toward an early 
ceasefire than he was three months ago the us official said 
baker also met with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and said he was assured the soviet union would not use force to 
crush lithuanias independence movement 
the minister made it very clear to me that they are hopeful 
questions involving lithuania will be handled through dialogue 
thats what the central government would like to have happen and 
thats what they expect to have happen said baker visiting 
namibia to attend the celebration of independence from south africa 
and he once again as he has done before said that force 
would not be the solution to the problem as far as the soviet union 
is concerned baker said 
baker said the talks covered a wide range of issues starting 
with the fact that what is happening here in namibia we both agree 
is a good example when the soviet union and the united states 
cooperate rather than compete 
shevardnadze said i believe namibia is the best example that 
this is realistic 
the united states brokered an agreement between south africa 
angola and cuba that led to independence for namibia ruled by 
south africa since it wrested control of the territory from germany 
during world war i the soviet government also was involved in the 
negotiations 
south africa demanded the withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola namibias northern neighbor as a condition of 
independence cuba has begun a withdrawal of more than 50000 
soldiers from angola but fighting continues between the countrys 
marxist government and antimarxist guerrillas 
sources in washington said on tuesday dos santos presented baker 
with a ninepoint peace proposal including a call for a ceasefire 
and direct talks with the americanbacked national union for the 
total independence of angola or unita 
shevardnadze whose government provides angola with weapons to 
fight unita met with dos santos on monday in the angolan capital 
luanda before the two flew here for the independence celebrations 
baker was scheduled to go to zaire on friday for talks with 
president mobutu sese seko and unita leader jonas savimbi who 
already has declared his support for a ceasefire 
ceasefire negotiations mediated by mobutu in june quickly broke 
down and fighting has intensified in recent months 
dos santos has insisted savimbis antimarxist guerrillas accept 
some conditions before a truce can be arranged 
the us administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a stalemate in the fighting could be a factor in dos 
santos apparent change of heart 
zaire reportedly serves as a transit point for the shipment of 
us weapons to savimbi american officials have refused to comment 
on reports that us aid to unita has increased 
the us official said baker made it clear to dos santos that 
american support for unita will continue until an end to the war is 
negotiated

the jury foreman in us district judge 
robert aguilars trial expressed outrage at the prosecutions case 
after jurors cleared aguilar of one charge and voted in strong 
majorities to acquit him of most other charges 
the justice department said tuesday it plans to seek a retrial 
i wish the government would go away and find something better 
to do san francisco bank executive carl damico said after the 
sixweek obstructionofjustice and racketeering trial ended monday 
with only one charge resolved 
aguilar a 1980 appointee of president carter was acquitted of 
one charge of trying to influence a friends criminal case by 
approaching a fellow judge 
mistrials were declared on the other seven charges after seven 
days of deliberations with reported jury votes leaning strongly 
toward acquittal on most of them 
they included a 93 vote to acquit on an unprecedented charge 
that aguilar had used his federal judgeship as a racketeering 
enterprise to obstruct justice 
defense lawyers accused the government of targeting aguilar as a 
liberal judge an accusation the justice department denied but 
which apparently hit home with some jurors 
damico said the case approaches a political trial saying 
he was speaking for a number of his fellow jurors the foreman 
called a retrial an unfair use of taxpayer money and an affront 
to a great judge 
but justice department spokesman doug tillett said the 
government intends to retry aguilar on the remaining charges 
each trial is different and each jury is different tillett 
said we believe as we always have that we have a good case 
aguilar attorney hugh levine was not surprised by the decision 
in a case that was not a cause celebre but an ordinary felony 
case i really cant imagine that any kind of prosecutor state or 
federal who viewed this case dispassionately would seek a 
retrial he said but the government has made an enormous 
investment and an enormous commitment to this it would be much 
more difficult for them to let go 
us district judge louis bechtle a philadelphia jurist 
assigned to the case by chief justice william h rehnquist 
scheduled the retrial for june 4 
aguilar who remains free without bail is returning to his san 
jose courthouse where he has kept a limited calendar of cases 
since his indictment last june he answered no questions after the 
verdict but issued a statement thanking god and his lawyers and 
adding i look forward to further acquittals 
even if acquitted aguilar could still be impeached and removed 
from office by congress which removed us district judge alcee 
hastings of florida last year despite his acquittal on a bribery 
charge 
but new york university law professor stephen gillers an expert 
on judicial ethics said if aguilar is acquitted his conduct 
should be viewed as less serious than that of hastings aguilar has 
not been accused of seeking personal gain through his office 
gillers said 
the jury verdict though inconclusive was a rebuff to the 
prosecution which portrayed aguilar as a judge blinded by his 
power and trying to throw his weight around the legal system on 
behalf of his friends 
the heart of the case was an accusation that aguilar improperly 
tried to lobby two colleagues for rulings favoring criminal 
defendants ronald cloud a friend and creditor facing trial for 
bank fraud and rudy tham a former teamster leader and friend of 
one of aguilars relatives who was trying to overturn an 
embezzlement conviction 
aguilar was acquitted of trying to influence clouds case and 
the jury deadlocked 93 for acquittal on the charge in thams case 
aguilar denied trying to sway either of his colleagues saying he 
wanted only to appear as a character witness for cloud and merely 
asked about the tham cases status 
another juror joan mcerlean said the prosecution failed to 
show motive she said the jury voted 75 for conviction on one 
charge that aguilar had relayed word in 1987 to abe chapman an 
exconvict related to him by marriage that chapman was being 
wiretapped

separatist campaign that was led by several guerrilla groups 
including the dominant liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
most militant groups surrendered arms under a july 1987 accord 
that allowed indian troops to be deployed in sri lankas 
predominantly tamil northern and eastern districts but the tamil 
tigers after an initial acceptance turned their guns on indian 
soldiers and continued the guerrilla war 
at the height of the jungle war against the tamil tigers about 
125000 indian troops were deployed in the northeast a phased 
withdrawal began last year after the new government of president 
rane 
majority against the sinhalesedominated government for its efforts 
to make peace with the tamils

in transylvania the region was ruled by hungary for centuries but 
was granted to romania under a 1920 treaty most of the estimated

hungarianlanguage television stations schools and other social 
institutions that were largely suppressed under ceausescu 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn on tuesday summoned

democratic gov william a oneill the 
dominant force in connecticut politics for almost a decade 
reversed himself tuesday and said he would not seek a third term in 
november 
oneill who had been saying he was going to run said he was 
loathe to enter what promises to be a nasty and negative campaign 
the modern process of campaigning is a rigorous one it exacts 
a toll on the body and the spirit which at this point in my 
career i do not choose to pay oneill 59 told a news 
conference 
oneill said his poor standing in the polls had little to do 
with his decision and he said his health which he had previously 
said would be the only thing that might keep him from running was 
not a factor during his nine years in office he has had a heart 
attack heart bypass surgery and more recently colon polyps one 
of which was cancerous 
he said he and his wife nikki had reached a final decision 
late monday 
he said he decided he could best serve the state by completing 
this term of office unfettered and unimpaired by the demands of a 
campaign for reelection 
a former lieutenant governor oneill became governor on dec 
31 1980 when ella t grasso resigned as governor in failing 
health he was elected to full terms in 1982 and 1986 
voters have given him poor job approval ratings oneill 
attributed that tuesday to record tax increases passed last year 
and lingering although far less severe fiscal problems this year 
polls released this month showed him as a weak contender in what 
will be a threeway race for governor this fall in addition to a 
democratic and republican candidate former republican us sen 
lowell p weicker jr has entered the race as an independent 
weicker said oneill was a class act and said he shared 
oneills foreboding about a negative campaign 
the immediate effect of the governors announcement was to make 
us rep bruce a morrison a liberal fourterm congressman the 
frontrunner in what is expected to become a crowded field for the 
democratic nomination he has been campaigning for the nomination 
since last fall 
the leading republican contender is threeterm us rep john g

before the explosions police said 
police said the slaying in north belfast occurred tuesday night 
they said at least two masked gunmen broke into the home of billy 
mcclure 43 and shot him to death as his wife watched 
later the irish peoples liberation organization claimed 
responsibility for the slaying in a message to belfast news 
organizations it said it killed him in retaliation for attacks by 
protestant paramilitaries on roman catholic hardliners 
the organization is a breakaway faction from the irish national 
liberation army which in turn is a splinter group of the mainly 
catholic ira 
police said mcclure had been convicted in 1974 for illegal 
possession of a gun but it was not known if he had any links with 
protestant paramilitary groups 
brian feeny an oficial with the moderate catholic social 
democratic and labor party denounced the slaying this murder is 
going to increase tensions in north belfast which has now become a 
virtual killing ground for both sides intent on carrying out 
retaliatory shootings feeny said in a statement 
they achieve nothing all it does is guarantee that another 
catholic will be killed in an equally sectarian fashion he said 
northern ireland minister john cope said the ira bombs were by 
terrorist gangsters set on a campaign of destruction for its 
own sake regardless of whose lives they put at risk 
short brothers said three other ira bombs have exploded at the 
companys nearby aircraft factory since july 1989 
after last months bombing at the aircraft hangar the ira 
warned there would be further attacks because the company was 
involved in government defense contracts 
a short brothers spokesman confirmed the company had a british 
ministry of defense contract to build the new starstreak missile 
security was tightened and high perimeter fences were built 
after the previous bombings the spokesman said 
the financially troubled company is the biggest employer in 
northern ireland it was stateowned until last year when it was 
sold to canadas bombardier inc an aerospace company 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the predominantly protestant province with the roman catholic 
republic of ireland

census officials were rebuffed tuesday night 
when they tried to count residents staying at the citys largest 
shelter for the homeless 
activist mitch snyder refused to allow a team of censustakers 
in the capitol hill shelter operated by his advocacy group the 
community for creative nonviolence 
snyder who on monday broke a nineday fast in protest of the 
citys cuts in spending for the homeless told the canvassers there 
were 1400 people in the shelter and that about 80 had completed 
census forms 
you cant use this census with any degree of legitimacy 
snyder said politicians can use these figures to say anything 
that they want them to mainly that the problem of homelessness 
isnt as bad as the american people have been made to believe 
because theres no way that you can legitimately count how many 
homeless people that are in this city or in this country 
he gave the completed forms to valerie lobban a district office 
manager of the census bureau 
ms lobban said that snyders actions would not deter her 
we kind of expected what happened here tonight mr snyder had 
publicized his intentions that he wasnt going to let us in but 
his actions in no way will affect what were trying to do ms 
lobban said 
she had 80 counters visiting shelters abandoned buildings 
sidewalks and other locations were the homeless might be found 
obviously there will be some people who will fall through the 
cracks ms lobban said it may be imposssible to account for 
each homeless person in washington we want to get a realistic 
estimate as to how many there are to make sure that the city gets 
its proper amount of federal funding 
wylie williams deputy mayor for economic development estimated 
that the citys homeless population had increased 50 percent in the 
past eight years to approximately 7500 
williams said that the number of homeless women in the city 
during that time had gone up from 1000 to about 2250 and that the 
dc governments funding levels for homeless service programs had 
more than tripled since 1982 from 8 million to 275 million 
the census effort was important because only when we know how 
many homeless there are can improvements be made in the delivery of 
services he said 
the city council on tuesday refused to restore 19 million cut 
by a committee from the fiscal 1991 budget for homeless programs 
snyder added that it was unlikely that the enumerators would be 
able to find a representative sample of the total amount of 
homeless persons who live in the nations capital 
homeless people are very resourceful snyder said they 
have to be to survive on the streets i doubt that the census 
takers will be going down every alley in the city looking into 
every shanty and crawl space these people should be allowed to 
have their dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night 
to accomodate government grandstanding he said

west germany said tuesday it will 
scrap as outmoded a 40yearold aid program for resettling east 
germans in light of the fast pace toward unification 
the bonn government also stepped up pressure on its new east 
german allies to decide quickly on the future governing coalition 
in east berlin 
volker ruehe chief of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democratic union conferred in east berlin with leaders of the 
threeparty conservative alliance that placed first in sundays 
east german elections among them was lothar de maiziere chairman 
of the east german christian democratic union and likely new 
premier 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said the cabinet decided to 
end the resettlement program on july 1 arriving east germans then 
will stop receiving special treatment 
west germany has about 61 million people and east germany about 
16 million 
nearly 500000 east germans have resettled in west germany in 
the last 14 months the exodus has devastated east germanys 
economy strained west german housing and job markets and worn out 
many west germans patience for the newcomers 
schaeuble said bonn expects major steps toward unification 
following sundays election and improved conditions for east 
germans would make special aid unnecessary 
we assume that by summer we will be able to achieve a 
currency economic and social community he said 
the two germanys are negotiating a monetary union in which the 
west german mark would replace east germanys currency they plan 
other links as part of an economic union to help rescue east 
germanys rundown economy and prepare for unification 
west germany further plans to provide massive social assistance 
to east germans as the nations come closer together 
hans klein kohls chief spokesman said the next steps toward 
unification were the main topic at the cabinet meeting he quoted 
kohl as saying east germany will have to undertake constitutional 
changes to achieve the planned currency economic and social 
steps 
kohl reiterated that he does not expect elections for a united 
germany to occur until after west germanys dec 2 elections he 
previously has said allgerman elections are unlikely until 
sometime next year 
president bush called kohl from washington on tuesday to press 
the us position that polands current borders should be 
guaranteed when the two germanys are united white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said 
they did discuss the polish borders question fitzwater 
said president bush reiterated our position that we are strongly 
supportive of the helsinki final act which calls for the 
inviolability of the polish borders 
polands prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki is expected to raise 
the issue when he visits bush this week 
schaeuble meanwhile said tuesday that west germany wants to send 
a psychological signal to east germans thinking about moving 
west and that it is possible emigres would be encouraged to return 
voluntarily 
tuesdays cabinet decision means new east german arrivals would 
be denied sudh special benefits as guarantees of a place to stay 
startingout money and lowinterest loans 
saarland state said tuesday it was immediately ending special 
resettlement procedures there and would send back any new arrivals 
bremen a city as well as a state already has taken that step 
kohl was under enormous pressure from leaders of west germanys 
11 states the population and politicians from a broad spectrum to 
eliminate or drastically reduce the special aid 
the resettlement procedures were designed to help east german 
refugees build new lives in west germany in a cold war climate when 
flights to the west were dangerous and rare 
in east berlin on tuesday the christian democratic union 
confirmed it will nominate de maiziere as their whip in parliament 
but that a decision on the future premier will be made later 
ruehe the west german christian democrats envoy invited de 
maiziere and other alliance for germany leaders to bonn for talks 
with kohl wednesday and again called for a broad coalition that 
would include the social democrats 
by including the social democrats the conservatives would have 
a twothirds parliamentary majority needed to declare a merger with 
west germany under a provision in the west german constitution 
such a merger is favored by kohl and would speed up unification 
the conservative east german alliance led by the christian 
democrats fell short of gaining an absolute majority in the 
400seat parliament and needs a coalition partner 
the social democrats who favor a slower reunification process 
have refused to enter a coalition government

muddy water surged over floridas 
panhandle on tuesday forcing more than 2000 people to evacuate 
and threatening a major bridge and water surged into selma ala 
forcing more evacuations there 
flooding also continued in central georgia 
at least 11 people have died in alabama since heavy rain more 
than 16 inches in some places doused that state last week 
more than 1500 people had to evacuate in three florida counties 
flooded by the rising choctawhatchee river an additional 500 
people had to be evacuated from other panhandle river basins 
flooded by water flowing down from alabama and georgia 
the worst florida flooding has been in the small farming town of 
caryville about 100 miles west of tallahassee 
most residents cooperated with the evacuation but a few elderly 
people had to be forced from their homes said washington county 
sheriffs deputy ronyon campbell 
they were kicking and screaming but its for their own 
good he said 
the choctawhatchee which inundated caryville was expected to 
crest during the night at about 21 feet 9 feet above flood level 
three or four families who had boats or could demonstrate their 
ability to cope were allowed to remain in caryville campbell said 
but no one who left could return to the flooded area 
hardest hit by flooding was elba ala where a broken levee let 
in the pea river and white water creek and forced about 2000 
residents to flee over the weekend water was receding there 
tuesday but few people were able to return to their homes as power 
and phone service remained out 
engineers announced tuesday that the elba levee had no 
structural flaws it just wasnt high enough 
the flood wave was larger than it was designed for said 
alton colvin area engineer for the army corps of engineers he 
said water poured over the top of the earthen dam eventually 
eroding its base and breaking it open 
mayor fred moore said the corps couldnt be blamed because 
they had never realized this much water was going to come in here 
at selma ala between 450 and 500 people evacuated tuesday as 
the alabama river spread into a mileswide lake curving around 
selma said warren rhodes director of the dallas county emergency 
management agency 
selmas central business district was just above the raging 
waters of the alabama river but other neighborhoods and homes and 
businesses on the opposite side of the historic edmund pettus 
bridge were engulfed 
at selmas elmwood cemetery about a halfdozen caskets floated 
out of the ground monday when water crept over the grounds city 
workers in rowboats tied the caskets to trees to keep them from 
floating off but there was nothing more to do until the water 
receded 
in the rural south alabama town of geneva emergency workers 
fought against a break in a levee near the courthouse with 
national guardsmen helping pile sandbags 
in the florida panhandle westbound interstate 10 was closed 
monday from bonifay to ponce de leon and will remain closed until 
next week because of erosion around the pilings of the highways 
bridge over the choctawhatchee said julian mccrary district 
maintenance engineer for the florida department of transportation 
in chipley 
high water also closed several other highways in the region 
flooding in georgia wasnt expected to end before friday 
in macon water swamped the citys water treatment plant 
residents were advised to boil water before drinking it and 
bottled water was sent to schools where water fountains were shut

the electoral college dominated by 
elderly deputies elected 40 years ago on mainland china cast 
ballots wednesday that are expected to give president lee tenghui 
his first full sixyear term 
protests continued for democratic change meanwhile as a student 
sitin at a downtown taipei park that began friday with about 200 
participants swelled to more than 5000 including about 50 on a 
hunger strike 
lee chairman of the ruling nationalist party was the only 
presidential candidate before the assembly but some members 
unhappy with the choice were expected to cast blank ballots in 
protest 
the 752member electoral college or national assembly began 
voting at about 9 am at a tightly guarded meeting hall in a rural 
suburb of taipei final results were expected later in the day 
the 11 assemblymen from the opposition democratic progressive 
party were not allowed to vote because they refused to swear 
allegiance to the nationalist government 
the election has stirred great controversy because the assembly 
is controlled by old men who were elected on mainland china in the 
1940s and then fled to taiwan with the rest of the nationalist 
government after losing a civil war to communist forces in 1949 
those deputies many in their 80s and 90s and in poor health 
were frozen in office to boost the nationalist claim to still be 
the legitimate government of all china several voted from 
wheelchairs or used canes to walk to the ballot box 
public pressure for the electoral college to be scrapped and 
replaced by direct presidential elections has dramatically 
increased particularly after some deputies proposed increasing 
assembly powers and the members salaries 
about 300 protesters led by huang hwa the opposition partys 
unofficial presidential candidate marched to the main road to the 
suburban hall wednesday morning to keep elderly assemblymen from 
voting one delegate was pulled from his car but appeared unharmed

a few dozen students got past about 2000 police surrounding the 
hall they gathered in front wednesday to sing patriotic songs and 
unfurl protest banners 
premier lee huan early wednesday visited the students 
demonstrating in chiang kaishek memorial park and said the 
government would consider their demands 
the day before president lee tenghuis office responded to the 
pressure by issuing a statement saying he agreed to convene an 
emergency conference to discuss changing the countrys political 
system 
it said nationalist and opposition politicians and other leaders 
would be invited to take part no date was set for the meeting 
wednesdays election was the first time the national assembly 
was asked to choose as president someone outside the chiang 
kaishek family which ruled taiwan for nearly 40 years after the 
nationalist retreat from mainland china 
the assembly elected chiang kaishek president five times and 
his eldest son chiang chingkuo two times 
the younger chiang died in office in january 1988 shortly after 
he began a political liberalization program that included the 
scrapping of martial law after 38 years and abolition of a ban on 
opposition parties 
lee tenghui was the handpicked vice president of chiang 
chingkuo and finished his term as president 
lee 67 is the first native taiwanese to head the government 
and ruling party and is regarded with suspicion by many of the 
nationalist old guard who believe he is not sufficiently committed 
to their dream of one day returning victoriously to rule the 
chinese mainland

the us news media missed the start of the 
american invasion of panama because defense secretary dick cheney 
decided secrecy was more important than ensuring media coverage 
according to a report released tuesday 
the report sponsored by the pentagon also criticized cheneys 
press secretary pete williams for not trying to convince cheney 
to send a group of reporters and photographers to panama in time to 
cover the critical opening battles dec 20 
i take the blame for what happened in panama williams said 
in response to the report he said the defense department was fully 
committed to the idea of allowing the news media to cover military 
operations and that steps already were being taken to correct 
problems described in the latest study 
the report also said poor planning by the defense department and 
the us southern command in panama prevented the media from 
providing meaningful coverage of newsworthy events long after they 
arrived key problems were lack of transportation and too few 
briefings on military developments during the brief war 
the report was written by fred s hoffmann a former reporter 
who until recently was a deputy pentagon press spokesman 
hoffmann made 17 recommendations on ways the pentagon can ensure 
the usefulness of media pools or a preselected group of us 
reporters and photographers who are to accompany a major military 
operation in remote areas 
one of hoffmans chief recommendations was that plans for 
military action include assurances that a pool travels with the 
us forces involved that recommendation was not immediately 
accepted but instead referred for further consideration along 
with five other suggestions 
because of a secrecydriven decision by defense secretary dick 
cheney the pool was called out too late and arrived too late to 
cover the decisive us assaults the report said 
hoffmann said cheney was unduly concerned that word of the 
invasion plan could leak out before the american troops arrived in 
panama 
over the fiveyear history of pentagonsponsored pools 
including a yearlong series in the persian gulf hundreds of 
newsmen and newswomen demonstrated they could be trusted to respect 
essential ground rules including operational secrecy the report 
said 
unless the defense departments leaders are prepared to extend 
that trust in hot war situations the pool will probably be of 
little value it said 
cheney told hoffmann that his first priority was safeguarding 
the security of the military operation and that i was aware of 
the conflict between that need and the goal of getting the 
reporters and photographers to panama in time 
as cheneys public affairs advisor assistant defense 
secretary pete williams should have foreseen the consequences of a 
late pool deployment the report said 
the american society of newspaper editors criticized cheneys 
delay in alerting the press pool 
cheneys decision to delay calling the pool until after the 
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made 
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security 
problem said jean otto chairman of the asnes pressbarpublic 
affairs committee 
since the creation of the pool there has been no security 
breach involving the press said otto who is associate editor of 
the rocky mountain news in denver cheneys lack of trust has 
instead breached the right of the press to report and of 
americans to learn what happens early in military actions

a legion of clipboardtoting counters sought out shelters 
subways and steam grates tuesday in the broadest attempt ever to 
find out te extent of homelessness since it became a national 
disgrace in the 1980s 
the tally went on into the night despite a spring storm that 
interrupted the count in vermont by dumping up to 22 inches of snow 
and the refusal of some shelters to allow censustakers inside 
some homeless didnt mind the government intrusion 
it shows that theyre starting to recognize us as humans and 
not the scum of the earth said chester broadwell 21 who 
answered questions at the waystation shelter in burlington vt 
no one expects the 27 million onenight us census bureau 
effort to yield a precise tally of americans with no fixed address 
critics fear an undercount will allow the government to justify 
cuts in services 
well get the vast majority said barbara bryant director 
of the census bureau which expected to hit 22000 shelters and 
street sites nationwide 
there are no believable numbers of homeless in america she 
said at a news conference in new york this is going to get an 
order of the magnitude of the problem 
some shelters offered free blankets and special meals to attract 
as many homeless as possible nationwide 15000 enumerators the 
federal euphemism for headcounters fanned out to visit an untidy 
world of shelters roosts and hideouts 
st pauls community shelter in toledo ohio lured the homeless 
with a party 
the biggest fear all of us have is that the dollars will be 
allocated according to the numbers that they get and the numbers 
will be significantly lower than the problem said shelter 
director ruth beshalske 
but robert allen 28 of toledo walked away when counters 
approached him 
what are they going to use the numbers for anyway to tell us 
there aint no homeless problem hell im a living example that 
there is a problem allen said we need jobs not surveys 
the homeless now estimated to number 250000 to 3 million 
were asked their name age sex race and marital status 
its part of the constitutional mandate for the country to take 
stock of itself every 10 years and a throwback to the days when the 
count was done with personal interviews instead of computerized 
mailings 
but critics such as david hayden of the justice house community 
in suburban washington dc refused to let counters inside and 
said the homeless could easily evade the census 
its akin to looking for needles in haystacks hayden said 
if people with clipboards can find them so can people with 
2by4s who want to rob them they should spend the money on 
decent affordable housing 
however christine mulholland census manager in milwaukee 
said they remain invisible unless theyre counted 
the counters many of whom are homeless and were paid 750 an 
hour got six hours of training in new york city alone 2167 
sites were tagged as places where the homeless congregate 
cold wet weather in new york city was expected to help census 
takers find and count more homeless people 
i expect that it will drive more people indoor to the shelters 
and to the subway system dwayne mayes a homeless man working as 
a district supervisor for the homeless count 
from 6 pm to midnight the count was focused on shelters 
armories missions church basements flophouses and hotels 
charging less than 12 a night 
a 2 am to 4 am phase 2 eroed in on bus stations allnight 
restaurants subway cars underpasses bridges railroad trestles 
cars bank machine vestibules park benches trash bins and other 
homeless hangouts 
in the third phase lasting until about 8 am counters were to 
interview people coming in and out of abandoned buildings for 
their own safety the counters have been told not to enter the 
buildings 
no sleeping person was supposed to be disturbed estimates of 
age race and sex would suffice 
we dont want someone pulling a blanket off someone and find 
they are staring at a knife or a pistol said kenneth meyer 
assistant regional census manager in new york 
census officials say the count will help determine such things 
as congressional and state representation and how much taxpayers 
dollars are doled out for homeless programs 
theres no way we can count everybody but its to everybodys 
advantage to have these people counted said ray bancroft a 
census official one obstacle is trying to gain the confidence of 
the homeless population to convince them it is to their benefit 
some homeless will elude the counters 
part of surviving on the street is being able to hide or being 
able to look like they are not homeless said kristin morse 
assistant director for the coalition for the homeless in new york 
but one who plans to stand up and be counted is steve weber 37 
who sleeps between the skyscrapers of midtown manhattan and begs 
money with a plastic foam cooler lid that says homeless man 
please help 
homeless people count too said weber sitting on a 
discarded cushion atop a plastic milk crate just because i aint 
got no money dont mean i aint a person 
activist mitch snyder of the center for creative nonviolence in 
washington has urged the homeless to snub the enumerators he and 
others have burned census forms as a protest 
it is impossible to locate and count more than a small 
fraction of americas homeless snyder said he said the process 
is demeaning because admitting homelessness is the final stage of 
brokenness 
but other advocates plan to cooperate even if the attempt is 
imperfect and unlikely to settle the debate over the number of 
homeless 
if we didnt count the homeless itd be like were saying 
they are nonpersons for 10 more years said bill friskicswarren 
of the coalition for the homeless in nashville tenn 
boona cheema director of berkeleyoakland support services in 
california said she planned to help guide the enumerators through 
their rounds even though she thought at least half the homeless in 
her area would be missed 
in sacramento calif a group concerned about assuring the most 
complete count of the regions homeless raised money to buy 1000 
blankets to give out at a free dinner at a salvation army center 
the message is get a free hot meal and a free blanket and be 
counted said greg bunker who was helping to coordinate the 
giveaway this wont get all of them but we think it will be a 
help

the gardner museum on tuesday offered a 1 million 
reward for information leading to the recovery of a dozen uninsured 
art treasures that were stolen in the largest art heist in modern 
times 
museum director anne hawley said the reward would be paid no 
questions asked and that it could even go to the thieves if it 
were to lead to the safe recovery of the art works 
she said sothebys and christies the international art auction 
houses had agreed to underwrite the reward through their own funds 
and through help from the art community around the world 
our firm has never done this before but there has never been 
such a catastrophic art theft sothebys president diana d 
brooks said in new york this is the most serious theft in our 
memory this is a very sad day for the art world 
hawley said she believed that no member of the museums staff 
had been questioned by the fbi as a possible suspect 
investigators admitting they had few leads turned their 
attention to what may have been similar recent efforts to break 
into the gardner and the museum of fine arts 
in another art theft new york city detectives displayed 1 
million worth of works stolen from a soho gallery last month that 
were found in a parked car two weeks ago police said six suspects 
were sought in the theft that included six leroy neiman paintings 
of european nightlife and an erte statue 
in boston investigators said about two weeks before sundays 
theft at least three people took part in an apparently staged 
disturbance outside the museum in the early morning 
one person pounded on the door and begged to be let in to escape 
people he had claimed were attacking him investigators said when 
the guard refused he got into a car with the two men who had 
supposedly attacked him and drove off 
museum guards were being interviewed to determine whether any of 
those involved in that incident matched the description of the 
robbers who had disguised themselves as police officers and 
entered the same door early sunday investigators said 
the investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
said the thieves removed video cassettes from the gardners 
surveillance system 
on jan 15 two men who appeared to be police officers tried to 
enter the museum of fine arts when it was closed for the martin 
luther king holiday said william mcauliffe the museums chief of 
security 
the men said they were responding to a summons for aid and asked 
a guard to let them in according to mcauliffe when the guard went 
to check with his supervisor the men left 
were checking to see if they were police mcauliffe said 
eleven paintings and drawings by rembrandt degas and vermeer 
and other old masters were among the works stolen from the gardner 
the loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
the doors of the fourstory tanbrick museum were posted tuesday 
with signs stating that the museum was closed for the day the 
museum was to reopen wednesday the one day of the week the 5 
admission fee is suspended 
a reporter allowed inside saw city police detectives and workers 
involved in the museums security mapping out locations of cameras 
and checking the equipment 
museum officials said monday that the collection gathered by the 
late isabella stewart gardner was only insured for restoration and 
conservation not for theft 
the cost of such insurance would be more than the museums 
annual 28 million operating budget and mrs gardners will bars 
the curators from buying and installing replacements said barry 
wanger a museum spokesman 
police said the two thieves gained entry by telling two security 
guards there was a disturbance in the area the robbers bound the 
guards with tape and spent the next two hours removing the art 
works 
the thieves took two paintings and an etching by rembrandt 
three paintings and two charcoals by edgar degas one painting each 
by edouard manet jan vermeer and govaert flinck and a bronze 
beaker dating from the chinese shang dynasty 12001100 bc 
wanger said the thieves also tried in vain to take a third 
rembrandt a selfportrait he gave no further details 
several of the pictures and at least one rembrandt were cut 
out of their frames which were connected to an alarm system the 
paintings ranged from matchbooksize to one as big as a desk top 
security consultants said while many museums have strict 
policies outlining who guards may admit after hours guards are 
often inexperienced poorly trained and susceptible to being 
intimidated or fooled 
in addition guards are often in short supply and museums must 
often close exhibits on certain days because of lack of staff to 
guard them 
its very common to see exhibits closed because of a guard 
shortage said steven keller a security consultant who was 
brought in to supervise security at the art institute of chicago 
after thieves stole three cezanne paintings in 1979 
most museums put in as many guards as they can afford but 
they usually cut back to a small number at night keller said 
robert burke the chief of security at the smithsonian 
institution in washington dc said the american association of 
museums recently recommended that museums adopt firm guidelines on 
who guards could admit people into museums after closing hours

democrat robert j gigante had 25916 votes or 34 percent two 
minor party candidates shared the rest 
i promise to work as hard as possible to represent you on a 
national level molinari told supporters and i pledge tonight 
to continue to concern myself with the quality of life issues that 
weve worked so hard on 
in his impoverished south bronx district serrano outdistanced 
republican simeon golar 61 a former city housing official and a 
third minor party candidate with all precincts reporting serrano 
had 26719 votes or 92 percent and golar had 2027 votes or 8

cochairman of president bushs campaign in new york in 1988 bush 
attended a fundraising luncheon that netted the young candidate 
223000 
in the bronx serrano had an enormous builtin advantage in 
voter registration golar who also held an independent line 
attacked him as the progeny of the bronxs notorious democratic 
machine 
the charge was a new one against serrano who won his assembly 
seat in 1974 as a reformer he rose to become chairman of the 
education committee and worked on consumer affairs 
the district one of the poorest in the nation elected herman 
badillo in 1970 as the first puerto rican to serve as a full voting 
member of congress then elected garcia also a puerto rican

airport tax as part of a fiveyear plan for commercial aviation 
transportation secretary samuel skinner included the 22 billion

speedier injections of clotbusting drugs to 
heart attack victims improves their chances of escaping permanent 
damage suggesting that ambulance crews can save lives by 
administering this medicine on the way to the hospital a study 
concludes 
even when hospitals are prepared to offer this treatment hours 
may pass before patients reach the emergency ward are evaluated by 
heart specialists and eventually hooked up to lines that drip the 
medicine into their bloodstreams 
the new research supports the growing belief that for this 
approach to work well it must be offered fast perhaps even before 
heart attack victims leave their homes 
the research found that 92 percent of clogged arteries could be 
reopened if the medicine was given immediately as a shot currently 
hospitals administer the medicine as a continuous drip infusion 
which takes longer to set up and is impractical for use by 
paramedics

a new wave of rap musicians is replacing 
drugs sex and cursing with the gospel and using the music of the 
streets to save souls 
transformation crusade is one of several rap groups nationwide 
with the idea that kids who dont listen to a sermon in church will 
listen to a rhyming message brought by musclebound hiptalking 
guys with a sound system 
were not like other rappers rapping for ourselves were 
rapping for god and no one else its not just entertainment its 
ministry we want to see sinners saved and saints released says 
the groups rap song rap righteousness and praise 
the group composed of present and former students at the rev 
jerry falwells liberty university recently released its second 
tape 
because its unorthodox and untraditional it reaches those 
who are tuning out the gospel said andre sims 26 a seminary 
student at liberty and a former gang member its the same 
gospel its new and different 
sims said he came to liberty to learn the gospel so he could 
take it back to the inner city rap serves that purpose he said 
it breaks the stereotype that christians are sissies or 
white or nerds said chris williamson 21 a senior majoring in 
biblical studies we lift weights we play basketball 
transformation crusade started about two years ago as a way to 
keep our fire alive and to find an application in the streets of 
the classwork at liberty sims said 
williamson and daryl fitzgerald do nearly all of the rapping 
sims preaches and sims wife kathy 24 designs their costumes 
and counsels with young women after the performances 
even though its the music of the street it goes 
everywhere says fitzgerald 22 a junior psychology major 
the group and others like it is going places 
christian rap first began to surface nationally in the mid1980s 
with christian musicians such as stephen wiley the first to be 
signed to a major label moving into territory once held only by 
secular rappers 
christian rap often thought too hip for the traditional 
christian station and perhaps too christian for the soul stations 
is beginning to be played on the radio the rappers say 
but airplay is mostly limited to special shows on saturday 
nights on christian rock stations said john styll editor and 
publisher of ccm contemporary christian music magazine in 
nashville tenn the magazine also compiles top50 lists of 
christian rock two rap songs were on ccms top 50 list for 
december 
its a booming area in christian music styll said its 
more lyrically driven its the perfect setting for christian 
thought 
the groups say they are busy playing on the road and recording 
tapes in the winter months transformation crusade spends three 
weekends a month on the road mostly playing churches in the 
summer they take rap to the projects 
they have played at myrtle beach sc in chicago new york and 
up and down the east coast this summer they plan to go to los 
angeles 
of a performance at the virginia correctional center for woman 
chaplain karen powell said the music was upbeat i thought it 
would appeal to the women and the experiences they had 
rap dc talk also grew out of friendships at liberty university 
the group plays mostly on college campuses and as an opening act 
for other christian groups said toby mckeehan they do about 115 
concerts a year 
mckeehan who grew up in washington where the group is now 
based earned the street nickname dc talk for his rapping while a 
teenager now he says the name stands for decent christian talk 
rap is the type of thing that whatever youre saying you need 
to be strong and bold about it mckeehan said thats the 
nature of rap if youre going to do rap youve got to be 
explicit whether its cursing or christianity as long as youre 
coming strong the kids are into theyll listen to what you have 
to say 
its nice to get on the mainstream said johnnie williams of 
the tulsa oklabased etw end time warriors 
sims said the kids on the streets know somethings different 
about these rappers the minute they see them 
we dont have gold chains no dancers he said some of the 
kids dont like it 
once they hear were not going to do any cursing not advocate 
drinking and hanging out they leave but its too late theyve 
already heard

there was a time hollywood was full of talent 
now it seems full of people with degrees in tv from the university 
of boy is this dumb 
two cbs sitcoms that resemble doctoral dissertations from that 
school are premiering tonight the worst is normal life 
costarring moon unit zappa and her brother dweezil as members of a 
lovably offbeat family 
the other is sydney it stars valerie bertinelli as a 
lovably spunky private eye named sydney kells 
each show is set in los angeles which certainly is a novel 
idea but a true los angeles sitcom requires yogurt thank you for 
not smoking signs references to other sitcoms and kids who keep 
saying thats gross 
neither normal life nor sydney have this though its 
enough to make you boo cbs for putting them on and taking grand 
slam off 
normal is about a freelance writer max gail and his 
family which consists of mom cindy laverne amp shirley 
williams a 13yearold boy josh williams and his older brother 
and sister the zappa kids 
the opening credits show a montage of home video shots of the 
family later on dweezil uses a home video camera could it be the 
writers turned to abcs americas funniest home videos for 
inspiration nah 
the opening crisis has the daughter fussing over getting pop to 
the airport in time she fears hell miss his plane to new york 
where his new play is being cast pop enters emits a few lines 
then withdraws 
he never is seen again this indicates he read tonights script 
the rest of the show features a neighborhood burglar the youngest 
lads efforts in basketball and the usual dropin visitors of 
sitcomville 
the visitors here are a doctor who keeps zapping himself with a 
burglarfighting stun gun and moon units best friend a lovable 
flake played by bess meyer the two women like to wear goofy hats 
the credits say that three writers were required to create this 
tableau okay but it has only one good line the line is so 
there remains the burning question of whether the zappas 
offspring of rock star frank zappa and occasional guest veejays on 
mtv can act 
well dweezil is a good guitar player but neither he nor moon 
unit appear quite ready for er you know dialogue 
we wont make fun of their names though they are children of 
the counterculture we pity the kids of baby boomers those poor 
urchins are facing life with names like justin and kimberly 
in sydney bertinelli formerly of one day at a time 
essays a woman who moves back to los angeles from new york to be 
closer to her boyfriend a handsome airline pilot but he doesnt 
call her now 
hes afraid to make a commitment he feels she doesnt need 
him 
well that means its time to get her life back together again 
to restart her budding career as a private eye good thing she 
comes from a police family and that her handsome brother is a cop 
by gumshoe he even steers her to a handsome lawyer who as she 
casually confides to a woman friend is semisingle sure the 
barrister thinks shes too pretty to be a private eye sure she 
turns out to be so darn smart and efficient that he well he 
goes and hires her 
there also is a bar in which she hangs out its run by an old 
pal of her late father the bars name is the blue collar everyone 
in it is strictly from brooks brothers though save for a 
greasyhaired geek named cheezy 
all this will cure insomnia however it must be said that tom 
byrd as the dashing pilot is the one bright spot in a dim show 
he deserves a medal for his deft deliveries of feeble lines 
bertinelli is chipper and lovely but here she mainly appears 
to be an advocate of speedtalking 
for the record she is one of four count em four executive 
producers that sydney required to get under way

the former prostitute and drug addict was testifying about her 
life at a washington church when she turned and shook her finger at 
the leader of the united methodist churchs battle against drug and 
alcohol abuse 
this is a spiritual problem and if youre here to talk about 
social programs then i dont think were going to get to first 
base the woman told bishop felton e may selected by the 
council of bishops to head an antidrug initiative in the 89 
millionmember denomination 
the next morning may heard a similar refrain from a hospital 
chaplain who told him doctors psychologists and others were 
agreed drug addicition is a spiritual problem 
i just said im in the right place in the right time may 
recalled in a recent interview 
while president bush has declared war on drugs the denomination 
decided to undertake an inititative of its own by appointing may to 
lead the churchs attack on drug and alcohol abuse although 
authorized by church law the denomination had never before 
assigned a bishop to a special issue 
still even some of the most committed to the drug fight within 
the denomination are skeptical about whether members of local 
churches are going to be willing to move over in their pews to make 
room for addicts 
the church often gets so caught up in systems in bureaucracy 
what it misses is taking a risk said the rev cecil williams 
of glide memorial united methodist church in san francisco 
addicts have to have a place pushers have to have a place drug 
abusers have to have a place they can trust 
the church often has not been that place some of the 700 
recovering addicts who regularly meet at glide memorial have told 
williams 
they often say all they want to do is preach us to hell 
our pain is not their pain he said until their pain 
becomes our pain the church is not the church as far as im 
concerned 
the 54yearold may who said when he took the job that he was 
worried the church would shrug its shoulders at the initiative 
said after a couple of months on the job he believes united 
methodists are ready for action 
i see a church that has consistently been involved through 
resolutions and pronouncements the day has come to act on those 
resolutions and pronouncements and that is happening now 
may and williams are planning a national conference on drug 
abuse in november and the health and welfare department of the 
board of global ministries recently organized an advisory panel on 
the public health aspects of the drug crisis 
in dallas the rev patrick williams of crestmoore king united 
methodist church is leading an effort to persuade area churches to 
establish fourblock drugfree zones 
the 54yearold may said there are reasons for optimism in 
battling drugs in the 90s 
with the growing recognition the united states is an addictive 
society and the failure of other initiatives in the battle 
against drugs there is greater openness to a spiritual approach 
that emphasizes the value of each individual he said 
in its own war on drug may has said i think the church must 
be reminded of the weapons that are at its disposal truth 
righteousness salvation faith and peace 
williams who said his church has helped more than 4500 people 
on crack cocaine the last four years agreed the denomination can 
be in the forefront of battling drug abuse 
i did it in my church first and now that i know i am 
convinced that the united methodist church with the appointment of 
bishop may can step ahead of the fray he said the united 
methodist church can do it if it really wants to 
may has asked all united methodists to light candles in the 
windows of their homes each evening as a symbol of hope for those 
who are hurting and suffering and to pray daily for them

effort that collapsed five months ago

would consider the offer which shattered a lull in the maneuvering 
for the parent of united airlines

coniston partners known for mounting proxy 
battles against corporate giants is in the hunt again for ual 
corp and some analysts believe the new york takeover trio will 
prevail 
coniston announced monday it was joining with united airlines 
three unions in a fight using shareholder ballots to unseat uals 
directors and buy the company for more than 38 billion 
the buyout plan by conistons keith gollust paul tierney jr 
and augustus oliver mirrors their attack on ual predecessor allegis 
corp in 1987 coniston also waged a proxy contest for gillette co 
in 1988 that it lost selling its stake in the personal care giant 
for a large profit 
coniston acquired a stake in allegis and threatened to oust the 
directors if the company did not divest its nonairline businesses 
which coniston believed were hindering corporate earnings and 
depressing share price allegis eventually sold the holdings 
now coniston is pushing for a sale of 75 percent of 
chicagobased ual to the companys employees contending a buyout 
offers shareholders a chance to realize the full value of their 
stock 
ual chairman stephen wolf said monday that the board would 
consider the offer at a meeting to be held soon a source said a 
meeting was scheduled for wednesday but ual would not confirm the 
meeting date 
although the buyout group has not disclosed its plans for 
financing the bid analyst jack hunter of howe barnes investments 
inc predicted the board would agree to the sale perhaps at a 
higher price 
i dont think theres going to be a war hunter said i 
think the board wants out 
morgan stanley amp co analyst kevin murphy said the groups 
ability to obtain financing was the key to their plan 
its going to be hard for them to win a proxy fight unless 
they can show the shareholders theyve got some financial clout 
he said 
analysts said ual was worth at least 25 more per share than the 
150 per share in cash and 25 per share in securities the 
conistonunion group is offering 
the new offer comes nearly seven months after los angeles 
investor marvin davis put ual into play with a 43 billion offer 
and two months after uals board offered to help the pilots 
machinists and flight attendants unions develop a viable buyout 
bid which has not materialized 
gollust said in a telephone interview that coniston was mounting 
the proxy fight based on our disappointment that the board was 
unable to produce another transaction 
obviously we reached a point where we felt it was in our 
interest and the interest of other stockholders to become more 
active he said 
coniston which owns 118 percent of uals approximately 218 
million outstanding shares previously had prodded the board with 
the threat of a consent solicitation to dump some of the directors 
a consent solicitation is similar to a proxy fight but is harder 
to win in a consent solicitation the party initiating the action 
needs to win approval of a majority of all shares outstanding 
winning a proxy fight requires approval of a majority of shares 
voting at a meeting 
uals annual meeting is scheduled for april 26 
under the conistonunion plan stockholders also would receive 
nonvoting common stock amounting to 25 percent of the total in the 
company based on the total shares outstanding the offer would be 
worth about 38 billion 
uals stock rose 12 to 15450 a share on the new york stock 
exchange monday the shares recently have traded as low as 121 
the new offer is about 40 percent less than a 68 billion 
debtfinanced buyout deal led by uals pilots and management that 
collapsed last oct 13 
that fiasco sparked a 190point drop in the dow jones 
industrials average and is considered a major event in the era of 
corporate takeovers because it instilled deep skepticism about 
whether such deals would continue

eastern airlines is cutting first class fares by 
about 40 percent in an effort to attract more business travelers 
but analysts said carriers on competing routes are unlikely to rush 
to make similar reductions 
it will probably be a week before we see matching or lowering 
fares said andrew geller analyst with provident national bank 
in philadelphia it wont be instantaneous 
in a related move eastern said monday it would raise travel 
agent commissions for sales of the new cutrate tickets 
the lower fares called ynot fares are good for domestic 
travel through june 30 carry no penalties are fully refundable 
and can be booked up to flight time 
industry analysts expressed surprise at the size of the cuts 
which put easterns firstclass tickets about 15 percent below the 
industrys full coach fares but they said they did not expect 
other carriers to immediately match or lower their rates 
its a marketing move a promotional program said robert 
decker analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago we might see some 
selective matching by other airlines but i wouldnt expect a 
widespread move at this point 
eastern is reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors where it sought protection following a crippling strike 
by pilots machinists and flight attendants a year ago 
eastern claims its 9000 daily firstclass seats are 65 percent 
full although eastern officials conceded that many passengers now 
flying first class on eastern are frequent flier passengers 
upgraded from coach 
current industry first class fares between new york and miami 
are 437 oneway while the lowest fullcoach fare is 333 
according to figures supplied by eastern the new ynot fare on 
that route is 276 one way 10 above easterns current fullcoach 
fare 
between chicago and atlanta the current firstclass oneway 
fare is 537 fullcoach is 360 and easterns ynot fare is 
298 
eastern passengers with fullcoach fare tickets will be able to 
exchange their tickets for firstclass seats for 10 more 
easterns fullcoach fares the lowest in the industry are 10 
less than the new fares 
eastern said it expects the lower fares to generate about 
400000 a day more in net revenue the fares are good for travel 
in the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands 
geller said the increase in travel agent commissions would be an 
incentive for travel agents many of whom have been wary of putting 
customers on eastern because of the carriers financial problems 
standard commissions industrywide amount to about 10 percent 
eastern will boost the commissions on ynot tickets to 15 
percent

general dynamics corp the nations second 
largest defense contractor is spending 5 million on a radio and 
newspaper advertising campaign aimed at washington insiders and 
capitol hill decisionmakers 
the ads were created before democratic change swept eastern 
europe and make no mention of a perceived easing of world tensions 
but the pitch is clear the government should not turn its back on 
advances in defense capabilities 
the campaign also comes as congress begins debate on next years 
defense budget at a time when pressure to reduce military spending 
is at its greatest in a decade 
this is a fairly soft message but the underlying text is 
keep the next generation of technology coming said gordon adams 
director of the defense budget project a nonprofit analyst group 
based in washington 
i dont think any member of congress is ever sold by an ad 
adams said monday what the ad does is put the issue on the 
table it says this is important sit up and take notice 
general dynamics first radio spot began airing last week it 
recounts the historic voyage of the uss nautilus the nations 
first nuclear submarine beneath the north pole on aug 3 1958 
the uss nautilus creeps forward threading between the arctic 
ice above and the shallow sea bottom below the narrator says 
the only thing more remarkable than the submarine itself is the 
submariner 
dedication to both has kept us improving submarines since we 
built the navys first 90 years ago were general dynamics a 
strong company for a strong country 
the nautilus ad is one of six radio spots prepared by 
clevelandbased wyse advertising budgeted at 5 million annually 
the effort will last at least two years and possibly much longer 
said chuck demund a general dynamics executive heading the 
campaign 
although the advertising budget is small for a fortune 500 
company general dynamics was 41st on last years list it is the 
first productoriented campaign for the st louisbased defense 
contractor in 20 years 
if youre in the defense business most of the decisionmakers 
are inside the beltway or so im told demund said the 
washington emphasis is heavy and pretty obvious 
an outline of the campaign distributed to top general dynamics 
officials indicates it is an extension of a mid1980s attempt to 
improve the companys image when its government contracting 
operations were under investigation 
although the probe later was dropped our corporate reputation 
was in disrepair and we were in the bulls eye of the medias 
target wrote bob morris a general dynamics communications vice 
president 
the earlier ad campaign promoted general topics such as 
education and voter registration as an imagebooster we decided 
it was time to start telling more specifically about what general 
dynamics does for a living demund said 
general dynamics gets about 90 percent of its business from us 
government defense contracts 689 billion in 1989 the company 
has more than 100000 employees and makes tomahawk cruise missiles 
in san diego nuclear submarines in groton conn f16 fighter 
planes in fort worth texas and m1 tanks in troy mich and 
lima ohio 
print ads are appearing in the wall street journal us news 
and world report fortune national geographic smithsonian the 
national review and washington monthly 
robert costello chief military procurement official in the 
reagan administration predicted that as military budgets fall 
other defense contractors will produce similar ads 
basically their issue is keeping as much business for their 
company as possible at the expense of competitors said 
costello now an analyst at the hudson institute an indianapolis 
think tank yes they can have an impact 
while its campaign germinated before the changes in eastern 
europe general dynamics is aware of the implications of democratic 
reform on military contractors 
the cover of the companys 1989 annual report is a photograph of 
cortland bryant a ships rigger at general dynamics electric boat 
division in groton conn where submarines are built 
i really think this countrys tough stand on defense helped to 
make all those good things happen over in europe bryant is 
quoted as saying on the cover nobody wants a war i sure dont 
and as long as weve got these boats out there i dont think 
well have one

a member of the commodity futures trading 
commission has proposed setting up an arbitration panel to iron out 
the regulatory agencys jursidictional disputes with the rival 
securities and exchange commission 
the compromise suggested monday by cftc commissioner fowler c 
west called for setting up a fivemember interagency 
jurisdictional arbitration panel to resolve disputes at the request 
of either agency 
the plan would require amending the federal laws that created 
the cftc which oversees the nations futures markets and the sec 
which regulates the stock and bond markets 
a spokeswoman for the sec said the agency had no comment on the 
proposal 
the cftc and the sec have a longsimmering dispute over which 
agency should have the power to regulate socalled hybrid 
financial products that share characteristics of both a security 
and a futures contract 
the dispute has heated up since a federal appeals court in 
chicago ruled last year that the cftcs regulatory authority 
extended to financial instruments with even a trace of futureslike 
characteristics 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals held that the sec 
overstepped its authority in claiming jurisdiction over hybrid 
products created by exchanges in chicago new york and philadelphia 
the ruling forced those exchanges to stop or never start trading 
the products known as index participations which allowed 
investors to trade on indexes tied to a whole basket of stocks like 
the standard amp poors 500 without actually buying the underlying 
stock 
that prompted sec chairman richard c breeden to call for reform 
to prevent foreign markets from copying innovative us financial 
products while their introduction in this country is held up by 
court battles 
last week treasury secretary nicholas brady said its time to 
make some changes he said the department was studying three 
scenarios merging the cftc and sec giving the sec authority over 
all financial futures contracts or simply giving the sec power to 
regulate stock index futures 
and two house members one from the committe that oversees the 
sec the other from the agriculture committee that oversees the 
cftc said last week they were exploring possible legislation to 
create a new super regulatory agency with authority over both 
securities and financial futures markets 
the seante banking committee has scheduled a march 29 hearing on 
the jurisdictional dispute 
under wests proposal each commission would appoint two 
qualified arbitrators who in turn would select a fifth member 
jursidictional disputes between the cftc and the sec would be 
submitted to the panel which would render a decision within 90 
days the panels findings would be final and not subject to 
reversal 
federal courts have encouraged arbitration and arbitration 
has been used even to settle disputes over international 
territorial boundaries west said i see no reason why 
arbitration could not be applied successfully to the gray area of 
jurisdictional disputes between these agencies 
rather than creating an expensive new federal bureaucracy west 
said his proposal would be taking the current system and making 
it work 
the arbitration panel could utilize the staff and facilities of 
either agency and west estimated it could operate for less than 
15 million a year

in the late 1980s columbia savings 
and loan television ads showed a man in a suit standing high atop a 
graph lines on the chart zigzagged up to demonstrate the companys 
growth and strength 
id say things are headed in the right direction the 
pitchman said 
if the ads ran now the guy might have to stand in a junkyard 
a metaphor not only for columbia but also for other california 
sampls that diversified away from homemortgage lending during the 
deregulated frenzy of the last decade 
a third of the states 21 biggest thrifts are in danger of 
failing even in a state economy that is one of the largest and 
healthiest in the world 
why are so many california thrifts sick 
a big reason is bad investments made under deregulation 
columbias years of success for example were built on 
investments in junk bonds securities that paid high interest 
because they funded risky ventures many were sold by drexel 
burnham lambert incs junk bond purveyor michael milken to his 
friend and ally columbia chairman thomas spiegel 
columbias heap of junk far bigger than any other thrifts has 
fallen in value by at least 800 million because of that the sampl 
no longer meets federal standards for capital reserves its cash 
cushion against risk 
spiegel has resigned drexel is in bankruptcy court milken is 
indicted the market for the risky securities he helped pioneer has 
collapsed 
columbias new president edward harshfield is trying to sell 
the whole 35 billion junk bond package many observers dont 
think he can 
i just have a feeling columbia may be too far gone said 
bert ely an alexandria vabased financial industry consultant 
the no 2 junk bond investor san diegos imperial savings and 
loan was seized feb 23 the same day regulators took over 
huntington beachbased mercury savings mercury had many problems 
but fell into insolvency partly because of another bugbear for 
california thrifts a risky outofstate loan 
the number of thrifts in california boomed in the early 1980s 
after federal and state laws were loosened permitting sampls to make 
a range of investments unlike banks they originally had been 
allowed only to make loans for houses 
california has about 12 percent of the countrys population but 
29 percent of the sampl assets 
the state hasnt suffered the economic shocks of texas and other 
energy states which could partly blame the skidding oil business 
for their sampl problems or arizona where thrifts were buried when 
real estate prices slumped 
analysts regulators and industry officials instead blame shoddy 
managers who courted big depositors with high interest rates and 
made illconceived investments well beyond the golden states 
borders besides junk bonds california thrifts put money into duds 
ranging from stud horses to yugo cars 
honcho thrift entrepreneurs with little experience used their 
newfound license to write not just adjustable rate loans but 
commercial and industrial loans loans on vacant land all that 
goofy stuff california sampl commissioner william crawford said 
making matters worse many conservative lenders followed suit 
often trying to recoup losses from early fixedrate mortgage loans 
made at low rates a lot of the good monkeys copied the bad 
monkeys crawford said 
crawford and marion sandler president of world savings and loan 
association said trying to do business outside the state was the 
biggest problem 
first you dont know the territory and second youre the 
latest pigeon she said 
many california thrift managers wrongly assumed every market was 
as good as california said alex sheshunoff the head of an austin 
texasbased firm that tracks the thrift industry 
they thought they had geographical risk diversification 
sheshunoff said what they wound up with was a piece of every bad 
deal no matter where it was 
some of the more prominent thrifts that ventured outofstate 
include great american savings bank of san diego now seeking an 
investor or buyer after losing 124 million in 1989 largely 
because of commercial lending in arizona 
great westerns 1989 profits fell 60 percent because of a 200 
million reserve for losses on commercial realestate loans most of 
them outside california the company is regarded as healthy 
nonetheless 
irvinebased lincoln savings the notorious thrift that 
regulators say will cost 2 billion to bail out lost money on 
arizona real estate and junk bonds it is the biggest sampl collapse 
so far 
mercury said a soured loan on a hotel in tulsa okla helped 
push it into insolvency with assets of 216 billion it had a 
negative net worth of 33 million when seized 
san diegos imperial had assets of 97 billion and a negative 
net worth of 60 million when regulators seized it besides big 
junk bond holdings imperials problems included shaky car loans 
and backing the importer of the yugo a car us drivers shunned 
ely attributes many of the problems to simply too many sampls with 
too few solid franchises 
theres parallels to the steel industry said ely what 
were doing is trimming away obsolescence its the same trend 
you see in any mature industry

the securities and exchange commission is 
looking into developing a centralized price quote system for the 
market in highyield highrisk junk bonds 
in a letter to a senate committee sec chairman richard c 
breeden said the agency needs to keep closer tabs on the junk bond 
market but cautioned against overly intrusive legislation 
the letter accompanied an sec report on junk bonds to the senate 
banking housing and urban affairs committee in which breeden said 
he wanted to improve the availability of information on price and 
liquidity of the securities 
the 84page sec report delivered to the committee last week and 
made public monday contained information on events and data up 
through fall 1989 
the committees chairman sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
requested the study after campeau corp sought bankruptcy 
protection for its huge us retailing operations which it 
acquired mainly with money borrowed through junk bonds 
the report does not deal with the collapse of drexel burnham 
lambert inc the junk bond pioneer whose parent sought bankruptcy 
court protection in february much of the data in the report came 
from drexel however 
the report stated drexel was the primary underwriter of junk 
bond issues with about a 43 percent market share in the first nine 
months of 1989 
the report also estimated the size of the entire junk bond 
market at 300 billion to 350 billion 
the sec report conceded that much of its information including 
the numbers of new issues the size of the secondary market and 
involvement of commercial banks in the junk market was based 
estimates rather than hard data because of what it called the 
persistent problem of obtaining quality research in junk bonds 
breeden said improved price information would assist investors 
market participants and regulators and he has asked the secs 
division of market regulation to study problems in developing a 
centralized price quotation system for junk bonds 
the issue of price quotes for junk bonds was highlighted last 
week when drexel which is liquidating its holdings stopped 
quoting prices on some 3000 to 4000 junk issues the firm had 
been the markets biggest and for some issues the only source 
for junk bond quotes 
breeden also warned that an overly intrusive approach could 
create other risks and significant costs 
therefore any steps to increase the direct regulation of 
trading in high yield securities should be carefully considered due 
to their potentially farreaching implications said breeden in a 
letter to riegle 
there was no comment from committee as the senate was not in 
session monday

thats the highest we expect to go gorman said but if 
everything is perfect we might go on the glacier a little higher 
 
its the highest objective ever attempted by gorman a 
recreational hiker who did virtually all his climbing in northern 
maines baxter state park and the white mountains of new hampshire 
before joining jim whittaker on a climb of 14410foot mount 
rainier in washington state three years ago 
whittaker who in 1963 became the first american to climb 
everest organized this years everest peace club and enlisted 
gormans company as lead sponsor and official outfitter 
included on the expedition were opportunities for physically fit 
people with little or no climbing experience to follow in the 
footsteps of expedition members to the 17100foot base camp or to 
advance further up to camp 3 
the cost of the treks is nearly 10000 with proceeds used to 
defray the expenses of the expedition figured at more than 1 
million with the united states through corporate sponsors and

canadas ambassador to the united states 
lashed out at american fishermen illegally plying his countrys 
waters saying the movements heightened the risk of injury from 
canadian patrol boats 
ambassador derek burney on monday cited recent incidents in 
which us fishermen have been caught working canadian waters and 
chased back into their own territory 
warning shots have been fired but no shots have been fired at 
us vessels he told the gulf of maine fisheries in the 90s 
conference i would like to keep it that way 
unfortunately the risk of injury has been heightened by the 
refusal of some us fishermen to obey the legitimate orders of 
canadian fisheries officials 
burney later denied he was threatening us fishermen i dont 
want there to be a situation in which shots are fired at fishing 
vessels from either country he said please dont interpret 
what i said as saberrattling 
burney also criticized legislation passed by congress last year 
banning the import of undersized lobsters from canada a panel of 
officials from both nations is determining whether the law is an 
unfair restriction of trade 
why could we not have asked the panel to give us an advisory 
opinion on this issue before the legislation was adopted burney 
said 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine said the 
legislation appeared necessary last year when canada began 
increasing its minimum size for lobsters but then backed off 
new england fishermen complain that canadas lower size limit 
gives canadian fishermen an unfair advantage canadian fishermen 
say their size limits are adequate to protect the supply of 
lobsters

the government said a new indictment of former 
drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond executive michael milken 
would be ready by midapril 
us district judge kimba wood on monday set a may 1 conference 
date to discuss when a trial would begin of one of wall streets 
most influential figures of the 1980s 
milken and two others were indicted last march 29 on 98 counts 
of criminal fraud and racketeering involving a range of alleged 
securities crimes some related to insider trading and fraud during 
corporate takeovers 
but the government plans to bring a broader or superseding 
indictment against milken that is said to include more charges and 
other defendants the new indictment first was expected last summer 
and prosecutors have repeatedly pushed back the date 
after the first indictment a march 1 1990 trial date was 
scheduled wood said she called mondays hearing in view of the 
fact that march 1 has come and gone 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said the new indictment 
would be ready no later than the week of april 16 
wood said the two sides would agree upon a definite trial date 
when they meet may 1 
obviously until we see the superseder were not in any 
position to talk about a trial date milken attorney arthur liman 
said he said the new indictment would require additional 
preparation because other defendants were expected to be named 
but lawyers involved in the case have said in the past they 
would need close to a year to prepare for what is expected to be a 
lengthy and complicated trial that would push a trial date back to 
early 1991 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce lee 
newberg were charged with defrauding clients through insider 
trading and stock manipulation between 1984 and 1986 they have 
pleaded innocent 
michael milken 43 left drexel last year and set up a 
investment management company 
drexel which pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay 
650 million in penalties to settle its case with the government 
is going out of business its parent company filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors last month

british executive john c cahill who 
wants to buy the 105yearold norton co calls his firm btr plc 
his family and worcesters largest employer a prospective member 
do i look ruthless do i look like attila the hun cahill 
said monday brushing aside analysts descriptions of his company 
as dogged in pursuit of cost targets 
but cahill didnt directly address the question of layoffs 
should he acquire the worlds leading abrasives manufacturer 
saying i cant respond to that at this moment 
despite cahills words employees of norton voiced disapproval 
of the 16 billion hostile takeover bid as about 3000 workers 
marched around city hall monday 
its more than just 75 a share its our livelihood its our 
jobs said john schafer an organizer of the rally timed to 
coincide with cahills visit 
the show of force by norton employees enlivened by chants 
renditions of god bless america and even the torching of a 
union jack didnt seem to deter cahill although he did change one 
meeting place to skirt the crowd 
i think this is a very healthy sign theyre showing loyalty 
and support said cahill adding that he had mingled with some of 
the earliest ralliers at around 6 am 
in boston gov michael s dukakis said he was watching the 
norton situation 
i am very concerned every time we have one of these hostile 
takeovers it seems to be directed at one of our best employers our 
best corporate citizens he said 
cahill said he hoped the takeover would marry nortons technical 
prowess with btrs operating techniques 
norton workers said they dont trust cahill and fear that if his 
bid is successful they could be out of a job or forced to meet 
stringent profit ratios btrs bid made its first public appearance 
in an ad in fridays wall street journal 
amongs those at mondays rally was 87yearold former chairman 
milton p higgins who was brought to city hall in a wheelchair 
my grandfather was one of the founders of the company its 
the best company in the city and we dont like to have it sold out 
to somebody else its as simple as that higgins said 
the employees cited btrs purchase of worcester controls corp 
in 1978 as grounds for their fears in 1986 the companys 
manufacturing operations were moved to north carolina although 
their corporate offices remain in marlboro 
but cahill maintained that was a decision by management that had 
been in place before the btr purchase and he insisted he had no 
such plans for norton 
norton management has said its board is evaluating the offer and 
will advise shareholders by march 29 over the weekend norton 
lined up a group of advisers including the investment banking firm 
morgan stanley amp co

the us trade deficit after two years of 
steady improvements could worsen significantly in 1990 economists 
say 
these analysts are concerned that a growing appetite for 
imported petroleum and steppedup demand by consumers for foreign 
products will worsen the nations trade problems 
analysts were anxiously awaiting todays report from the 
commerce department on the merchandise trade deficit in january 
in advance of the report many analysts were looking for the 
deficit to widen substantially from a 72 billion deficit in 
december which was the smallest shortfall in five years 
robert dederick chief economist of northern trust co in 
chicago said he expected a january deficit of 105 billion he 
said this would reflect a jump in petroleum imports as oil 
companies increased purchases to replenish heating oil supplies 
following unusually cold weather in december 
the merchandise trade deficit showed an 84 percent improvement 
for all of 1989 dipping to 1086 billion that followed a 22 
percent drop to 1185 billion in 1988 
but many analysts are concerned that the backtoback deficits 
will be erased this year as imports of cars and televisions flood 
into the country because a stronger dollar has made those goods 
more attractive to american consumers 
that increased demand added to the jump in oil imports could 
keep the monthly deficit hovering around 10 billion for the entire 
year some economists said 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting company said he 
was looking for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between 120 
billion and 125 billion which would make it the second worst 
imbalance on history the alltime high was a 1521 billion 
deficit in 1987 
without a weaker dollar we are just not going to get an 
improvement in trade evans said we are destined to have bad 
trade numbers for some time 
such a forecast could spell trouble for the bush administration 
which is counting on further gains in exports to help boost the 
fortunes of american manufacturers and dampen protectionist 
sentiments in congress 
last month president bush held a hastily arranged meeting in 
california with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu to press 
demands that japan do more to reduce its trade gap with the united 
states which amounted to 49 billion last year 
kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a top 
priority but us critics question whether the verbal commitments 
will be turned into significant marketopening moves 
sen john danforth of missouri the ranking republican on the 
senate trade subcommittee said monday that japanese officials he 
met with in tokyo last week appeared to be more willing to address 
us complaints about their closed markets 
there was a recognition that the time had come to redress the 
grievances we had said danforth who has been a leading critic 
of both japanese trade practices and the way bush and former 
president reagan addressed them 
but danforth told reporters i remain skeptical that the 
talks are going to lead to the kind of concrete results we hope 
for 
he said the talks will have to produce more specific sales of 
us products to japan as well as a broader general commitment by 
tokyo to removing impediments

japans central bank ended weeks of uncertainty for 
investors today by raising its key lending rate a full percentage 
point but the move provided no quick fix for the sinking stock 
market and weakening yen 
the bank of japan said it raised its official discount rate 
the interest charged on loans to commercial banks to 525 percent 
from 425 percent 
while uncertainty over interest rates had been cited as one 
factor in stock prices recent decline the tokyo stock exchanges 
key index still fell 45605 points or 148 percent closing at 
3080719 it was its lowest closing since 3067839 on jan 9 
1989 
that followed a decline of 135320 points or 415 percent on 
monday the indexs thirdlargest singleday fall 
although higher interest rates generally tend to make a 
countrys currency more attractive the yen weakened further 
traders said the move did not spur yenbuying because the market 
had been expecting it soon 
the dollar gained 010 yen tuesday closing at 15365 yen its 
highest closing in three years 
the yens failure to respond to the discount raise increase 
discouraged stock investors traders said 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said tuesday the banks 
move was preemptive to maintain price stability and would 
not appreciably slow japans economic expansion 
while not providing an instant remedy the rate increase would 
help both the yen and the stock market in the long run he said 
hiroshi saito president of nippon steel corp told kyodo news 
service that the action would stabilize financial markets by making 
investors think the interest rate has reached its top 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto also said it would contribute 
to stability in financial markets while helping to sustain 
noninflationary economic growth led by domestic demand 
but hideo mori president of sumitomo chemical co said the 
rate increase might damage healthy economic growth 
some analysts suggested the problem was waiting too long to 
raise the rate 
if the discount rate had been raised when the dollar was about 
to surpass the 150yen line the dollar could not have risen this 
high said toshiaki kakimoto chief economist with sumitomo bank 
monetary actions should be taken in more flexible fashion 
with signs of inflationary pressure growing the market 
originally had expected the rise to come shortly after general 
elections on feb 18

the yen all continued to weaken 
so far this year the dollar has risen by more than 10 yen or 7 
percent while the tokyo stock exchanges 225share nikkei stock

analysts said apple computers new 
more powerful and speedier macintosh model shows the company is 
continuing its strategy of selling expensive computers with high 
margins 
thats despite recent criticism from wall street and some of its 
customers that the company desperately needs a lowcost updated 
version of its original macintosh 
apple executives promised to soon get cheaper models of the 
enormously popular machines on the market 
we will have new compact machines at lower price points and 
modular machines at lower price points said randy battat 
apples vice president for marketing said at a news conference on 
monday he refused to say when those machines will be available 
apples new macintosh iifx is based on a speedy version of 
motorola incs 68030 microprocessor and is twice as fast as the 
macintosh iici introduced six months ago it will enable the 
company to compete better in the 6 billion a year market for 
workstations which are powerful and fast desktop computers 
the iifx costs from 9696 to 11497 nearly 3000 more than 
the iici and in the same range as competing workstations 
while the new machine wont satisfy critics who blame the 
companys recent financial woes on the absence of a cheap 
macintosh apple responded to the call for lower prices by 
announcing decreases of up to 50 percent on its memory expansion 
kits for almost all macintosh systems as well as laserwriter 
printers 
apple also introduced video display cards that improve graphic 
display and will compete with those sold by other companies a new 
release of its implementation of the unix operating system and new 
training programs for customers and authorized apple resellers 
the macintosh iifx is available in three configurations with a 
single floppy disk drive with an 80megabyte hard disk drive or 
with a 160megabyte drive each comes with 4 megabytes of internal 
memory and the machine is expandable to 8 megabytes 
many of the people who developed the new system originally 
worked at such rival workstation makers as sun microsystems inc 
and apollo computer 
william lempesis an analyst with dataquest inc a san jose 
market research company said the new machine shows that apple is 
continuing efforts to better position itself for a greater share of 
the highend corporate computer market where profits are higher 
in the last year apples sales have declined but the company 
made more money per machine indicating a switch in sales toward 
higherpriced more profitable units 
lempesis said the macintosh iifx will compete with workstations 
used for such technical work as computeraided design 
one of the objections to the mac has been pure speed and 
processing power said jennifer aurand a spokeswoman for 
versacad corp a software maker in huntington beach adding that 
the new machine allows the mac to compete more directly with 
suns sparcstation 
the new version of unix also is likely to assist apple in the 
workstation area federal government agencies and universities 
generally use computers that run the unix operating system 
the macintosh iifx won a generally enthusiastic response among 
industry observers but the company is still criticized for a lack 
of cheap products that has resulted in a loss of sales to companies 
selling less expensive ibmpc compatibles 
apple slashed prices by up to 17 percent on its lowend 
computers in february after laying off 400 people because of slow 
sales in the first quarter which ended dec 29 profit fell 11 
percent to 1248 million revenue grew just 6 percent to 149 
billion 
apples troubles recently led to a major management shakeup 
including the resignation of two division presidents and 
appointment of a chief operating officer

ec finance commissioner henning 
christophersen said today he sees the ec introducing a single 
currency in the second half of the 1990s as part of economic and 
monetary union in the trade bloc 
he said making the european currency unit legal tender across 
the ec could save up to 242 billion a year in bank charges on 
transactions among the european community currencies 
christophersen said the ecu would not necessarily replace 
existing currencies but its corresponding value could be printed on 
one side of coins and bills now in circulation 
i do not exclude that you can have a single currency and also 
protect the names of existing currencies he told reporters 
he added jokingly if consumers feel very european they can pay 
with the ecu side of bills and coins facing up alternatively 
they can let the national denomination face upward he said 
currently the ecu is a basket of existing ec currencies 
weighted in favor of the largest economies in the community 
christophersen released the commissions recommendations for ec 
economic and monetary union the topic of an intergovernmental 
conference that meeting due to start this year will discuss the 
necessary amendments to the ec treaty 
the benefits of the ec single market will be amplified by 
economic and monetary union and a single currency christophersen 
said 
in addition to a single currency his report proposes a central 
ec bank system called eurofed 
it also recommends the ec states coordinate their budget 
policies more closely and that those with serious budget 
difficulties solve them before monetary union takes shape 
christophersen rejected a british plan for economic and monetary 
union under which currencies would float freely against each other 
he said that would result in one currency emerging as the winner 
but the commission recommended looser controls on member states 
budget policies than suggested by ec commission president jacques 
delors last year 
christophersen said ec central banks could have some flexibility 
in following eurofeds policy depending on for example regional 
circumstances 
his report lists two key rules for monetary union ec states 
cannot fund deficits by printing money and the ec will not 
automatically bail out a member facing serious budgetary problems 
it isa clear message if a member state is following the wrong 
policies it will have to pay the price christophersen said 
the central bank system modeled on the us federal reserve 
system and the deutsche bundesbank would develop ec monetary 
policy and be independent of ec central banks and of the ec 
institutions 
it would comprise the governors of the 12 ec central banks who 
would set monetary targets and interest rates and a group of 
lowerlevel experts to monitor compliance with these 
in addition to responsibility for price stability eurofed would 
have exclusive control over the issuing of ecus 
ec finance ministers will review christophersens plans at a 
meeting in ireland on march 31 
the single currency and the central bank would emerge in the 
last two stages of the drive to economic and monetary union 
under the first stage starting july 1 the ec states would 
tighten their economic policy coordination free capital movements 
and join the european monetary systems exchange rate mechanism 
britain has not done the latter 
the second stage would start after the ec treaty has been 
amended which might be by jan 1 1994 during the third stage 
which may take another three years the ec would institute a single 
currency and create a central bank

brazilian soybean crop now being harvested will be smaller than the 
205 million metric tons forecast by the us agriculture 
department

ames department store inc which in 
january announced it expected to post its first annual loss has 
suspended the companys annual 10 cents a share common stock 
dividend 
directors of the rocky hillbased ames said monday that the 
dividend would not be paid until the company becomes profitable 
again the companys last quarterly dividend of 2 cents was paid 
thursday 
ames is expected to release its 198990 financial report within 
three weeks and company officials have conceded the news will not 
be good retail analysts have predicted ames might have lost more 
than 1 per share or more than 37 million 
ames has attributed its financial troubles to a weak retail 
environment and problems at the zayre chain of discount stores 
which it acquired in october 1988 
in january ames said it would post its first annual loss and 
that it would take a number of costcutting measures including 
laying off 85 workers 
douglas ewing ames director of investor relations said the 
decision to discontinue the common stock dividend will save the 
company about 37 million a year 
given that dividends are really a distribution of earnings 
and that were operating at a loss for 1989 theres a rationale in 
that ewing said no earnings no dividend 
the dividend suspension announced about an hour before the 
stock markets close monday caused ames stock to drop 37 cents 
to 562 cents a share on heavierthanaverage trading volume on 
the new york stock exchange the stock has been dropping steadily 
since january when it was selling for about 9 a share

japans economy should slow due to tuesdays hike 
in a key interest rate but there are questions about whether 
another big increase is needed to douse inflationary fires 
analysts said 
the question for most was whether the discount rate hike would 
revive the sagging yen a key cause of inflationary speculation and 
stock market instability 
the latest discount rate will bite said richard koo senior 
economist at nomura research institute but this kind of thing 
operates with a lag 
the bank of japan raised its discount rate by 1 percentage point 
tuesday to 525 percent it was the fourth hike of a series 
intended primarily to fight inflation 
the rate the interest charged on loans to commercial banks 
was 25 percent last may 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno called the increase 
preemptive saying it would ease latent inflationary pressures 
without appreciably slowing japans economic expansion 
japan already has some of the worlds highest prices throughout 
the 1980s japan managed to keep consumer prices stable and 
wholesale prices tumbled in the late 80s as the yens value shot 
up only land prices rose sharply by as much as 90 percent 
annually 
but recently the costs of items ranging from beer to school 
tuition have been rising 
last year japanese inflation was about 3 percent but fully 
half of the increase was attributed to a 3 percent sales tax 
imposed in april economists predict that excluding effects of the 
tax inflation will rise by about 1 percentage point to 25 percent 
this year 
the bank of japan has blamed the weakening yen along with 
labor shortages and a growing money supply for much of the 
inflation problem so far this year the yen has fallen 7 percent 
against the us dollar the weaker yen fuels inflation by raising 
the cost of imports 
kenneth s courtis senior economist with db capital markets 
asia said the money supply growing twice as fast in japan as in 
the united states with the supply of yen far outstripping demand 
the central banks rate hike was inadequate he said 
japanese rates will have to go up much higher to support the 
yen he said 
the dollar rose to 15365 yen on tuesday from mondays 15355 
yen the highest close since its 15369 yen level of march 12 1987 
courtis predicted the yen would fall to 165 against the dollar 
pushing the japanese inflation rate to about 25 percent 
but others said inflation may have peaked if the rate hike 
stabilizes the yen 
economist atsuko kitamura of yasuda trust bank said hotels 
taxis and other services were likely to raise their prices in 
april but she noted the cost of golf club memberships an early 
indicator of land price trends in japan was slipping 
koo said the central banks action paved the way for an 
investment slowdown he predicted the longterm prime rate would 
now go up half a point to 8 percent 
how many people can afford to borrow at 8 percent to speculate 
in land he said 
but others felt the market had adjusted in advance to the widely 
anticipated rate increase 
jan vandenberg an economist with merrill lynch said larger 
companies would react to the higher cost of capital by laying off 
parttime workers reducing orders to suppliers and cutting 
production 
but despite this economic cooling another increase might be 
required to trim land prices she said 
jason james a strategic analyst with james capel pacific said 
the market continued to shun the yen because the cost of land and 
other assets in japan was much higher than abroad reducing 
investment yields 
james speculated there remained a 5050 chance that the bank 
of japan would have to raise the discount rate again this year

the us trade deficit bloated by a record 
demand for foreign oil worsened dramatically in january climbing 
to 93 billion the government said today 
the commerce department said the january deficit was 205 
percent larger than decembers 77 billion imbalance most of the 
deterioration came from a 44 percent surge in oil shipments 
the january deficit was an ominous beginning for the new decade 
many analysts believe americas trade woes will worsen in coming 
years as us dependence on foreign oil grows 
for january exports climbed to an alltime high of 321 
billion 4 percent above the december level 
however this gain was swamped by a 73 percent surge in 
imports which increased to 413 billion 
the trade deficit the difference between imports and exports 
was the largest since a 101 billion imbalance in november 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the january increase showed export growth has been outpacing growth 
in imports 
these numbers are pretty much as expected due to the deficit 
drop in december which was the lowest in five years everyone 
seemed to realize they couldnt maintain that low level and so it 
was expected that there would be an increase in january 
fitzwater said 
the us trade deficit has been improving for the past two 
years falling to 109 billion last year down 8 percent from 1988 
but many economists predicted the 1990 deficit could begin 
rising again because of the oil bill and gains in the value of the 
dollar a stronger us currency makes imports cheaper for 
americans and us products less competitive on overseas markets 
the huge 44 percent surge in oil imports did not come as a 
surprise with analysts blaming the rise on decembers record cold 
weather which caused oil companies to import heavily in january to 
restock depleted supplies 
the total volume of oil 291278 barrels was an alltime high 
topping a previous record set in august 
prices shot up to 2013 per barrel pushing the total oil bill 
to 586 billion the highest total dollar amount snce august 1982 
a month when the volume was less but the price per barrel was 
higher 
the american petroleum institute has reported that foreign oil 
accounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in january as 
domestic production fell to its lowest level in a quarter century 
another factor swelling the deficit in january was a 31 percent 
surge in imports of clothing which totaled 31 billion in january 
as usual the deficit with japan was the largest of any country 
however at 29 billion it was at the lowest level since december 
1984 
the bush administration has been pressing the japanese to do 
more to purchase us exports as a way of reducing the huge annual 
deficit of 49 billion that america is running with japan 
other big deficits included taiwan 12 billion china 800 
million canada 600 million and the countries of western europe 
300 million 
many economists are worried that the deficit will worsen even 
further in coming months 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting company said he 
was looking for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between 120 
billion and 125 billion which would make it the second worst 
imbalance on history the alltime high was a 1521 billion 
deficit in 1987 
without a weaker dollar we are just not going to get an 
improvement in trade evans said we are destined to have bad 
trade numbers for some time 
such a forecast could spell trouble for the bush administration 
which is counting on further gains in exports to help boost the 
fortunes of american manufacturers and dampen protectionist 
sentiments in congress 
last month president bush held a hastily arranged meeting in 
california with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu to press 
demands that japan do more to reduce its trade gap with the united 
states which amounted to 49 billion last year 
kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a top 
priority but us critics question whether the verbal commitments 
will be turned into significant marketopening moves 
sen john danforth of missouri the ranking republican on the 
senate trade subcommittee said monday that japanese officials he 
met with in tokyo last week appeared to be more willing to address 
us complaints about their closed markets 
there was a recognition that the time had come to redress the 
grievances we had said danforth who has been a leading critic 
of both japanese trade practices and the way bush and former 
president reagan addressed them 
but danforth told reporters i remain skeptical that the 
talks are going to lead to the kind of concrete results we hope 
for 
he said the talks will have to produce more specific sales of 
us products to japan as well as a broader general commitment by 
tokyo to removing impediments

a record increase in clothing costs helped 
push consumer inflation to a brisk 05 percent in february despite 
the biggest onemonth drop in fuel oil prices in 55 years the 
government said today 
the gain in the labor departments consumer price index came on 
top of a huge 11 percent rise in january the steepest in 7 years 
a turnoftheyear cold snap sent energy and food costs soaring 
in january fuel oil prices recovered with warmerthanusual 
temperatures in february 
however food prices are taking longer to snap back and clothing 
costs posted the largest seasonally adjusted monthly rise in 43 
years accounting for about twofifths of the overall gain 
its a nasty little number worse than we thought it would 
be said economist robert brusca of nikko securities co 
international inc the problems we had in january still appear to 
be lingering in february 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we must remain vigilant against any increase in inflation 
but the inflation level has been relatively steady for some time in 
spite of the weatherrelated and energyrelated surges overall we 
continue to believe that inflation is low and under control 
taken together the first two months of the year represent an 
annual inflation rate of 99 percent however most analysts expect 
a succession of milder reports this year and look toward a 1990 
rate just under last years 46 percent 
in a separate report the commerce department said the us 
trade deficit widened to 93 billion in january up from 77 
billion in december the deficit worsened despite a 4 percent climb 
in exports to an alltime high of 321 billion 
many stock and bond prices fell in reaction to the reports 
although the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 383 points 
at 275946 in the first half hour of trading bond prices declined 
and the broader stock market was lower declining issues 
outnumbered gains by around 3 to 2 on the new york stock exchange 
in advance most analysts had been expecting only half as much 
inflation traders took the price rise coupled with the economic 
strength suggested by the export number as an indication the 
federal reserve board will not soon lower interest rates 
in a related report the labor department said us workers 
earnings rose 03 percent in february after adjustments for 
inflation and seasonal factors that followed a 12 percent drop in 
january much steeper than an earlier government estimate of 07 
percent 
energy prices overall were down 07 percent in february 
following a 51 percent gain in january 
the department said fuel oil which advanced 263 percent in 
january fell back 187 percent in february a record since 1935 
when the government first began tracking the price 
gasoline rose 08 percent after a 77 percent rise natural gas 
and electricity rose 06 percent after a 03 percent increase 
food costs rose 05 percent in february after a large 18 
percent rise in january 
dairy products rose 09 percent so did fruit and vegetables 
following a 102 percent rise in january after a freeze ruined 
crops from texas to florida 
tomatoes jumped 307 percent in february for the two months 
combined they were up 1294 percent 
there were declines for sugar and sweets and fats and oils 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories prices rose 
05 percent this core number is generally considered a better 
indication of underlying inflation pressures 
however it was driven higher by an unusual 33 percent rise in 
clothing and upkeep prices on a seasonally adjusted basis it was 
the sharpest rise since 1947 when that series of numbers was first 
recorded 
a department analyst said spring fashion lines were introduced 
earlier in the year than normal throwing off the departments 
statistical adjustments 
infants and toddlers clothing rose 103 percent womens and 
girls clothing was up 5 percent while mens and boys clothes 
rose 12 percent 
there was a 02 percent drop in new car prices as dealers tried 
a new round of incentives to stimulate lagging sales 
the various changes left the consumer price index at 1280 
before seasonal adjustments that meant that a hypothetical 
selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 198284 base 
period would have cost 128 last month up from 12160 a year 
earlier 
in other details the department said services rose 04 percent 
including a gain of 08 percent for medical care 
for the year analysts expect inflation to be stable low 
unemployment is keeping wage increases from abating but 
sluggishness particularly in manufacturing is keeping inflation 
from getting out of control 
the economy is too strong for inflation to go down but its 
still too weak for inflation to really be rising very much 
said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch

chase manhattan corp president thomas labrecque 
said tuesday he expects to see a steady increase in problem real 
estate loans over the next several months as sluggishness in many 
commercial and residential markets continues 
we had expected a cyclical market downswing for two years 
labrecque told a meeting of securities analysts we took steps to 
limit our growth and tighten our underwriting and appraisal 
standards 
chase placed 783 million in domestic real estate loans on a 
nonaccrual basis at the end of 1989 a 49 percent jump from the 
527 million the previous year 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status banks no longer 
include on their statements the interest and other charges due on 
the loans until the money is actually received 
as the current sluggish real estate environment persists 
labrecque said the number of these nonperforming loans is 
expected to increase moderately in the first quarter and somewhat 
more over the next quarters 
chases domestic real estate loan portfolio totaled 9 billion 
at yearend up from 71 billion in 1988 
despite the sharp rise in problem loans labrecque told analysts 
overall credit quality in the banks real estate lending business 
was relatively good and should remain profitable 
ours is a welldiversified portfolio that has helped us 
withstand regional downturns he said

a longawaited increase in a key lending rate 
tuesday provided no quick fix for the sinking japanese stock market 
and weakening yen but analysts predicted the move would have a 
greater impact over the long term 
the bank of japan raised its discount rate the interest 
charged on loans to commercial banks by 1 percentage point to 
525 percent the increase was the fourth since last may when the 
rate stood at 25 percent 
the tokyo stock exchanges key index which has been slumping 
this year due to uncertainty over interest rates continued to fall 
in reaction to the rate hike dropping 45605 points or 148 
percent to close at 3080719 it was the nikkeis lowest closing 
since 3067839 on jan 9 1989 
that followed a decline of 135320 points or 415 percent on 
monday the indexs thirdlargest singleday fall 
in another move aimed at supporting the stock market major 
japanese securities houses reportedly agreed to suspend the 
issuance of new shares nikkei telecom a japanese news wire 
service reported the suspension would last at least a month 
in the currency markets the yen weakened further despite the 
discount rate hike although higher rates tend to make a countrys 
currency more attractive analysts said traders discounted the move 
because they had been expecting it 
the dollar gained 010 yen tuesday closing at 15365 yen its 
highest since the march 12 1987 closing of 15369 yen 
the yens failure to respond to the discount rate hike 
discouraged stock investors who view currency stability as a key 
to a recovery in stocks traders said 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said tuesday the banks 
move was preemptive to maintain price stability and would 
not appreciably slow economic growth 
while not providing an instant remedy the rate increase would 
help both the yen and the stock market in the long run he said 
hiroshi saito president of nippon steel corp told kyodo news 
service that the action would stabilize financial markets by making 
investors think the interest rate has reached its top 
but hideo mori president of sumitomo chemical co said the 
rate increase might damage healthy economic growth 
some analysts suggested the bank of japan waited too long to 
raise the rate 
if the discount rate had been raised when the dollar was about 
to surpass the 150yen line the dollar could not have risen this 
high said toshiaki kakimoto chief economist with sumitomo bank 
monetary actions should be taken in more flexible fashion 
with signs of inflationary pressure growing the market had 
expected the rise to come shortly after the feb 18 general 
elections 
amid the uncertainty that followed stock and bond prices and 
the yen all continued to weaken 
so far this year the dollar has risen by more than 10 yen or 7 
percent while the tokyo stock exchanges 225share nikkei stock 
average has fallen more than 8100 points or almost 21 percent 
this triple decline yen stocks and bonds led companies to 
shift money from stock and bond investments to bank accounts and 
forced many to abandon plans for raising capital 
kakimoto said the rate increase would show its effects slowly 
but surely and would give the yen a chance for a gradual recovery 
since the interest rate gap between the united states and japan 
has narrowed reducing the relatively higher returns on us 
securities dollarbuying should slow he said 
also direct investments in the united states in factories 
real estate and takeovers may slow because dollars will become 
more expensive for japanese businessmen kakimoto said

not everyone noticed but tuesday was the great american 
meatout a day when soup kitchens went vegetarian in pittsburgh and 
the mayor of des moines iowa discovered a new kind of pork barrel 
politics 
youre not my mayor was among the kinder remarks greeting 
des moines mayor john pat dorrian at the iowa statehouse after 
he signed a proclamation recognizing the vegetarian holiday 
this blows my mind added dorrians nonconstituent state 
sen john soorholtz 
dorrian halfheartedly defended his decision to support a 
oneday meat boycott in the nations top porkproducing state but 
even he conceded its probably something that should never have 
been signed 
the meatout was the idea of the farm animal reform movement a 
national advocacy group opposed to factory farming and in favor 
of vegeterian diets it was intended as a response to national meat 
week another of the nations lesserknown commemorations 
the meatout was supported by such entertainment figures as doris 
day ally sheedy and river phoenix and american top 40 radio 
announcer casey kasem 
it also was observed perhaps inadvertently by about 500 people 
who ate vegetarian meals at three soup kitchens in the pittsburgh 
area the food was donated and served by volunteers from animal 
advocates and the pittsburgh vegetarian society 
about 165 people ate vegetarian chili corn fruit cocktail and 
bread at the rainbow kitchen in homestead a depressed former steel 
town just outside of pittsburgh 
they liked it we do serve vegetarian meals from time to 
time said kevin amos the kitchens food program manager 
it was somewhat less of a success in philadelphia birthplace 
of freedom and the cheesesteak where meatout supporters targeted 
jims steaks on south street as their staging ground 
a group of high school vegetarians stood outside the art deco 
landmark passing out antimeat fliers carrots and orange slices as 
the aroma of seared beef and fried onions wafted overhead 
but they were evidently unable to cow any of the early lunch 
crowd into avoiding meat for a day the usual stampede began 
shortly after 11 am 
if they dont want to eat it they dont have to said leon 
schwartz a 30yearold philadelphian weaned on the famed 
cheesesteak a mound of sliced beef slathered with melted cheese 
served on a roll i want to and i eat it thats what america is 
all about 
what is this save a cow said bernie bartholome a new york 
businessman as he chewed on a cheesesteak laden with peppers 
onions and tomatoes see i eat vegetables too 
many passersby accepted the handout from the students and 
chomped on the carrots 
as long as they read it and understand thats a start said 
rachel randolph 15 people are being real receptive 
this is a philadelphia institution so we decided to stand 
here said laura kuperman 16 were trying to be friendly not 
confrontational 
whats their beef 
the demonstrators said raising livestock is environmentally 
dangerous wastes vital farmland and is cruel to animals 
its also bad for you they said reciting statistics about 
heart disease saturated fat cancer hormones and other 
uncomfortable topics 
even if they dont convert their eyes will be open said 
jane edelstein 15 
were trying to make people more aware added alix 
hetherington 16 
anything more presumably would be gravy

the government in growing trouble over the 
economy presented a cautious budget tuesday aimed at fighting 
inflation partly by encouraging britons to save and hiking taxes on 
tobacco alcohol and gasoline 
in his annual spring budget statement to the house of commons 
chancellor of the exchequer john major said the government would 
raise an addition 500 million pounds or 805 million from 
taxpayers in the year ended march 31 1991 
but he announced no drastic changes in the way the government 
raises its tax revenue choosing instead to tinker with thresholds 
and allowances 
his budget was expected to be highly popular with britons who 
will benefit from the adjustments mainly small savers retirees 
working mothers and small businessmen 
however economists expressed disappointment in the statement 
saying it was not austere enough to curb 77 percent inflation 
which has been stubborn despite 15 percent interest rates 
a tight budget would have increased tax revenue more than 3 
billion pounds and that would have been more effective in curbing 
consumers spending power the economists said 
the financial markets had little reaction opposition labor 
party leader neil kinnock called it a bits and pieces budget 
that wont save the government 
this budget has been viewed as politically crucial for prime 
minister margaret thatcher whose economic strategy has come under 
increasing fire she needs to get the economy in the best possible 
shape before mid1992 the deadline for the next election 
the spring statement in addition to outlining the governments 
revenue raising plans is a principal platform for announcing 
economic policies and forecasts 
the government which announces its spending plans in an autumn 
statement said in november it would spend 179 billion pounds in 
the coming year the treasury said a figure for total tax revenue 
was not available but that overall government receipts are expected 
to come to 219 billion pounds 
major announced new special savings accounts which will allow 
britons to earn interest taxfree on up to 1800 pounds a year for 
five years if they leave the capital unchanged during the entire 
period 
the rises in excise taxes on gasoline alcohol and tobacco were 
roughly in line with inflation major said for example a 
onepound pint of beer will cost 2 pence more and a 160pound pack 
of cigarettes will cost 10 pence more 
the chancellor left britains two income tax rates of 25 percent 
and 40 percent unchanged he reaffirmed the governments intention 
to bring the basic rate down to 20 percent but did not say when 
the corporate tax rate remains at 35 percent 
this budget will take no risks with inflation major said 
that beyond any doubt is the most urgent program before us 
today 
evelyn brodie senior british economist at the london investment 
firm morgan grenfell and co said the chancellor hasnt tightened 
policy at all 
if you were bearish before youre still bearish now said 
chris dillow an economist at nomura research institute in london 
we believe that the uks problems still remain 
major said british inflation was worse than in other countries 
because of heavy borrowing and strong consumer spending but 
insisted the governments strategy of raising interest rates was 
working 
it will worsen noticeably before it improves he warned 
he did not forecast the inflation rates peak which many 
economists are pegging at 9 percent he said the rate might still 
be above 7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the 575 
percent he previously forecast but that it should fall below 5 
percent in 1991 
my judgment is that interest rates will stay high for some 
time to come he said later at a news conference he said he 
could not be certain interest rates wouldnt go up again 
britains economy should grow 1 percent this year and reach 
275 percent in 1991 he said in parliament growth was 25 percent 
last year and 44 percent in 1988 
the trade deficit should shrink to 15 million pounds this year 
and further thereafter from more than 20 billion pounds last year 
major said

gold futures prices skidded well below 400 an ounce tuesday on 
new yorks commodity exchange as a stronger dollar and a rise in 
japanese interest rates prompted aggressive selling of gold by 
banks and far eastern investors 
on other commodity markets coffee futures surged livestock and 
meat futures retreated energy futures were mixed and grains and 
soybeans were mostly higher 
gold futures settled 860 to 960 lower with the contract for 
delivery in april at 39330 a troy ounce a fourmonth low

commodity exchange with march at 5043 a troy ounce platinum 
futures dropped 850 to 870 on the new york mercantile exchange 
with april at 49360 a troy ounce 
analysts said the gold market mainly took its cues from the 
dollar which surged in value tuesday against the british pound 
swiss franc west german mark and the japanese yen 
a stronger dollar tends to discourage foreign demand for gold 
because it makes the metal which is traded in dollars more 
expensive in terms of other currencies 
further selling was prompted by the bank of japans announcement 
of a 1 point increase in its discount rate to 525 percent the 
fourth rate hike in a series intended to fight inflation 
tuesdays developments created uncertainty about the future of 
japanese investment demand for gold said stephen w platt metals 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
he said investment buying from japan has been a big mover for 
the market and there are questions as to whether it will still be 
as formidable a source of demand as it has been 
coffee futures rallied strongly on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange erasing nearly half of the steep losses registered 
in the two previous sessions 
analysts tied the buying to perceptions that the market had sold 
off too sharply in reaction to the brazilian economic reforms 
announced friday traders initially speculated the reforms would 
spur sales of coffee from brazil the worlds largest producer but 
doubts about that prediction have surfaced 
coffee futures finished 1 cent to 352 cents higher with may at 
9121 cents a pound the march contract expired at 8846 cents a 
pound 
cattle futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange 
in selling prompted by softer cash markets weak cash prices also 
pressured pork futures

april at 7682 cents pound feeder cattle were 40 cent to 87 cent 
lower with march at 8220 cents a pound live hogs were 47 cent 
lower to 05 cent higher with april at 5325 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were unchanged to 85 cent lower with march at 5060 
cents a pound 
crude oil futures slipped while refined products advanced on the 
new york mercantile exchange ahead of the american petroleum 
institutes weekly inventory report 
the report released after the close showed 
smallerthanexpected us supplies of crude oil and petroleum 
distillates including heating oil while supplies of gasoline 
were within market expectations 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures finished 9 cents to 32 
cents lower with april at 1928 a barrel heating oil was 15 cent 
to 33 lower with april at 5435 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 25 cent to 95 cent higher with april at 5731 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade after seesawing through the session as traders 
searched for significant new developments 
wheat futures finished cent to 3 cents higher with march at 
402 a bushel corn futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
march at 253 a bushel oats were cent to 2 cents lower with

foreign companies would have to pay more taxes 
on profitable operations in the united states under a bill 
introduced tuesday by senior house democrats 
it is critical that we ensure that foreignowned companies are 
not underpaying their taxes thereby gaining a competitive 
advantage over american companies that are paying their fair share 
of taxes rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee said at a news conference 
the bill also sponsored by house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo grew out of internal revenue service disclosures 
that more than half of 36800 foreign companies that filed tax 
returns in 1986 reported no taxable income the irs is 
investigating whether foreign companies underpaid taxes by billions 
of dollars in the 1980s 
foreigncontrolled corporations reported 542 billion in 
receipts and 15 billion in losses and paid 3 billion in us 
income taxes in 1986 gephardt said foreign automobile 
manufacturers had 77 billion in sales and paid less than 12 
million in tax 
no wonder us automakers have had a hard time 
competing gephardt said 
gephardt and rostenkowski said they are not worried that 
enactment of their bill would discourage foreign investment which 
has played a major role in financing the us budget deficit all 
we are asking people to do is pay what americans pay to do business 
in this country rostenkowski said 
the bill would 
expand irs authority to investigate whether foreign companies 
have manipulated us tax laws in dealings with their american 
subsidiaries and operating arms for example a foreign automaker 
could artificially inflate the price of parts coming into the 
united states so as to show little or no profit on the sale of the 
completed car 
a 1989 law strengthened the hand of the irs by requiring 
increased reporting and better recordkeeping by foreign companies 
but it does not apply to pastyear taxes the bill would allow the 
irs to use the stricter rules in investigating pastyear problems 
tax the capital gains realized when a foreigner sells stock in 
a us corporation the tax would not apply to residents of 
countries with which the united states has treaties prohibiting 
such taxation 
congressional analysts estimate the bill would boost taxes on 
foreign corporations and investors by about 200 million a year 
gephardt said other estimates are far higher

gasoline futures rebounded tuesday while crude 
oil prices continued to sag pressured by concern about shortterm 
plentiful supplies and slowing demand 
on the new york mercantile exchange the april contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil tumbled 
32 cents to settle at 1928 a 42gallon barrel after trading as 
low as 1907 
analysts said a late round of arbitrage buying helped lift the 
contract off its lows on the final day of trading before it expired 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for april delivery which dropped 
060 cents in mondays session rose 095 cent to 5731 cents a 
gallon 
and the april contract for no 2 heating oil which rose 008 
cent in the previous session slipped 019 cent to 5435 cents a 
gallon 
energy analysts said crude oil started the day higher but gave 
way to fundamental factors as the session progressed 
demand has slowed in recent weeks due mainly to seasonal factors 
while production particularly by opec countries has remained 
strong projections are for demand to continue to slow in the 
second quarter which is traditionally a period of weak demand 
analysts said the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
inaction at last weekends monitoring committee meeting left the 
market under pressure 
opec ministers adjourned a twoday session without making any 
new commitments to curb production which currently exceeds demand 
by more than a million barrels a day according to various 
estimates

a mann 
a secretary said mann was out of the office until wednesday and 
that the company would have no other comment 
kosher for passover matzo is made specially for the jewish 
holiday that celebrates the exodus of the jews from ancient egypt 
the indictment filed by the justice departments antitrust

international business machines corp introduced 
six new personal computers tuesday that allow quick transfer of 
information among a network of microcomputers 
the machines which include new versions of ibms model 80 plus 
a new machine called the model 65 sx are ibms first workstations 
or file servers based on jazzedup personal computers analysts 
said they will enable the computer giant to catch up with the rest 
of the personal computer market in that field ibm had not 
introduced a new topend model 80 since 1987 
file servers are computers that can quickly disperse individual 
files to a number of other computers in contrast to a standalone 
computer that does not have such capability 
ibm already makes larger computers that can be used as file 
servers for networks of machines 
the new personal system2a models are variations of ibms 
personal system2 desktop computer line offer twice as much memory 
as earlier model 60s and 80s and include highperformance fixed 
disks as standard equipment 
four of the new machines are based on versions of intel corps 
80386series microprocessor a new system the ibm personal 
system2 model 65 sx is designed around the intel 80386sx 
microprocessor 
all are equipped with microchannel card adapters called small 
computer system interface that will enable the user to attach up to 
seven devices such as printers disk drives or optical scanners 
through a single system expansion slot previous adapters allowed 
only one hookup 
they are as good as the competition but i wouldnt say theyre 
any sort of showstopper said daniel c benton computer analyst 
with goldman sachs amp co 
two of the machines run at 25megahertz and include a 64 
kilobyte memory cache and four megabytes of random access memory 
two others run at 20megahertz and come equipped with two megabytes 
of ram and either 120 megabytes or 320 megabytes of hard disk 
capacity 
two versions of the model 65 sx come with a two megabyte memory 
and either 60 megabytes or 120 megabytes of hard disk capacity 
companies increasingly have been hooking together their personal 
computers so employees can share a data base that allows workers 
to access and update the same documents or to share computer files 
electronically rather than by transferring computer disks manually 
from one machine to another 
file servers function as the central data repository for a 
network of personal computers they have a much greater storage 
capacity and can get at data more quickly than an ordinary desktop 
computer 
but the capabilities of a file server are as much a function of 
the hardware as the software the program that runs the computer 
said peter burris an analyst with the consulting firm 
international data group 
ibms chief competitor in the personal computer file server 
business will be compaq computer corp which last fall introduced 
machines that analysts considered impressive compaq makes 
ibmcompatible computers 
the four model 80s are priced between 7495 and 13195 and the 
model 65 sx machines at 5295 and 5995 
ibm also announced price reductions between 15 percent and 24 
percent on all existing ps2 model 80s model 60s model 30001s 
and model 30021s 
for example the model 80071 has been reduced to 6095 from 
7995 and the model 30021 has been marked down to 1925 from 
2255 
other new devices announced by ibm include a new ibm ps2 
laserprinter model p70 386031 that is 25 percent faster than the 
current industry leader made by hewlett packard the laserprinter 
with color display is also competitively priced with the hp printer 
at 1495

a pilots union said american airlines request 
that federal regulators monitor its flight crews is raising tension 
between the two sides 
the allied pilots association which represents the 8100 pilots 
at american said the airline asked the federal aviation 
administration to monitor its flights in order to determine if 
pilots are slowing down 
a federal mediator is scheduled next week to join contract talks 
between american and the pilots which started last september 
in a letter to us transportation secretary samuel skinner apa 
president fred vogel said faa monitoring violates the bush 
administrations policy of not intervening in labor disputes 
vogels letter contained what he said was an faa memo advising 
air traffic controllers to keep a record of americans flights 
it appears that some flight crews are flying their aircraft at 
lessthan expected altitudes and speeds american airlines has 
asked to the extent possible that we record the flight call 
signs dates and times for forwarding to the airline the faa 
memo said according to vogel 
vogel warned skinner that the faa will bear some responsibility 
if negotiations break down and pilots strike american the nations 
largest airline 
the letter asks skinner to take the necessary steps to stop 
the faa monitoring 
the pilots union referred questions about details of its request 
to scott peterson who did not immediately return a call tuesday 
al becker a spokesman for fort worthbased american said the 
airline has seen absolutely no evidence of a systematic 
slowdown 
a dot spokesman said monday it was a common practice for air 
traffic controllers to closely monitor airlines that are locked in 
tough contract talks with their pilots 
but he added during these types of negotiations its not 
uncommon for individual pilots to conduct themselves in a way that 
is not in the best interest of the company 
to slow down flights pilots can fly and taxi at 
slowerthannormal speeds and cancel flights because of minor 
mechanical problems

standard amp poors corp on tuesday downgraded 
greyhound lines incs credit rating citing a 20dayold drivers 
strike and a 380 million debt from a 1987 leveraged buyout 
standard amp poors a credit rating agency said the companys 
new management has improved revenue generation and operating 
efficiency but interest on the debt and rentals on leased buses 
remain a heavy burden 
it also said the strike by unionized drivers that began march 2 
initially halted most bus operations and has caused substantial 
losses 
standard amp poors said it had lowered greyhounds rating to 
bfrom b it said the company remained on its creditwatch list 
pending a further review 
george gravley a spokesman for dallasbased greyhound said 
we dont have anything to say about that we have a good 
financial condition and were not at all concerned 
meanwhile the company and the drivers union amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions said there was no movement 
toward reopening contract talks that stalled sunday 
each has accused the other of not negotiating in good faith 
unions representing 6300 drivers and an estimated 3000 other 
greyhound workers walked out over wages job security and grievance 
procedures 
a greyhound spokeswoman monday said the proposal union leaders 
offered saturday was three times more than greyhound could 
afford 
a union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that 
included no guaranteed pay raises but would have made raises 
contingent on increased profits and ridership 
during the strike there have been at least 14 shooting attacks 
on greyhound buses 46 bomb threats and numerous other incidents of 
vandalism or threats during the walkout company officials say 
greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service

anheuserbusch inc the worlds largest 
brewer announced a new product tuesday that looks and sounds a lot 
like the popular coldfiltered beer made by rival miller brewing 
co 
the new beer called busch cold filtered draft will be sold in 
clear longneck bottles just like millers genuine cold filtered 
draft 
imitation is nothing new for anheuserbusch said susan 
henderson a spokeswoman for milwaukeebased miller miller 
coined the term cold filtered in 1985 to describe its exclusive 
nonheat pasteurization process and anheuserbusch wants to turn it 
into a generic term 
anheuserbusch plans to test market the new beer for one to two 
months in tulsa okla to determine whether its a viable product 
michael roarty director of marketing for anheuserbusch said 
the company has wanted to use a clear bottle for some time to 
serve beer drinkers who like to see what theyre drinking 
miller genuine draft the fastestgrowing premium beer in the 
country last year supplanted anheuserbuschs michelob as the 
nations 10th mostpopular beer 
a big difference between the two beers is that busch cold 
filtered draft is sensitive to light and could spoil if the bottles 
are taken out of the box and left for example on a shelf or in a 
tub of ice in the backyard 
anheuserbusch hasnt sold beer in clear bottles for at least 
100 years because beer made by its methods spoils when exposed to 
light 
anheuser uses the entire hop blossom when it makes beer while 
miller extracts the important oils and resins from the blossom 
separately and adds them to the brew kettle 
millers process protects the beer from tastealtering light 
buschs does not the two have had a longrunning dispute over 
their brewing processes 
we really had a dilemma because we wanted to use a clear 
bottle but we also wanted to continue our tradition of using only 
natural ingredients said klaus zastrow brewmaster for 
anheuserbusch 
the company compromised by brewing busch cold filtered draft 
with its usual methods while packaging the clear bottles in a 
lightproof cardboard box but once the beer comes out of the box 
its susceptible to spoilage zastrow said 
if youre talking about a bright sunny day it could be a 
matter of minutes before the beer develops this offflavor 
zastrow said if youre inside it could take hours 
because of this uncertainty anheuserbusch in its test 
marketing initially will sell the beer only in restaurants and 
taverns 
zastrow said some people may enjoy the lightinduced change in 
the taste 
the exposure to light will enhance the hoppy flavor and the 
beer will taste more european said zastrow 
anheuser busch sells 17 other brands of beer including busch and 
busch light the company uses a cold filtering process to make 
busch light and bud dry which is scheduled to be rolled out 
nationally in two weeks 
all beer is coldfiltered but beer that advertises the cold 
filtered process undergoes a second highly pressurized 
coldfiltering to remove yeast cells that second process takes the 
place of pasteurization 
stock analysts said the new beer offered the worlds largest 
brewery another opportunity to grow in an industry that has been 
experiencing flat sales for several years 
i guess you could call it copying but in every business if 
something is successful youre going to see people jump on the 
bandwagon said bob bernstein a stock analyst for edward d 
jones co in st louis companies dont stand back and applaud 
their competitors success they try to come up with something even 
better

the world bank on tuesday held back a 150 
million loan to china that was to go before representatives of the 
152 member governments for approval a bank spokesman said 
a source familiar with the banks work said world bank president 
barber conable decided on the move when it became apparent the loan 
would not be approved 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady last week said he would 
oppose loans by the bank to china that were not for basic human 
needs the proposed loan was earmarked for roads and inland ways in 
jiangsu province in east central china 
decisions on loans are made behind closed doors by the banks 22 
executive directors the united states controls 19 percent of the 
vote the largest single block usually enough other governments 
support the us view for a majority 
conable last june withheld consideration of nearly 800 million 
in loans to china after troops suppressed a prodemocracy movement 
he said his decision was made on economic grounds 
president bush however asked that loans be held up as part of 
the us sanctions against the chinese goverrment 
last month the board approved two loans to china worth 90 
million including one that delayed in june the treasury 
department said the us representative voted for the loans 
at a congressional hearing last week brady took note of 
opposition to the loans by many members of congress and said the 
us position was taken on behalf of them as well as the bush 
administration 
the bank is the largest single source of aid to the third world 
making loans of more than 22 billion a year 
its charter and those of other intergovernment banks that help 
the third world try to prevent political matters from being 
considered in granting loans 
but brady said the united states will insist that progress 
toward democracy be made a condition for loans under the rules of 
the projected european bank for reconstruction and development

the senate rejected efforts tuesday night to 
toughen auto pollution controls in a compromise clean air bill as 
opponents successfully argued the provision was a prescription 
for deadlock 
the vote was 5246 to table and in effect kill an amendment 
which would have required considerably tighter emissions controls 
on automobiles than a compromise bill crafted by senate leaders and 
the white house it also called for 1 million vehicles capable of 
burning fuels other than gasoline toward the end of the decade 
sen timothy wirth dcolo and other backers of the amendment 
argued that additional restrictions on automobile pollutants were 
needed because autos are the biggest source of pollution in our 
cities 
but senate leaders and supporters of the compromise bill 
characterized the tougher requirement as threatening enactment of 
clean air legislation altogether this year because of the strong 
opposition from the bush administration 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the amendments 
a prescription for deadlock on the bill before the senate 
do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill do 
we want to make statements or do we want to make law mitchell 
asked his colleagues 
meanwhile the compromise was under attack on another front 
tuesday in a dispute over whether the federal government should 
provide assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of 
the bill 
wirth said on the floor that the coal miner assistance proposal 
appears to have a majority of the votes negotiations have been 
under way with the bush administration to see if all parties could 
agree on help for miners 
the white house has objected to the plans 700 million price 
tag and has characterized it as a deal breaker if some 
compromise cannot be reached with the sponsor sen robert c byrd 
dwva 
deadlock on the byrd amendment caused the senate to turn its 
attention to auto controls 
byrd is trying to help miners of highsulfur coal who would lose 
jobs because of new curbs of sulfur dioxide emissions by midwest 
utilities his plan calls for four years of assistance to miners 
byrds state produces both highsulfur and lowsulfur coal 
mitchell had refused byrds repeated calls to bring his 
amendment to a vote 
the amendment was to have been the first order of business when 
the senate reconvened after a week recess but consideration was 
postponed for a second time early tuesday 
senate sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed 
wirths assertion that byrd appears to have enough votes for the 
amendment senate leaders fear the amendment would prompt the white 
house to withdraw support for the legislation and threaten passage 
of a clean air bill this year 
some of byrds support may come from senators who oppose the 
overall bill for various easons and see a push for coal miners 
assistance as a chance to stall the legislation senate and 
industry and environmental lobbyists suggested tuesday 
byrd met monday with roger porter president bushs chief 
domestic policy adviser in an attempt to reach a compromise but 
sources said little progress was made 
the senate bill would set tough new pollution controls on 
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog cut toxic chemical 
emissions from industry and require electric utilities to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the 
decade 
byrd says that provision which is aimed at reducing acid rain 
would cost the jobs of thousands of coal miners including many in 
his state where many jobs depend on highsulfur coal 
wirth noted in tuesdays debate that president bush said last 
year the clean air bill should reconcile the automobile with the 
environment but wirth said the compromise backs off from that 
promise 
in the house meanwhile the energy and commerce committee edged 
toward consideration the first of several amendments to a somewhat 
different clean air bill 
rep henry waxman dcalif introduced an amendment tuesday 
that would tighten controls on urban smog from industry 
i dont think were that far apart said waxman suggesting 
hes ready to compromise on the proposal and predicting a possible 
vote within days the committee chaired by rep john dingell 
dmich hopes to push a clean air bill to the house floor by may

the case of joseph hazelwood went to 
the jury tuesday after a defense attorney called the exxon valdez 
skipper a scapegoat of political powers and a prosecutor portrayed 
him as a reckless drunk 
a defense attorney argued that the 7weekold trial was a 
political action in which the state seeks to shift blame for the 
disaster 
maybe the state hopes the people will look the other way when 
it comes to their responsibility defense attorney dick madson 
declared in his final argument 
madson said crew members were not the only ones who saw that 
hazelwood wasnt impaired aboard the exxon valdez when it struck a 
charted reef a year ago saturday he pointed to 21 witnesses at 
hazelwoods criminal trial who said the captain was sober and 
showed no signs of being impaired by alcohol 
assistant district attorney brent cole said it was not necessary 
to show that hazelwood looked intoxicated to have been impaired by 
drink 
the state has to prove he was under the influence of 
intoxicating liquor cole said he said this did not mean that 
a person is stumbling falling down and needs support 
instead cole argued impairment means when your physicial and 
mental abilities are impaired 
cole asked jurors to determine that hazelwood was impaired from 
his actions and from a blood test taken 10 hours after the ship 
ripped its hull open on a reef in prince william sound 
following arguments superior court judge karl johnstone 
instructed jurors on the law for about an hour then told them to 
select a foreman and begin their deliberations 
they spent about 10 minutes behind closed doors then retired 
for the day they were to resume wednesday morning 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he could receive 7 years in prison and 61000 
in fines 
after the ship ran aground it spilled nearly 11 million gallons 
of alaska north slope crude oil blackening hundreds of miles of 
shoreline and killing fish birds and other wildlife 
madson urged jurors to ignore efforts to make hazelwood out as 
the villain 
alaska is known as the last frontier he said we dont 
have vigilantes or lynch mobs what this frontier does is grant a 
fair trial to everyone even people who transport what they call 
black gold 
captain hazelwood is entitled to that fairness madson said 
he reminded jurors that their verdict cannot change or improve 
what happened in prince william sound that is over and done 
madson said 
many parties had an interest in seeing hazelwood blamed for the 
disaster and among them might be exxon itself madson said in 
response to prosecution claims that exxon wants the skipper 
acquitted 
madson ridiculed any reliance on the delayed blood test he said 
the calculations presented by a prosecution expert on how drunk 
hazelwood might have been were hard to believe 
under the testimony you heard captain hazelwood would have 
had to be dragged up there on the ship by the collar he would 
have been so high at that blood alcohol level madson said 
he held up a picture of the ships precarious gangway which the 
skipper negotiated without a missed step and declared this is 
probably the toughest sobriety test youre going to see 
cole said crew members who testified that the captain was sober 
were probably influenced by exxon to back up the skipper 
he asked the jury to notice the presence of exxon in this 
case and recalled the testimony of an exxon executive who said 
the company has an interest in the outcome of hazelwoods trial 
it doesnt take a brain surgeon to see exxons interest in 
this matter cole said its seeing captain hazelwood get 
acquitted 
the prosecutor reminded jurors that crew members who testified 
supported their captain on many issues and sometimes changed the 
stories they had originally given about the grounding of the exxon 
valdez 
witnesses for example told the national transportation safety 
board that the skipper tried to move the ship off the reef but 
some said on the stand that they did not know if he was trying 
while others said he was not cole contended 
its easy to see the pressure they exxon were putting on 
these crew members said cole as exxon lawyers maintained their 
daily frontrow vigil 
exxon spokesman joe tucker in anchorage said he was not 
authorized to comment on coles allegations and that exxon 
officials in houston were not available 
cole said hazelwood risked his ship and the lives of his crew 
and should be found guilty of reckless conduct 
madson told jurors they could not ignore the testimony of the 21 
people not all exxon employees who said he was sober he said 
jurors could not discount the opinions of experts who said that if 
the skippers instructions had been followed the ship would have 
missed bligh reef by two miles 
hazelwood sat calmly at the defense table his wife and father 
who recently arrived at the trial sat in backrow seats of the 
crowded courtroom
