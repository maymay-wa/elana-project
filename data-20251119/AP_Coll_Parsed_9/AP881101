the colorado department of health on tuesday 
granted the army an air pollution emission permit to burn pershing 
ii missile motors at its pueblo depot to comply with an arms 
reduction treaty 
the army had been seeking the state permit since february 
because the missiles must be destroyed under terms of the 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty signed by leaders of the united 
states and the soviet union 
the permit imposes some restrictions on the method frequency and 
wind conditions for missile destruction at the depot in southern 
colorado according to john clouse of the departments air pollution 
control division 
it also requires emissions monitoring for the three years the 
permit will be in effect beginning on the first day of missile 
destruction 
under these conditions there will be no adverse impact to 
pueblo residents or to the residents east of the site said clouse 
gov roy romer praised the department for allowing the burn 
while at the same time protecting our environment and the health 
of our citizens 
i wanted colorado to help get rid of these missiles so that 
this country could fulfill its treaty obligation romer said 
however i wanted it to be done safely and we have worked that 
out with the us army 
slated for destruction at the depot are 234 pershing ii stage i 
motors each of which contains 7940 pounds of propellant and 223 
pershing ii stage 2 motors each of which contains 4940 pounds of 
propellant state officials said 
the rest of the armys original stockpile of 849 pershing ii 
missiles will be destroyed at a site in marshall texas army 
officials said 
were very pleased were grateful to the citizens and the 
state of colorado for the confidence they have placed in us and 
rest assured we dont take that confidence lightly said pueblo 
depot spokesman alan kenitzer 
kenitzer said depot officials will travel to denver in the next 
few days to pick up the permit and the depot will send the health 
department a check later this week for about 25000 for research 
and administrative costs 
he said the army will select a date to begin the missile burns 
and under treaty terms will give the soviets 30 days notice 
some state lawmakers had been concerned that if the state denied 
the permit jobs at the facility might be in jeopardy kenitzer 
didnt know immediately whether the depot might hire more people as 
a result of the permit

george bush campaigned like a presidenttobe tuesday saying he 
hoped for a meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev soon after 
moving into the oval office democrat michael dukakis said made in 
america was the only label he cared about as he bid for union 
support 
the polls one week before election day showed bush a solid 
leader and the contrast in campaign styles between the frontrunner 
and the underdog couldnt have been plainer 
the vice president struck an abovethefray pose in a speech at 
the university of notre dame saying he wanted to meet gorbachev for 
a serious and direct examination of superpower relations the 
gop presidential nominee also pledged to appoint moderate persons 
of conservative views to the supreme court 
dukakis was in the political trenches blending his appeal for 
blue collar support with an attack on alleged republican influence 
peddling as president im not going to stand up for the sharp 
operators im going to stand up for the lathe operators and machine 
operators he said 
the dukakis campaign also unveiled a new oneminute ad centering 
on the theme the rich get richer and claiming dukakis tax 
proposals would be fairer to the middle class 
dukakis aides said their private polls pointed to a race that 
was narrowing privately some democrats expressed doubts while abc 
said its survey of california showed bush a leader by seven points 
in the nations biggest state 
a cbs news poll released tuesday showed bush holding a 12point 
lead over dukakis 5341 percent the survey of 1065 probable 
voters was conducted saturday through monday and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points 
bush had an even larger lead in an abc newswashington post poll 
5542 which the network said was the largest lead in its polling 
since labor day the survey of 1099 likely voters wednesday through 
monday had a margin of error of close to four percentage points in 
either direction 
dan quayle bushs running mate expressed irritation with gop 
campaign managers after they abruptly switched his schedule to 
cancel a trip to south bend ind the same city bush was visiting 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen climbed into 
the cockpit of an f16 fighter for the benefit of television cameras 
as he renewed his campaign to persuade texans that dukakis would be 
strong on defense 
president reagan campaigned for bush and other republicans 
ripping into dukakis for describing himself as a liberal in the mold 
of roosevelt and truman dukakis is no harry truman and hes no 
fdr the outgoing president said and then depicted this years 
democatic candidate as a man pursuing the cartermondale liberal 
agenda 
transition planners were on a schedule that couldnt wait for the 
election stationery bearing the politically correct letterhead 
office of the presidentelect was on order to suit either bush 
or dukakis 
bush behaved like a man who thought hed be using the stationery 
in his speech at notre dame he said much progress has been 
made in superpower relations during the reagan years and added it 
was important for him and gorbachev to size each other up 
correctly he said he would ask his secretary of state to make 
it clear that i am prepared to meet with general secretary gorbachev 
at the earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace 
my purpose in such a meeting would not be to achieve any grand 
breakthrough but to engage in a serious and direct examination of 
where we are and how we can best go forward toward further arms 
reductions a decrease in regional tensions and further adherence to 
human rights and thus toward a surer peace he said 
bush couldnt resist a few sharp digs at dukakis saying now was 
no time for total inexperience in diplomacy and adding that his 
democratic rival would name doctrinaire liberals to the supreme 
court 
in a campaign matter that dukakis jumped on instantly a top bush 
fundraiser denounced as rotten a report implying that he was 
trying to use his position to land a public relations contract for 
his firm with the government of haiti fred bush who is not related 
to the vice president said he had told his partner michael govan to 
forget it when it came to haiti but his partner had ignored the 
admonition and had written the nations new president using bushs 
name 
dukakis referred to the reports as he campaigned his way across 
the midwest saying the country has had a bellyful of allowing 
representatives of foreign governments easy access to the white 
house 
dukakis first event of the day was in youngstown ohio a 
steelproducing region hard hit by recession 
he said bush likes to talk about labels a reference to the way 
the vice president attempts to make him seem a liberal out of touch 
with the mainstream you know what label im intereted in made 
in america is the label im interested in 
the washington post on wednesday said it would endorse neither 
george bush nor michael dukakis for president saying neither 
candidate has established a claim to the office that we find 
compelling 
this has been a terrible campaign a national disappointment 
the newspaper said 
with only a week to go dukakis schedule seemed stretched almost 
beyond endurance he arranged four appearances in as many states 
then was flying to the bedside of his wife kitty who was 
hospitalized with a viral infection in minneapolis 
his marathon was brightened in milwaukee where he was serenaded 
with a chorus of happy birthday two days before his 55th and 
presented with a new snow blower that was a joking reference to the 
25yearold model that he keeps in his garage in massachusetts 
dukakis also took another crack at answering a question that many 
advisers felt he handled poorly in last months televised debate 
the issue of whether he would favor the death penalty if his wife 
were raped and murdered 
i think i would have that kind of emotion he told cable news 
networks bernard shaw the newsman who asked the same question 
during the debate on the other hand this is not a country where 
we glorify vengeance

the state seized more than 5 
million in businesses and property belonging to a convicted cocaine 
smuggler tuesday in floridas largest civil racketeering 
confiscation 
the seizures were made as prosecutors filed suit to collect 5 
million in drug profits the state claims the nashville tenn man 
funneled into a string of businesses in florida tennessee and 
elsewhere 
this is really a big lick for us said statewide prosecutor 
peter antonacci 
russell brothers jr 51 was jailed last week after a fort 
lauderdale jury found him guilty of piloting two planeloads of 
cocaine from south america to the bahamas in 1986 
essentially this is an action against property in florida and 
tennessee derived from a pattern of racketeering said andrew 
zelman an assistant statewide prosecutor 
zelman said brothers sent the cash to a gibraltar banker named 
eric ellul who transferred the money back to the united states to 
be invested 
according to the lawsuit filed in broward circuit court property 
involved in the moneylaundering scheme ranged from a gibraltar 
corporation to ranches in tennessee and a 42foot boat at a fort 
pierce marina 
brothers assets also included two airplanes one of which was 
seized and sold by costa rican authorities and the other a 
beechcraft baron which was seized by the florida department of law 
enforcement zelman said 
it all adds up to over 5 million the prosecutor said 
these are corporate entities that were funded by the proceeds of 
racketeering 
brothers claimed in his trial that he got involved with a ring of 
drug smugglers while trying to hide assets including an airplane 
from his wife whom he was divorcing she testified against him at 
the trial and is now seeking a divorce settlement 
the previous state record for seized drug assets in a civil case 
was 2 million in property taken last september from convicted drug 
smuggler frank brady

an rotc commander recommended tuesday that a 
former college student who disappeared with his new wife for four 
months last spring should serve four years in the army as an 
enlisted man because he violated his contract 
the recommendation that scott swanson 23 serve in the army was 
made by brig gen james a musselman at the reserve officers 
training corps regional headquarters in fort knox ky it now goes 
to maj gen robert wagner at fort monroe va who will make the 
final decision said capt charles wade an rotc spokesman at fort 
knox 
its not punishment nor is it the final decision wade said 
tuesday night this is all administrative procedure it was never 
intended as punishment 
the swansons disappearance last april drew national attention as 
authorities in several states searched for them for four months 
they surfaced in san diego saying they had vanished to seek 
perfect love 
swanson said he would abide by the rotc decision and if he must 
serve in the army im going to be up front about it im going 
to serve proudly 
musselmans recommendation differs from one offered by a 
threemember army panel that reviewed swansons case in august the 
panel found that swanson had violated his rotc contract when he and 
his wife carolyn disappeared april 2 before he had completed his 
military and academic obligations but it recommended that he be 
expelled from the rotc program 
the panel also recommended swanson pay back more than 16000 he 
received through the rotc program for college tuition and other 
education expenses he had been scheduled to graduate from wheaton 
college last may 
wade said the contract is standard procedure for all candidates 
when they enter the advanced rotc program in their final two years 
of college 
the contract contains a provision stating that any breech of its 
terms can result in the cadet having to repay an rotc scholarship 
fulfill the contract as an army officer or serve a term of 
enlistment wade explained 
swanson knew the options going into it as does every cadet 
wade said 
he said he did not know how long it would take for wagner 
commander general of the us army rotc command to make a decision

ensign deron jordan confidently barked out 
orders as the helmsman guided a sleek gray navy ship between red and 
green markers that dotted the smooth waters 
looking toward the bow he directed the helmsmen to turn the 
rudder to the right 
see your red buoy up here asked the helmsman lt cmdr jim 
hoover 
as the ship passed within inches of the red marker jordan called 
out another order then looked over the side and said under his 
breath we didnt touch did we 
jordan had missed the marker but it wouldnt have mattered if he 
had hit it he and other young officers were the crew on a 36foot 
fiberglass model of a navy supply ship gliding across lake bradford 
at the little creek amphibious base 
the officers were participating in a popular navy course on ship 
handling that uses scale models of everything from a fast frigate to 
an aircraft carrier 
ship handling is a navy skill that attracts little attention 
unless something goes awry 
the commander of the carrier eisenhower lost his job because the 
ship collided with an anchored spanish collier in hampton roads 
harbor aug 29 and the captain of the tank landing ship boulder was 
relieved of his command because the ship ran aground during a nato 
exercise off the coast of norway on sept 12 
the junior officers who take the oneweek ship handling course 
are a long way from commanding a ship but with other officers they 
share responsibility for navigating their ships into piers and 
anchorages and away from other vessels 
the more than 400 officers who take the course each year have 
been assigned to a ship for at least six months 
most young navy officers get little experience aboard ship 
however because so many officers share the shiphandling duties 
said hoover who oversees shiphandling training at the naval 
amphibious school 
in his 16 years in the navy hoover said he has maneuvered a 
ship to the dock only twice 
here in one week a guy can make 15 pier approaches hoover 
said as he showed off a 40by40foot water tank where the students 
practice with remotecontrolled ship models 
ships have gotten very expensive you just cant afford to let 
everybody come in and try to take them alongside because if you do 
have a collision theres going to be a lot of damage he said 
the course allows the young officers to make mistakes with few 
consequences hoover said 
here the captains not watching he said its not going to 
show up on their fitness reports 
the course begins with the tank a shallow blue body of water 
marked with an island a bridge a canal and several piers a small 
fan provides the wind 
with remotecontrol boxes the students guide 3foot models of 
frigates destroyers and amphibious assault ships alongside the 
piers and under the bridge 
in the afternoon they head for the lake to practice in the 
43foot model of a nimitzclass carrier and five other ships that 
cost an average of 74000 with a crew of three or four the ships 
powered by electric motors glide between the piers moorings and 
channel markers set up in the lake 
it builds confidence jordan 22 of saratoga springs ny 
said after his turn at navigating you can experiment more 
giving orders to the person whose hands are on the wheel teaches 
responsibility the students said 
we learn the basics and when we actually do get to do it its 
a lot more realistic said lt jg william kordyjak 25 of 
amsterdam ny we have an idea of the theory behind it 
hoover said the model ships probably have endured a few 
fenderbenders since they were put in use in the 1970s since hoover 
and other instructors steer the ships they can simply ignore 
students orders if the vessel is about to crash into the dock 
but do the students ever get to take a turn at steering 
let them have fun no hoover said with a grin as he turned 
the wheel of his miniature supply ship

the arrival of at least two new soviet missiles 
in kabul has raised us concern about pakistans security and 
whether there will be a delay in the second stage of the red armys 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
the ss1 scud rockets were displayed in the afghan capital after 
undersecretary of state michael h armacost complained to soviet 
ambassador yuri v dubinin on monday about sending longrange tu26 
backfire bombers into combat there for the first time 
the soviets are backing the afghan government against usarmed 
rebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years on aug 15 
the soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100000 
troops that had fought alongside the promoscow government 
the remaining troops must depart by feb 15 under an agreement 
signed in geneva last spring the soviets hinted recently that the 
second stage would begin nov 15 but a us official who spoke 
tuesday on condition of anonymity said that might be delayed 
he also said the united states would see to it that the rebels 
had an adequate arsenal although missiles to match the scuds 
probably would not be provided through pakistan 
two scudb missiles which have the range of about 175 miles 
were displayed in kabul the official said it was not clear whether 
the soviets delivered more of them which are mobile and can reach 
the pakistani frontier as well as vast areas of afghanistan 
its clearly intended to intimidate pakistan the official 
said 
us weapons to the guerrillas are delivered through pakistan 
which also has given sanctuary to millions of afghan refugees 
the afghan news agency in a dispatch tuesday accused pakistan 
of instigating attacks by extremist guerrillas on population 
centers and demilitarized areas this is why a new kind of weapon 
mainly longrange missiles with a great destructive power was 
adopted for service by the afghan army the afghan general staff 
said 
the missiles will be used to stop the criminal activities of 
the extremist group the dispatch added without referring 
specifically to the scudb 
gennady gerasimov the spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
said at a news conference last month in new york that pakistans 
support for the rebels could have unpredictable consequences 
we dont want to be specific he said but he left open the 
possibility that the withdrawal of soviet troops might be suspended 
state department spokesman charles e redman cautioned moscow on 
tuesday that the united states was determined to protect pakistan 
if the purpose of these latest military developments is to 
threaten pakistan the soviet union knows that pakistan enjoys our 
full support in this situation he said 
the version of the scud the soviets are believed to have provided 
to the afghan forces is a mobile rocket 37 feet long 34 inches in 
diameter and weighing 14000 pounds the scud has a simple guidance 
system uses liquid fuel and can be equipped with either a nuclear 
or highexplosive conventional warhead 
this action redman said calls into question the soviets 
stated desire to achieve a genuine political settlement in 
afghanistan and their undertakings to us not to engage in offensive 
actions this display is only the latest attempt by the soviets to 
prop up a desperate regime which lacks legitimacy among the afghan 
people and clearly demonstrates that the regime is incapable of 
defending itself 
in san bernardino calif white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater accompanying president reagan on a political speaking 
tour issued this formal statement 
we are concerned about the display of ss1 missiles in kabul 
and the deployment of soviet migs and backfire bombers these 
actions call into question the soviets stated desire to achieve a 
genuine settlement in afghanistan 
this display of military hardware will only increase tensions 
in the region our support for pakistan and the mujahedeen remains 
unshakeable 
redman welcomed meanwhile the visit to the united states of 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the islamic society guerrilla group 
he called monday in islamabad for elections to create a new 
government after soviet troops withdraw 
our position is that we can support any proposal for a 
political solution which reflects the will of the afghan people and 
meets their aspirations for selfdetermination redman said 
redman said rabbani will be in washington next week

representatives of the three mile island 
nuclear plant told federal officials monday that allowing 23 
million gallons of contaminated water to evaporate would pose no 
health threat but an activist argued for storing the water at the 
site 
the statements came before the atomic safety and licensing 
board which will help decide what to do with the water 
contaminated by the march 1979 accident at tmi unit 2 and the 
continuing cleanup 
a battery of lawyers representing the plant owner gpu nuclear 
corp faced frances skolnick the lone representative of the 
citizen groups three mile island alert and the susquehanna alliance 
peter b block chairman of the board repeatedly reproached 
skolnick saying she was failing to prove her alternative was 
better than the gpu proposal 
in his opening statement attorney thomas a baxter told the 
board gpu nuclear wants to evaporate the water and bury the residue 
off site as commercial lowlevel waste at a cost of 41 million 
the intervenors alternative would cost at least 21 million 
for the preprocessing of the water 91 million for the tanks 
they suggest plus the unknown costs of ultimate disposal of the 
water baxter said 
baxter also argued evaporation would pose no health risk in the 
middletown area 
he said a conservative estimate of the average exposure to 
someone living within a 50mile radius is 0005 millirems of 
radiation compared with about 300 millirems per year that people 
receive from natural sources 
gpu nuclear has argued that storing the water in tanks at the 
plant would be dangerous because during an accident the entire 
load would flow into the nearby susquehanna river which feeds into 
the chesapeake bay 
dr robert piccioni a senior staff scientist at accord research 
and educational associates of new york city disputed the gpu 
nuclear scenerio 
piccioni testifying as skolnicks expert witness said that 
there appears to be an overstatement by the licensee regarding 
the amount of contamination that would be released 
questioned during a break piccioni said the levels of 
contamination suggested by gpu nuclear would not be reached if the 
activists recommendations were followed 
first they assume that the water is not treated which they 
plan on doing anyway he said second they assume all 23 
million gallons would go into the river and three they assume 
people will eat shellfish from the chesapeake bay after the 
release which would account for a majority of the dose 
piccioni acknowledged the alternative would cost more than gpu 
nuclears plan 
but i dont have an easy time associating dollar costs with 
cancer risks he said 
the fourday hearing continues tuesday

space shuttle atlantis will be moved 
to the launch pad early wednesday for a late november liftoff with 
a secret military payload 
the fourmile sixhour trip to launch pad 39b was scheduled to 
start at 1201 am with the shuttle perched upright on the broad 
back of a giant tracked transporter called a crawler 
the move was delayed two days after a threeinch wire was 
discovered saturday pinned beneath a nut and washer that are part 
of structure that attaches the shuttle to its external fuel tank 
before the nut could be loosened to get at the wire atlantis 
had to be partially decoupled from the tank to which it was 
attached last week 
lisa malone a national aeronautics and space adminstration 
spokeswoman said the wire was removed monday and engineers did not 
determine how it became lodged under the washer 
at the pad atlantis will be readied for a launch in the last 
week in november a date will be set nov 10 following a flight 
readiness review nasa said monday the launch would occur between 
632 am and 932 am est

the state environmental agency has 
blocked a nineyear attempt by an excavating company to establish a 
landfill on land believed to be a sacred indian burial ground 
richard l shank director of the ohio environmental protection 
agency went to the cuyahoga valley national recreation area 
between cleveland and akron on monday to announce his rejection of 
the landfill application 
we won the council fires will be burning tonight all over the 
united states said mel fletcher a social worker at akrons 
north american indian center who has worked to preserve the 
remaining 25 percent of the burial ground undisturbed by shale 
mining 
the council fires similar to the smoke signals that indians 
used to communicate mean we have succeeded to keep from 
polluting the burial grounds fletcher said 
shank said his decision while affecting the burial site and the 
33000acre recreation area was based primarily on environmental 
risks to underground water resources 
he said the geology of the landfill site a 200foot shale 
quarry in this cleveland suburb was inappropriate for dumping 
trash because of the risk of contamination of underground water 
resources the company wanted permission to dump up to 2750 tons a 
day 
in addition shank said this decision is based in part on 
my continued belief that a landfill has no business being placed in 
or near a park or recognized recreation area such as this one in 
the cuyahoga valley 
the recreation area which follows a 22mile stretch along the 
cuyahoga river attracts more than 6 million people a year 
boyas excavating inc of cleveland had applied to operate a 
31acre landfill on private land within the park boundary for up to 
20 years 
mike gavin an attorney for boyas excavating said the company 
would probably appeal shanks decision because of the expense 
incurred in its nineyear battle to gain approval of the landfill 
fletcher 60 a member of the choctaw indian tribe of oklahoma 
and mississippi has visited the burial ground once or twice weekly 
for several years he hopes to rebury bones found at the site in 
1984 if indians gain control of the land

interest rates have been falling in recent 
weeks but many economists believe they will stabilize around 
current levels for the rest of the year and climb early next year 
while the federal reserve is not likely to take any action to 
drive rates higher for the rest of 1988 these analysts said the 
central bank will be forced into a series of rate hikes beginning 
next year to fight renewed inflationary pressures 
the federal open market committee led by fed chairman alan 
greenspan was meeting behind closed doors today to review how the 
economy has been performing and map monetary policy for the next 
two months 
analysts said they expected no dramatic change in course from 
this session especially given the fact that the presidential 
election is just one week away 
right now there is no overwhelming need to change monetary 
policy and they certainly arent going to stick their neck out one 
week before an election said david wyss chief financial 
economist with data resources inc a lexington mass forecasting 
firm 
various economic reports are suggesting that the economy slowed 
in the second half of the year last week the government said the 
broadest measure of the economy the gross national product grew 
at a modest 22 percent annual rate during the summer the slowest 
pace in almost two years 
many economists believe this slowdown is good because it will 
relieve the pressure on tight labor markets and factories already 
operating at peak capacity 
the fed began a series of credittightening steps late last 
march which culminated in august with a onehalf percentage point 
increase in its discount rate the interest it charges to make bank 
loans 
analysts give these changes part of the credit for slowing 
economic growth although some critics contend the central bank 
overreacted and has increased the chances of a recession next year 
economic growth has slowed to far below its potential said 
richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce it 
is time for the fed to reverse its mistaken interestrate policy 
and lower the discount rate before slowing investment derails the 
71monthold economic expansion 
while economic growth has slowed many economists argue that it 
is not at all certain that inflationary pressures have abated they 
predicted the fed would take a waitandsee attitude ready to 
react more quickly to signs of inflation than to fears of a 
recession 
the performance of consumer prices especially energy and food 
prices and renewed downward pressure on the dollar will contribute 
to higher inflation next year many economists said 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said the 
fed will probably delay further increases in interest rates 
however partly out of fears that it could be accused of 
manipulating the presidential election 
i think the fed would consider it extremely poor form to 
tighten right after the election people would say they knew they 
had to tighten but they just held off until george bush got 
elected he said 
mortgage rates have been falling in recent weeks reflecting an 
easing of inflation fears on financial markets because of the 
various reports showing slower growth in the second half 
fixedrate mortgages stood at 1022 percent at the end of last 
week according to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp down from 1042 percent at the end of september 
reflecting this decline the veterans administration announced 
monday that it was lowering its maximum interest rate for federally 
backed va home loan mortgages by onehalf percentage point to 10 
percent effective tuesday 
but warren lasko executive director of the mortgage bankers 
association said he would not be surprised to see fixedrate 
mortgages hit 11 percent by next spring driven higher by borrowing 
demands on the part of the federal government and other factors 
the economy is working at almost full capacity there are some 
pressures on wages he said while these pressures are less 
ominous than they were two months ago we are still forecasting 
higher interest rates 
evans predicted that fixedrate mortgages could hit 115 percent 
next year 
the official minutes of todays meeting will not be released 
until after the next fomc meeting scheduled for dec 1314 on 
friday the central bank will release the minutes of the last 
policy session held on sept 20

a new survey of real estate investment 
prospects in major cities says there are fewer best markets 
this year although los angeles washington and boston remain the 
most favorable 
it said the worst real estate markets are houston denver and 
dallas 
the report released monday said new york was dropped from the 
list of most bullish property markets because it is just too 
expensive to live there 
even washington and boston while remaining on the list of top 
prospects were said to face possible future problems due to their 
fastrising housing costs 
fewer and fewer people can afford to live in or near those 
centers and that will take its toll on economic expansion the 
report said 
but real estate research corp said that despite its current 
problems new york is a premier market that will return to favor 
as its inherent strengths prevail 
the company said its survey was based on interviews with 90 real 
estate investors lenders and developers around the country 
it said there are fewer best markets than in the past and 
that no city or region offers good prospects across the board 
los angeles was called a prime investment prospect despite 
regulatory barriers 
las pluses economic diversity job growth climate quality 
of life and pacific rim access outweigh traffic congestion 
smog ridiculously high housing prices and regulatory hurdles 
said the report emerging trends in real estate 1989 
growth restriction it says is one of the things that 
attracts investors to california and to the other topranked areas 
developers complain often bitterly of the hassles expense and 
risk but they are increasingly resigned to them and willing to 
accept the responsibilities in return for unsurpass development 
opportunities less competition and upside profits 
the report put houston denver and dallas under places to be 
avoided also included in this category were austin san antonio 
new orleans and tulsa 
any meaningful turnaround is still a year or so off in dallas 
and two to three years in houston the report said denver a 
much smaller market needs a yearortwo respite when it does come 
back it wont be to the level of the early 80s 
here is what the report said of other cities as real estate 
investment opportunities 
phoenix overbuilt in every property type speculative 
samplfinanced land deals apartments and office space are in 
seriously long supply the phoenix economy is slow and steady 
resort pizazz notwithstanding and needs three years to rebuild 
enough momentum to justify new starts

president reagan disputes hostage terry 
andersons videotaped statement that the administration bargained 
with terrorists but says he still doesnt know what happened in 
the irancontra affair 
reagan commented monday on the videotape of anderson that was 
released in beirut by proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers 
i dont think that was terry speaking the president said 
after a billsigning ceremony in a hotel ballroom i think he had 
a script that was given to him 
when i was given a script i always read the lines the 
former movie actor said to laughter in the room sprinkled with film 
luminaries 
hollywood executives and such stars as charlton heston and cyd 
charisse had come to watch reagan sign a copyright bill affecting 
the entertainment industry 
reporters however zeroed in on andersons taped statements 
that the administration thwarted efforts for the release of the 
hostages and that vice president george bush had bargained with 
terrorists during the irancontra affair and the 1985 hijacking of 
a twa airliner on a middle east flight 
theres never been any interference nor have we ever been 
negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of kidnapper 
on a ransom type of basis the president said 
asked specifically whether bush now the republican candidate 
for president was involved in the twa talks the president said 
george has been a part of everything that weve accomplished 
but in a constructive way and thats why hes my choice in the 
coming election 
when asked if this meant bush was involved in all his decisions 
on the irancontra affair which wound up in a scandal the 
president replied 
well there was no scandal that scandal im afraid has 
been artificially created by a media that i cannot understand 
the president completed the sentence by saying that his 
administration sought to find out the facts the minute the news 
broke and the operation was exposed 
and i am still asking after 10 months of a congressional 
investigation i still dont know who delivered the weapons and 
where the money came from reagan said 
bush asked during an interview with nbc anchor tom brokaw about 
andersons statement said i had no role that you are aware of 
or are not aware of absolutely so i dont know what hes what 
that refers to 
anderson 41 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was kidnapped by the islamic jihad on march 16 
1985 he is the longestheld of the 14 foreign hostages in lebanon 
nine are americans 
copies of the 2minute 35second tape were delivered to two 
western news agencies in beirut four days after anderson marked his 
fourth birthday in captivity 
i have been very close to being released several times over 
the past three years but each time it seems that the us 
government uses its influence to stop any agreement and i dont 
understand this anderson said on the tape 
i am not asking reagan to deal with terrorists although mr 
bush did so in the irancontra affair and twa hijacking he said 
reagan said any information anderson has must come from his 
captors 
you have to recognize that no hostage is taking something upon 
himself he said theyre telling him what to do

a new book and a tv report are reviving the 
emotional debate over the john f kennedy assassination and whether 
reputed louisiana mob chieftain carlos marcello conspired to kill 
the president 
jonathan kwitny a former investigative reporter for the wall 
street journal hosts an hourlong public television special that 
concludes there was a mob conspiracy to kill kennedy 
the tv report points to evidence that both kennedy assassin lee 
harvey oswald and oswalds killer jack ruby had connections to 
marcellos crime syndicate 
the show airs tonight on new york public television and 
elsewhere later in the month it recounts a potpourri of evidence 
presented over the years by kennedy authors theorists and 
investigators plus some new evidence unearthed by john h davis a 
cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis and author of a new book on 
marcello and the jfk slaying 
marcello who was a prime target of thenattorney general robert 
f kennedy and was temporarily deported by rfk was mentioned by 
the house select committee on assassinations as a possible 
conspiracy suspect in the jfk assassination 
the house panel concluded that kennedy was probably the victim 
of a conspiracy breaking sharply with the warren commission the 
commission appointed by lyndon johnson and headed by thenchief 
justice earl warren concluded that there was no conspiracy and 
two commission counsels who appear on the kwitny report reject the 
mob conspiracy theory as nonsense 
sen arlen specter rpa who served as a commission counsel 
said evidence presented by the theorists are snatches of a little 
fact here and there which really add up to nothing 
the warren commission turned over every stone and found no 
conspiracy specter said 
david belin the panels chief counsel scoffed at the notion 
that ruby who gunned down oswald in a dallas police station was a 
mob assassin 
mafia hitmen do not go ahead and kill their targets when 
theyre surrounded by police when theyre sure to be apprehended 
and face life in prison and possible death he said 
marcello reportedly hated the kennedys for the 1961 deportation 
a las vegas private investigator told the house committee that 
marcello indicated to him a year before the slaying that he wanted 
to kill the president you cut off the head the tail dies ed 
becker quoted marcello as saying the tail allegedly was a 
reference to rfk 
the evidence presented by mob conspiracy theorists include that 
oswalds uncle who helped raise him worked for the marcello 
organization and reports that oswald at least several times met 
david ferrie who was marcellos personal pilot 
a new piece of evidence uncovered by davis in his book titled 
mafia kingfish is an fbi report quoting a georgia businessman 
who said shortly after the assassination that he remembered seeing 
oswald earlier that year accepting cash from a man later identified 
as a top marcello lieutenant the author said the fbi never 
followed up on that lead 
ruby according to one fbi report was not just a dallas 
nightclub owner and a smalltime operator but an important player 
in narcotics trafficking in the dallas area which would have 
fallen under marcellos turf and the mob conspiracy theorists 
point to reports that ruby went to visit santos traficante when the 
reputed miami mob boss was imprisoned in cuba 
clearly rubys ties to the mafia werent just marginal as the 
warren commission suggested he was exactly the sort of person to 
be assigned to an important and risky mission and he was not the 
sort of person who would have suddenly shot oswald in sorrow for 
the kennedys kwitny said 
kwitny points to several eyewitness reports that place ruby 
outside the dallas police station long before he shot oswald ruby 
said he just happened on the police station and killed oswald 
spontaneously hoping to spare the presidents widow the pain of 
coming back to texas and testifying at oswalds trial 
belin dismissed the reports of those who say they saw ruby 
earlier whenever you have a witness to an accident to any 
sudden emergency youre going to get different stories he said 
kwitny also argues that the late teamsters boss jimmy hoffa was 
involved with marcello in the alleged conspiracy noting hoffas 
hatred of robert kennedy for his dogged investigations of union 
corruption kwitny also quoted hoffas son as saying his father had 
known ruby since 1939 and law enforcement officials said hoffa and 
marcello were close 
the kennedy assassination 25 years ago this nov 22 has 
triggered a neverending flow of conspiracy theories ranging from 
mob retribution to a cia scheme to a plot by cuban leader fidel 
castro 
last week a british television program claimed three french 
gangsters killed kennedy on a contract from american mob figures 
some including the house assassinations committee believe 
there was a second gunman standing on the grassy knoll as the 
presidents motorcade rode through dallas dealey plaza 
the us government has stood by the warren commission findings 
and closed its investigation into the slaying

new figures from the agriculture department 
show that farm commodity prices on the average have held steady 
the last two months after peaking during the summer drought 
even so the usdas preliminary figures released monday showed 
that october prices still averaged 13 percent more than they did a 
year ago 
the departments agricultural statistics board said prices rose 
from september to october for oranges milk lettuce and corn but 
were offset by lower prices for tomatoes apples eggs and soybeans 
meanwhile prices paid by farmers to meet expenses a figure 
computed only every three months rose 12 percent from july and 
averaged 55 percent more than a year ago 
farmers paid more for feeder cattle and calves than they did in 
july but feed and fuels were lower the report said 
prices received by farmers for some major commodities are based 
on midmonth averages and then are revised the following month when 
additional information is available 
the revised figures showed the leveling off actually began in 
september when the price index held steady at its august average 
the preliminary reading for october continued at the 
augustseptember level 
prices of raw farm commodities began rising in may as the 
drought worsened and continued climbing in june july and august 
an increase of about 11 percent from last april 
after holding steady during most of last winter the usda index 
rose 31 percent from april to may followed by june 22 percent 
july 29 percent and august 21 percent 
the drought and searing heat during the spring and summer cut 
1988 harvest prospects sharply and triggered the midyear price 
rise total us grain production is expected to be down 31 percent 
from last years harvest 
despite the leveling of the overall price index some commodity 
prices were higher in october wheat for example rose an 
additional 14 cents per bushel to a us farm price average of 
389 per bushel the most since it was 395 in may 1981 
prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were 
unchanged from september although dairy products gained 31 
percent during the month and the index for poultry and eggs 
declined 5 percent compared with october 1987 the index was up 
41 percent 
the departments allcrops price index for october although 
unchanged from september was up 27 percent from a year earlier 
prices of feed grain and hay as a group rose 15 percent from 
september and averaged 62 percent more than in october 1987 
prices of commercial vegetables were down 5 percent from 
september but were still 82 percent more than a year ago 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 55 
billion to 60 billion this year compared with the record level of 
571 billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists are holding to an earlier prediction that 
consumer food prices will rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year 
compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 before the 
drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 
percent to 4 percent 
some usda officials also have predicted that the drought may add 
2 percentage points to food prices in 1989 above the expected 
increase in inflation currently forecast at around 4 percent that 
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 
7 percent 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6790 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 6720 in september and 6290 reported for 
october 1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as 
beef 
hogs averaged 3940 per 100 pounds compared with 4070 in 
september and 4890 a year earlier 
corn at 271 a bushel was up from 260 in september and the 
average of 155 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 389 per bushel compared with 375 in september and 
262 a year earlier 
rice averaged 715 per 100 pounds compared with 682 in 
september and 588 a year earlier 
soybeans were 771 per bushel compared with 794 in 
september and 504 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 50 cents per pound compared with 
518 in september and 651 cents in october 1987 
eggs were 587 cents per dozen compared with 638 cents in 
september and 502 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1280 per 100 pounds compared with 1240 in 
september and 1290 a year earlier 
broilers were 375 cents per pound live weight compared with 
392 cents in september and 251 cents a year ago

the pilot of a delta air lines flight that 
crashed last august near dallas waited at least 20 seconds after a 
stall warning before he applied full power according to documents 
the documents made public monday by the national transportation 
safety board pointed to no specific cause for the aug 31 crash in 
which 14 of the 108 people aboard flight 1141 were killed 
the ntsb investigation is not expected to be completed for a 
number of weeks 
according to a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape on 
flight 1141 an unusual snap was heard seconds after liftoff 
followed almost immediately by a vibration of the control column 
a warning of an impending stall 
a normal procedure for dealing with an impending stall close to 
the ground such as in a takeoff would be to apply full power and 
attempt to fly out of the problem according to aviation experts 
but the transcript showed that capt larry davis 48 a veteran 
delta pilot did not call for full power until nearly 23 
seconds after the first sign of trouble and nearly 20 seconds after 
the socalled stickshaker stall warning 
the call to full power came as the aircraft was about to crash 
and eight seconds after davis could be heard on the tape saying 
were not gonna make it according to the transcript 
davis a 23year veteran at delta with 17000 hours of flying 
including 6500 in a boeing 727 later told investigators in 
retrospect i should have pushed up full power immediately 
a summary of the ntsb interview of davis from his hospital bed 
was included among the documents made public monday without further 
comment by safety board officials 
the documents provided no apparent clear evidence as to 
specifically what caused flight 1141 not to gain proper lift as it 
departed the dallasfort worth airport the flight was bound for 
salt lake city utah 
the investigation continues to focus on the possibility that the 
flight crew failed to set the planes flaps properly inhibiting 
the aircrafts lift the ntsb previously had said that the wing 
flaps were found in a retracted position in the wreckage as was the 
cockpit lever controlling the flaps 
but the cockpit tape transcript shows as also has been 
previously disclosed that copilot gary kirkland specifically 
acknowledged during a pretakeoff check that the flaps were in the 
proper 15 degree extension contradicting evidence in the wreckage 
but that does not necessarily mean the flaps actually were in 
that position sources close to the investigation have said among 
the documents released monday were the results of a sophisticated 
sound analysis of the tape to determine whether there were any 
background sounds to indicate flaps being extended 
the tests concluded that after an examination of the entire tape 
from flight 1141 no noise pattern could be found to match the 
pattern of flaps actually being set on a test boeing 727 aircraft 
two click sounds heard on the tape did not match the pattern of 
an actual setting of flaps on the test plane the document said 
kirkland has told investigators he recalls nothing after the 
plane departed from the gate 
davis has said he does not know whether the flaps were set 
properly although he recalled kirkland making the acknowledgment 
a third man in the cockpit flight engineer steven judd 31 said 
he believes that kirkland set the flaps to their proper setting 
but does not recall actually seeing the flap lever in that position 
according to the ntsb documents a takeoff alarm that should 
have sounded if the flaps were not properly set was inspected 20 
days before the accident and replaced because the horn was weak 
and intermittent a new alarm was installed 
meanwhile the cockpit tape which began shortly before the 
aircraft pushed back from the gate revealed that flight 1141 had 
nearly a 30minute wait before getting takeoff clearance during 
which much of the time the flight crew sometimes with a flight 
attendant taking part engaged in casual conversation including a 
lengthy exchange about the large number of birds at the dallasfort 
worth airport 
at one point the transcript refers to nearly eight minutes of 
nonpertinent conversation omitted from the transcript with 
a senior flight attendant the exchange is cut short when davis 
asks kirkland about requiring to change frequencies to contact a 
second ground controller as the plane moved from the east to the 
west side of the airport 
yeah im sorry im sitting here talking to the flight 
attendant apologized kirkland 
judd the flight engineer later told investigators that when 
the plane was third in line for takeoff he announced the plane 
would be taking off soon in part because of his concern about the 
flight attendants continued presence in the cockpit one ntsb 
document said

in republican as well as democratic accents 
the name and the policies of john f kennedy are echoing in the 
waning days of the campaign for the white house 
and to hear the republican ticket tell it democrat michael 
dukakis is no jack kennedy 
george bush claims that on such issues as taxes and defense he 
has more in common with jfk than dukakis does 
dukakis has been invoking the kennedy political legacy all 
campaign long 
on sunday after shrinking from the liberal label all season 
dukakis declared that he is one and said kennedy was too 
yes i am a liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and 
harry truman and john kennedy the massachusetts governor said 
thats not the kennedy legacy bush cites how much the 
national democratic party has changed since the days of john 
kennedy bush said how far it has moved from those policies of 
lower taxes and a stronger defense 
a dukakis campaign commercial recalls the narrow 1960 victory 
that put kennedy in the white house my friends they won that 
election by a margin of 112000 votes out of nearly 70 million 
cast he says and remember what a difference john kennedy and 
lyndon johnson made in the lives of millions and millions of 
people 
the kennedy issue first was unleashed by sen lloyd bentsen the 
democratic vice presidential nominee and unlikely enforcer of 
claims on the jfk legacy 
in debate with sen dan quayle bushs running mate bentsen 
dismissed his rivals claim to congressional experience matching 
kennedys with a stinging senator youre no jack kennedy 
kennedys brother sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts was 
gentler and kinder to quayle kennedy said that while they disagree 
on issues he thinks the indiana senator was treated unfairly in 
news accounts that questioned his record and abilities 
quayle used bentsens belittling line monday to dispute dukakis 
claim to the venerable liberal tradition of roosevelt truman and 
kennedy 
i didnt know jack kennedy and i didnt serve with jack 
kennedy but michael dukakis is no jack kennedy quayle told a 
crowd in michigan 
when he chose bentsen as his running mate dukakis said he was 
reassembling a bostonaustin partnership that would win the white 
house as kennedy and lyndon b johnson did in 1960 he says that 
was a strong ticket one of our best tickets and that he and 
bentsen are out to match it 
bush has taken to reciting lines from kennedy speeches notably 
on a 1963 tax cut proposal 
in santa clara calif last thursday bush said dukakis 
election would mean higher taxes smothering economic growth and 
that it would then become virtually impossible to cut the budget 
deficit 
the reason for this was perhaps best explained by a previous 
democratic president none other than john f kennedy back in 
1962 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today 
and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the 
revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now bush said 
quoting the late president 
in detroit insisting that his proposal for a reduction in the 
tax on capital gains would spur the economy and create new jobs 
bush said kennedy endorsed just such a plan dukakis has denounced 
the bush proposal as a tax break for the rich 
in waterbury conn bush recalled a memorable kennedy campaign 
rally shortly before his 1960 victory when thousands of people 
waited long into a rainy night to see the young candidate from 
boston 
if we succeed here then the cause of freedom is 
strengthened kennedy told them 
its important to remember how president john f kennedy went 
about strengthening the cause of freedom bush said he signed 
one of the most important tax cuts in our history he rapidly 
rebuilt americas national defense and from that position of 
strength he was able to negotiate a test ban treaty with the 
soviets 
kennedy did not live to sign the tax cut he proposed president 
johnson signed it into law on feb 26 1964 
theres sometimes a kennedy flavor in dukakis campaign 
speeches more often in the six weeks or so since theodore c 
sorensen kennedys friend aide and speechwriter began traveling 
with the democratic nominee 
dukakis tells people that we can do better promises to 
get this country moving again sometimes speaks of conquering 
new frontiers

the supreme court will referee a dispute over 
congressional access to national security information the latest 
conflict over checks and balances between the legislative and 
executive branches 
the justices announced monday they will consider reviving 
legislation limiting presidential authority to withhold classified 
information a decision is expected by july 
justice sandra day oconnor who had breast cancer surgery 10

oconnor 58 has said the cancer was detected in an early stage 
and the prognosis is for a full recovery 
the national security case involving classified information a 
sticking point for years between congress and various presidents 
stems from a 1983 directive by president reagan 
the directive requires federal officials before they are 
allowed access to classified information to sign an agreement they 
will not disclose the information 
the directive also created a standard form for officials to 
sign promising they never will divulge classified or 
classifiable information without written permission from proper 
authorities 
members of congress said the president is seeking to abridge 
freespeech rights of federal employees and punish whistleblowers 
for making disclosures that embarrass their superiors 
opponents of the presidential directive also said the secrecy 
agreement federal employees must sign would bar them for life from 
revealing information to congress which lawmakers are entitled to 
receive 
congress enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds during the 
198788 fiscal year to implement the standard forms reagan had 
authorized a similar provision was attached to the spending bill 
for the current fiscal year 
a federal judge declared the legislation unconstitutional last 
may because he said it tramples on presidential foreignpolicy 
powers 
the american foreign service association representing members 
of the nations diplomatic corps and senators and house members 
from both political parties appealed to the supreme court to 
reinstate the law 
president reagan announced last week that he was pocketvetoing 
another measure intended to give new protection to federal 
employees who expose government fraud and abuse that measure is 
not tied directly to the case acted on by the court monday

us experts say the soviet budget deficit 
that moscow has finally acknowledged is comparatively larger than 
that of america and could jeopardize the reform program of kremlin 
chief mikhail gorbachev 
the soviets likely will try to ease the deficit by printing more 
money raising prices and reducing subsidies on such goods as 
housing and food according to the central intelligence agency and 
two nongovernment economists marshall goldman of harvard 
university and jan vanous 
but those steps could anger consumers as well as key interest 
groups such as the military goldman and vanous said monday in 
telephone interviews 
the soviet finance minister boris gostev said during a session 
of parliament last week that the kremlin expected to run a deficit 
of 34 billion rubles 55 billion on a budget of 493 billion 
rubles 795 billion in 1989 the soviet government budget makes 
up the bulk of the socialist countrys economy in which nearly all 
enterprises are owned by the state 
gostev did not disclose the deficit for 1988 or previous years 
a cia report issued in september before gostev spoke estimated 
that the soviet deficit had grown from 11 billion rubles or 14 
percent of gross national product in 1984 to 64 billion rubles or 
74 percent of gnp in 1987 
by contrast the us government deficit peaked as a percentage 
of gnp at 35 percent in 1986 148 billion 
vanous estimated the soviet deficit for 1987 and 1988 at 6575 
billion rubles per year 
the actual deficit is much higher than the soviet figure 
said vanous who develops econometric models of the soviet economy 
for planecon a washington firm what they have released to the 
public is a distortion 
the cia analysis said gorbachev needs to come to grips with 
the budget deficit most of the options open to him however 
impinge on the welfare of the population or key interest groups 
such as the military just at a time when he needs as much 
political support as he can garner 
if the budget deficit is not brought down it could lead to 
inflation much worse than the soviets have experience in the 
postwar era the cia said 
goldman said that gostevs budget figures were probably meant 
as a warning signal to the population that prices will be going 
up and that subsidies will be going down 
the whole thing is so bizarre because they say now that the 
previous budgets were incorrect said goldman the associate 
director of the russian research center at harvard glasnost 
greater openness has been in effect for three years and this is 
the first we have heard of the deficit so we dont know what is 
right 
the deficit began to rise in 1985 the year gorbachev became 
communist party general secretary and it really took off in 
198788 said vanous 
vanous attributed the jump to two factors a 30 billion ruble 
revenue shortfall resulting from decreased sales of stateproduced 
alcohol and a 40 billion decrease in oil export and related 
earnings due to lower world petroleum prices 
while two main sources of revenue were drying up said vanous 
outlays increased gorbachev went ahead and kept spending he 
said 
they have already been running deficits but they were 
typically quite modest 23 percent of gnp which was covered by 
increase in monetary supply causing inflation said vanous 
they always have hidden inflation which was running at 23 
percent per year they are finally admitting it because it is so 
bad in some sectors he said 
soviet economists and goldman have said that the budget was 
also caused by new methods of accounting introduced under gorbachev 
to give a more accurate picture of the economy 
the cia analysis said kremlin economic figures are so far off 
that the us intelligence agency had developed its own method of 
calculating the soviet ecomomy recent statements by soviet 
reformers indicated that cia estimates were in many cases closer to 
the truth than the previous official soviet data the analysis said

the chairman of the fund insuring commercial 
bank deposits says hes ready to help the comparable fund for 
savings institutions provided theres no request for money 
involved 
the fdic would like to help you in any way we can within 
limits of course federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman told delegates to the us league of savings 
institutions 96th annual convention 
in remarks to reporters after his speech on monday seidman 
said i strongly oppose the banks having to pay for the problems 
of the thrift industry and that banks prefer to go it alone 
with their own insurance fund 
however he did not rule out merging the two regulatory systems 
provided insurance costs were kept separate he said the fdic could 
help thrifts by providing use of its credit 
at midyear 497 of the 3096 us savings associations were 
insolvent while another 408 were losing money regulators estimate 
it will cost 45 billion to 50 billion to clean up the mess and 
the sampls say they cant pay for the cleanup without help from 
congress 
in contrast seidman said the fdic fund although it will suffer 
its first loss ever is sound it had 163 billion at the end of 
september and should shrink to between 15 billion and 16 billion 
by yearss end before growing by about 500 million next year he 
said 
seidman said bank failures should decline from a postdepression 
record topping 200 this year to between 175 and 200 next year 
there are no more megabank failures on the horizon next year 
he said 
theo h pitt jr chairman of pioneer savings bank in rocky 
mount nc and outgoing chairman of the sampl industrys trade 
group said the organization will fight next year to preserve a 
separate regulatory system arguing that it is crucial to the 
american home buyer 
seidman said americans appear to want a separate sampl system and 
government probably will preserve one but he said i dont 
think the world would necessarily come to an end if there were no 
thrifts 
pitt opening the first day of a fourday convention said 
bungled deregulation by the reagan administration bankrupted the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp 
weve had our troubles but you know how we got there as a 
result of illtimed poorly executed illconceived deregulation 
pitt said 
the regulators let some real sharpies slip into the system 
high fliers who looked upon their institutions as personal piggy 
banks to serve their own irresponsible sometimes criminal ends 
he said 
pitt said the industry has spent 45 billion in extra payments 
to its insurance fund can spend no more than an additional 3 
billion and should not be forced to contribute more because the 
crisis was not of its making 
however h joe selby former director of regulatory affairs in 
the federal home loan bank of dallas which oversees some of the 
most troubled savings institutions in the country disputed pitts 
account 
my god the thrift industry has fought and fought and fought 
regulation selby said in an interview they want to have their 
cake and eat it both 
selby who now operates a consulting firm in dallas the 
insignia company said they wanted deregulation they got 
deregulation they didnt want supervised deregulation and they 
didnt get supervised deregulation 
pitt outlining a part of the trade groups legislative strategy 
for next year said the industry will push for regulatory reform as 
part of a package providing new money to the fslic 
among the reforms he mentioned were tighter restrictions on sampl 
investments in junk bonds and in commercial real estate projects 
limits on the availability of highpriced brokered deposits 
greater power for regulators to block the creation of new sampls or 
the transfer of ownership of existing institutions and limits on 
growth tied to the amount of capital an institution can raise from 
private investors

imelda marcos pleaded innocent monday to 
racketeering charges for allegedly helping her husband deposed 
philippine president ferdinand marcos plunder 100 million from 
their countrys treasury 
us district judge john f keenan set bail for mrs marcos at 
5 million and said she could not return to hawaii and her ailing 
husband until details of the bond are worked out 
mrs marcos 59 famous for her opulent lifestyle as first lady 
of the philippines arrived at the federal courthouse by limousine 
accompanied by an entourage of at least a dozen people 
she wore a fulllength chiffon aquamarine gown with traditional 
filipino butterfly sleeves pearl earrings and black pumps and her 
queenly appearance stunned the crowded courtroom into silence 
mrs marcos later found herself blinking back tears when the 
judge refused to allow her to return right away to hawaii where 
she and her 71yearold husband have lived since he was forced out 
of the philippines in february 1986 
im not going to let the lady go back to the hawaiian islands 
until im certain the bail is set keenan said as a glum mrs 
marcos brushed away a tear 
he ordered her to return to court thursday with her lawyers if 
they had not worked out a bail package by then with prosecutors 
after being fingerprinted and photographed by federal marshals 
she was released temporarily without bail and told not to leave the 
new york area mrs marcos who arrived sunday is staying at the 
posh waldorf towers in a suite reportedly costing 1800 a night 
aides said the bill would be paid by marcos friends they would not 
identify 
the marcoses were indicted oct 21 by a federal grand jury in 
manhattan for a racketeering scheme that allegedly plundered the 
filipino treasury of some 103 million 
the money allegedly was spirited out of the philippines to 
foreign bank accounts and then used to buy prime manhattan real 
estate and art objects 
the court appearance was mrs marcos first visit to new york 
since she and her husband fled their homeland they have lived in 
honolulu since then and are forbidden to leave the island of oahu 
without us government permission 
the former president remained in hawaii defense lawyers claimed 
last week that he was too frail to make the 10hour plane trip 
keenan postponed marcos arraignment pending an examination by a 
government physician performed later monday in honolulu 
results were to be sent tuesday to the judge and lawyers in new 
york said sgt robert shipp a spokesman at tripler army medical 
center hospital in hawaii 
mrs marcos sat with two lawyers on either side of her and spoke 
aloud only twice during the 45minute proceeding once to waive a 
reading of the sixcount indictment and once to answer not 
guilty 
outside the courthouse at least a dozen signcarrying 
protesters chanted justice justice must prevail send the 
marcoses to jail one woman wearing a black cape and vampire 
fangs held up a sign that read imelda bloodsucker of the 
filipino people 
but their demonstration was off to the side of an even bigger 
crowd that included hundreds of photographers television camera 
crews and passersby who stopped out of curiosity about the 
commotion 
mrs marcos coatless despite the chill autumn air clasped 
rosary beads as she stepped from a caravan of seven autos and 
walked the gauntlet of reporters and photographers who were held 
back by police barricades on the courthouse steps 
in the courtroom crowded with 200 artists reporters and 
spectators the bulk of the session was taken up with trying to set 
bail 
after lawyers for both sides argued keenan set bail to be 
secured by real estate cash and personal possessions amounting 
to a reasonable market value of 5 million 
earlier in the hearing the judge said he would not detain mrs 
marcos but a hitch developed when prosecutors and defense lawyers 
could not agree on the property and cash to secure bail 
defense lawyers who originally wanted mrs marcos released 
without bail had agreed to a bail package in which the couple 
would put up 12 million in philippine pesos along with jewelry 
they brought to this country in 1986 
but assistant us attorney charles labella balked noting the 
jewelry is subject to subpoena in an ongoing grand jury 
investigation and the current philippine government has laid claim 
to the marcoses philippine currency 
marcos attorney john s bartko conceded there are conflicting 
claims to the property brought by the marcoses to the united 
states and that a federal judge in california has frozen 
anything the marcoses own anywhere in the world except for 
living expenses and lawyer fees 
the marcoses have been forced to live on borrowed funds 
said bartko all of their collateral is subject to claims 
keenan suggested putting up the hillside home the marcoses 
occupy in honolulus makiki heights but bartko said the home was 
owned by an offshore corporation controlled by a marcos 
codefendant 
also suggested and rejected were the marcoses swiss bank 
accounts and a home in woodside calif 
keenan eventually gave lawyers until thursday morning to work 
out a plan they and mrs marcos are to appear before him then if 
no agreement is reached

a test tube experiment shows that a protein 
produced in cells infected by the common liver disease hepatitisb 
may activate production of the aids virus in human cells 
dr ts benedict yen an assistant professor at the university 
of california san francisco says the finding suggests an 
explanation of why almost 90 percent of aids patients are also 
infected by the hepatitisb virus but he cautions that more study 
must be done to determine the exact connection between the two 
viral infections 
a team of scientists led by yen studied the link between 
hepatitisb and aids by inserting fragments of the hepatitisb 
virus into human cell cultures containing the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
yen said the group found that a protein produced by the 
hepatitis virus activates the production of the hiv genes a 
necessary step in the replication of hiv 
the protein produced by the hepatitisb virus is called the x 
protein said yen because it long had been a mystery 
nobody knew for a long time what it did or even if it existed 
or not said yen recently other people have found it can 
activate both its own expression and other viruses we now know 
that includes hiv 
yen said researchers have long recognized that most aids 
patients are also infected with the hepatitisb virus 
thats the reason that for a while some people thought that 
hepatitisb was the cause of aids he said 
yen said it is believed that both aids and the hepatitisb virus 
can infect the same cell at the same time when this happens yen 
said his studies suggest that the xprotein which is produced 
only by hepatitisbinfected cells may contribute to the 
replication of the aids virus 
further studies he said are needed to confirm that aids 
patients have cells that are infected by both viruses 
also he said more study will be needed to verify that the 
xprotein is acting alone in triggering the reproduction of the 
aids virus 
yen said it could be that hepatitisb is acting as an immune 
system stimulant and that it is this action that causes aids to 
replicate he noted that other researchers have found that herpes 
simplex and a related virus both also cause cells to produce a 
protein that can stimulate the aids virus the proteins from these 
two viruses he said are different from xprotein 
both aids and hepatitisb can be transmitted by sexual contact 
and by the exchange of body fluids such as blood both diseases 
are commonly prevalent among homosexual men and among intravenous 
drug users who share needles 
hepatitisb attacks the liver and in severe cases can lead to 
jaundice liver failure and death there is a vaccine against the 
disease 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
that attacks the immune system and leaves the body defenseless 
against other diseases and some cancers there currently is no 
vaccine against aids 
a report on yens research was published monday in the 
proceedings of the national academy of sciences coauthors were 
edward seto and dr b matija peterlin of ucsf and jinghsiung ou 
of the university of southern california school of medicine

an ohio pet shop owner outraged at brokers of 
smuggled possibly diseased mexican parrots helped government 
agents run a twoyear sting operation resulting in planned 
prosecutions in six states 
carol rueve said she and her husband frank helped the us 
fish and wildlife service investigate illegal parrot trafficking 
because it kind of rubbed me wrong when middlemen tried to sell 
them illegal birds 
the investigation operated out of their daytonarea driftwood 
pet shops where an undercover agent posed as the shops 
parrotbuying agent from august 1986 to august 1988 
the probe culminated monday with the announcement that us 
attorneys in indiana missouri illinois wisconsin texas and 
california have agreed to seek indictments against 36 people the 
government believes have been buying parrots from smugglers who 
sneak them across the mexican border near brownsville texas 
two men already have pleaded guilty and are serving sentences in 
texas said andrew pierce the columbus ohiobased agent who for 
two years posed as the rueves bird buyer 
mexico prohibits the commercial exportation of birds but the 
dealers along the border in mexico seem to operate in total 
impunity he said monday its a bad situation 
the service had received complaints of the illegal trade for 
some time but had trouble making cases because dealers claimed 
their birds were bred in captivity in the united states he said 
they dared you to prove they werent bred here he said 
a bird selling on the border in mexico for 100 can sell for 
1000 in a pet store with certain exotic varieties bringing 
many times that pierce said 
pierce said that over the course of two years he bought about 
150 birds for 66000 investigators have seized parrots worth 
about 468000 plus aircraft and vehicles worth another 93000 
the service said 
some of the birds seized during the operation are protected by a 
treaty outlawing international trade in them without permission of 
both the exporting and importing countries or trade in officially 
listed endangered species under any circumstances 
those include the thickbilled parrot an endangered species in 
the united states and thus illegal to import and the black palm 
cockatoo and the scarlet macaw illegal to import without permits 
from the fish and wildlife service and the exporting country 
others include the double yellowhead amazon parrot and the 
mexican redhead parrot which may not be imported without export 
permits from mexico in addition yellownape parrots and redlored 
parrots were seized because they were imported without undergoing 
quarantine service spokeswoman megan durham said 
parrots may carry newcastles disease a highly contagious viral 
disease that can infect poultry the service said

the legacy of the three mile island accident 
nearly 10 years ago includes 23 million gallons of radioactive 
water and continued debate over how much of the nuclear reactors 
core melted 
a government scientist said monday that at least half the 
material in the core melted during the march 1979 accident a 
figure higher than most previous estimates 
the material that melted included fuel and the tubes in which 
the fuel was contained james broughton manager of the tmi2 
accident evaluation program at the idaho national engineering 
laboratory said at a conference of the american nuclear society 
many of you may not be aware that at least 50 percent of the 
core melted during the accident broughton told industry 
officials 
in the accident at the pennsylvania plants unit 2 reactor 
uranium fuel was allowed to lose the vital cooling water that 
normally covers it causing temperatures to rise dangerously in the 
core 
broughtons estimate based on an updated scenario of the 
accident was higher than the 35 percent figure presented to the 
nuclear regulatory commission on april 15 1987 by donald 
mcpherson of the department of energy 
as late as several years after the accident it had been 
uncertain even whether any of the fuel had melted 
franklin standerfer who has directed the plant cleanup for gpu 
nuclear the plant operator said in an interview that there was 
guesswork involved in figuring the core damage 
its not a science theyre just estimated numbers 
standerfer said in 1986 he said a scientist estimated that 70 
percent of the core material liquefied a figure standerfer said 
was too high 
however standerfer said researchers had a better picture of the 
core now than ever before 
half the core clearly ended up as rubble just undefined 
material he said whats important is that with the core 
damaged as badly as it was it was maintained entirely in the 
reactor vessel 
broughton presented his remarks during a session in which 
executives of gpu nuclear and former members of the nrc convened to 
review lessons from the accident 
to put tmi2 into perspective it was was a very useful event 
one which could change the history of nuclear power and one which 
i believe in the end changed it in a positive direction rather 
than a negative one said edwin e kintner executive vice 
president of gpu nuclear 
it was a good thing in that it provided a traumatic shock to 
all the institutions involved in nuclear energy applications a 
badly needed shock to make them aware of the special requirements 
for the safe use of this enormous new source of energy he said 
the tmi session was held as cleanup workers continued removing 
damaged fuel from the plant and performing other decontamination 
work in anticipation of mothballing the crippled unit 2 reactor at 
the end of 1989 its twin unit 1 continues to produce power 
a troubling legacy of the accident remains 23 million gallons 
of water contaminated in the accident and in cleanup operations 
afterward on monday two weeks of hearings before the atomic 
safety and licensing board began in lancaster pa on the 
utilitys request to boil away the water into the atmosphere 
standerfer said monday that the water is clean enough now that 
any other reactor plant in the country could discharge it without 
approval by the nrc or its informationgathering boards 
however citizens groups favor leaving the water in storage 
tanks at the plant for the time being

each party makes up numbered lists of candidates and those gaining 
seats are chosen by their order on the list 
twentyseven parties are running the two major parties are the 
rightwing likud bloc headed by prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
the leftofcenter labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
in israels history neither major party has ever won an 
absolute majority meaning the government is always a coalition and 
small parties have influence beyond their numbers 
labor and likud each have three allied parties as likely 
coalition partners there also are eight religious parties which 
use their seats as swing votes to gain backing for jewish orthodox 
causes two arab parties an arabjewish party that favors creating 
a palestinian state and eight others most championing single 
causes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most polls predict a close race either with likud and its 
allies winning narrowly or a split vote that will again create a 
laborlikud coalition such as has governed since the last election 
in 1984 then neither major party could form a government without 
the other 
the polls are regarded as less than reliable because most are 
sponsored by labor or likud also most do not survey arabs 
religious jews soldiers and residents of collective farms

months of unemployment from his wife by leaving home each morning

banks only when he was running out of money and needed funds to 
make it appear he had been paid on the job 
sampson said his wife found out about his illegal activities on 
may 18 when she saw his picture taken by a bank surveillance 
camera on television he said he surrendered the next day 
you certainly are unique the judge said in sentencing

michael dukakis has embraced the l word 
after weeks of avoiding it and republicans moved swiftly to 
exploit what they say is a misstep 
after months of denying he was a liberal dukakis conceded 
that he is one george bushs campaign manager lee atwater said 
this is worse than a flipflop this is a gaffe bigger than 
putting himself in that tank 
miracle of miracles bush sarcastically said 
with a week to go and facing long odds dukakis on sunday said 
im a liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and harry 
truman and john kennedy 
it was a statement some had been urging dukakis to make a 
defense of values as well as a political point of view long 
associated with democratic party successes of old and democratic 
failures of late 
but it was also viewed by democrats themselves as a highrisk 
move by a candidate who trails nearly everywhere and has little 
choice but to roll the dice 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said dukakis made no mistake he 
was advancing his im on your side argument gearan said and 
asserting that it is he and not bush who is in the tradition of 
those popular democratic presidents 
dukakis had seemed to shy away from the word previously 
in his second debate with bush dukakis quipped if i had a 
dollar george for every time you used that label id qualify for 
one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away 
after one debate statement by bush dukakis told the vice 
president i didnt hear the word liberal or left one time i 
thank you for that 
dukakis has repeatedly asserted that such labels are meaningless 
and said he has conservative instincts as well he points to his 
balanced budgets in massachusetts as proof 
in his interview on abcs nightline last week dukakis said 
bush is trying to misuse that label in a way which suggests that 
im somebody who doesnt have a set of values 
any reluctance to embrace the word liberal can be understood 
with a glance at recent polls which suggest its no longer 
fashionable only 15 percent or so of the electorate accept that 
label to describe themselves even though many more may take 
liberal positions on specific issues 
a cbsnew york times poll conducted oct 810 was typical it 
found 17 percent saying they were liberal 34 percent saying they 
were conservative and 43 percent identifying themselves as 
moderate 
president reagan whose eight years in office have seen a growth 
in voter identification with conservatives has been hammering 
dukakis with the liberal cudgel in three speeches in ohio one day 
recently he used the word 50 times 
the republicans have used a handful of assertions to give a 
negative connotation to liberalism and dukakis they depict him as 
weak on defense permissive toward crime likely to raise taxes 
george bush succeeded in defining what a liberal is in the 
most unflattering light possible said mark mellman a pollster 
for democratic candidates unfortunately to a lot of people right 
now to be a liberal means to be in favor of furloughs and in favor 
of higher taxes and so on 
those of us who call ourselves liberals i think would 
suggest that has nothing whatever to do with being a liberal and 
thats very much a distortion of what that ideological perspective 
is all about mellman added 
dukakis on sunday offered his own definition he said liberalism 
means standing up for average americans while also balancing 
budgets and recognizing fiscal constraints 
as a threeterm governor of massachusetts dukakis in fact was 
not known as a liberal he was a moderate and a reformer in a state 
with a long liberal tradition 
liberals there assailed him for not doing enough on welfare 
social services and the homeless as governor he faced democratic 
primary challengers from the left as well as the right 
former house speaker thomas p oneill jr once the leader of 
liberal democratic politics last month disputed bushs charge that 
dukakis was liberal 
absolutely not oneill said hes progressive 
but massachusetts politics is not the standard for politics 
elsewhere and even massachusetts liberals acknowledge that 
being a centrist in massachusetts makes him a liberal in 
general said rep barney frank dmass who often opposed 
dukakis from the left in their own state 
frank said dukakis is a liberal in the broad sense that he 
sees a role for a vigorous public sector to help attain social 
goals 
atwater suggested dukakis might have had an easier time of it if 
he had accepted the liberal label earlier and then spent time 
defining it in more favorable terms 
hes made a tough task for himself to come in here at the 
end and try to redefine what liberal means atwater said 
democratic national chairman paul kirk said liberalism means a 
prudent positive practical role for government helping people 
he suggested dukakis might have moved sooner to defuse the issue 
im one who happens to believe that as soon as the opening 
pitch is thrown you take a crack at it kirk said he might 
have done it earlier but its not too late

billion capital gains tax giveaway for the very rich if you make 
200000 a year you get 30000 from mr bush if you make 40000 
or less you dont get a dime 
dukakis also lays claim on behalf of his party to the 
kinder gentler nation that george bush has invoked repeatedly 
since the gop convention in august 
im fighting for fundamental values the values that made the 
democratic party the party of the people the values that make 
america a kinder gentler nation dukakis says 
a dukakis administration will never try to cut college loans he 
vows it will make america first in health care not infant 
mortality and get tough on nations that dont open their markets

to say where or when 
in one of his new economic spots bush says 18 million jobs were 
created over the last six years interest rates were cut in half 
inflation is down taxes are down and the economy is stronger 
america is better off than we were eight years ago and by 
building on the gains weve made well all be better off in four 
years than we are today he says 
the other spot called tax blizzard shows a couple being 
bombarded by tax bills through their mail slot it accuses dukakis 
of raising taxes on interest dividends and meals of raising 
corporate payroll and state income taxes and of signing a sales 
tax on items never taxable before 
and now he wants to do for america what hes done for 
massachusetts says a narrator american taxpayers cant afford 
that risk

dan quayle says a public backlash over 
harsh criticism of his selection as george bushs republican 
running mate has bolstered the ticket 
the american people have a very distinct antenna for fairness 
and they know i havent been treated fairly quayle said monday 
and i think theres a lot of sympathy out there for dan quayle 
the question of quayles impact on gop prospects was raised anew 
as the senator arrived to campaign here told during a local 
television interview that some ohio editorial writers had 
questioned his selection even while endorsing bush quayle denied 
that he was a burden to the ticket 
thats absolute nonsense and you know it he said 
as a matter of fact since ive been put on the ticket weve 
done quite well he said you recall before i was on the 
ticket we were down about 16 or 17 points were ahead now 
the indiana senator in the weeks immediately following his 
selection by bush during the august gop convention in new orleans 
was besieged by questions about his enlistment in the indiana 
national guard in 1969 during the height of the vietnam war and 
his grades at depauw university and the university of indiana 
school of law 
quayle has said that no rules were broken in connection with the 
naional guard signup and that he was a c student at depauw 
but did better in law school 
the senator was appearing at a local high school for a rally 
today before traveling to his native indiana to tour a steel plant 
and appear at a fundraising reception for gop gubernatorial 
candidate john mutz 
quayle was in a mostly upbeat mood monday as he toured parts of 
western michigan and visited a ski resort in northcentral ohio 
before traveling to columbus where he rounded out the day taking 
part in a basketball game with aides and traveling press 
the gop candidate said that if he had his druthers he would 
debate democratic vice presidential opponent lloyd bentsen a second 
time 
quayle complained that reporters participating in the omaha 
neb debate last month never put bentsen on the spot concerning 
what the texan would do if the presidency suddenly fell to him 
but he wasnt the target quayle said i was the target 
asked if he would like a second shot at bentsen the senator 
replied my own preference is yes but he said that its 
really too late 
in the meantime quayle got a measure of revenge against bentsen 
for the texans memorable debate declaration that youre no jack 
kennedy 
chiding democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis for 
identifying himself sunday with democratic liberals of yesteryear 
such as franklin d roosevelt harry truman and john f kennedy 
quayle said yes i didnt know jack kennedy and i didnt serve 
with jack kennedy but ill tell you one thing michael dukakis is 
no jack kennedy 
in 1960 president kennedy campaigned for the presidency on 
the very basis of building a strong strategic defense to protect 
america he said the man from massachusetts is campaigning on 
cutting back on our national defense he refuses to commit to 
modernizing our strategic deterrence wants to ban flight testing 
of missiles and proposed to slash our carrier task forces 
can you imagine roosevelt truman and kennedy having to ride 
around in a tank to prove theyre tough on national defense he 
asked

a collision of two helicopters was the apparent 
cause of a crash that killed four us marines during a training 
exercise on okinawa american military authorities said today 
it was the second time in a week that marine corps fliers were 
involved in fatal collisions in flight 
last tuesday nine marines and an air force officer died in a 
training crash in the arizona desert and marine officials said the 
two helicopters they were in apparently collided in flight 
the us media liaison office announced monday that four marines 
had been killed in a crash on the southern japanese island of 
okinawa that day but no cause of the crash was given 
today it issued a statement saying two ch46 helicopters 
apparently collided while conducting routine training 
operations 
one of the big twinrotor copters crashed in mountainous 
terrain killing all four men aboard the other returned to marine 
corps air station futenma on okinawa with damage in the nose area 
but no injuries aboard it said 
the cause of the crash was under further investigation the 
office said 
the crash occurred in such difficult terrain that rescuers had 
to be lowered on ropes from a helicopter to reach the wreckage 
meanwhile japanese foreign minister sosuke uno expressed regret 
over the crash and concern at what might have happened if the 
collision had occurred over a populated area 
he also said the foreign ministry had asked us military 
authorities to look into reports of live ammunition having been 
found after military exercises on okinawa and stray bullets hitting 
houses 
there is rather a lot of carelessness he said 
his comments pointed to underlying friction between japanese 
civilians and the military on okinawa where about 30000 us 
troops are based 
the marine fliers were on sixmonth assignment to okinawa for 
training from their base at kaneohe bay hawaii the us statement 
said 
it identified the four killed as maj richard j eisloeffel 34 
of el cajon calif capt michael f king 31 of bend ore 
whose wife constance king lives in kaneohe bay hawaii cpl sean 
m timmons 20 of isle of palms sc whose wife stacy l timmons

republican strategists are pouring 1 million 
into a finalweek advertising effort to tie their senate candidates 
to george bush hoping the gop presidential frontrunners strength 
will give them a boost in selected cliffhanger races 
at the same time the ads are designed to exploit what the 
republicans say is democratic standardbearer michael dukakis 
unpopularity in some states said jann olsten executive director 
of the national republican senatorial committee 
were not so naive as to believe this will dictate the outcome 
in each and every state around the country olsten said monday at 
a briefing 
but he said the generic vote republican television spots 
would help gop candidates in close contests remind voters of the 
differences between the two parties on matters of taxes and the 
economy 
one of the ads notes the no new taxes pledge made by bush 
but characterized as unrealistic by other republicans including 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan democrats will raise 
taxes the ad states republicans wont its that simple 
democrats dismissed the move to maximize bushs coattails 
saying he doesnt have any in the first place 
we dont see any coattails said robert chlopak olstens 
counterpart at the democratic senatorial campaign committee i 
think there are individual dynamics in each of the senate races 
and you just cant explain a democrat leading in florida with 
dukakis down big and democrats doing well in other states where 
dukakis was losing 
analysts constantly debate whether coattails exist when they do 
appear it often is because of a presidential candidate with a 
strong personal appeal or because of an overriding national 
mandate democrats say bush has neither 
if theres one thing george bush has not done in this 
campaign its convey a mandate on taxes or any other issue 
chlopak said its a lot easier to know what he dislikes than 
what he stands for for senate candidates to attach themselves to 
bush sort of falls through the cracks 
the converse of that tying ones opponent to underdog dukakis 
is seen by some gop senate contenders as a potential boost in 
states where bush holds wide margins 
there is a dynamic at work driven in large part by the 
presidential election olsten said states where the ads will 
appear include montana nevada new jersey florida wisconsin 
nebraska washington and north dakota 
olsten said the ads would help candidates who want to press 
their opponents on what values they share and dont share with 
michael dukakis 
a bush campaign spokesman said the candidate wouldnt be going 
out of his way to help senate candidates however 
we are not in a position yet where we have the luxury of 
comfort in some of these states said the spokesman mark goodin 
we dont feel our margins in some of these target states are at a 
level where we can afford to turn our sights away from our 
principal objective

republican george bush blending mild praise 
with sharp criticism says democrat michael dukakis is a decent 
man no doubt but would bring a return to weakness 
inexperience and recession 
entering the final week of the presidential campaign bush 
appeared intent monday on addressing the perception that he has 
been too personally critical of dukakis his democratic opponent 
at a rally in the recently refurbished union station in st 
louis bush added a new dimension to his stump speech by saying 
that while dukakis was an inexperienced governor he also was 
a decent man no doubt good family good with his family and 
they interact together 
quickly switching to the attack mode bush said i dont want 
this country to take a dangerous risk on an inexperienced liberal 
governor coming out of massachusetts trying to run this country 
by the next stop in kansas city mo bush had dropped the 
praise and stepped up the criticism 
the choice is simple whether we are going to build on the 
peace and prosperity that we struggled so hard to attain these past 
eight years whether were going to pass on a sound and secure 
america to our children and our grandchildren or risk it all on a 
return to weakness inexperience and recession out from the 
mainstream values bush said 
while bush has a sizable but narrowing lead in the polls there 
are indications that the voters are not happy with the way he is 
waging his campaign a gallup poll taken for the times mirror 
company found that respondents by a 5243 percent margin felt 
bush had been too critical of dukakis 
the same poll released monday showed bush with a 5042 percent 
lead among all voters surveyed and a 5241 percent edge among 
likely voters 
bush was spending this morning in washington taping an 
interview with television personality david frost then he was 
flying to south bend ind for an address at notre dame and 
traveling to milwaukee for a rally bush will spend the night in 
chicago where he will campaign on wednesday 
indiana the homestate of his running mate sen dan quayle 
seems safe territory for bush wisconsin and illinois remain key 
battleground states and bushs strategists are planning his travel 
in the final days with an eye on states where the race is close 
in addition to dealing with the problem of whether hes been too 
tough on dukakis bush also spent part of monday addressing 
criticism that the campaign has been dominated by negative 
television advertising and devoid of real issues 
waving a 347page compilation of his speeches and position 
papers dating back to his announcement as a candidate on oct 12 
1987 bush said heres a message ive tried to deliver about 
sensible mainstream leaderhip and its all right here 
and yes i have been talking about the issues and the american 
people are listening and i believe thats why im going to win 
bush said this is our agenda 
he derided dukakis for finally embracing the liberal label that 
republicans have been pinning on him dukakis on sunday said he was 
a liberal in the tradition of former presidents franklin roosevelt 
harry truman and john kennedy 
miracle of miracles headline read all about it bush 
chortled my opponent finally called himself the big l 
called himself a liberal 
noting that dukakis had challenged him to an election eve 
debate bush said we dont need any more debates we had em

the chances of prime minister yitzhak shamir of the conservative 
likud bloc who advocates tougher measures against the arab 
uprising in the occupied lands 
theres no question it will help likud said daniel elazar 
a political analyst of the jerusalem center for public affairs 
for most voters this will only reconfirm their beliefs but for 
those voters sitting on the fence something like this could push 
them off to the right 
zeev eitan a political analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said in this election that could 
be the difference between a clear victory by one party or a tie 
polls taken before the attack and published monday in the 
newspaper maariv either gave likud the edge or indicated a dead 
heat similar to the one that forced likud and the centerleft labor 
party into a national unity coalition in 1984 
four different polls indicated labor led by foreign minister 
shimon peres and its leftwing partners would win 4755 of the 
knessets 120 seats with likud and its allies getting 5665 
some seats are expected to be taken by three araboriented 
parties whose strong support of the palestine liberation 
organization make them unacceptable in either major partys 
coalitions 
to guard against violence on election day authorities ordered 
14000 police border guards and other security personnel into the 
17 election districts which have 5000 polling places 
final results were not expected before wednesday and days may be 
needed to determine a clear winner if there is one in israels 
complicated coalition politics 
a 48hour travel ban prevented the 15 million palestinian 
residents of the occupied west bank and gaza strip from entering or 
returning from israel it began at 11 pm monday and also barred 
press coverage without army escort in the territories where 
palestinians have been in revolt since dec 8 against 21 years of 
israeli occupation 
an army spokesman said privately the purpose was to ensure a 
quiet election and had nothing to do with the the attack on the 
israeli bus sunday nignt in the west bank town of jericho 
the killings prompted calls for revenge by leading politicians 
competing in an election that is expected to be a major element in 
deciding the future of the west bank and gaza 
ariel sharon a former defense minister and senior likud 
politician blamed labor for the attack he said the partys 
willingness to exchange occupied land for peace encouraged 
palestinian violence 
all talk of withdrawal or pullbacks brings more and more 
firebomb attacks he was quoted as saying by the newspaper 
hadashot he called for creation of special military units to 
eliminate terrorists and rioters 
likud opposes trading land for peace 
shamir spoke out for swift punishment of palestinians 
responsible for the bus attack which peres said provide nothing 
the way of hope for a solution to the israelipalestinian 
conflict 
campaign rhetoric became increasingly harsh in the final days as 
the rivals sought to attract undecided voters who pollsters say 
total 4 percent to 8 percent of the 29 million israelis registered 
an unsigned advertisement in sundays edition of maariv included 
a photograph of adolf hitler and prime minister neville chamberlain 
of britain meeting in munich in 1938 with international 
conference printed below 
peres has supported arab demands for an international conference 
on middle east peace including the future of the occupied 
territories 
labor immediately accused likud of a horrific propaganda 
campaign and demanded an apology likud denied paying for the ad 
and threatened to file a 10 million slander suit against labor 
a leaflet distributed by the underground palestinian leadership 
in the west bank town of nablus urged israeli soldiers to vote for 
parties favoring an international conference soldiers voted at 
their bases and in the field sunday and monday 
dear soldiers your leaders know very well that the 
palestinian arab uprising will not be crushed by force and they 
know that the solution is political said the leaflet printed in 
hebrew vote for stopping the new nazi hand vote for the 
international conference

nineyearold joshua deshaney can make some 
awkward movements and guttural sounds and will need special care 
throughout his life because of a beating more than four years ago 
that left him brain damaged 
the boys mother blames a wisconsin county welfare agency for 
not preventing the injuries inflicted by the boys father and the 
us supreme court will hear arguments in her lawsuit wednesday 
we cant restore the tissue thats missing from joshuas 
brain but we can make sure little suzie smith doesnt become 
another joshua donald sullivan an attorney for melody deshaney 
said in a telephone interview 
ms deshaney who lives in wyoming filed the lawsuit on behalf 
of her son against the winnebago county department of social 
services and two of its employees 
the multimilliondollar lawsuit accuses social workers of 
violating the boys consitutional rights by failing to come to his 
rescue after they had repeated evidence he was being beaten 
they had a mountain of direct evidence that was higher than 
their eyebrows said sullivan 
ms deshaney appealed the case to the supreme court after the 
7th us circuit court of appeals dismissed the suit saying it 
would place welfare agencies in an unfair predicament to require 
them to take custody of children who are suspected victims of abuse 
lawyers for winnebago county located in eastcentral wisconsin 
about 80 miles from wausau have said the case could put public 
employees in the impossible position of always having to make the 
right decisions or face lawsuits 
the case is being watched very closely by the national 
association of counties which filed a friendofthecourt brief 
were all feeling very vulnerable said mark quam director 
of social services for winnebago county it popped up here but 
it could have happened anywhere 
joshua was living in the county with his divorced father when he 
came to the attention of social workers a county social worker 
assigned to his case visited the boy several times and a file of 
reports grew 
social worker ann kemmeter reported she noticed a bump on 
joshuas head one time and a scraped chin that appeared to me to 
look like a cigarette burn another time 
ms kemmeter visited the deshaney home on march 7 1984 but did 
not ask to see the boy according to court records the next day 
the then 4yearold boy was in the hospital with head injuries that 
destroyed half of his brain 
his father randy deshaney was later convicted of felony 
battery and child abuse and sentenced to two consecutive twoyear 
prison terms he served about two years and eight months before he 
was released in september 1987 
deshaney who lives in central wisconsins portage county and 
declines interview requests will finish his parole dec 11 said 
don netzel his parole agent 
joshua remains in the custody of the county and lives in a group 
home for children who are developmentally disabled said john 
bodnar attorney for winnebago county 
the boy has no use of his legs or one arm and can only make 
awkward movements with one hand sullivan said joshuas 
intelligence has been tested at less than a 1yearolds he said 
his mother wants custody but has filed no formal legal petition 
because she wants to be sure she can provide care for him first 
sullivan said 
were going to ask for the money for joshua he said 
ms deshaney who gave custody of her infant son to her former 
husband when she was divorced at 19 declined an interview request 
because of the pressures of the case sullivan said 
the fact that the supreme court has decided to hear the case 
concerns the counties association said lee ruck the general 
counsel for the washingtonbased association counties acknowledge 
a general duty to protect everyone in the county but that is not a 
guarantee everyone will be protected he said 
the case could raise a new class of lawsuits that not only 
review public employees decisions with hindsight but may 
mondaymorningquarterback a decision not to get in the game 
ruck said

president reagan is following an old 
performers adage in the waning days of his administration every 
time he gives a speech he tries to leave them laughing 
lately at the end of each address reagan confesses hes got 
a new hobby and proceeds to relate a joke he says i can 
absolutely prove is invented by the people of the soviet union 
and told among themselves 
and at a recent speech before the world affairs council reagan 
seemed to be enjoying himself so much he told not one but several 
here are a few in reagans words 
you know in the soviet union for a private citizen to buy an 
automobile there is a 10year waiting period you have to put 
the money down too 10 years in advance 
so this man has gone in and hes doing all the signing all 
the papers and putting out his money 
and finally when he makes that final signature the man behind 
the counter said now come back in 10 years and take delivery 
and the man asked morning or afternoon 
and man behind the counter said well 10 years from now 
what difference does it make 
well the man answered the plumbers coming in the 
morning 
</TEXT>

reagan went on to tell one joke he said hed relayed to soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev who reagan added laughed quite 
heartily 
an american and a russian are arguing about their two 
countries and the american said look i can go into the oval 
office pound the presidents desk and say mr president i dont 
like the way youre running our country 
and the russian said i can do that 
and the american said you can 
and the russian said i can go into the kremlin into the 
general secretarys office i can pound on his desk and say mr 
general secretary i dot like the way president reagans running 
his country 
</TEXT>

the president claimed gorbachev chuckled at this one as well 
you know less than one family out of seven in the soviet 
union owns an automobile most of the automobiles are driven by the 
bureaucrats the government furnishes them and drivers and so 
forth 
so an order went out one day to the police that anyone caught 
speeding anyone no matter who gets a ticket 
well gorbachev came out of his country home his dacha he 
was late getting to the kremlin there was his limousine and driver 
waiting 
he told the driver to get in the back seat hed drive and 
down the road he went 
they passed two motorcycle cops one took out after him and 
pretty soon hes back with his buddy and his buddy says well 
did you give him a ticket and his buddy says no 
well he said why not 
oh the cop said too important 
well his buddy said were told to give anybody a ticket 
no matter who it is

heres one reagan said he wouldnt dare tell gorbachev 
they had me in his limousine with general secretary 
gorbachev and the head of my secret service unit and his chief 
security person and we were sightseeing 
and we pulled up by a waterfall and supposedly we got out of 
the car to look at the waterfall and gorbachev said to my secret 
service man go ahead jump go over the fall 
and he said ive got a wife and three kids 
so gorbachev turned to his own man and said jump go over 
the waterfall and he did 
well my man scrambled down the rocks around the bottom and 
found the fellow wringing out his clothes and apparently all right 
and he said well when he told you to jump and go over the 
falls why did you do that 
and the soviet said ive got a wife and three kids

george bush who doctors say is in excellent 
health says disclosures about his physical condition as president 
would depend on whats happening in the world according to an 
interview published today 
because such medical news might send markets plummeting or 
rising it would have to be sorted out by good standards the 
vice president said in an interview with the new york times 
if i didnt feel good today i wouldnt feel i had to rush out 
and have a press conference about it 
doctors interviewed said the 64yearold bush is in excellent 
health he runs two miles three or four times a week has coffee 
and fruit for breakfast and keeps his weight at 195 pounds he is 
6foot2 
bush said he has had a few sleepless nights lately because he is 
worried about the election but that he hates taking sleeping pills 
he also said he handles stress much better today than he did 20 
years ago when he was a chronic worrier and suffered from two 
ulcers 
bushs doctors said the vice president has a mild enlargement of 
the prostate gland but that they do not expect corrective surgery 
to be necessary in the next four years 
in 1986 bush had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his 
face but he has no symptoms of other cancers he is allergic to 
bee stings but is receiving immunotherapy injections to stave off 
potentially lifethreatening allergic reactions

george bush mocked michael dukakis sudden embrace of liberalism 
as the republican nominee courted disenchanted democrats underdog 
dukakis in an appeal to women voters assailed the reaganbush 
administration for being on the wrong side of issues important 
to women 
with election day exactly one week away and polls indicating a 
sizable but narrowing republican lead the gop ticket of bush and 
sen dan quayle exploited dukakis claim that he is a liberal in 
the tradition of former presidents franklin roosevelt harry truman 
and john f kennedy 
miracle of miracles headline read all about it bush told 
an audience monday in louisville ky my opponent finally 
called himself the big l called himself a liberal 
quayle retuned democratic opponent lloyd bentsens debate 
putdown line of youre no jack kennedy to poke fun at dukakis 
michael dukakis is no jack kennedy said the indiana senator 
as he campaigned in michigan and ohio 
dukakis seeking the support of women voters said the democrats 
are on your side on the issues of abortion equal pay and 
parental leave the republican ticket however has been on the 
wrong side of every issue of special importance to american women 
the democratic nominee was campaigning today in youngstown 
ohio milwaukee detroit and kansas city mo he also was telling 
voters in a new fiveminute ad scheduled to run tonight on nbc that 
the race for the white house is far from over 
in recent days our campaign has been on the move thousands of 
americans are joining our effort daily dukakis says next 
tuesday your one vote will be more powerful than all the pollsters 
and political commercials 
two new polls a survey by harris and another done by gallup 
for the times mirror corp showed bush maintaining a strong lead 
among likely voters 
in the harris survey of 1250 voters questioned during the 
weekend bush led dukakis 5245 percent a slight narrowing from 
5344 percent in a similar poll done oct 1417 
the times mirror poll of 1505 likely voters conducted oct 
2326 found bush ahead by 11 points 5241 percent both polls had 
margins of error of plus or minus three points 
the frontrunning republican ticket was concentrating on the 
midwest today 
bush was speaking about law and order this afternoon at the 
university of notre dame in south bend ind and campaigning in 
wisconsin after taping an interview this morning with david frost 
quayle was stumping in ohio and his home state of indiana 
democratic candidate bentsen was focusing on his home state of 
texas kentucky and missouri 
former democratic contender jesse jackson joined bentsen monday 
night at a rally in fort worth texas where the 
preacherturnedpolitician responded to bushs read my lips 
refrain 
you watch our hips as we march to the voting booth jackson 
told the crowd at the mount olive missionary baptist church 
the texas senator urged those in the audience to get out and 
vote dont tell me your vote doesnt count it does he said 
while bentsen focused on texas and its thirdlargest electoral 
prize of 29 votes dukakis sought support in california and its 
biggest electoral bounty of 47 votes 
in his major appeal to women voters dukakis said the republican 
ticket wanted to outlaw abortions 
i believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in 
the exercise of her beliefs the democratic nominee told an 
audience in san jose 
dukakis cited quayles response to an 11yearold girls 
question last week about what she should do if she was raped by her 
father and became pregnant the gop candidate said that he favored 
childbirth over abortion even under those circumstances 
dukakis also challenged bush to an hourlong debate the night 
before the election but the republican nominee scoffed at his 
rivals idea and suggested that dukakis debate himself 
the new left versus the old left bush said 
the vice president ostensibly concerned about a slight decrease 
in his lead appealed to what he called abandoned democrats 
those left behind as he says the party moves away from the 
mainstream 
so my pitch here in the last eight days is to those good 
democrats the rank and file bush said during a stop in 
louisville ky i tell them have hope have confidence 
the bush campaign also continued with two new economic ads a 
positive spot citing the accomplishments of the reaganbush 
administration and a negative commercial showing a couple inundated 
with tax bills that ad accuses dukakis of consistently raising 
taxes and the narrator concludes and now he wants to do for 
america what hes done for massachusetts american taxpayers cant 
afford that risk 
the topic of ads arose in bushs interview with nbc news 
anchorman tom brokaw who questioned the vice president about 
whether his commercial saying george bush led the way on the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with the soviet union was 
an exaggeration 
well i hope it didnt indicate that i was out in front of the 
president bush said 
the vice president said he gives great credit to the arms 
control negotiators and obviously the most credit to the president 
of the united states 
pressed as to why that is not mentioned in the ad bush replied 
well theyre not running for president tom and i am

votes by 14 utilities to approve a 226 million 
settlement in the giant washington public power supply system 
securities fraud trial remove a burr in the saddle for the 
state the governor says 
the 14 public utilities from around the state voted monday to 
approve the settlement that would let them out of the trial which 
stems from wppss record default on 225 billion in bonds used to 
finance construction of two nuclear power plants that never were 
completed 
the agreement which also involves the state of washington and 
the federal bonneville power administration leaves snohomish 
county public utility district the only remaining utility defendant 
its an opportunity to get it behind us gov booth gardner 
said of the settlement it removes a burr in the saddle 
snohomish contracted for the biggest single share 13 percent 
on the two partially built wppss plants that were abandoned in 
1982 under the settlement memorandum snohomish would be allowed 
to settle until nov 10 
snohomish officials said they welcomed the settlement proposal 
even though they were not included 
attorney don hale said there was a risk remaining in trial but 
it appeared settlement figures were coming down as the trial 
progressed and that could work to his utility districts benefit 
but hale and other snohomish officials would not comment on the 
possibility of settlement which would call for it to pay 487 
million based on the size of its interest in the abandoned plants 
other defendants remaining include two engineering firms and a 
financial advisor firm out of nearly 100 entities originally sued 
the trial which was moved to tucson ariz was recessed last 
week when attorneys reported a settlement was possible it was 
scheduled to resume wednesday 
its a settlement we can certainly live with and handle and 
it wont have great diverse impact on our state said tacoma 
attorney albert malanca who engineered the agreement 
under the agreement the 14 utilities would pay 181 million 
bpa and the federal government would pay 35 million and the state 
would pay 10 million to plaintiffs who sued after wppss defaulted 
in 1983 
the plants were begun but never finished after regional energy 
planners determined power from the plants wouldnt be needed the 
regions economy suffered when wppss attempted to build five 
multibillion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one 
several utilities that agreed to the settlement said rate 
increases may be necessary but would be small 
the governor said the state would pay 10 million toward the 
settlement if the legislature concurs 
washington state is not a defendant in the case but a 
settlement should end a separate lawsuit against it involving the 
same plaintiffs who are suing to recover 75 billion the 23 
billion default plus interest 
bpa participation still requires the approval of the us 
department of justice which was expected this week and final 
approval will have to come from us district judge william 
browning who is overseeing the case 
a settlement now will put one of the regions major problems 
behind us said jim jura head of the bpa it would enable us 
to devote more of our time attention and legal talent to 
productive work 
besides tacoma city light utilities agreeing to the settlement 
are the city of ellensburg and cowlitz mason no 3 clark grays 
harbor lewis okanogan pacific skamania wahkiakum benton 
franklin and klickitat county public utility districts 
tacoma director of utilities ted coates said the settlement 
would bring to 591 million the amount paid to plaintiffs 
a class of more than 24000 past and present bondholders and 
chemical bank of new york a trustee for bondholders are 
plaintiffs in the trial that began sept 7 and was expected to last 
a year they alleged the defendants conspired to lie and hide 
information that might have discouraged potential investors

a generation after his polite parody of 
john f kennedys family sold millions of records vaughn meader is 
playing honkytonk music in outoftheway bars and enjoying life 
in maines slow lane 
the first family which depicted jfk in press conferences 
family settings at the white house and meetings with heads of 
state sold more than 5 million copies before nov 22 1963 when 
it became funny no longer 
meader then commanding top billings around the country for his 
kennedy impressions got the grim news of the dallas assassination 
from a cabbie in milwaukee while en route to a gig 
i said whats the punch line recalled meader 52 then 
i heard it on the radio 
i felt a sense of loss that we lost something special said 
meader then a strikingly handsome man in his late 20s i went 
into deep hibernation 
after two months in seclusion meader tried to renew his act 
without kennedy humor but bookings continued to be canceled 
i was a reminder of that tragedy meader who has a gray 
beard and often sports a cowboy hat recalled somberly in an 
interview it was over 
as lenny bruce said that day they dug two graves in 
arlington one for john kennedy and one for vaughn meader said 
the excomic who after the assassination stopped using meader his 
middle name and started to go by the surname he was given at 
birth abbott 
lighthearted and respectful by todays bareknuckled standards 
of political humor the first family also featured soundalikes 
of jacqueline caroline and bobby kennedy 
it was very daring at the time said meader whose 
performing career began in his army days in the mid1950s when he 
formed a country band his act then was sprinkled with elvis 
presley and hank snow imitations 
meader studied broadcast technique in 1959 and began a career as 
a pianoplaying comic at small new york clubs he grew tired of 
motherinlaw jokes and about 1960 as the jfk juggernaut gained 
full momentum he injected political humor into his act 
he brushed his hair into his face like kennedy and did 
impressions of the charismatic massachusetts senator because i 
had a new england accent anyway said meader who was born in 
waterville and lives in this small city 
the act took off when meader closed an appearance on the 
talent scouts television program with a kennedy news 
conference winning meader critical acclaim tv appearances and 
billings at some of new yorks top clubs he was pictured in life 
jabbing his finger a la kennedy at a mock news conference 
after being turned down repeatedly by record companies that did 
not want to take a chance with political humor the first 
family finally appeared in 1962 on the cadence records inc label 
it was recorded before an audience of 200 on the night kennedy 
announced a naval blockade to keep soviet missiles from reaching 
cuba in october 1962 
if the audience had heard that speech the album would have 
never gotten off the ground meader said 
a few cuts on the air by a new york disc jockey sent listeners 
to their phones demanding more said meader it became a runaway 
hit selling 12 million copies within two weeks and 5 million 
copies within a year earning meader 700000 
the jacket which pictured meader and the other performers lined 
up in familyalbum fashion in front of the white house also 
included a disclaimer explaining it was not meant to hurt anyones 
feelings and that it is for fun 
jfk seemed more amused than annoyed remarking i thought it 
sounded more like teddy than it did me 
by 1963 only four years after breaking into show business 
meader was among the brightest new stars of the day and his 
nightclub act commanded 4000 to 12500 a week he began work on 
a second first family volume and cut a single in which kennedy 
tells his daughter the night before christmas also a parody 
then 25 years ago this month came the assassination 
meader said he lost interest in working and was spending most 
of my time in bars by the late 60s he was living in hippie 
mecca san francisco wearing flowers in his hair and beads and 
making money by playing piano and writing music 
during his wine women song and drugs period that followed 
his meteoric rise meader wandered about the country staying with 
friends in diverse accommodations a teepee a houseboat a log 
cabin 
meader landed back in new york in 1971 and recorded a humor 
album based on a visit by jesus to harlem the second coming 
received minimal airplay because of what many considered offensive 
religious references 
after moving to louisville ky in 1972 meader returned to his 
roots as a performer and formed a country band called the honky 
tonk angels later he moved to los angeles to play movie sound 
tracks and even took small parts in movies 
he has not done any kennedy material since the presidents death 
in 1977 meader returned home to maine where he lives with his 
fourth wife and plays piano with his fivepiece countrybluegrass 
band gone fishin which specializes in what he calls saloon 
good time honky tonk music his act is billed at resorts in such 
recreational areas as moosehead lake and squaw mountain and in 
small nightspots around maine 
i love it he said describing maine as the slow lane 
home 
even if he had a chance to return to the big time he would turn 
the opportunity down saying thats for youth 
thats like asking ted williams to play for the dodgers 
said meader he couldnt hit the ball past first base

about 700 argentines lost their lives won back the islands on 
june 14 gen menendez surrendered his troops at port stanley

wearing a regal gown former philippine first 
lady imelda marcos was fingerprinted photographed and ordered to 
remain here until she can come up with 5 million bail to face a 
racketeering trial 
im not going to let the lady go back to the hawaiian islands 
until im certain the bail is set us district judge john f 
keenan said after mrs marcos pleaded innocent at an arraignment 
monday 
mrs marcos who lives in exile in honolulu with her husband 
former philippine president ferdinand marcos brushed away tears 
keenan ordered her to return to court thursday with her 
attorneys if the lawyers have not worked out a bail agreement with 
prosecutors by then 
mrs marcos 59 was then fingerprinted and had her mug shot 
taken by federal marshals before being released temporarily without 
bail keenan instructed her not to leave the new york area 
she blew a kiss to a crowd outside the federal courthouse before 
departing for her midtown manhattan hotel 
the marcoses were indicted oct 21 on charges they plundered the 
philippine treasury of 103 million spirited the money out of 
their country and into foreign bank accounts and used it to buy 
prime manhattan real estate and art 
mrs marcos arrival at the courthouse for her arraignment was 
dramatic a sevencar caravan including two stretch limousines 
pulled up to the courthouse 
the waiting crowd was momentarily stunned when the former first 
lady stepped out of her limo she wore a bright aquamarine chiffon 
gown with traditional filipino butterfly sleeves and pearl 
earrings mrs marcos who gained notoriety for the thousands of 
pairs of shoes found in the presidential palace after her husbands 
ouster in february 1986 wore simple black highheeled pumps 
she doesnt look like shes going to court she looks like 
shes going to a dance ball said ziyad barq a designer who 
stopped at the courthouse to see what all the fuss was about 
at least a dozen protesters greeted mrs marcos and her 
entourage of at least a dozen people chanting justice justice 
must prevail send the marcoses to jail 
a woman wearing a black cape and vampire fangs held up a sign 
reading imelda bloodsucker of the filipino people 
detractors shouts drowned out those of supporters who 
occasionally called out we love you imelda 
mrs marcos clasping rosary beads made her way up the 
courthouse steps through a gauntlet of hundreds of reporters and 
photographers 
inside she spoke aloud only twice during the 45minute hearing 
once to waive a reading of the sixcount indictment and once to 
answer not guilty when asked her plea 
most of the hearing in a court packed with 200 artists 
reporters and spectators was taken up with lawyers arguing over 
the amount of bail 
mrs marcos attorneys originally wanted her released without 
any bond but had agreed to a package in which the couple would put 
up 12 million in philippine pesos and jewelry they brought to 
hawaii in 1986 
but assistant us attorney charles labella balked noting that 
the jewelry is subject to subpoena in a grand jury investigation 
and that the current philippine government has laid claim to the 
marcoses philippine currency 
there are conflicting claims to the property brought by the 
marcoses to the united states conceded the marcos attorney 
john s bartko a federal judge in california has frozen anything 
the marcoses own anywhere in the world except for living expenses 
and legal fees bartko said 
the marcoses have been forced to live on borrowed funds he 
said all of their collateral is subject to claims 
keenan suggested putting up the hillside home the marcoses 
occupy in honolulu but bartko said the home was owned by an 
offshore corporation controlled by a marcos codefendant 
also suggested and rejected were the marcoses swiss bank 
accounts and a home in woodside calif 
keenan finally ordered bail secured by real estate cash and 
personal possessions amounting to a reasonable market value of 5 
million and gave the lawyers until thursday to work out details 
marcos remained in hawaii defense lawyers claimed last week 
that he was too frail to make the 10hour plane trip keenan 
postponed marcos arraignment pending an examination by a 
government physician 
marcos was examined monday at tripler army medical center in 
honolulu and the results were to be sent to the judge and lawyers 
today said sgt robert shipp a hospital spokesman

walden pond where henry david thoreau 
retreated to observe nature 140 years ago is to conservationism 
what selma ala is to civil rights or woodstock ny to rock 
music 
so the possibility that an office park and a housing project may 
rise within a few hundred yards of the pond has rallied the 
conservation movement 
if you cant save the place where the principle was first 
asserted how can you hope to assert the principle elsewhere 
thomas blanding president of the thoreau country conservation 
alliance asserted monday 
weve been getting calls about these projects from washington 
and new york and san francisco said janet beyer chairwoman of 
the concord historical commission its no longer a matter just 
of concord making decisions about a few parcels its a symbol for 
the nation 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water in a 333acre stateowned 
reservation on the edge of concord an affluent town of 12500 
about 20 miles northwest of boston thoreau a naturalist and 
writer built a cabin on the pond in 1845 and remained there two 
years 
the concord zoning board of appeals is scheduled to decide 
thursday whether to allow the 139unit housing project 
several local officials have come out in favor of the project 
which is a compromise between the developers original request for 
251 units and a prior ruling by the zoning board that it would 
accept just 125 
my feeling is that this is a reasonable compromise said 
town manager alan h edmond 
to make the project more palatable developers philip 
denormandie and john corcoran have agreed to set aside 41 of the 
units at prices of about 75000 for people with low incomes 
the rest of the 135 condos and four detached singlefamily 
houses would sell at market rates probably around 250000 each 
for the condos and 1 million or more for the houses edmond said 
blanding said the conservation alliance agrees that concord 
badly needs affordable housing but he contended the project is 
still too intrusive and should be scaled down further or 
better yet moved elsewhere 
we recognize that concord is a living town we dont want to 
freeze it at some elite level but we have to realize that we have 
one of the countrys great cultural resources in the landscape 
here and its our obligation to protect it for future 
generations he said 
plans for the office park are on hold while the developer 
boston properties prepares an environmental notification form for 
state review 
boston properties is owned by publisher and real estate magnate 
mortimer zuckerman he owns the atlantic monthly magazine which 
published thoreaus journals posthumously in the early 1900s 
edward h linde president of boston properties said he 
disputes conservationists assertions that the project would 
negatively affect the woodlands he said his firm considers the 
area a very desirable site 
last summer in the face of erosion littering and vandalism 
the state department of environmental management began limiting 
access to walden pond closing the reservation whenever the 300car 
parking lot became full 
stuart weinreb the states principal planner for the property 
said massachusetts officials are concerned about the fact that 
just as were beginning to get a handle on the overuse there are 
these construction projects on the edge of the reservation that are 
potentially a threat 
however he said the state is not likely to jump into the fray 
our position has been that it is a battle that is more 
appropriately fought at the local level weinreb said the 
question is what is concord all about what kind of town does it 
want to be

salvadoran rebels say they are ready 
to renew talks with the usbacked government to end their 
9yearold civil war but will not surrender weapons as a 
precondition 
we have given them the message that we are ready to talk with 
all social forces including the army that we are ready to talk at 
any place or time said leonel gonzalez of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front the umbrella organization for five 
salvadoran guerrilla groups 
the one thats established conditions is the government he 
said monday president duarte has said that in order to talk 
again with the fmln we have to put down our arms this is absurd 
its inadmissible 
arturo rivera damas roman catholic archbishop of san salvador 
met with rebel leaders and presented a report on proposals for a 
negotiated end to the conflict that has claimed 65000 lives he 
said the report is based on observations from more than 60 
salvadoran organizations 
guerrilla representative joaquin villalobos said the front 
considers the report positive because it demands an end to the 
war and the reasons that led to it 
rivera damas presented the report during a ceremony at a 
military installation attended by gen manuel antonio noriega 
panamas military commander and de facto ruler 
villalobos and gonzalez said they briefed noriega on visits by 
rebel representatives to peru argentina ecuador and costa rica to 
promote a negotiated settlement 
they said rebel officials would return to those countries to 
inform government leaders about their meeting with the archbishop 
rivera damas said the report contained ideas offered by the 
salvadoran organizations in several days of meetings with church 
leaders but he gave no details 
salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between 
the government and rebels and frequently urge that talks resume 
the last meeting was oct 20 1987 in san salvador the capital of 
el salvador 
radio venceremos the clandestine rebel radio said monday that 
salvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in morazan 
a western province in the war zone the army said 53 rebels and 29 
soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in october

the reagan administration is listing five 
areas in which it says north korea could respond constructively to 
a series of unilateral us measures aimed at easing tensions on 
the peninsula 
state department spokesman charles redman said monday that the 
united states is relaxing some trade travel and diplomatic 
restrictions against north korea in support of efforts by south 
korea to promote greater stability in the area 
redman said the united states is looking for a positive 
constructive response from the north koreans 
specifically he said the united states is seeking signs of 
north korean flexibility in the fledgling northsouth dialogue and 
a willingness to provide more information on the thousands of 
american servicemen still unaccounted for since the korean war 
redman said at the end of the conflict there were 8177 american 
soldiers listed as missing although that figure also includes 
servicemen whose remains were recovered by the us military but 
for whom positive identification was not possible a year ago 
north korea said it had uncovered the remains of five us 
servicemen 
the spokesman said north korea also could show good faith by 
eliminating vicious antiamerican propaganda by cooperating in 
confidencebuilding measures in the demilitarized zone and by 
ending its alleged support for international terrorism 
he said any discussion of the withdrawal of the 40000 us 
troops stationed in south korea would be premature 
the south korean government today welcomed the us statement 
saying it hoped the moves would promote dialogue between the two 
koreas 
we hope that the us moves would help promote dialouge on the 
peninsula and stimulate north korea to come out as a responsible 
member of the international community said shin dooyoung 
directorgeneral of the foreign ministrys america department 
the united states and north korea have had a record of almost 
uninterrupted hostility since the korean armistice was signed 35 
years ago and the steps announced monday appear to represent the 
most ambitious effort to date to achieve a more harmonious 
relationship the warfare claimed the lives of more than 33000 
american servicemen 
redman said the united states will encourage unofficial 
nongovernmental visits from north korea in academics sports 
culture and other areas 
he said financial regulations are being revised to permit group 
travel by americans on a casebycase basis to north korea 
in addition american diplomats will be allowed substantive 
contact with north korean diplomats for the first time in almost a 
year 
commercial exports of humanitarian goods to north korea will be 
allowed on a limited basis currently humanitarian items must be 
donated 
south korean president roe tae woo has announced a series of 
initiatives aimed at easing tensions on the peninsula including a 
call for a northsouth summit meeting and for twoway trade 
on oct 20 he met with president reagan and asked for 
conciliatory measures toward the north to complement the ones he 
has taken 
redman said china and the soviet union have been advised of the 
us policy switch and have been asked to convey the american 
position to north korean authorities

a hemophiliac has been awarded 16 million by a 
federal jury in a lawsuit in which he said he contracted aids from 
a bloodbased drug 
randy j jones 35 sued miles laboratories the elkhart ind 
maker of koate a bloodbased clotting product he took to control 
bleeding after minor surgery in october 1983 
in a similar case in south florida earlier this year a jury 
ruled in favor of miles laboratories 
jones was diagnosed in 1985 as infected with the aids virus and 
two years later doctors told him he had developed acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
in his lawsuit jones contended that the product he took had 
been contaminated with the aids virus from an unemployed texas man 
who on 40 occasions between november 1982 and september 1983 sold 
plasma to a center in austin which supplied miles 
the texas man died of aids less than six weeks after his last 
plasma sale a us district court jury on wednesday awarded jones 
11 million and his wife 500000 
this was a tragic thing george h connell jr jones 
attorney said monday a man about 30 years old just got 
married in the prime of life and he gets struck down like 
this 
according to the national centers for disease control almost 
800 cases of aids have been attributed to blood products such as 
that taken by jones since early 1985 special heat treatment has 
been performed on clotting products to kill any aids virus 
contamination but many hemophilia patients were infected before 
those precautions were used according to researchers 
the jones award was adequate in light of the disease 
connell said 
however miles denied jones claim of negligence on the 
companys part 
we feel strongly that the verdict in the case is not supported 
by the facts said bud modersbach the berkeley calif counsel 
for cutter biologicals the miles division that manufactures koate 
the company intends to appeal he said miles will ask us 
district judge orinda evans for a judgment overturning the verdict 
and failing that will seek a new trial modersbach said

park rangers shot it out with poachers who 
gunned down at least five white rhinoceroses and made off with the 
animals valuable horns killing off the species in kenyas public 
lands authorities said 
a newspaper reported today that two rangers were seriously 
wounded in the battle sunday night with about 30 poachers at meru 
national park 140 miles northeast of the capital nairobi 
the poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos horns which 
can sell for up to 24000 each in the far east where they are 
used to make traditional medicines in the middle east the horns 
are fashioned into ornamental dagger handles 
people watched over them day and night a kenyan wildlife 
source said of the rhinos the rangers were wounded trying to 
defend them 
according to todays englishlanguage newspaper the standard 
two rangers were seriously injured in what it described as a 45 
minute attack 
five rhinos were killed said george muhoho minister of tourism 
and wildlife several wildlife experts who spoke on condition of 
anonymity put the number at six 
thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week in 
different areas the wildlife sources said 
the killings came despite increased antipoaching efforts by the 
government since august when muhoho revealed the slaughter of 92 
elephants in the previous three months and the government launched 
a highly publicized campaign to stop the killing 
the white rhinos which unlike the black rhino are not 
indigenous to kenya were imported from south africa about 20 years 
ago to start a colony and lived under guard in a special reserve in 
the park there still are an estimated 30 to 40 white rhino on 
private ranches in kenya 
the white rhinos numbers have not been reduced as sharply as 
have those of the black rhino which were thought to number more 
than 60000 in the early 1970s today the black rhino numbering 
about 800 throughout africa is considered an endangered species 
most of africas white rhinos live in south africa where 
experts estimate the herd at about 3000 strong twentyfive to 30 
of the animals live in a private park in solio ranch near the 
equator southeast of mount kenya according to the daily nation 
newspaper 
both types of rhino are a rather dark gray with their visible 
differences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape the white 
rhinos horn is longer 
kenya sent a paramilitary unit to meru national park to track 
the rhinos poachers said a government wildlife source he 
declined to provide details 
gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks off 
five elephants in southeastern tsavo east national park and eight 
elephants in the arid mathews range 155 miles north of nairobi the 
sources said 
their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since april 
according to published data wildlife officials estimate the toll 
is much higher 
studies by the nairobibased un environmental program show 
that in the past 15 years kenyas elephant population has dropped 
85 percent an aerial survey in february of tsavo park and its 
environs found fewer than 5500 elephants down from 35000 in 1974 
experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an alltime high of 
ivory prices which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s and 
average about 82 per pound

sears roebuck and co the nations largest 
retailer is selling the worlds largest building and a real estate 
unit shuffling jobs and buying its stock in a move seen by some as 
a defense against a possible takeover 
edward a brennan chairman of the 102yearold company said 
the plan is designed to enhance stock value and put its resources 
on consumeroriented businesses retailing insurance real estate 
and financial services 
brennan said the timing of the announcement may have been 
affected by the recent wave of takeovers 
sears has not been untouched by the rumor and speculation that 
thrives in these conditions he said 
but make no mistake he added this strategy is not solely 
a reaction to that environment 
the announcement was greeted wearily on wall street as sears 
stock slid 1875 monday to close at 4175 on the new york stock 
exchange 
the markets perception seems to be that they labored mightily 
and brought forth a mouse william n smith a retail analyst 
with smith barney harris upham amp co told the new york times 
sears had been expected to take some action to improve the value 
of its stock after announcing last week that thirdquarter profits 
fell 16 percent the third consecutive period sears income has 
declined 
net income for the quarter was 3442 million or 90 cents per 
share for the three months that ended sept 30 compared with 409 
million or 108 a share for thirdquarter 1987 
this makes a takeover more difficult in the near term it 
doesnt make it impossible said monroe greenstein an analyst 
with bear stearns amp co this will satisfy the pressure on 
sears for the short term 
the sears tower a stunning black skyscraper that rises 110 
stories 1450 feet from the downtown loop business district 
was built in 1974 and has been valued at 18 billion 
besides selling the building sears said it would 
buy back 10 percent of its stock 
sell the commercial real estate division of its coldwell 
banker real estate group a move that analyst walter f loeb of 
morgan stanley amp co said would raise 500 million 
continue to trim jobs from retail support activities like 
stockrooms and distribution centers and add people to the sales 
force overall there will be job reductions said brennan 
whose company employs 526000 worldwide 
adopt everyday low pricing at its 825 retail stores 
instead of sales 
take a onetime aftertax charge of 425 million in the 
fourth quarter to cover expenses for new merchandise assortments 
liquidation of old merchandise and other organizational changes 
in terms of merchandising they did what they had to do go 
headtohead with the k marts and other companies who have taken 
market share from them greenstein said 
loeb said i think the consumer isnt going to jump on the 
bandwagon as quickly as sears would like the consumer expecting 
the flyer isnt going to get it anymore

perhaps mystery writer dashiell hammett was 
dropping a clue to wouldbebadwriters when he wrote the 
cheaper the crook the gaudier the patter 
more than 100 writers accepted the challenge and submitted 
entries in the hamming up hammett writing contest vying for 
the grand prize package a bottle of cheap gin a ham sandwich and 
hardboiled egg 
the winners got what they had coming monday at johns grill a 
swank little joint where hammett used to bend an elbow between 
chapters of books like the maltese falcon and the thin man 
top honors or dishonors were shared by kevin killian and 
william vlach carolyn diamond got a bottle of cheap wine as a 
runnerup all three writers are from san francisco although the 
judges didnt know that while poring over essays from around the 
country 
vlach was picked for his classic hammettesque prose 
she turned to me the continental cop and said with a tear 
dribbling through her eye liner like moses parting the red sea 
you wont turn me in i love you you love me 
i counted the lies in those three sentences multiplied by 
three then opened the door for her pal little joel egypt 
when the cops got there i turned them both in her because she said 
she loved me him because he called me donald dick 
killians entry was honored for an obscure pun from the thin 
man 
tell me the truth nora said when you were on the floor 
wrestling with mimi did you have anorexia 
when the thin man was published in 1934 censors deleted a 
similar line nora actually asked nick if he had an erection 
when he wrestled with mimi 
diamonds entry featured a hardboiled detective named sam 
meeting an operative named gus at the corner of fifth and market 
where sam had found a body 
gus bends over and with a heave rolls over a huge concrete 
slab laying there is a body with a face one could never forget it 
was hoffa we put the slab back and left ol jimmy there at 
that intersection hes lying there now looking up at those society 
dames as they go by i figure jimmy would have liked it that way 
there were lots of other nosogood entries reviewed and the 
judges private eye hal lipset novelist joe gores and local 
hammett expert don herron said there was little difference 
between the winners and many of the losers 
killian seemed to agree 
im pretty disappointed he griped all i got was a bottle 
of cheap gin and a moldy old ham sandwich he apparently forgot 
about the egg and the free publicity

to pay for a toy giveaway 
us district judge t emmet clarie sentenced luz berrios 
berrios a 38yearold occupational therapist on monday 
we hoped for more but it didnt surprise us defense 
attorney jacob wieselman said 
federal prosecutors declined to comment on the sentence 
berrios pleaded guilty in september to a charge of conspiracy to 
transport stolen money the loot was taken from a wells fargo depot 
in west hartford in september 1983 authorities say it was the 
nations secondlargest cash heist

by los macheteros and carried out by a wells fargo security guard 
who has never been captured 
according to a presentencing report by authorities berrios was 
the macheteros payroll from september 1980 until may 1985 and was

a palestinian who was the only hijacker 
to survive the 1985 commandeering of an egyptian airliner pleaded 
guilty today to killing two women passengers an american and an 
israeli 
sixty people died in the hijacking and the storming of the 
boeing 737 by egyptian soldiers who attacked with gunfire and 
highpowered explosives it was the highest death toll ever for a 
hijacking 
the lebaneseborn defendant omar mohammed ali rezaq 25 was 
the only survivor among three palestinian gunmen who commandeered 
the egyptair plane which was flying the athenscairo route nov 
23 1985 
in a courtroom in a heavily guarded fort rezaq pleaded guilty 
to seven of nine charges including the killings of scarlet maria 
rogenkamp of oceanside calif and of nitzan mendelson 
the two were shot and thrown onto the tarmac after jewish and 
american passengers were singled out 
if convicted of the murder and hijacking charges rezaq could be 
sentenced to life imprisonment maltas stiffest criminal penalty 
prosecutor vincent de gaetano speaking during a break said the 
state might drop the two remaining lesser charges of firearms use 
and violation of maltese airspace in order to end the trial 
quickly 
the storming of the plane in which 56 of the 60 victims died 
raised questions about whether too much force was used by the 
egyptians 
most of the victims died from smoke inhalation during a fire 
sparked by an explosion which a maltese investigation said 
appeared to come after a hijacker tossed a grenade at the egyptian 
soldiers 
two of the other victims were killed by gunfire from the 
egyptians investigators found

gov rose mofford who once said reporters and 
friends call her mother had some motherly advice for business 
and civic leaders drink milk eat cookies and take a nap every 
afternoon 
the speech was intended for delivery to an arizona town hall 
meeting but wasnt because mrs mofford was suffering laryngitis 
however press aides released a copy of the text monday 
i would like to offer you one more piece of advice mrs 
mofford said in the speech after discussing the rising cost of 
litigation and possible alternatives to court rooms 
think about it carefully as you deliberate these next few days 
this advice is a small essay called everything i ever needed 
to know i learned in kindergarten 
there are the things i learned 
play fair 
share everything 
dont hit people 
put things back where you found them 
clean up your mess 
dont take things that arent yours 
say youre sorry when you hurt somebody 
wash your hands before you eat 
flush 
warm cookies and cold milk are good for you 
live a balanced life 
learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and 
dance 
and play and work every day some 
take a nap every afternoon 
when you get out in the world watch for traffic hold hands 
and stick together 
think of what a better world it would be if we all the whole 
world ate cookies and milk every afternoon and lay down with our 
blankets for a nap 
or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other nations to 
always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own 
messes 
and it is still true no matter how old you are when you go 
out in the world it is best to hold hands and stick together 
mofford press secretary vada manager said the passage was a 
story that she picked up in her numerous travels and seemed 
appropriate for the speech 
the essay is by robert fulghum and is part of his book all i 
need to know i learned in kindergarten being published this fall 
by random house 
it was kind of a humorous end to what was otherwise serious 
and substantive stuff manager said 
the arizona town hall is a periodic gathering of civic 
governmental academic and business leaders that focuses on a 
different issue each session the 53rd town hall meeting at the 
grand canyon was focused on civil justice in arizona 
the democratic governor who succeeded republican evan mecham 
upon his impeachment conviction in april raised several 
costcutting alternatives such as arbitration mediation and 
selection by the court of neutral expert witnesses but she said it 
was not for her to recommend any specifics

several jurors gasped as a neurologist testified 
that joel steinberg on trial for murder in the death of his 
illegally adopted daughter grinned when told the 6yearold girl 
was permanently brain damaged 
dr patrick kilhenny testified monday that he met with steinberg 
after neurological tests conducted on the comatose lisa steinberg 
were completed 
i told him her condition was quite grave and that she had 
suffered permanent brain damage but that she would survive 
kilhenny said adding that steinberg responded what youre 
saying is that shes not going to be an olympic athlete 
he said steinberg had a big grin it was i thought 
inappropriate 
steinberg glared at the doctor during his testimony while the 
dead girls biological mother michele launders listened from the 
front row 
kilhenny and steinberg talked in the st vincents hospital 
emergency room on the morning of nov 2 1987 when lisa arrived 
unconscious she died three days later after being officially 
declared brain dead 
kilhenny testified that lisa had died from blunt head trauma 
which the prosecution contends was inflicted by steinberg he said 
there was no medical evidence that the girl choked to death as 
steinberg contends 
under questioning by defense attorney ira london he conceded 
that lisas symptoms vomiting liver malfunction and 
unconsciousness were similar to those of reyes syndrome a rare 
viral illness that afflicts children 
but the doctor said that lisas autopsy did not reveal the 
presence of a virus 
earlier the defense attorney attacked the credibility of nurse 
nancy dodenhoff after she admitted disliking steinberg because of 
his cool unemotional response to the statement that lisa was 
probably braindead 
ms dodenhoff said she formed a dislike for steinberg in the 
emergency room because he did not react the way she thought he 
should to the grave diagnosis she said he seemed to show little 
concern about the child 
ms dodenhoff 26 testified last week that when she told 
steinberg the condition of lisa he asked have you found 
anything else wrong with her 
it upset me his response to the statement ms dodenhoff 
said monday i thought it was inappropriate 
under a tense crossexamination during which london and judge 
harold rothwax were shouting at each other the nurse denied her 
feelings about steinberg influenced her testimony 
the judge interrupted london several times to ask questions 
london objected vigorously yelling this is my 
crossexamination 
rothwax slammed down his gavel and replied that he would 
interrupt to clarify matters whenever he deemed it necessary 
even though ms dodenhoff admitted she wanted to see steinbergs 
reaction when she said the bureau of child welfare would be 
notified she denied she was trying to provoke a reaction

federal officials suspected for years that 
radioactive wastes from the fernald uranium processing plant might 
be contaminating ground water but they were indifferent to the 
threat a watchdog group says 
the government received the information through a 1960 
engineers report to national lead of ohio the contractor that 
operated the plant from the early 1950s through late 1985 said the 
government accountability project 
the washingtonbased organization cited documents obtained under 
the freedom of information act 
it was disgusting these documents indicate there were 
problems with these pits that clay sides were slipping down that 
there were cracks in the pits and materials were leaking into the 
groundwater said tom carpenter staff lawyer for the group 
nearly 13 million pounds of uraniumcontaining waste have been 
dumped into six waste pits since the plant opened in 1951 
according to the ohio environmental protection agency thorium and 
other radioactive toxic wastes in the pits threaten water supplies 
said the department of energy 
the plant located 18 miles northwest of cincinnati at fernald 
is over the great miami river aquifer that provides water for some 
southwestern ohio communities and businesses 
the pits were placed in unsuitable wet areas despite warnings 
from government geologists and other scientists about danger to the 
environment carpenter said 
the prime motivation at the fernald plant and other department 
of energy sites was production and the environment either played 
no role at all in decisions or at best a backup role he said 
the documents were internal memoranda from august 1960 written 
to national lead of hio by jd eye a university of cincinnati 
engineer the cincinnati post reported monday 
in the memo eye said there was no assurance clay seals in the 
pits were still watertight he also informed the company of damage 
to one pit the post said 
national lead of ohio faces a 300 million classaction lawsuit 
filed by fernald plant neighbors in 1985 alleging that radioactive 
materials from the plant have contaminated the environment 
threatened residents health and ruined property values 
the energy department the fernald plants owner said in 
documents filed recently in us district court that government 
officials instructed national lead of ohio managers to ignore 
environmental problems and push ahead with production the agency 
is defending the national lead of ohio in the lawsuit 
a department spokesman in washington declined to comment further 
monday 
ohio has also sued accusing the department of polluting air and 
water at the fernald plants 1050acre site the state and the 
energy department have been negotiating in an attempt to settle the 
dispute

finance minister boris gostev said today that the 
soviet national budget has been in the red for the past decade and 
that the deficit was critically large in the mid1980s before 
beginning to drop 
gostevs revelation at a news conference came just days after 
the supreme soviet passed a 494 billion ruble 795 billion 1989 
budget with a 34 billion ruble 55 billion deficit 
in presenting that budget gostev acknowledged for the first 
time that the soviet union had a budget deficit 
id say its been in existence for about 10 years it was 
extremely large critically large in the last years of the 
previous fiveyear plan period gostev told reporters 
he said the deficit then was 37 billion rubles 59 billion 
for the first time we have clearly stated that a deficit 
exists gostev said we cannot live with a budget deficit so 
well try to get rid of it during the year 
he said economic managers would try to trim 40 billion from the 
budget cut down on administration and get moneylosing state 
businesses 24000 of which are bankrupt to turn a profit 
western analysts said monday they think the soviet budget 
deficit is larger than officials have said and may threaten soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
jan vanous who develops models of the soviet economy for the 
washington firm planecon estimated the deficit at 65 billion 
rubles to 75 billion rubles 104 billion to 120 billion each in 
1987 and 1988 
yuri maslyukov the chairman of the state planning committee and 
an alternate member of the ruling politburo told the news 
conference that the soviet economy has inflation of 09 percent to 
15 percent 
maslyukov said wages have risen faster than labor productivity 
we have more money than we have goods thats why the shelves 
in the stores are empty he said 
some economic analysts say cheap consumer goods are hard to find 
in the soviet union because of the system of setting prices since 
producers are not free to raise prices gradually on their goods 
they stop manufacturing them and replace them with more expensive 
products on which they can make a profit 
showing a profit has become increasingly important as gorbachev 
pushes reforms requiring local managers to account for profits and 
losses 
but maslyukov said officials were not considering eliminating 
government control over prices 
if we want to maintain the low level of prices we must ensure 
state control otherwise we are not ready for the anarchy of the 
market competition in the internal economy will be required the 
basis for that is not yet ready maslyukov said

a dormitory housemother who opened the door 
to an alleged victim of wifebeating should not have been fired 
despite her employers rule barring unauthorized visitors her 
lawyer said 
sallyanne brown said she lost her parttime job at a dormitory 
for northeastern hospitals women nursing students after she opened 
the dormitory door late one night last december to a woman who was 
crying and saying that she had been beaten by her husband and 
needed the police 
officials at northeastern hospital said mrs brown was fired for 
violating rules that prohibited her from doing anything that might 
endanger the safety of the dormitory residents including allowing 
unauthorized visitors after curfew 
mrs brown is seeking unspecified damages and back pay from the 
hospital in a civil lawsuit argued monday in common pleas court 
both sides completed their arguments in the first day of trial 
but common pleas judge lawrence prattis gave mrs browns lawyer 
judith chomsky until nov 30 to cite similar cases 
during the hearing prattis said there was no question that 
public policy encourages giving assistance to victims of abuse but 
said that does not mean that it can be used as an exception to 
every rule established by employers 
when mrs brown was on the stand prattis asked her if she would 
have let in a teenage boy who came to the door with bruises and 
said he was abused 
mrs brown said she would to which prattis replied i believe 
you would 
and that ms chomsky is your problem the judge said to 
mrs browns lawyer 
mrs brown also testified that a hospital security guard who was 
present on dec 13 1987 when she let the woman in told her to 
let the woman in and stayed until police came for the woman 
however the guard john demasi who no longer works for the 
hospital testified that he told mrs brown not to let the woman in 
the dorm 
the woman did not testify and was not identified during the 
hearing 
dr shirley hickman the director of nursing education at the 
hospital testified that mrs brown would have been disciplined 
regardless of whether a security guard was present or whether the 
woman had been seeking assistance 
hospital rules she said prohibited any unauthorized people 
regardless of their condition from entering the building after 
curfew 
ms hickman also contended that when mrs brown first related 
her actions to hospital officials she did not say the woman had 
claimed she had been abused

venice today enforced a law banning the 
sale and use of detergents with high amounts of phosphorus that 
have been blamed in part for the severe pollution of the lagoon 
the ansa news agency reported 
about 2000 tons of phosphorus from industrial agricultural and 
residential use pour into the waters surrounding the city spurring 
the growth of algae according to deputy mayor rosa carbone 
the algae die when they use up the sparse oxygen supply leaving 
behind a nauseating smell and green slime 
the new ordinance which ansa said was the first of its kind in 
italy bans detergents with a phosphorus content of more than 1 
percent city officials will conduct spot checks of stores to see 
if such detergents are being sold violators may face arrest and a 
threemonth jail term 
mayor antonio casellati called the action only the first step 
in the battle against pollution but it is a necessary step in 
order to avoid aggravating the environmental situation 
in july the italian government allocated 22 million to help 
venice fight the algae in its canals which serve as sewers as well 
as thoroughfares in this boatdependent city

a white county prosecutor who was 
cleared by a grand jury of accusations that he attacked a black 
teenager filed an 800 million defamation lawsuit against the girl 
and her advisers 
assistant district attorney steven pagones said last month that 
he would sue the rev al sharpton and lawyers c vernon mason and 
alton maddox for their blatant disgusting and deplorable lies 
he filed the lawsuit monday in a state court 
the three men repeatedly claimed that pagones was involved in 
the alleged abduction and rape of tawana brawley by six white men 
last november 
miss brawley who never cooperated with the grand jury during 
its sevenmonth investigation was found near her former apartment 
in wappingers falls last nov 28 smeared with dog feces and with 
racial slurs written on her body 
the grand jury cleared pagones of any involvement in the brawley 
case and concluded that the girl now 16 fabricated the story 
miss brawley who has moved from new york to virginia with her 
family and her advisers denounced that report as the product of a 
racist legal system 
the 75page lawsuit claims that miss brawley also defamed 
pagones by saying that she supported all the actions of her lawyers 
and sharpton 
sharpton said monday that miss brawley would tell her story in 
court and along with other witnesses would prove pagones 
involvement 
mason had no comment on the lawsuit according to a receptionist 
at his law office maddox did not return telephone calls for 
comment 
state attorney general robert abrams who was special prosecutor 
in the brawley investigation has sought an investigation of mason 
and maddox for possible disciplinary action

chinas population could reach 127 billion by 
the year 2000 70 million more than the current target the 
nations top family planning official said 
state family commission minister peng peiyun said the goal of 
holding the number of people in the worlds most populous nation to 
12 billion at the turn of the century no longer seems realistic 
the official china daily reported today 
peng is the highestranking official to acknowledge that the 
target set in the 1980s will not be achieved although other 
chinese demographers have estimated the population in the year 2000 
will be between 125 and 128 billion 
china now has about 108 billion people 
since the beginning of this decade family planners have tried 
to curb population growth by advocating that each family have only 
one child and promoting the use of contraceptives and abortion 
the natural growth rate reached a low of 11 percent in 1985 but 
climbed to 14 percent in 1986 and 16 percent last year a result 
of rural opposition to the onechild policy and a secondgeneration 
baby boom as people born in a population surge in the early 1960s 
begin raising families 
peng said that although 78 percent of all couples use 
contraceptives only 18 percent 323 million couples say they 
want only one child 
she said more than half of families have two or more children 
and rural couples whose first child is a girl now are allowed to 
have a second baby ethnic minorities which make up about 6 
percent of the population also are permitted two or more children 
the government has made a concession for peasant families whose 
first baby is a girl because of the strong desire for boys to help 
work the land and carry on the family name 
newly affluent farmers frequently pay large fines for having two 
or more children until they produce a male heir 
peng said the government will not use force to carry out its 
family planning policy

iran and iraqs foreign ministers met today in the 
first joint session of their stalled unmediated peace talks 
since early last month 
the session led by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar was only the sixth direct meeting between irans ali akbar 
velayati and iraqs tariq aziz since the talks began aug 25 
no details of the talks were immediately reported 
the negotiations aim at a lasting settlement with priority 
given to consolidating the ceasefire which took effect aug 20 
after eight years of fighting that claimed an estimated 15 million 
dead and wounded 
previous talks were held in geneva and in new york the third 
round began monday when perez de cuellar met separately with 
velayati and aziz 
talks have bogged down over the definition of the common border 
specifically in the shattalarab the waterway which is iraqs 
only sea outlet 
under a 1975 treaty which iraq repudiated five years later the 
border runs down the middle of the waterway the iraqis want it 
moved to irans shore where it was before the treaty 
the shattalarab which iran calls the arvand river was closed 
soon after the war began in september 1980 and is blocked by 
stranded ships unexploded shells and accumulated silt iraq has 
pressed for dredging to begin immediately while negotiations on 
sovereignty continue 
iran has agreed in principle to a un compromise that envisages 
dredging in conjunction with agreement on three points withdrawal 
of forces to recognized borders prisoner exchange and irans 
renunciation of the right to search ships in the persian gulf for 
warrelated cargo it has discontinued the searches under the truce 
velayati urged iraq on monday to join in reactivating the common 
bureau of coordination an agency established by the 1975 treaty to 
resolve questions about navigation in the shattalarab 
in a statement read to the journalists before his meeting with 
perez de cuellar the iranian foreign minister said progress in the 
new negotiations depends much on iraqs position toward the 
un formula 
the 15member security council passed resolution 598 unanimously 
july 20 1987 demanding a ceasefire in the war iraq accepted it 
immediately on condition iran do the same and the iranians agreed 
a year later 
aziz said after mondays meeting with perez de cuellar that his 
government would try to find solutions but added it is up to 
the other side to show a similar sort of good faith and cooperation 
in order to achieve progress 
perez de cuellar has said his first objective is disengagement 
of forces the secretarygeneral said he also hopes for early 
substantial progress in the exchange of all prisoners who un 
experts say total more than 100000

in an intriguing twist to the white house 
campaign the nations next vice president may be a republican 
senator or he may be a democratic senator but he almost certainly 
will be replaced in congress by a republican 
the two vice presidential candidates are republican dan quayle 
of indiana and democrat lloyd bentsen of texas and the winner must 
resign his seat in congress before taking his oath as firstinline 
to the presidency next jan 20 under state law in both cases the 
governor from the vice presidents state would appoint a temporary 
replacement in congress 
indianas situation is complicated because the state is picking 
a new governor this year democratic secretary of state evan bayh 
is rated a favorite over republican john mutz but republicans say 
they have no intention of winning the vice presidency only to 
surrender quayles senate seat to the democrats 
they expect quayle would resign from congress before bayh could 
take office and permit outgoing gov robert orr a republican to 
make an appointment phil schermerhorn a spokesman for secretary 
of state bayh agreed it was up to quayle to decide when to resign 
from congress 
if mutz wins the indiana statehouse quayle would also have the 
option of waiting until the new governor took office before 
stepping aside one republican speaking on condition of anonymity 
speculated that quayle would have more influence over mutzs 
decision than he would over orrs 
in any case one frequently mentioned replacement is rep dan 
coats who served as an aide to quayle and took over his old house 
seat when his mentor moved up to the senate 
whoever the new indiana senator is he or she would serve as an 
appointed lawmaker until the 1990 election and then be eligible to 
run for the two years that would be remaining in quayles unexpired 
term 
texas is complicated in a different way 
bentsen is seeking reelection to the senate this year as well 
as running for vice president and his rival rep beau boulter 
would replace him if he wins the senate seat 
but if bentsen wins his senate seat and the vice presidency 
republican gov bill clements would name a new senator to serve 
until a special election were held 
jim warren a spokesman in the texas secretary of states 
office said the state law does not dictate when that election must 
be held and he expects a court case to resolve the matter

michael dukakis could win the presidency by 
honing his appeal to the sizable number of undecided voters but 
the stability of his opponents lead makes the task a formidable 
one pollsters say 
two polls released monday found republican george bush 
maintaining a healthy lead among likely voters 11 points in one 
survey done last week seven points in a harris poll conducted 
during the weekend 
the harris poll found dukakis gaining a bit by countering bushs 
attacks of his record on crime fiftythree percent rated dukakis 
as soft on crime still high but down from 63 percent in an earlier 
poll by harris 
dukakis also appeared to score slightly by portraying bushs 
campaign advertisements as unfair while 68 percent called dukakis 
own advertising too negative a higher 75 percent said that of 
bushs ads 
overall harris put the race at 5245 percent a very slight 
narrowing from 5344 in its oct 1417 poll the contest was 5241 
in the other new poll done by gallup for the times mirror corp 
the first half of last week 
the times mirror poll found support for dukakis uneven within 
his own party while bush has solid backing from republicans and 
siphoned away some democrats gallup in its analysis of the 
results noted that bush has led the race at least since september 
though the contest remained largely stable the times mirror 
poll found that bush had increasingly loyal support in key groups 
dukakis popularity eroded meanwhile and he lost support in some 
democratic groups even while gaining it in others 
the problem in analyzing the race was bushs stable lead on one 
hand versus the weakness of voter preferences on the other 
twentyseven percent of likely voters were undecided or said they 
might change their minds and only about half of each candidates 
supporters backed them strongly 
if dukakis and the dukakis campaign can get their act together 
and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies they 
can win it on the basis of the numbers said andrew kohut the 
president of gallup but thats a big if given the course of the 
campaign so far 
bushs lead was based upon overwhelming support from 
republicans solid backing from republicanleaning independents and 
substantial defections from some democratic groups according 
to kohuts analysis 
for dukakis on the other hand his support is not as strong 
among his own partisans and he is receiving virtually no 
defections from members of core republican groups the analysis 
said 
the times mirror poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly 
sized groups whose members share general values its partisan 
poor for example is a democratic group its enterprisers 
and moralists are republican 
bush attracted 21 percent of the partisan poor a good 
showing in a democratic stronghold dukakis by contrast drew only 
2 percent of the enterprisers and 3 percent of the 
moralists 
disaffected voters a potential swing group whose members 
are set apart by their suspicion of government continued to back 
bush by more than 21 and they were more loyal fiftyone percent 
said they were unlikely to switch to dukakis up from 36 percent 
last month 
in contrast on the democratic side defections to george bush 
have doubled among seculars and significantly increased among the 
partisan poor gallups analysis said 
while dukakis offset the losses by gaining with other democrats 
the movement was indicative of the problems that the dukakis 
campaign has had in achieving enthusiastic support from groups in 
his own party it said 
among all registered voters not just those likely to vote 
dukakis was rated favorably by 48 percent compared with 58 percent 
favorable for bush the poll analysis said dukakis rating was 
significantly below those of most candidates in recent 
presidential elections 
the times mirror poll was conducted oct 2326 among 2006 
registered voters of whom 1505 were considered likely to vote 
the harris poll was done among 1250 likely voters both had a 
threepoint margins of error 
meanwhile abc news polls gave bush the lead in two big states 
texas and california in texas it was 52 percent for bush to 45 
percent for dukakis in a survey conducted saturday and sunday among 
505 likely voters the margin of error was plus or minus five 
percentage points 
in a state poll of 510 likely voters conducted saturday and 
sunday abc put the race in california at 51 percent for bush to 44 
percent for dukakis again with a potential margin of sampling 
error of five points other recent surveys also have found bush 
slightly ahead there 
in massachusetts a boston heraldwbztv poll published today 
shows dukakis leading bush by 4942 percent there although bush 
appears to have pulled closer the same pollsters found dukakis 
with 49 percent to bushs 39 percent in midoctober 
the latest poll of 400 likely massachusetts voters surveyed 
saturday and sunday had a five percentage point margin of error 
in a separate poll in missouri bush led dukakis 53 percent to 
39 percent among 397 likely voters the poll was taken last monday 
through thursday and had a margin of error of four points 
in wisconsin a survey of 1019 likely voters sunday through 
thursday found bush leading 4540 percent the survey had a margin 
of error of three points

a justice department investigation of rep 
fernand st germain chairman of the house banking committee found 
substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct 
according to court documents 
the department nonetheless declined to prosecute st germain a 
rhode island democrat after investigating whether he accepted 
meals from lobbyists and failed to report them on his financial 
disclosure form the court papers said 
the documents unsealed last week quote a may 31 letter that 
the justice department sent to the house ethics committee stating 
it had declined to prosecute st germain 
we believe it is appropriate to refer the matter to your 
committee to consider whether representative st germain has 
violated any relevant standards of conduct the department said 
in the letter by john c keeney then the acting assistant attorney 
general in charge of the criminal division 
st germain on monday night denied the ethics committee was 
reviewing justice department evidence on him 
that is absolutely unfounded this seems curious to me that it 
comes out eight days before the election he said in a telephone 
interview 
the ethics committee conducted a thorough investigation of 
me and they cleared me justice conducted a thorough grand jury 
investigation of me and they found they had nothing to proceed 
with there was nothing there said st germain there is 
nothing going on and im sick and tired of this 
but in a court pleading dated sept 30 the ethics panel opposed 
public release of a resolution it adopted in closed session on june 
23 saying it reveals confidential details of the committees 
investigation in that it recites the potential violations the 
committee believes may exist based on the information in the 
letter from the justice department 
the justice department investigated for accepting food drink 
and entertainment from james o freeman lobbyist for the us 
league of savings institutions and other financial industry 
lobbyists 
according to the court papers a federal judge in september 
granted the ethics committee access to grand jury information 
the departments investigation had focused on a possible 
violation of antibribery statutes that prohibit members of 
congress from accepting anything of value in return for an official 
act the inquiry also dealt with whether the chairman should have 
disclosed meals freeman allegedly purchased on the annual financial 
statement st germain filed with the house 
last may the department said it was declining to prosecute st 
germain and had closed the investigation 
its letter to the house committee on standards of official 
conduct was quoted in pleadings filed by the ethics panel in us 
district court to obtain the complete record of the grand jurys 
investigation of st germain 
the ethics panel was given access to the grand jury transcript 
as part of its investigation under a court order issued last summer 
with the consent of the justice department 
the committees investigation has not reached the stage of a 
preliminary inquiry according to the papers filed by the house 
ethics committee 
the papers were ordered unsealed last week by us district 
judge aubrey e robinson jr on a motion by the washington post 
and public citizen a publicinterest law firm founded by ralph 
nader 
only portions of the justice department letter quoted in 
pleadings filed in the newspaper case by the committee were 
released by robinson 
the pleadings reveal that in response to the may 31 letter the 
ethics committee voted formally to request the grand jury material

a marine with emotional troubles 
caused by 444 days of captivity at the us embassy in iran will be 
honorably discharged soon despite his desire to remain in the 
service officials said 
staff sgt john d mckeel jr 35 who contends his problems are 
manageable will be discharged with a 10 percent medical disability 
within 20 days according to a statement monday by the marine corps 
in washington 
mckeel who is stationed at camp pendleton was a marine guard 
at the embassy in tehran when it was stormed by radicals on nov 4 
1979 following the revolution that toppled the shah of iran and 
brought the ayatollah ruhollah khomenei to power in february of 
that year 
he was among 52 americans held hostage 444 days before being 
released jan 20 1981 
mckeel a marine for nearly 13 years has said civilian doctors 
diagnosed him in 1985 as suffering from posttraumatic stress 
syndrome the federal privacy act of 1974 prohibits release of 
details of mckeels career and military doctors diagnoses of his 
medical condition 
due to the nature of his disability and the length of his 
service staff sgt mckeel will be entitled to two years of his 
base pay about 34000 as a severance payment the marine corps 
statement said 
the commandant of the marine corps due to the special 
circumstances involved conducted an indepth review of staff sgt 
mckeels case to ensure that every available option had been 
considered 
telephone calls to mckeels home in san marcos 35 miles north 
of san diego went unanswered monday evening 
mckeel a dallas native has said he wont fight the discharge 
because his enlistment is up in march and he has no legal right to 
reenlist because he has less than 18 years in the service 
however he doesnt believe the marines have treated him fairly 
or exhausted all efforts to find a job that his condition will 
allow him to handle 
im perfectly capable of doing a good job they just wont 
give me one mckeel said last month when he first complained 
publicly about his situation 
if you put your life on the line for your country they ought 
to repay you some other way than saying hit the road after the 
awards and the honors you get they do this to you 
mckeel said the civilian doctors who diagnosed him wanted to 
place him in a treatment program for former prisoners of war but 
the marines wouldnt approve it 
he was instead sent back to camp pendleton and assigned to 
supply duty while undergoing periodic counseling which mckeel said 
helped a little 
mckeel said he decided to discuss his problem publicly because 
if more people speak up a lot of stuff like this might not 
happen

newspapers reported today 
south africa has agreed to the substance of a us proposal to 
grant independence to southwest africa before a cuban withdrawal 
from angola 
until now south africa linked independence for the territory 
commonly called namibia to the departure of some 50000 cuban 
troops supporting angolas marxist government 
but the citizen a progovernment newspaper and business day 
the countrys leading financial daily said south africa would 
allow about half the cuban forces to remain in the northern part of 
angola for a year after independence elections in namibia

the us plan although they were asked to do so by oct 12 
south africa has indicated that it was prepared to be 
flexible as far as the latest us proposal is concerned botha

therefore not be attributable to south africa 
angolas official angop news agency quoted president jose 
eduardo dos santos as saying its possible the implementation of 
namibian independence will begin some time in november december 
or january 
dos santos said there still were unresolved questions concerning 
the cuban troop withdrawal according to the angop dispatch which 
was monitored in lisbon portugal 
the cubans reportedly are insisting on a 30month withdrawal 
compared to ussouth african proposals of 24 months 
south africa has said it wanted to begin implementing namibian 
independence today leading to elections june 1 but it has given 
no indication it will begin the independence process without a 
timetable on the cuban withdrawal 
the citizen and business day said south africa now seeks to 
begin granting independence to namibia on jan 1 leading to 
elections aug 1 
under this plan cuba would move its troops to the northern half 
of namibia by march 31 and withdraw about half by aug 1 the 
citizen said the remaining troops would depart by the end of 1990 
the newspaper said 
south africa cuba angola and us mediators have been holding 
periodic talks since may in a bid to settle on a timetable for the 
withdrawal of the cuban forces 
south africa and the combined cubanangolan forces have been 
observing a ceasefire since aug 8 and there have been no reports 
of violations

the peace talks and continues to fight in angola

finance minister boris gostev said today that the 
soviet national budget has been in the red for the past decade and 
that the deficit was critically large in the mid1980s before 
beginning to drop 
gostevs revelation at a news conference came just days after 
the supreme soviet passed a 494 billion ruble 795 billion 1989 
budget with a 34 billion ruble 55 billion deficit 
in presenting that budget gostev acknowledged for the first 
time that the soviet union had a budget deficit 
id say its been in existence for about 10 years it was 
extremely large critically large in the last years of the 
previous fiveyear plan period gostev told reporters 
he said the deficit then was 37 billion rubles 59 billion 
for the first time we have clearly stated that a deficit 
exists gostev said we cannot live with a budget deficit so 
well try to get rid of it during the year 
he said economic managers would try to trim 40 billion from the 
budget cut down on administration and get moneylosing state 
businesses 24000 of which are bankrupt to turn a profit 
western analysts said monday they think the soviet budget 
deficit is larger than officials have said and may threaten soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
jan vanous who develops models of the soviet economy for the 
washington firm planecon estimated the deficit at 65 billion 
rubles to 75 billion rubles 104 billion to 120 billion each in 
1987 and 1988 
yuri maslyukov the chairman of the state planning committee and 
an alternate member of the ruling politburo told the news 
conference that the soviet economy has inflation of 09 percent to 
15 percent 
maslyukov said wages have risen faster than labor productivity 
we have more money than we have goods thats why the shelves 
in the stores are empty he said 
some economic analysts say cheap consumer goods are hard to find 
in the soviet union because of the system of setting prices since 
producers are not free to raise prices gradually on their goods 
they stop manufacturing them and replace them with more expensive 
products on which they can make a profit 
showing a profit has become increasingly important as gorbachev 
pushes reforms requiring local managers to account for profits and 
losses 
but maslyukov said officials were not considering eliminating 
government control over prices 
if we want to maintain the low level of prices we must ensure 
state control otherwise we are not ready for the anarchy of the 
market competition in the internal economy will be required the 
basis for that is not yet ready maslyukov said

michael dukakis today blasted republican 
rival george bush as the candidate of privilege touted himself as 
the candidate of working people and told a union audience the only 
label he likes is made in america 
dukakis sounded populist themes at a town meeting in a former 
steelworkers union hall decorated with signs reading ohio unions 
vote dukakis as he toured major industrial states in the final 
week before the nov 8 election 
the massachusetts governor mentioned the merger mania on wall 
street and said im not interested in the sharp operators im 
interested in the lathe operators and the machine operators 
dukakis tackled bushs repeated efforts to tag him as a liberal 
who is out of touch with mainstream america 
the vice president likes to talk about labels dukakis said 
you know the label im interested in made in america is the 
label im interested in 
with 23 electoral votes ohio is crucial to dukakis strategy for 
scoring an election upset over the vice president in national 
balloting one week from today 
dukakis aides dont dispute public opinion polls showing the 
democratic nominee trailing bush in ohio but they claim the gap is 
narrowing 
this is not my first visit to this valley dukakis told his 
audience in the economically troubled mahoning valley where most of 
the once thriving steel industry has shut down 
to my knowledge george bush has never been here he said 
adding that the gop nominees absence tells much about the 
differences between the two candidates i know what a community 
like this has gone through he said 
people in charlotte nc newark del and college park md 
also heard dukakis through a satellite hookup and were able to ask 
questions of the candidate 
dukakis suggested that a heavy fine imposed by the occupational 
safety and health administration against a big meatpacking company 
for alleged safety violations was politically motivated because it 
came 10 days before the election 
my question is where was osha before that he asked we 
need an osha thats in at the beginning insisting companies obey 
the law 
from youngstown the democratic candidate flies to milwaukee 
detroit and kansas city mo for rallies 
the campaign bought five minutes on nbc at 1055 pm est 955 
pm cst tonight for another appeal to voters 
in that speech dukakis will accuse the republicans of waging 
the lowest level campaign in modern history they are engaged in a 
scorched earth policy against the truth 
he also was identifying with past democratic presidents with 
the notable exception of jimmy carter and pledging to make america 
first in education health care and exporting products 
on the flight east after three days of campaigning in california 
dukakis aides argued monday night that the candidate had finally 
found the combination he needed to close with a rush 
people who may have been swayed by negative advertising are 
taking a second look now said dukakis political adviser steve 
engelberg 
im on your side is striking a chord said francis obrien 
another senior campaign adviser 
dukakis drew big enthusiastic crowds on two campuses in 
california 
im fired up he said as he left a rally at san jose state 
university 
the populist theme was in the forefront at a later rally on the 
campus of cerritos community college a few miles south of los 
angeles 
i said yesterday i was proud to stand in the tradition of some 
great presidents the liberal tradition of great presidents like 
franklin roosevelt harry truman and john kennedy he told the 
cheering crowd 
republicans he said dont understand this tradition the 
tradition of being on the side of working families 
coming out and affirming the liberal thing was good said 
james boulgarides vice mayor of culver city calif who was on the 
stage with dukakis at the cerritos rally 
when asked if he thought it played well the previous day when the 
democratic nominee campaigned in the more conservative san joaquin 
valley boulgarides said supposedly it got received very well 
but he was talking to his own people 
dukakis made a particular appeal to women saying the republican 
ticket of bush and indiana sen dan quayle was on the wrong side 
of every issue of special importance to american women

president reagan told fellow 
californians today that presidential candidate michael dukakis is 
no harry truman and hes no fdr two presidents the democrat has 
tied himself to in recent days 
in a speech prepared for delivery at california state university 
in fullerton reagan also sought to turn aside dukakis contention 
that im on your side 
george bush is the one and the only one whos on your side 
reagan told the students and thats not negative campaigning 
thats the truth 
dukakis in campaign appearances this week has said im a 
liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and harry truman and 
john kennedy 
reagan who has derided dukakis as a liberal throughout the 
campaign said in his speech dont be fooled folks george 
bushs opponent is no harry truman and hes no fdr 
in a speech prepared for a later stop at the national orange show 
stadium in san bernardino reagan continued his onslaught on the 
democratic record saying weve been slashing tax rates and 
liberating the american economy from the confiscation of the malaise 
years 
we cleared away the wrecks the liberals left behind waved the 
green flag fired the starter pistol and watched you go to the 
races he said in his speech at the agricultural trade center 60 
miles east of los angeles 
in his gymnasium speech at cal state fullerton a commuter 
university with more than 22000 students reagan warned against 
complacency and said this election campaign is not over and the 
only poll that means a thing is the one on election day thats why 
its so important for you to vote 
the two speeches were reagans final pitch to fellow 
californians whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to either 
candidates hopes 
the president will also campaign in the battleground state of 
ohio appearing at baldwinwallace college in berea on wednesday 
ohio has 23 electoral votes and like california is a hotly 
contested prize in bushs white house battle with dukakis 
reagan is also putting his prestige on the line on behalf of 
republican senatorial candidates in nevada and wisconsin 
from california he was flying to reno nev for a rally in 
support of firstterm gop sen chic hecht facing a stiff battle 
with popular democratic gov richard h bryan 
hecht a quiet sometimes inarticulate former banker and clothing 
store owner was elected in 1982 after reagan came into the state 
for two appearances in october 
he jumped me up 8 or 10 points and i stayed there and won 
hecht said in a 1986 interview 
in 1986 however appearances in the state by reagan failed to 
save the faltering senate campaign of then rep jim santini as 
democratic sen harry reid won election 
national republican senatorial committee records show that reagan 
campaigned for gop candidates for the senate in 17 states in 1986 
only six of them were elected as democrats regained the control 
they had lost with reagans election in 1980 
before flying to ohio on wednesday the president goes to 
milwaukee to put in a pitch for the senate campaign of susan 
engeleiter republican leader of the wisconsin state senate 
public opinion polls show mrs engeleiter trailing herbert kohl 
owner of the milwaukee bucks basketball team 
still presidential appearances can help as both hecht and 
former nevada republican sen paul laxalt can testify 
in an interview in 1986 laxalt recalled his 1964 race against 
democratic sen howard cannon who ended up defeating him by a 
narrow margin after a campaign appearance by president lyndon b 
johnson 
we had howard cannon on the run and i think we had the race 
won and the big texan came in with guns blazing into las vegas and 
reno and he literally blew me away laxalt said

in an emotionally electric climate of arab 
firebomb attacks and reprisal air raids israelis today cast ballots 
in watershed elections expected to determine the future of the 
occupied lands 
more than 300 arabs and 10 jews have been killed in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip in the nearly 11monthold palestinian 
uprising against 21 years of israeli rule 
election officials reported a heavy voter turnout under clear 
skies a massive security force protected polling places the army 
sealed off the occupied lands where a palestinian general strike 
was taking place 
political observers said the slaying of four israelis in a 
firebomb attack sunday would tilt undecided voters to prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc which opposes israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied lands 
labor led by foreign minister shimon peres has offered such a 
withdrawal in return for peace 
as its citizens voted israel raided arab guerrilla targets in 
lebanon in apparent retaliation for a firebomb attack sunday 
lebanese police said four people were killed and 15 wounded 
in arab east jerusalem assailants today threw a firebomb at a 
car injuring three people police said witnesses said the car was 
plastered with stickers for the likud bloc and was being used to 
transport voters 
by midafternoon 41 percent of the electorate or about 1090000 
voters had cast ballots results were to be announced after polls 
closed at 10 pm 3 pm est 
neither labor or likud has succeeded in gaining a majority in the 
120member parliament since the jewish state was established in 
1948 polls indicated they would fail again 
the situation has forced labor and likud to form alliances with 
minor parties that have gained influence beyond their numbers 
twentyseven parties were entered in the election 
likud and labor formed a fractious coalition after the 1984 
elections when neither party could arrange a majority with the 
small parties 
election officials said the turnout was heavy indicating that 75 
to 80 percent of eligible voters would cast ballots in the 1984 
election voter turnout was 787 percent 
analysts said the high turnout would favor likud because much of 
its support comes from lower and workingclass voters more easily 
deterred from voting by bad weather and transportation problems 
police reported 74 incidents ranging from fistfights to unlawful 
campaigning near polling stations three people were reported 
arrested 
the army sealed off the occupied territories for 48 hours 
beginning at 11 pm monday and imposed curfews on refugee camps in 
gaza journalists were barred without army permission and escort 
from entering the territories where a palestinian general strike 
was under way 
bank employee rahamim fadikler voted in a working class jerusalem 
neighborhood 
my family and i vote for likud he said the people here 
dont want to return the territories we suffered the shelling in 
1967 and we dont want to see it again 
he was referring to shelling of settlements along the border 
before israel captured the territories from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
shamir favors the strengthening of jewish settlement in the 
occupied lands which 70000 settlers share uneasily with 15 
million palestinians 
in the election 29 million voters were eligible to cast 
ballots results were not expected until wednesday 
more than 13000 policemen and civil guardsmen were deployed at 
the 4800 polling stations 
likud planned to spend about 25 million hiring taxicabs and 
buses and using the services of 10000 volunteer drivers to get 
voters to the polls 
in jerusalem streets were littered with political fliers 
polls taken before sundays firebombing and published in the 
maariv newspaper monday gave the likud an edge or pointed to a 
deadlock 
in four different polls labor and its allies were projected to 
receive between 47 and 55 seats with likud and its partners getting 
between 5665 seats 
labors best chance of blocking a likud coalition appeared to be 
an alliance with the far left expected to win eight seats among 
israels 350000 arab voters 
likud accused labor of readiness to form a coalition with 
nonzionist parties and labor said likud would form an alliance 
with the extreme rightwing parties both indicated the possibility

the american defense establishment needs to be 
overhauled to take account of a lessened threat from the soviet 
union and heightened risks in other areas says a study by a private 
research organization 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs internal reform efforts have 
somewhat lessened the military threat to the united states at the 
same time that threats from other sources such as terrorism and 
economicbased problems have increased concluded the national 
security group report 
due to mr gorbachevs initiatives that threat appears to have 
decreased at the same time we find ourselves increasingly 
threatened by smaller thirdworld countries terrorism and 
unconventional problems like drugs environmental pollution and 
instability the study said 
in the face of this horizontal escalation we find that our 
force structure intelligence system and operating procedures are 
all geared to the large single threat we do not have the 
flexibility required for these smaller more diffuse hazards it 
said 
the national security group describes itself as a nonpartisan 
educational organization the fiveyearold organization is based in 
chicago and has previously sponsored studies on securityrelated 
issues such as arms control it board of advisors includes donald 
rumsfeld the former defense secretary 
the report said a new ominous potential threat looms in the 
growing influence of the drug cartels of latin america over the 
legitimate governments of that area 
the solutions it proposed include a marshall plan for latin 
america increased flexibility in the us military structure and 
intelligencegathering apparatus and new attention to global 
environmental problems 
the report also urged the winner of next tuesdays presidential 
election either democrat michael dukakis or republican george bush 
to quickly call a budget summit with capitol hill leaders to 
deal with looming defense budget problems 
the pentagon budget will be a key concern of the new 
administration defense spending rose sharply each year during 
president reagans first term but has been essentially frozen 
during his second term the current defense budget is 300 billion 
and is not likely to rise much regardless of who is elected nov 8 
overly optimistic projections of defense budget growth coupled 
with relatively larger growth of internal fixed accounts and public 
pressure against increasing defense spending will result in a 
decrease of 250 billion to 400 billion for defense in the next 
five years from what the military had assumed it said 
during reagans first term the military services made down 
payments on a large number of new weapons systems some of those 
weapons may have to be canceled 
the report also said the pentagon spending effort should be 
broadened to keep pace with the new view 
carefully selected projects in the areas of education 
industry research and development and energy policy would be funded 
specifically as security projects it said

firebombs hurled by palestinians today set 
ablaze a car carrying likud bloc voters to the polls witnesses said 
the bomb set fire to the hair of a woman passenger seriously 
injuring her and the two men in the car 
in lebanon israeli warplanes blasted palestinian guerrilla 
targets along in apparent retaliation for a firebomb attack in the 
occupied west bank that killed a jewish woman and her three sons on 
sunday 
lebanese police said four people were killed and 15 wounded in 
the 20th air raid this year 
palestinians staged a general strike shutting businesses and 
public transportation throughout the occupied lands troops shot and 
wounded four demonstrators in stonethrowing clashes in the occupied 
gaza strip and the west bank city of nablus arab hospital officials 
said 
the steppedup violence coincided with parliamentary elections in 
israel that pitted prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
against foreign minister shimon peres leftist labor party 
analysts said the attacks on israeli civilians would give a 
lastminute boost to rightwing parties that advocate tougher 
policies in dealing with the nearly 11month palestinian uprising in 
the occupied territories 
as a security precaution israeli troops confined 250000 refugee 
camp residents to their homes in the west bank and gaza and banned 
arabs from travelling to or from israel for 48 hours 
at least 300 arabs and 10 jews have been killed in the 
palestinian uprising which began dec 8 
in jerusalem witnesses said gasolinefilled bottles set fire to 
a car covered with campaign stickers that was being used to carry 
likud supporters to the polls 
the driver lost control smashed into a parked car and careened 
across the road the vehicle was in flames within seconds victims 
said 
a man rushed close from a side alley and threw the firebomb 
from a very short distance passenger avi assis 26 said on 
israel army radio we were screaming because there were only arabs 
around 
an arab passerby who identified himself only as ahmed told the 
associated press the woman emerged from the car her hair in flames 
and residents came out of their houses to help 
she jumped out of the car and her hair was burning people ran 
from their houses to put the fire out he told a reporter 
the woman yocheved farbish 23 was in serious condition at 
jerusalems shaarei zedek hospital hospital officials said assis 
and his friend uzi kazdan 26 the driver of the car suffered light 
facial burns 
police said about 30 arabs were detained for questioning and 
said they suspected palestinians were behind the attack 
on sunday a 27yearold school teacher and her three sons aged 
9 months to 3 years burned to death when palestinians hurled 
firebombs at a civilian bus outside jericho 
beefed up army patrols guarded main roads in the gaza strip and 
west bank today to assure safe travel to polling places for jewish 
settlers arab reporters said 
in other developments a military spokesman confirmed that 
soldiers on reserve duty in the west bank stripped and beat 
palestinian prisoners several weeks ago one was accused of using a 
dog to scare the prisoners 
the spokesman who confirmed a report published in a weekly 
jerusalem paper said a battalion commander his deputy and a 
sergeant would be summoned to a disciplinary hearing he said the 
deputy commander will be transferred from his post 
the names of those being disciplined were not released 
in jericho 18 miles east of jerusalem the army on monday 
dynamited three houses and demolished four other homes belonging to 
suspects in firebomb attacks 
israeli politicians had called for vengeance for the firebombing 
sunday that killed rachel weiss 27 and her three children and 
israel television broadcast footage of the explosions on its nightly 
newscast monday 
three of the demolished homes belonged to suspects in the attack 
the army said it said the other homes belonged to other firebomb 
assailants captured monday when troops searched the city of 17000 
hundreds of ultraorthodox jews in long black coats attended 
mondays funeral in jerusalem for ms weiss and her children aged 9

president reagan told fellow 
californians today that presidential candidate michael dukakis is 
no harry truman and hes no fdr two presidents the democrat has 
tied himself to in recent days 
in a speech prepared for delivery at california state university 
in fullerton reagan also sought to turn aside dukakis contention 
that im on your side 
george bush is the one and the only one whos on your side 
reagan told the students and thats not negative campaigning 
thats the truth 
dukakis in campaign appearances this week has said im a 
liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and harry truman and 
john kennedy 
reagan who has derided dukakis as a liberal throughout the 
campaign said in his speech dont be fooled folks george 
bushs opponent is no harry truman and hes no fdr 
in a speech prepared for a later stop at the national orange show 
stadium in san bernardino reagan continued his onslaught on the 
democratic record saying weve been slashing tax rates and 
liberating the american economy from the confiscation of the malaise 
years 
we cleared away the wrecks the liberals left behind waved the 
green flag fired the starter pistol and watched you go to the 
races he said in his speech at the agricultural trade center 60 
miles east of los angeles 
in his gymnasium speech at cal state fullerton a commuter 
university with more than 22000 students reagan warned against 
complacency and said this election campaign is not over and the 
only poll that means a thing is the one on election day thats why 
its so important for you to vote 
the two speeches were reagans final pitch to fellow 
californians whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to either 
candidates hopes 
the president will also campaign in the battleground state of 
ohio appearing at baldwinwallace college in berea on wednesday 
ohio has 23 electoral votes and like california is a hotly 
contested prize in bushs white house battle with dukakis 
reagan is also putting his prestige on the line on behalf of 
republican senatorial candidates in nevada and wisconsin 
from california he was flying to reno nev for a rally in 
support of firstterm gop sen chic hecht facing a stiff battle 
with popular democratic gov richard h bryan 
hecht a quiet sometimes inarticulate former banker and clothing 
store owner was elected in 1982 after reagan came into the state 
for two appearances in october 
he jumped me up 8 or 10 points and i stayed there and won 
hecht said in a 1986 interview 
in 1986 however appearances in the state by reagan failed to 
save the faltering senate campaign of then rep jim santini as 
democratic sen harry reid won election 
national republican senatorial committee records show that reagan 
campaigned for gop candidates for the senate in 17 states in 1986 
only six of them were elected as democrats regained the control 
they had lost with reagans election in 1980 
before flying to ohio on wednesday the president goes to 
milwaukee to put in a pitch for the senate campaign of susan 
engeleiter republican leader of the wisconsin state senate 
public opinion polls show mrs engeleiter trailing herbert kohl 
owner of the milwaukee bucks basketball team 
still presidential appearances can help as both hecht and 
former nevada republican sen paul laxalt can testify 
in an interview in 1986 laxalt recalled his 1964 race against 
democratic sen howard cannon who ended up defeating him by a 
narrow margin after a campaign appearance by president lyndon b 
johnson 
we had howard cannon on the run and i think we had the race 
won and the big texan came in with guns blazing into las vegas and 
reno and he literally blew me away laxalt said

a top politicial fundraiser for george bushs 
presidential campaign denounced as rotten today a published 
report suggesting he had tried to use his position to land a 
contract with the government of haiti for his public relations 
company 
frederick m bush who is not related to the vice president said 
his business partner michael govan had written the haitian 
government after bush specifically told govan to forget it 
we got an inquiry from the government of haiti bush said in 
an interview my partner mentioned this to me a long time ago i 
said i dont want anything to do with foreign governments i dont 
want anything to do with haiti and dont respond 
im not interested in doing that kind of work bush said he 
said that bush amp co his sixperson washingtonbased firm does 
public relations work for nonprofit groups 
although the oct 12 letter to haitian president prosper avril 
bore his signature bush said the signature was written by govan 
the overture by bushs firm was disclosed today by the orlando 
fla sentinel which quoted the letter in part 
given the fragile environment in haiti and the ensuing 
presidential election in the united states there exists a window of 
opportunity for us to combine our resources and energies for the 
mutual benefit of our two countries 
bush served as deputy finance chairman for the republican 
nominees primary election campaign and now serves as a financial 
consultant at the republican national committee 
the letter sent by bush amp co offered avril a variety of lobbying 
services and said we are confident that we can effectively work 
in the transitional environment in washington to assist haiti 
an attachment to the twopage letter promoted frederick bushs 
connections with the gop presidential campaign and his former job on 
the white house staff the newspaper said 
bush said he found out about the letter monday evening from a 
reporter and discussed it with govan 
put it this way im very upset he said this is a rotten 
rotten thing to happen it looks bad for me and the bush 
campaign 
he said he was having govan write the haitian government to sever 
the possibility of any future relationship 
george bushs campaign spokesman mark goodin characterized the 
matter today as much ado about nothing 
he said govan had been overzealous in responding to a letter 
from the government of haiti fred bush did not seek out a 
contact with the government of haiti they sought him out his 
partner responded to their request for a proposal but apparently was 
unaware that fred already had made a decision he did not want to do 
business with haiti 
bush said he had withdrawn from active participation in the 
companys affairs because of his fundraising duties for the vice 
president in the past two years starting before the vice president 
became a formal candidate when he raised money for bushs political 
action committee the fund for americas future 
six weeks ago avrils regime ousted the government that had been 
having trouble conducting a peaceful election after a november 1987 
election was canceled because of violence the us government cut 
off 89 million in aid only food and development aid has continued 
through international humanitarian organizations 
us officials while pleased with recent steps taken by avril to 
improve the political climate and rein in haitis military have 
said there is little prospect of restoring full assistance to haiti 
until the next president and a new congress take office in january

lloyd bentsen climbed into the cockpit 
of an f16 fighter jet today as he toured a defense plant and 
described michael dukakis as a liberal who supports a strong 
national defense 
dukakis recently said he was a liberal in the terms of jack 
kennedy and a harry truman and i dont think anyone ever questioned 
their being for a strong national defense said bentsen who 
toured the general dynamics plant here 
the democratic vice presidential nominee said the reagan 
administration was trying to cut f16 purchases by the pentagon 
from 180 a year to 100 while he and dukakis planned to emphasize 
conventional weapons such as the f16 
bentsen rode around the plant in a golf cart with general 
dynamics general manager ca anderson and house speaker jim wright 
dtexas stopping at one point to shake hands in a crowd of several 
hundred employees who greeted him with enthusiasm 
many chanted bentsen bentsen and several employees yelled 
out in objection to george bushs running mate dan quayle calling 
him a draft dodger there were also bush supporters in evidence but 
they did not heckle or disturb the tour of the milelong plant 
which manufactures about 300 jets a year 
bentsen a former world war ii bomber pilot tried the latest 
f16c fighter on for size squeezing into the singleseat cockpit 
for the cameras and lowering the canopy it fits like a 
wetsuit he declared afterward joking to reporters that hed fly 
it to the next campaign stop and meet his entourage there 
taking questions afterward bentsen brushed aside questions as to 
whether dukakis hurt the tickets chances in texas by saying he is a 
liberal 
you know what you have to look at and read is how he stated 
it he talked about it in the terms of harry truman in the terms of 
jack kennedy in the terms of balanced budgets in the terms of 
paying your own way he said 
those are the things hes pushed for bentsen said the 
republican administration talks about fiscal responsiblity and 
hasnt given us a balanced budget yet he said 
according to recent polls the democratic ticket of dukakis and 
bentsen trail in texas which has 29 electoral votes at stake 
on monday night bentsen put aside his defense speech for visits 
to two black baptist churches in fort worth including a stop where 
he was joined by former democratic candidate jesse jackson 
at the first stop bentsen sat on the floor with children at a 
halloween party he and wright gave out candy prizes to winners of a 
costume contest 
jackson joined bentsen at the second stop a rally at the mount 
olive missionary baptist church and was the featured speaker of 
the night 
bentsen who spoke first got a friendly reception when he told 
the crowd to get out and vote dont tell me your vote doesnt 
count it does he said 
reciting the republican record on social issues bentsen 
highlighted bush running mate quayles votes against civil rights 
legislation 
senator quayle has stated that civil rights is not very high on 
his list of priorities he said how do you like the idea of a 
man like that being a heartbeat away from the president 
bentsen also included an attack on the gop proposals earlier in 
the decade to trim back social security spending 
the social security check for some of them thats all they 
have isnt it he said the republican willingness to cut that 
back thats reason enough to vote against them he said 
jackson clearly the favorite of the crowd attacked bushs call 
for a kinder gentler nation as nice words from some 
speechwriter but they dont fit 
he called bushs campaign meanspirited and he had an answer 
to bushs phrase of read my lips 
you watch our hips as we march to the voting booth jackson 
said 
jackson wrapped up his speech by getting the crowd to repeat 
after him dukakis yes bush no bentsen yes quayle no dukakis 
yes justice yes fairness yes keep hope alive

a pioneer in the fight against aids has quit 
the state aids advisory committee in protest over gov george 
deukmejians endorsement of an aidsreporting initiative saying the 
governor doesnt understand the aids crisis 
proposition 102 on ther nov 8 ballot would require mandatory 
reporting to state health officials of positive test results for 
those infected with the aids virus officials also would be required 
to track down an infected persons sexual partners for the past 
decade and inform them they may be at risk 
it is opposed by the california medical association california 
nurses association and the american cancer society opponents say 
the measure would inhibit voluntary testing and the cost would be 
exorbitant 
dr michael s gottlieb who in 1981 first reported cases of what 
is now known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome announced his 
resignation from the state panel monday 
his deukmejians endorsement ignores the collective medical 
wisdom of the national and international experts whose strategies to 
fight this disease are already working gottlieb said at a news 
conference 
i can no longer constructively work within the 
administration he said 
two other committee members also resigned gottlieb said they 
were appointed to the 11member panel by deukmejian 
the republican governor on friday released his stand on 
proposition 102 and 28 other statewide propositions on the nov 8 
ballot 
this does not mean he will be campaigning on proposition 102 
nor use campaign funds nor his own time on it it was merely an 
indication on how he will vote nov 8 said tom beermann a 
spokesman for deukmejian 
beermann said formal resignations had not been received by the 
governors office late monday and the governor had not issued a 
statement

celebrities are working overtime to get their candidates elected 
theyre riding on bus caravans to register voters speaking at 
campaign rallies making tv commercials and attending fundraising 
events 
their support may be crucial to a presidential candidate 
especially in a close election because they can raise the enormous 
sums required to finance a television advertising blitz in the final 
weeks of a campaign 
the star power of bob hope and arnold schwarzenegger at a los 
angeles fundraiser sept 13 helped raise 1 million for the gop 
nominee chevy chase and bette midler were headliners at an oct 16 
event for dukakis in beverly hills calif that reaped 800000 
by tradition hollywood is a liberal town rene henry jr an 
entertainment director for the bush campaign told the los angeles 
times he believes other stars who support bush arent campaigning 
publicly for him because they fear it might jeopardize their careers 
that didnt dissuade frank sinatra helen hayes and cheryl ladd 
from joining heston at the gop convention other celebrities who 
have made postdebate appearances with bush include chuck norris 
telly salavas and bruce johnston and mike love of the beach boys 
at a sept 15 campaign strategy session at tv producer norman

gere michael douglas and the massachusetts governors oscarwinning 
cousin olympia dukakis

george bush likes to invite audiences to read 
his lips but republican conservatives and moderates dont always 
agree on what hes trying to say 
if elected would bush be as conservative a president as his 
recent campaign speeches indicate 
or would he revert to the moderate bush of yore who favored the 
equal rights amendent opposed a constitutional ban on abortions and 
dismissed ronald reagans 1980 proposal for tax cuts as voodoo 
economics 
both sides are keeping their fingers crossed 
basically hes more moderate than his image has been of recent 
years says rep james jeffords rvt a gop moderate i think 
some of the more conservative issues that president reagan has 
brought to the forefront like abortion will be more on the back 
burner with george bush thats what were hoping 
on the other hand david carmen a political consultant who was a 
key adviser to conservative rep jack kemp rny says of bush 
hes actually run to the right of reagan on some issues like 
abortion and socalled family issues i think hell be a 
conservative president 
hes had eight years of experience sitting to the right of the 
throne carmen continued hes really had a change of heart on a 
lot of key issues and is less moderate than he was projected to be 
in 1980 
bush never accused of ideological rigidity was a goldwater 
republican in 1966 when he first ran for congress a rockefeller 
republican in 1980 when he first sought the presidency and a reagan 
republican ever since 
views are mixed on what political stripes he will wear if he wins 
the white house next week and political pundits arent getting all 
that much guidance from the vice presidents oftrepeated advice to 
heed the fractured wisdom of baseball great yogi berra you can 
observe a lot by just watching 
theres plenty evidence for either intepretation said 
william schneider a political analyst for the american enterprise 
institute the moderates think hes one of them good old george 
weve known him for years 
but hes also been running a tough ideological campaign going 
down the line conservative on all the major social issues hitting 
all the hot buttons schneider said and hes been going out of 
his way to please the reaganites including putting dan quayle on 
the ticket 
hes going to have to choose which george bush he is the 
kinder gentler bush or one who says read my lips he cant keep on 
doing this forever 
many bush watchers suggest that if elected his presidency is 
more likely to resemble the middleoftheroad policies of former 
gop presidents nixon and ford than the ideological conservatism of 
reagan or the more liberal wing of the party represented by the late 
nelson rockefeller 
still brent scowcroft who was national security adviser in the 
ford administration and is now a bush consultant on international 
issues says the vice president is likely to be a rockefeller 
republican in foreign policy 
tough hardheaded no illusions more or less powerpolitics 
oriented with somewhat of less ideological content scowcroft 
said in an interview 
bush in campaign speeches has signaled a keen interest in 
negotiating further nuclear arms reduction pacts with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev seems less committed than reagan to going full 
speed ahead with the star wars strategic defense shield and has 
emphasized negotiating cuts in eastwest conventional armies in 
europe 
on domestic issues bush has taken up the conservative banner and 
waved it coming out strongly against gun control and in favor of 
the death penalty urging a ban on abortions talking repeatedly of 
the pledge of allegiance in classrooms and criticizing the american 
civil liberties union 
but at the same time bush has argued for stronger protection of 
the environment has called for an increase in the minimum wage if 
accompanied by a lower minimum for young workers and has proposed 
a tax credit that could be used for day care 
in addition the men bush has surrounded himself with and who 
appear to be in line for key cabinet posts in a bush administration 
tend to be moderates many of them from the east 
they include former pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh now the 
attorney general nicholas brady a former new york investment 
banker who is now the treasury secretary former treasury secretary 
and longtime friend james a baker iii former deputy treasury 
secretary richard darman and harvard economist martin feldstein 
its looking like its going to be an eastern establishment 
administration said richard viguerie a conservative directmail 
specialist 
if baker who practiced a brand of nonideological pragmatism 
both as reagans firstterm chief of staff and as treasury 
secretary were to become secretary of state in a bush presidency 
as is widely assumed that would complicate life even further for 
conservatives viguerie said 
jim baker over the years rejected confrontation with liberals 
it would make a bush administration much more in tune with the nixon 
administration and were concerned about that were apprehensive 
still viguerie echoing sentiments of other republicans of 
various political persuasions says he doesnt want to be a naysayer 
im concerned about being negative at this point i want him to 
have a massive landslide and then the day after the election is 
when conservatives will speak out loud and clear 
rep jim leach riowa a gop moderate says he expects bush to 
be staunchly conservative on budget issues in terms of restraining 
spending but more progressive on domestic matters 
hes made it clear he will give a greater priority to day care 
will be more environmentally sensitive bush doesnt wear 
progressiveness on his sleeve but is very likely to get substantial 
results leach said

the defense department said tuesday it had 
ordered home one of its warships in the persian gulf the first such 
reduction since this summers ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
acknowledging earlier press reports pentagon spokesman fred 
hoffman said the guidedmissile frigate rodney m davis had been 
detached from duty and ordered to sail for its home port of 
yokosuka japan 
the frigate started out of the persian gulf tuesday 
hoffman said 
there have been no attacks against shipping in the gulf since 
the ceasefire began on aug 20 he said this has permitted 
us to assess further the threat 
the cessation of hostilities the lessening of the threat and 
the move to accompanying as distinguished from the tight escort 
procedure has allowed us to reduce our forces by one surface 
combatant but i want to emphasize that the departure of the davis 
in no way reduces our commitment to the region hoffman added 
his reference to the accompanying procedure referred to an 
administration decision earlier this fall to keep usflag tankers 
under loose surveillance whenever they sailed through the gulf but 
to stop providing 24houraday escorts for every convoy 
the davis withdrawal leaves 15 us navy ships inside the 
persian gulf and 10 in the nearby gulf of oman and northern arabian 
sea the pentagon has said it hopes to gradually scale back the gulf 
force to a prewar level of about five ships if the ceasefire stays 
in effect 
the davis arrived in the gulf on sept 9 and was not supposed to 
leave for home until january

prime minister margaret thatcher scourge of 
british labor and iron lady to moscow arrives wednesday in 
poland where she is admired by its communist leaders and its banned 
solidarity trade union movement 
adding to this paradox and increasing the diplomatic challenge of 
the threeday official trip the polish government said monday it 
will close the lenin shipyard birthplace of solidarity because it 
is unprofitable 
at a monument outside the shipyard at gdansk on friday mrs 
thatcher is to lay a wreath with solidarity leader lech walesa an 
event the british insisted on as a precondition of the visit 
her domestic opponents charged that expressions of sympathy to 
walesa would sound hollow from the leader whose record includes 
eliminating thousands of jobs in the british coal and steel 
industries and emasculating britains oncepowerful labor unions 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski in a british television 
interview soon after the closure announcement heaped new praise on 
mrs thatcher for what he called her hardhanded implementation of 
total economic efficiency 
we feel admiration for mrs thatcher for that reason that she 
has pursued such a consistent and aggressive economic policy 
which has brought such results jaruzelski said 
and i would very much like to ask for her counsel the polish 
communist party chief added without apparent irony of his imminent 
talks in warsaw with the conservative party prime minister 
britains most rightwing leader since world war ii 
mrs thatchers aides said she will argue to both sides that 
political and economic reform go together 
said opposition labor party foreign affairs spokesman gerald 
kaufman mrs thatchers visit to poland is an act of hypocrisy 
which the poles will survive and forget 
either way most british analysts saw the shipyard closure 
announcement as giving the thatcher visit more political overtones 
than she bargained for including possible antigovernment 
demonstrations when she is in gdansk on friday 
the times of london said polish prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowskis choice of the shipyard as the first big enterprise to go 
under a program of economic reforms will dull the moral and 
aspirations of people in poland no less surely than the 1981 
declaration of martial law 
he rakowski signaled not only that the government would not 
allow solidarity to interpret mrs thatchers visit as their 
triumph but also that gdansks days as a place of pilgrimage for 
western leaders are numbered the newspaper added in an editorial 
the gdansk trip is the centerpiece of the nonofficial 
engagements in a schedule reflecting both modern eastwest politics 
and memories of world war ii which was began in 1945 when britain 
declared war on germany after adolf hitler invaded poland 
beginning with an official welcome by rakowski in warsaw on 
wednesday evening mrs thatcher 63 has a hectic schedule 
it includes talks with cardinal jozef glemp polands roman 
catholic leader nonsolidarity government opponents or critics 
including academics wreathlaying ceremonies at the tomb of the 
unknown soldier in warsaw and at westerplatte where german forces 
invaded on sept 1 1939 
between several rounds of talks with jaruzelski and rakowski and 
a state banquet mrs thatcher also will visit the grave of a 
prosolidarity priest the rev jerzy popieluszko murdered by four 
secret policemen in 1984 
it is a delicate mix of engagements carefully negotiated by 
british officials before the rakowski announced the fate of the 
lenin shipyard now commented the times mrs thatcher will be 
hard put to avoid being harnessed to polish attempts to crush 
solidarity

israels air force blasted palestinian 
guerrilla bases in lebanon on tuesday two days after a firebomb 
attack in the occupied west bank that killed a jewish teacher and 
her three children 
lebanese police said four people were killed 15 wounded and 
several targets destroyed they said all reported casualties 
resulted from a sixminute raid on the mieh mieh refugee camp at 
sidon 
israeli leaders had vowed revenge for the attack on the israeli 
bus sunday in which five other people were wounded israel 
frequently responds to attacks on its citizens by hitting 
palestinian targets in lebanon 
the raids came as israelis voted in national elections expected 
to influence the fate of palestinians living under military 
occupation 
police said the four dead at mieh mieh on the fringe of the 
ancient port 25 miles south of beirut were three guerrillas and a 
civilian motorist driving in the palestinian refugee camp two women 
and 13 guerrillas were wounded they reported 
spokesmen for the palestine liberation organization gave the 
figures as three dead and 15 wounded both the plo and police said 
they had no casualty reports from the other targets 
six israeli fighterbombers attacked plo bases at mieh mieh and 
positions of syrianbacked guerrillas in hills above the coastal 
town of damour and at aramoun a southern suburb of beirut 
lebanese police said the planes were usbuilt f16s and a plo 
military report made available to the associated press in nicosia 
said they were f15s 
the israeli command confirmed the raids but followed standard 
practice of not revealing the type of aircraft it said pilots 
reported the targets destroyed including ammunition storehouses 
along the coast 
bases of plo chief yasser arafats mainstream fatah guerrilla 
faction in mieh mieh bore the brunt of the attack police reported 
they said the raiders fired eight rockets in four sorties that 
demolished four buildings used as bases by fatah and the plos force 
17 security agency 
flames shot up from from mieh mieh and the nearby hills of ein 
eldilb ambulances and fire engines raced to the scene 
police said four rockets hit positions of prosyrian guerrilla 
factions in the highlands outside aramoun 10 miles south of beirut 
and two rockets struck a camp of three tents in a forest above 
damour midway between beirut and sidon 
they said the tent camp belonged to the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine its guerrillas and allied fighters of walid 
jumblatts druse militia were seen firing at the raiders without 
success 
we heard the planes bombing sidon so we all rushed from the 
base to the woods said one guerrilla who would not give his 
namethats why we suffered no casualties 
israeli jets broke the sound barrier over beirut before and after 
the raids 
tuesdays attack was the fifth inside lebanon in two weeks and 
the 20th this year 
thirtysix people were killed and 76 wounded in four raids on 
strongholds of palestinian and iranianbacked shiite moslem 
guerrillas in south lebanon between oct 21 and oct 26 
those raids responded to a suicide attack in which a shiite 
driver detonated a car bomb oct 19 in an army convoy in israels 
selfdesignated south lebanon security zone killing eight 
soldiers 
by police count 104 people were killed and 184 wounded in the 19 
previous air strikes of 1988

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle voiced irritation tuesday over a sudden schedule change 
imposed by george bushs campaign saying i wish i knew what my 
schedules going to be 
however quayle whose campaign stops were juggled so he wouldnt 
be in south bend ind the same day as bush said it would make 
absolutely no sense for him and bush to appear together 
chatting with reporters outside reynoldsburg high school in 
columbus quayle also showed frustration over his relative lack of 
attention in recent weeks actually ive been trying to create 
news for the last three weeks and im not doing a very good job of 
it he said put me on the air 
quayle and his aides had been asked by reporters tuesday morning 
why he had canceled a scheduled trip to south bend in his native 
indiana later in the day 
he noted bushs appearance at the university of notre dame and 
said it makes absolutely no sense for the two of us to campaign 
together because theyre the democratic ticket not going to win 
the election 
its not good strategy im telling you he said 
but the republican senator also said i wish i knew what my 
schedules going to be it keeps changing all the time 
he said hed told an aide to call bush headquarters in washington 
at days end monday to send the message back that yesterday 
was a great day and we hope to have more of them 
when asked if he was intentionally conducting a playitsafe 
campaign in the waning days quayle replied theyre not afraid of 
putting the two of us bush and quayle together 
weve got plenty of time to be together he added but 
theres no reason for us to show up i keep saying that marilyn 
quayles wife and i dont even campaign together 
quayle was traveling to indiana later tuesday but not to south 
bend he scheduled a steel plant tour in jeffersonville just across 
the border from kentucky and was to go to memphis tenn in the 
evening 
a rough outline of quayles schedule for the balance of the week 
showed him traveling to owensboro ky st louis stillwater 
okla monroe la and greensboro nc 
quayle said that while he feels hes been an asset to the gop 
ticket george bush doesnt need my help 
he suggested that democratic nominee michael dukakis picked sen 
lloyd bentsen as his running mate in an attempt to carry texas on 
nov 8 
if you think that you have to have a vice president to prop up 
the top of your ticket youre in trouble he said and thats 
what theyre trying to do to have their vice presidential nominee 
prop up the top of their ticket 
quayle said he has been focusing on the midwest this week because 
bush wants me to get out with the voters get good regional 
coverage and ive been trying to make news 
on another subject he said theres a difference of opinion 
within the american jewish community about the bushquayle ticket 
and the impact a bush administration would have on israel 
but quayle said that president reagan has been israels best 
friend over the years and im sure george bush will as well 
he described himself as very strong proisraeli and said that 
he had been there to encourage israel to join the united states in a 
project to develop a missile defense system

the governor took the bus to work and the mayor 
greeted commuters at a bus station tuesday as denver launched its 
fifth better air campaign to combat carbon monoxide pollution 
produced by cars and wood stoves 
last year the campaign included for the first an oxygenated fuels 
program for vehicles and denver dropped from first to seventh place 
on the environmental protection agencys list of worst cities for 
carbon monoxide pollution this year the goals have been raised 
carbon monoxide levels in the milehigh city are highest during 
the winter when cold air traps the pollution and internal 
combustion engines work less efficiently in the high thin air and 
emit dirtier exhaust 
the better air campaign encourages commuters in the sixcounty 
metro area to leave their cars at home at least one day a week and 
on highpollution days until the end of january 
it also calls for woodburning bans on highpollution days some 
communities have mandatory bans and others appeal for voluntary 
cutbacks 
the air pollution control division of the state health department 
announces highpollution days and expects about 20 of them in the 
threemonth period of the better air campaign 
under the mandated highoxygen fuels program service stations 
along the front range will sell only cleanerburning fuels blended 
with grain alcohol or a compound called mtbe based on ether until 
the end of february 
this year the better air campaign hopes to reduce traffic by 10 
percent and woodburning by 8 percent on highpollution days last 
year it surpassed its goals by reducing traffic 9 percent or 3 
million miles a day and woodburning 7 percent 
the oxyfuels program last year cut carbon monoxide emissions up 
to 95 percent and this years goal is 12 percent 
last year we saw for the first time that people in the area 
have internalized the need to reduce driving as an air quality 
measure and in fact they were doing that across the board not 
necessarily when we asked them to do it said campaign coordinator 
anne grady 
as a result we feel very optimistic 
gov roy romer rode the one mile from the governors mansion to 
the capitol by bus 
he wanted to show its important for people to do what they can 
to say to folks its important it makes a difference said the 
governors press secretary cindy parmenter who also took the bus 
to work 
mayor federico pena observed the start of the campaign by 
greeting commuters at a downtown bus station 
grady said the average car emits one pound of carbon monoxide 
every 11 miles the average woodburning stove emits one pound of 
carbon monoxide for each hour it burns 
she said she expects this years oxygenated fuels program to 
reduce carbon monoxide emissions significantly from last year 
because the oxygen content in the blended fuels has been raised from 
15 percent to 2 percent the drive also has been extended by a 
month 
and whereas last year mtbe was the more commonly used oxyfuel 
the even cleanerburning ethanol is expected to be used more this 
year she said

the epsteinbarr virus that causes 
mononucleosis also may trigger a rare form of anemia that can lead 
to death scientists reported tuesday 
the dna or genetic code of the epsteinbarr virus has been 
found in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia 
researchers report in this weeks philadelphiabased annals of 
internal medicine 
in patients with that disease usually young adults the bone 
marrow quits functioning and fails to produce enough red blood cells 
to carry oxygen through the body 
while unlikely to be a common cause of bone marrow failure among 
those who lack a history of infectious mononucleosis epsteinbarr 
virus or ebv must be considered as a possible cause of aplastic 
anemia the authors wrote 
according to the lead researcher dr bruce baranski a 
hematologist at the university wisconsin at madison aplastic anemia 
afflicts about 200 people a year in this country usually a few 
months after a bout of mononucleosis 
treatment requires drugs and not all patients survive 
the authors said the research suggests three possible mechanisms 
for how epsteinbarr infects the bone marrow 
the virus could directly attack and kill bone marrow cells 
it could cause the immune system to turn against the bone 
marrow shutting down the production of blood cells 
other viruses may aid epsteinbarr in causing the anemia as 
occurs in patients with aids a disease involving a compromised 
immune system 
james jones a pediatric immunologist at the national jewish 
center for immunology and respiratory medicine in denver said the 
new research takes you one step closer to understanding the 
causes of aplastic anemia 
he said the research eventually could lead to a form of therapy 
directed toward the virus or a treatment aimed at suppressing an 
immune system that has turned against itself it could be that 
aplastic anemia is secondary to an overzealous immunosuppressive 
system he said 
the researchers began their study in late 1985 after treating a 
patient who had severe aplastic anemia following a bout of 
mononucleosis based on prior research they suspected epsteinbarr 
might play a role in the anemia and found traces of the viruss dna 
only in the patients bone marrow 
according to yale epidemiologist james niederman who discovered 
that epsteinbarr causes mononucleosis in 1968 almost all adults 
have been infected with it at some time 
niederman said the report published tuesday confirmed 
researchers suspicions that epsteinbarr might play a role in 
triggering aplastic anemia 
researchers also have linked epsteinbarr to chronic fatigue 
syndrome the socalled yuppie flu but the association between 
the virus and the syndrome remains unclear 
baranski said the researchers studied five patients treated for 
aplastic anemia at the national institutes of health clinical center 
and one at massachusetts general hospital in boston 
all had traces of the virus in their bone marrow and several had 
experienced mononucleosis he said 
the researchers also reviewed the cases of 40 prior patients with 
aplastic anemia and other blood diseases and found traces of the 
virus baranski said

the government said tuesday that its chief 
economic forecasting gauge dipped 01 percent in september the 
third decline in the past five months 
private economists said the commerce departments index of 
leading indicators was signaling slower growth but probably no 
recession next year 
the 01 percent september decline followed drops of 07 percent 
in both may and july often three consecutive monthly declines have 
been the signal of an impending recession 
but the latest declines have been interspersed with large monthly 
gains including a revised 05 percent increase in august and a 
sizable 15 percent advance in june the biggest gain since late 
1986 
after smoothing out the big monthtomonth swings analysts said 
the leading index was indicating a slowing of the robust economic 
growth of the past year 
there is absolutely no question that the economy is slowing 
down said lawrence chimerine chief economist of the wefa group 
an economic consulting firm the only question is whether this 
slowdown will lead into a recession 
chimerine said he believed a recession can be avoided over the 
next 12 months to 18 months although he said this forecast could 
prove too optimistic if consumer spending slows more than expected 
or if the dollar comes under further sharp pressure from foreigners 
worried about the ability of the next administration to deal with 
budget and trade deficits 
if foreigners suddenly decide they no longer want to buy us 
debt that would force us interest rates higher and could push the 
country into a downturn he said 
the recovery from the 198182 recession completes a peacetime 
record of six years this month and the reagan administration is 
hoping this performance will persuade voters to keep the white house 
in republican hands 
while many economists once believed that the new president would 
face a recession in his first year in office most are now 
predicting the downturn will not occur until 1990 at the earliest 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
is expected to expand at a robust 38 percent annual rate for all of 
1988 the fastest pace since the last presidential election in 1984 
however david wyss an economist with data resources inc 
predicted that growth next year would dip to around 23 percent he 
said that forecast was in line with the signals from the leading 
index 
we are looking for an economy that is slowing but not 
stopping he said 
many analysts believe that a boom in us exports which has 
accounted for fully half of the growth this year and business 
investment spending another key sector will both level off in 1989 
1989 is beginning to look pretty poor said michael evans 
head of a washington forecasting firm the export boom is clearly 
gone capital spending has tailed off and consumers havent been too 
eager to spend either that is basically the whole economy 
in a second report tuesday the commerce department said 
construction spending rose 06 percent in september to an annual 
rate of 4034 billion as strength in housing and government 
construction offset a decline in office building 
construction spending for the first nine months of the year is 
just 07 percent higher than a year ago a sluggish performance 
which analysts expect will continue because of widespread 
overbuilding of offices and other commercial space 
the leading index by focusing on forwardpointing business 
statistics is designed to foretell economic activity six months to 
nine months into the future 
for september four of the available nine indicators flashed 
signs of a slowdown the biggest negative factor was a drop in plant 
and equipment orders which primarily reflected a drop in aircraft 
orders during the month 
other negative forces were a fall in building permits a decline 
in raw materials prices and slower growth in the money supply 
falling prices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand 
five available indicators made positive contributions the 
biggest boost came from an increase in the average work week other 
positive factors were a fall in initial unemployment claims a rise 
in stock prices a slowdown in filling orders and a rise in orders 
for consumer goods 
the various changes left the index at 1933 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
top policymakers at the federal reserve met behind closed doors 
tuesday to map monetary strategy for the next two months analysts 
said they expected no dramatic moves to boost interest rates 
primarily because the signs of economic slowdown had eased fears 
that inflation was getting out of control

a man charged with starting a fire that 
destroyed a black church just as it was about to reopen after an 
earlier arson believed he was destroying a devilworship church 
and was not motivated by racism authorities said today 
james russell calvin 19 was arrested monday and charged with one 
count of arson he was being held in the madison county jail on 
100000 bond sheriff bob churchich said at a news conference 
the new bethel ame church of rock fork in godfrey has been hit 
by fire twice in six months raising fears among its members that 
the crimes were rooted in racism 
the more recent fire occurred oct 18 less than a month before 
the rebuilt church was to be rededicated and left just one wall 
standing 
after calvins arrest was announced the churchs pastor the 
rev steven jackson said worshipers could breathe a little 
easier 
were elated its hallelujah time jackson said monday 
noting that the church was founded for religious freedom he 
said we ought to be able to worship in peace in 1988 
calvin is white but churchich said racism was not a factor in 
the second blaze there was no evidence that calvin was involved in 
the april blaze he said 
the night before the earlymorning blaze calvin was with friends 
and one of his buddies told him the church was part of a 
devilworship church the sheriff said 
the church founded in 1863 by blacks who had fled slavery is 
located at the end of a gravel road in a remote wooded area near a 
mostly white neighborhood in godfrey population 1000 
last year racial epithets were carved in the walls and swastikas 
were spraypainted on the church three men await trial in that 
incident 
elsewhere in southern illinois four cross burnings have been 
reported since july on property owned by black families in 
predominantly white neighborhoods in belleville and fairview heights 
authorities say they do not believe the crimes are the work of a 
single group

a year of stunning upsets has catapulted a 
12yearold hungarian girl past fellow prodigies and could herald 
the end of male domination of chess 
at the end of november judit polgar will become the youngest 
player ever to gain the title of international master which 
bobby fischer of the united states and garri kasparov of the soviet 
union didnt achieve until they against leading male grandmasters 
men and women still play for separate world titles in chess and 
have segregated ranking lists 
the current womens champion soviet grandmaster maya 
chiburdanitse 27 ranks 79th in the world 
in august judit became the world champion in the under12 
division after refusing to compete in a separate competition for 
girls romanian organizers presented her with a trophy for the 
world under12 boys championship 
these other girls are not serious about chess judit said 
polishing off a banana split during an interview in a london cafe 
after winning the duncan lawrie mixed chess challenge this week she 
defeated two grandmasters 
i practice five or six hours a day but they get distracted by 
cooking and work around the house said the selfconfident youth

the united states today charged the soviet 
union with posing a threat to pakistan by sending ss1 scud missiles 
to afghanistan 
the accusation was coupled with a veiled warning that the united 
states isd determined to protect pakistan 
the soviet union knows the government of pakistan enjoys our 
support charles e redman the state department spokesman said 
the missiles were displayed in kabul the capital of afghanistan 
after undersecretary of state michael h armacost complained on 
monday to soviet ambasador yuri v dubinin about other arms 
shipments to the afgahn government redman said 
the us official said pakistan was within range of the missiles 
he gave no count of the scuds now in the hands of the promoscow 
government redman said dubinin promised to inform moscow about us 
concerns 
the united states has reserved the right to provide guerrillas 
fighting the afghan government with equal firepower redman declined 
to say whether that step would be taken 
he again registered grave concern over soviet arms shipments 
that he said were designed to bolster afghan forces against a rebel 
offensive in the kandahar region in the southeast 
on monday redman said the soviet union had used newly introduced 
mig27 groundattack planes against advancing resistance fighters 
violating a commitment to use its weapons only to defend soviet 
troops 
he said the united states views this augmentation of soviet 
firepower in afghanistan with grave concern 
such actions are inconsistent with soviet undertakings not to 
conduct offensive operations except in defense of their own 
forces redman said we intend to take this matter up with 
soviet officials at the earliest possible opportunity 
responding to a question at the departments daily news briefing 
redman said moscow has indicated all soviet troops have been 
withdrawn from southern afghanistan 
but he said officials of the afghan resistance alliance report 
that the soviets have flown about 30 mig27 combat aircraft into 
shindand air base in western afghanistan 
we believe this estimate to be accurate he said 
he said the mig27s a class of aircraft never before used in 
afghanistan arrived during the third week of october us 
officials believe the mig27 in operation since the late 1970s has 
become the mainstay of the soviet ground attack fighter force it is 
equipped both with bombs and an array of guns 
diplomats in afghanistan report that the mig27s based at 
shindand are being used in an effort to stem the mujahedeen 
resistance advance on kandahar in southern afghanistan redman 
said 
the spokesman said the united states also is concerned about 
the use of soviet aircraft based in the soviet union including 
backfire bombers to bomb targets in afghanistan in the kandahar 
area 
he said the attacks began over the past weekend but that he had 
no way of judging their effectiveness or of estimating casualties 
redman said that although there has been a lull in the withdrawal 
rate of soviet forces since midsummer we still see no reason why 
the soviets wont meet their obligation of february 15th for all 
of them being out

the government tuesday 
suspended a leading antiapartheid newspaper as a threat to public 
safety in a move one of its editors said was an example of the 
arbitrary rule stifling south africa 
the fourweek bank against the weekly mail is the third time this 
year that information minister stoffel botha has suspended an 
antigovernment newspaper the other two papers since have resumed 
publication 
one can endlessly guess and speculate as to what his reasons 
are but were really dealing with arbitrary rule one mans whim 
where he made up his mind all on his own said anton harber 
coeditor of the weekly mail 
courts have upheld bothas contention that national emergency 
regulations do not require him to give specific reasons for his 
actions in controlling and restricting the news media 
botha has sent several warning letters to the newspaper in recent 
months saying it contained subversive propaganda 
in a statement tuesday botha said the weekly mail continued 
with a systematic or repetitive publishing of matter which in my 
opinion has the effect of causing a threat to the safety of the 
public or to the maintenance of public order or is causing a delay 
in the termination of the state of emergency 
harber said were planning for a strong return on dec 2 
the papers editors and lawyers were meeting tuesday night to 
decide whether they can challenge the suspension in court 
in the meantime he said were going to be looking at other 
kinds of publishing work to keep things around here running were 
not going to be silenced 
since it was established in 1985 the newspaper has been a 
combative government opponent with a reputation for excellent 
writing aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary 
last friday the paper said bothas complaints focused on its 
coverage of security force actions and reports about outlawed 
organizations like the african national congress guerrilla movement 
labor human rights and political organizations condemned bothas 
action 
the state has not been able to silence the weekly mail through 
the courts simply because it realized the newspaper was not breaking 
the law instead mr botha has taken an arbitrary and reprehensible 
decision to close the newspaper for a month said the south 
african society of journalists 
the foreign correspondents association of southern africa 
protested the move against a publication that is professionally 
respected and which undertakes its reporting in a responsible and 
lawful manner its absence from the local scene will mean the public 
will be denied a source of news and information that is extremely 
important to the national debate 
the us embassy said it deplored the decision 
it is the embassys conviction that the press plays an 
essential role in any democratic society and that press freedom 
inconveniernt as it may be on occasion for governments is 
nevertheless inseparable from democracy itself it said in a 
statement

prime minister yitzhak shamir used just three 
words to sum up his thoughts when asked why he was convinced 
palestinians eventually will give up their struggle against israeli 
rule we will win 
shamir is a forceful man but not a wordy one silence is a habit 
from his many years as an underground leader fighting to create the 
state of israel and later as an israeli secret agent 
aides say that his past surfaces in shamirs penchant for secrecy 
and distrust but once he trusts he is a loyalist he built his 
political career on a tenacious faithfulness to the rightwing likud 
bloc 
he is a believer in an israel extending to the jordan river and 
derides his rival labor party leader shimon peres for willingness 
to negotiate away part of the occupied west bank and gaza strip in 
exchange for peace 
there is no chance whatsoever that we would consider 
relinquishing control of judea and samaria he tells jewish 
gatherings using the biblical words for the west bank 
in one such talk he suggested 9 million jews should live in 
israel where the jewish population is now 36 million he insists 
there will never be a palestinian state 
the stocky 5foot4 shamir has tried to soften his image during 
the campaign under careful coaching by aides the scowl beneath the 
bushy eyebrows is often a smile 
still critics complain that the smiles dont fit the words 
shamir 73 was born yitzhak ysernitzky in poland inspired by 
zionism he came to palestine in 1935 and changed his name to 
shamir hebrew for thistle he was quickly was drawn into the 
clandestine movement to drive out the british and establish israel 
shamir first joined the movement of menachem begin who became 
his political mentor but when the movement split shamir sided with 
the more militant fighters for israels freedom known as the stern 
gang to the british and the lehi to israelis from its hebrew 
acronym 
when lehi founder avraham stern was killed sharmir became one of 
the leaders of the group the most ruthless of the israeli 
underground cells 
the group carried out the slaying of lord moyne britains 
mideast resident minister in 1944 in cairo and was later blamed for 
the 1948 slaying of swedish un mediator count folke bernadotte 
who opposed including jerusalem in the state of israel 
a recent report claimed shamir was present when the killing was 
planned when asked about this he replied i dont think i have 
to say anything about such questions im not talking about the 
past about what happened 40 years ago 
after israels founding shamir spent several unhappy years 
in business from 1955 to 1965 he worked for the mossad israels 
secret service living in paris and traveling widely 
he says little about that period of his life i changed names 
passports and identities he said in one interview in various 
places i would go armed 
shamir was recruited into rightwing politics by begin who 
became prime minister in 1977 begins loyalty to his old 
underground colleague raised shamir to speaker of paliament foreign 
minister then prime minister when begin retired in 1983 
when the 1984 election was inconclusive shamir entered a 
coalition government with peres serving as foreign minister in 
1986 in accord with the coalition agreement they switched jobs and 
shamir became prime minister 
shamir opposed begins triumph the camp david accords that led 
to peace with egypt in 1979 he said then he did not believe the 
egyptians were sincere about peace ten years later he says much 
the same thing about the plos moves to disown it terrorist past 
now he says peace can only come through the ussponsored 
accords he once opposed they call for limited autonomy for 
palestinians with their final status to be negotiated later 
shamir recently told reporters the palestinians uprising against 
israeli rule was useless because israel would never cave in to 
pressure 
we will win he said if it takes time we are a patient 
people notwithstanding the time it takes we will win

guards used highpressure water hoses today to 
break down barricades put up by prisoners demanding better treatment 
for homosexual inmates at the oregon state correctional institution 
the 19 prisoners were placed in segregation units after the 
uprising ended this morning prison spokesman robey eldridge said 
no one was injured he said 
we used water hoses to force inmates away from the barricades 
against the wall eldridge said at that point we were able to 
enter through the doors and take charge of the situation he said 
it took about 20 minutes of sustained water pressure to get the 
prisoners to back away from the barricades 
the prison located just east of here was designed to house 476 
inmates but had a record 1065 prisoners today 
a specially trained group of eight prison guards was assisted by 
about 40 other guards in quieting the disturbance eldridge said 
except for the water no force was used he said 
the prisoners had presented a list of seven demands including 
more equality and betterpaying jobs for homosexual prisoners 
the barricades were erected in unit 2 a dayroom that had been 
converted into a dormitory eldridge said a guard on patrol outside 
the dormitory noticed about 230 am that a light inside the unit 
had been broken 
nothing was done about the light eldridge said but at 518 
am a note was slipped under the door to the guards saying 
there are people in here who want no part in this but we have no 
choice but to keep quiet and just stay uninvolved 
guards investigated further and found that the inmates had used 
bunk beds to barricade the door and would not let anyone inside 
eldridge said 
about 630 am the special guard unit began using the 
highpressure hoses to force the prisoners away from the barricades 
and into corners of the dormitory 
the meaning of some of the demands was unclear eldridge said 
but at any rate prison officials had no intention of meeting them 
he said complaints are considered only when prisoners go through 
proper channels 
there had been no prior allegations of discrimination against 
homosexuals at the prison he said adding that the fact that 
someone wrote a note mentioning the subject doesnt such complaints 
are widespread 
im not saying this is a homosexual disturbance eldridge 
said 
he said there are about 60 openly declared homosexual inmates in 
the institution

construction spending climbed 06 percent in 
september as strength in housing and a rebound in government 
building offset weakness in nonresidential construction the 
commerce department reported tuesday 
spending for new construction rose to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4034 billion in september following a 02 percent 
decline in august construction spending had risen 15 percent in 
july 
even with the latest increase construction activity has been 
sluggish this year the september level of activity is actually 05 
percent below the level of a year ago 
weaknesses in apartment office and shopping center construction 
have depressed building activity although this has been offset 
somewhat by continued demand for singlefamily homes analysts said 
they expect this pattern to continue through next year 
i think nonresidential construction will soften further 
said david wyss an economist with data resources inc we still 
believe that commercial and office buildings are overbuilt and there 
wont be a lot of oil drilling activity with oil prices as low as 
they are 
for september residential construction rose 07 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 1953 billion that reflected a 1 percent 
increase in construction of singlefamily homes and a 09 percent 
rise in construction of multifamily units even with the latest 
increase multifamily construction is 91 percent below the level of 
a year ago 
nonresidential construction fell by 05 percent during the 
month dropping to an annual rate of 917 billion factory 
construction was up 08 percent in september but is still 15 percent 
below the level of a year ago 
office construction dropped by 28 percent in september and the 
building activity for hotels and shopping centers remained unchanged 
from august 
government construction climbed 18 percent to an annual rate of 
782 billion reflecting a rebound following a 32 percent drop in 
august the increase came from higher spending for schools housing 
redevelopment and sewers 
highway spending the largest government category was unchanged 
in september at 236 billion 22 percent higher than a year ago

foreign minister shimon peres is an ironic 
figure in israeli politics he wins popularity polls but often is 
booed and heckled when he takes to the campaign trail 
peres 65 head of the leftleaning labor party is an 
intellectual a writer whose honed speeches impress israels 
middleclass many of whom share his european background 
but his literary allusions and plays on words are sometimes seen 
as pretentious or even dishonest by sephardis the working class 
jews of north african and middle eastern origin who make up most of 
israels voters 
aides cringed at a recent rally in a working class area when 
peres referred to the artist marc chagall to argue against a plan by 
the rival likud bloc that would give palestinians autonomy without 
sovereignty 
they say autonomy for people but not territory as if people 
are suspended in air like in a chagall painting he said 
in the campaign for parliamentary elections peres has been the 
target of stoning and heckling in towns populated by sephardis 
backers of the rightwing likud headed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
peres has consistently outscored shamir in personal popularity 
polls but voter surveys showed labor and likud extremely close on 
election day 
the labor leader based his campaign on trying to draw jordan into 
a dialogue within an international peace conference to negotiate 
peace in exchange for giving up parts of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
but he faces audiences worried about security and about the 
palestinian uprising detractors also say peres backing for the 
international conference which he once opposed shows he shifts 
policies to suit his needs 
peres is trying to regain the position he reached in 1985 when as 
prime minister in a coalition government he ended israels 
threeyear occupation of lebanon and curbed tripledigit inflation 
he turned the prime ministers job over to shamir in 1986 under a 
powersharing agreement worked out when neither labor nor likud 
gained enough votes in the 1984 election to form a government 
peres began serving israel as an agent buying arms for the 
countrys fight for independence in the 1940s he gained stature 
among israelis when as defense minister in 1976 he was an 
architect of the raid to rescue israeli hostages from entebbe 
born in vishneva poland peres immigrated with his family to 
palestine when he was 10 he hebraicized his name from persky 
joined a zionist youth movement and tasted life on a kibbutz or 
communal farm he married sonya gelman in 1945 
he began his political career as a motorcycle messenger for 
israels first prime minister david bengurion later as 
bengurions deputy defense minister peres was the founder of 
israels arms and aircraft industries 
from bengurion peres learned the art of political compromise 
and pragmatism which are his trademarks along with hard work he 
often works from dawn to midnight at what one aide called a 
murderous pace 
peres practical approach is illustrated by his support for an 
arabbacked plan for an international conference to resolve the 
middle east conflict he opposed the plan when he was prime 
minister fearing a wide forum of nations would try to impose a 
settlement on israel 
but he changed his mind when he concluded that jordan would come 
to the peace table only under the umbrella of an international 
conference 
the turnabout has been widely mocked by peres rivals but his 
allies defend it as an example of flexibility that could lead israel 
to a peace treaty with an arab neighbor 
peres has written four books and studied for a time at harvard 
university in the united states he once said that as a youth he 
thought of becoming a poet 
poets are truly wise men for they see the end and are afraid 
he said politicians see a series of happenings for if a 
politician could see how things end he would stop struggling and 
quit the arena

hunters bagged 2979 alligators and only reported 
two minor injuries during floridas first widespread gator hunt in 
26 years 
they did better than we thought a fact probably attributed to 
the number of experienced trappers who were enlisted to help said 
mike jennings a wildlife biologist for the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission in gainesville 
officials were pleased at the number of gators taken and the 
safety record among the 230 hunters issued permits for the hunt 
which lasted throughout september 
only two minor injuries were reported one man shot off his 
finger with a bang stick on lake george and another was bitten 
on the arm according to a preliminary report on the hunt 
commission officials had predicted the hunters would kill 2600 
alligators or about 75 percent of the 3450 limit the hunt was 
called to promote interest in state wetlands and to trim the 
alligator population which has doubled since antipoaching measures 
were adopted in 1970 
jennings said regulations governing next years hunt may be 
altered following a study on the 28 areas in this years harvest 
the hunt will bring the total alligators killed this year to 
about 8000 said john white a wildlife biologist with the 
commission 
nuisance trappers who kill alligators that threaten people 
destroy about 5000 animals a year in florida where the animals 
population is estimated at 1 million 
louisiana has harvested more than 20000 alligators every year 
since 1971 in texas where hunts resumed in 1984 about 1500 
gators are taken annually 
despite the lure of profits for the gators which can bring up to 
1000 per foot in meat and hide the riches came mostly in form of 
memories 
this was more for the experience than anything it was a great 
way to see the real florida said james gelardi whose 13foot4 
770pound gator was the biggest caught during the hunt 
i think the game commission did a great job said jimmy 
douglas a sumter county nuisance trapper who took his 15gator 
limit in 2 nights 
but this is the first year when everybody was real cautious 
as time goes on people are going to get more careless he said 
i hear people saying already that getting a gator aint nothing 
well ive seen a gator crush my fiberglass boat like it was paper 
all i can say is be careful

about 200 victims of the 1984 bhopal gas 
disaster marched to the us embassy tuesday urging president 
reagan to intervene in the legal battle with union carbide corp 
over disaster relief 
the rally came as the supreme court began hearing appeals on the 
award of 192 million in interim relief to the victims of the 
disaster that killed more than 3100 people 
the marchers mostly women presented a memorandum to embassy 
officials that urged reagan to seriously ponder over the issue and 
stand by the side of great human sufferings by upholding the values 
established by george washington and abraham lincoln 
the marchers said they were yet to get relief after the dec 3 
1984 disaster 
at least 20000 people were injured when toxic gas leaked from a 
pesticide plant owned by the indian subsidiary of union carbide in 
the central city of bhopal 
a fivejudge panel headed by chief justice rs pathak heard 
lawyers tuesday for the danbury connbased company begin 
preliminary arguments against the award 
in 1986 the indian government filed a 3 billion civil suit 
against union carbide claiming the leak was caused by negligence 
union carbide says it was sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
a district court hearing the suit last year ordered union carbide 
to pay 269 million to the victims of the disaster as interim 
relief the us company appealed to the high court of madhya 
pradesh state which lowered the payment to 192 million 
the supreme court now is hearing appeals by union carbide against 
the payment and by the indian government against the lowering of the 
amount 
arguments in the case are likely to continue for another three 
weeks according to union carbide lawyer jb dadachanji

the united states signed a supplemental treaty 
tuesday aimed at limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides air 
pollutants that help cause acid rain and smog the environmental 
protection agency said 
administrator lee m thomas signed the protocol to the existing 
treaty on longrange transboundary air pollution in sofia bulgaria 
according to an agency announcement 
the united states earlier declined to sign a similar protocol 
dealing with sulfur dioxide requiring a 30 percent reduction in 
emissions on the ground that us sulfur dioxide emissions had been 
reduced substantially under the 1970 clean air act 
such a requirement would have been unfair when similar 
percentage reductions by european countries would be made from 
almost uncontrolled sources the united states argued 
during negotiations on the nitrogen oxides agreement the united 
states sought a 20 percent credit for reductions already made that 
other countries had not yet undertaken 
as a compromise the agreement requires participating nations to 
limit emissions in the 1990s but permits each to choose as its 
ceiling the emission level of any year through 1987 
in addition the annual average from 1987 through 1996 may not 
exceed the average for 1987 
epas latest estimate is that us motor vehicles power plants 
and industrial boilers produced 213 million tons of nitrogen oxides 
in 1986 the peak year which presumably the united states could use 
as its base year when the freeze takes effect was 1978 when epa 
estimates emissions at 224 million tons 
fortyfour percent comes from motor vehicles and other 
transportation sources and just under half from industrial and 
powerplant boilers 
nitrogen oxides are produced by all combustion particularly at 
high temperatures though new cars today emit only a quarter of what 
cars without pollution controls emitted in the 1960s travel has 
increased so much that emissions have declined only slightly from 
the peak and epa expects the total to turn up again about 1995 
reaching 22 million tons in the year 2000 
participating nations are obliged to apply best available 
technologies that are economically feasible and to control 
existing sources taking into account such factors as plant age and 
rate of utilization and the need to avoid undue operational 
disruption 
the united states already has done that and thus no additional 
regulatory actions are required epa said 
major us industries did not oppose us adherence to the 
agreement after epa pointed out its judgment that no new regulations 
would be needed 
nitrogen oxides in high concentrations can damage the lungs one 
of these compounds provides the visible brown component of urban 
smog 
transported long distances when emitted high in the air as from 
a tall smokestack nitrogen oxides become nitric acid and falls in 
acid rain 
nitrogen oxides are essential in producing the chemical reactions 
that make ozone the major component of smog and recent research 
has shown that even tiny amounts in forests may prompt the formation 
of ozone from hydrocarbons emitted by the trees themselves 
in fighting urban smog epa has chosen to stress reductions in 
hydrocarbons from fuels and solvents rather than nitrogen oxide 
reductions in certain circumstances reductions in nitrogen oxides 
can increase ozone in the city before ozone concentrations start 
going down

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
met tuesday with a us state department official who said 
washington believes the prince should lead any new cambodian 
government emerging from peace talks 
paris is the venue for talks this weekend between sihanouk and 
cambodian prime minister hun sen it will be the third such meeting 
in france in the past year 
sihanouk the former cambodian chief of state is informal leader 
of a coalition of three guerrilla groups fighting the phnom penh 
government and vietnamese forces occupying cambodia 
the us embassy said assistant secretary of state gaston sigur 
met the prince 
he reiterated american confidence in prince sihanouks central 
role in that peace effort and our belief that he should lead any 
postsettlement government which emerges the statement said 
sigur was to meet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev of the 
soviet union on wednesday to discuss cambodia and other asian 
issues it said rogachev also is in paris for the talks 
the official cambodian news agency spk reported that hun sen left 
bangkok for paris on monday 
spk said hun sens main guerrilla opposition the khmer rouge 
communists was resisting efforts to exclude it from a major role in 
a political settlement 
the khmer rouge and noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front boycotted the first two rounds of talks in france 
and evidently wont attend the latest session 
the increasingly isolated khmer rouge also did not attend 
multilateral discussions in indonesia last month 
there have been no breakthroughs 
peace proposals increasingly have focused on ways to ensure the 
khmer rouge the most powerful guerrilla faction does not return to 
power the khmer rouge regime of democratic kampuchea killed 
hundreds of thousands of people in its bid to radically restructure 
cambodian society from 1975 until late 1978 when vietnam invaded 
vietnam installed the prohanoi government hun sen leads the khmer 
rouge radio said sunday that the attempt to isolate the khmer rouge 
was not fair and not realistic 
without the khmer rouge it said the possibility of a 
political solution is uncertain and vietnam would already have 
swallowed cambodia 
in a recent interview hun sen said there were two options an 
agreement involving all factions or one with sihanouks coalition 
if the khmer rouge do not want to join the negotiations then 
it seems to me indispensable that hun sen and sihanouk might have to 
find a solution he said 
the framework for a political settlement has been established 
hun sen said only the khmer rouge and its biggest backer china 
had rejected it 
it was based on the withdrawal of vietnamese troops on excluding 
the khmer rouge from power and halting outside military aid to the 
khmer rouge 
china has indicated it would not support the khmer rouge taking a 
dominant position in postwar cambodia 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
sigur reiterated president reagans support for sihanouk for the 
noncommunist resistance forces in cambodia and for a negotiating 
process that can restore genuine selfdetermination to the cambodian 
people 
dr sigur expressed continued american support for prince 
sihanouks efforts to achieve a settlement in cambodia that will 
result in complete withdrawal of vietnamese forces from that 
country while preventing a return to power by the khmer rouge 
redman said

employees on grounds that it carries a flier for democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis 
one cannot use departmental resources to advance any partisan 
political candidacy george salem the departments solicitor 
said tuesday its a violation of the hatch act a bushquayle 88 
flier would be the same violation 
you cant use department resources to advance a partisan 
politcal candidacy in that manner he said 
the 1939 hatch act restricts political activity by federal civil 
service employees 
the fourpage newsletter by the national council of field labor 
locals was sent through the labor departments internal mail 
distribution system last friday to the departments 10 regional 
offices 
it was distributed in new york and kansas city but was stopped in 
the eight other regional offices by salem on monday after he saw the 
threeinch threecolumn flier essentially an ad across the 
botton of newsletters second page 
the flier obtained from the aflcio shows a picture of dukakis 
and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas with their arms 
in the air and says its time to say yes dukakis bentsen a team 
for americas future 
above it jesse rios an osha compliance officer based in chicago 
and the locals president wrote a 750word article on the aflcios 
endorsement of dukakis and bentsen under a headline the election 
what it means for field labor personnel 
in the article rios says the labor departments payroll has 
fallen from 25000 employees to 19000 during the eight years of the 
reagan administration 
the local an affiliate of the american federation of government 
employees represents some 8500 labor department field workers 
primarily in the occupational safety and health administration and 
the mine safety and health administration 
rios said the article had been shown to labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin last week and she had tentatively approved its 
distribution in the newsletter under an arrangement that has allowed 
the union to utilize the departments internal mail network since 
1978 
he said he had taken precautions in writing the piece to avoid 
advocating dukakis candidacy and only report on the aflcios 
endorsement and the reasons that the labor federation gave for it

noah adams host of the nationally 
broadcast good evening radio variety show that succeeded a 
prairie home companion will leave at the end of the year 
minnesota public radio announced tuesday 
adams is returning to his career as a broadcast journalist 
according to mpr which produces good evening he did not say 
for whom he would work 
good evening will continue to be broadcast live from the 
world theater in st paul each saturday night to more than 160 
american public radio stations across the country mpr said 
adams was an anchor for public radios news program all things 
considered before becoming good evening host in 1987 
ill be doing some radio work im sure and possibly 
television adams said and i have a couple of ideas for books 
that id like to explore but ill miss the music and stories and 
especially the excitement of saturday evenings close to air time 
good evening replaced a prairie home companion with 
humorist garrison keillor as host keillor left a prairie home 
companion last year and moved to his wifes native denmark then 
to new york 
beginning with the jan 14 1989 broadcast good evening 
will feature guest hosts until a permanent host is named mpr said 
we started thinking about this program early in 1987 adams 
said in a statement and we were pretty sure that good music and 
literature and storytelling could be brought together in a live 
broadcast from the world theater that would find a substantial and 
appreciative audience 
now were convinced of that i think weve established a format 
that can continue for many years 
its been a wonderful two years here adams told wccotv of 
minneapolis i think of it in a way as having left someplace and 
gone to make a movie for a couple of years and made the movie and 
its worked and i dont think they want to make it again for the 
next two years i want to find some other movie to make

algerians vote thursday in a referendum 
on political reforms proposed by president chadli bendjedid 
following riots earlier this month that left at least 176 people 
dead 
algeria has a oneparty system and the only legal party is the 
national liberation front 
bendjedid who took over the presidency in 1979 has indicated he 
would phase out oneparty rule and said approval of the referendum 
would be a major step in that direction 
the proposal would require the president to name a prime minister 
who would head the government and be responsible to the national 
assembly that is designed to free the government from the 
domination of the party the president who also serves as 
secretarygeneral of the national liberation front presumably would 
no longer have complete control over the government 
but the referendum does not legalize other political parties and 
both communist and islamic fundamentalist leaders have called for a 
boycott of the election 
about 12 million voters in algerias population of 25 million are 
expected to cast ballots and approve the proposal 
there will be two other steps in what bendjedid has called the 
greater democratization of political action 
in late december a party congress of the national liberation 
front will meet to consider political reforms but bendjedid has not 
said what those proposals will be 
then there will be a second referendum at an unspecified date 
early next year on political and institutional modifications of 
the constitution 
the justice ministry said tuesday that 1500 people arrested 
during the riots would be released wednesday that would mean 
virtually all of the people detained during the rioting that began 
oct 4 and continued for a week would be free 
an estimated 3000 people were arrested and the government has 
said 1500 have already been freed 
the riots began during demonstrations protesting unemployment a 
scarcity of staple commodities and rising prices 
the interior ministry said 176 people were killed throughout the 
country during the rioting unofficial estimates put the death toll 
at more than 400 
bendjedid also has promised economic measures to deal with the 
crisis provoked by falling oil prices although he has not said what 
those measures would be algeria relies on oil for about 95 percent 
of its export earnings 
the value of those exports has fallen by more than 40 percent 
since 1981 while algerias population has grown nearly 26 percent 
since 1980 
unemployment ranges from about 20 percent in the capital to 40 
percent in rural areas

the government and a decorated former air force 
colonel whose bid to build a better antitank cannon went awry have 
agreed to settle multimillion dollar suits by victims of a 1986 
explosion attorneys said tuesday 
lawyer michael sj chernau who represented one of the victims 
said agreements were reached within the last two weeks avoiding the 
need for a trial 
chernau said the explosion victims plan to seek a dismissal of 
the case against the us army and robert dilger inventor of a 30mm 
cannon that accidentally discharged at an arlington va filling 
station blowing up a gas pump and injuring four people 
dilger a weapons expert was attempting to market the antitank 
gun to the pentagon at the time of the accident 
chernau refused to reveal the terms of the tentative settlement 
reasoning the other parties may not want to disclose the amounts he 
said his client former gas station employee theresa thompson asked 
for 24 million and the amount shell receive is not close to 
that 
two other victims sued the army for 2 million 
lawyers for dilger and the justice department confirmed a 
tentative settlement had been reached and also refused to disclose 
how much the xenia ohio man and the federal government agreed to 
pay the victims 
until that case is dimissed by the court it is not a final 
deal we cant say anything on it justice department spokesman 
tom stewart said 
in addition to the civil suit a separate criminal case also is 
near completion 
dilger has pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge of 
discharging a firearm in a public place his sentencing scheduled 
for friday had been postponed because arlington county general 
district judge paul sheridan wanted to see an effort made toward 
compensating the injured 
chernau said about 60 pieces of shrapnel were removed from 
thompsons legs after the explosion her legs remain scarred and she 
has lost some mobility he said 
the other civil suit said elda and domenico gargani of arlington 
suffered extreme pain mental anguish and shrapnel wounds after the 
eightfootlong cannon fired a nineinch shell into a gas pump 
sending exploding metal into their car 
dilger who won three silver stars and four distinguished flying 
crosses in 180 combat missions in vietnam retired from the air 
force in 1980 after establishing a reputation as a costconscious 
procurement officer 
in addition to trying to develop a better cheaper antitank gun 
dilger developed a stereo electronics business and until a year ago 
was a parttime weapons analyst for a congressional office

gov bob martinez has asked us 
attorney general richard thornburgh to intervene in a federal 
lawsuit accusing the state of failing to protect lake okeechobee and 
the everglades 
the lawsuit probably would grow to include more than 50 
defendants or other parties take at least six years to resolve and 
cost at least 1 million according to an analysis by martinezs 
office 
in a letter he handdelivered to thornburgh on friday when both 
men were in gainesville martinez proposed holding conferences to 
settle the case out of court the governors office said tuesday 
while all of that litigation is taking place the substantial 
enforcement efforts which my administration and other agencies have 
already put into place may be impaired and intended new initiatives 
may be delayed or jeopardized the letter read 
on oct 12 us attorney dexter lehtinen in miami filed a 
fivecount complaint accusing the south florida water management 
district and the florida department of environmental regulation of 
failing to protect water quality and prevent pollution as required 
by state and federal law 
on tuesday lehtinens spokeswoman diane cossin said her office 
had not received official notice of the governors letter 
regretfully we cannot comment at this point said ms 
cossin but added lehtinen probably would respond at a later date 
the lawsuit seeks to stop pollution throughout the kissimmee 
riverokeechobeeeverglades system which includes a national park 
and wildlife refuge 
okeechobee the nations largest freshwater lake outside of the 
great lakes has for years been receiving pollution much of it in 
the form of nutrientladen runoffs from dairy farms along the 
kissimmee river valley the river flowing from south of the orlando 
area is a primary source of water for the lake 
in turn water from the lake flows into the loxahatchee national 
wildlife refuge into everglades national park and to the 
waterconservation areas that recharge the biscayne aquifer 
southeastern floridas primary water supply 
both state and federal laws are violated by allowing large 
quantities of polluted water to enter the protected areas lehtinen 
has said 
the state and the selfgoverning water district failed to 
maintain legal water quality standards operated pumps without a 
permit and violated their contracts to supply clean water to the 
national parks the federal suit claims 
the everglades park provides sanctuary to rare and endangered 
species of wildlife including the florida panther southern bald 
eagle woodstork american crocodile and cape sable sparrow

a man accused of setting a fire that 
destroyed a historic black church told investigators he did it 
because he thought it was part of a devil worship cult police said 
tuesday 
however the pastor of the 125yearold church the new bethel 
ame church of rocky fork in nearby godfrey said he was convinced 
the oct 18 fire was racially motivated 
it was the second arson fire at the church in six months 
hed have to be in a coma to not know about rocky fork the 
rev steven jackson said of the suspect james russell calvin who 
is white the church has been repeatedly in the news in the past 
10 years i dont buy that 
madison county sheriff bob churchich said calvin was actually 
convinced that it was a devil worship church we have no reason not 
to believe his story 
calvin 19 of alton was arrested monday and charged with one 
count of arson after someone tipped off the illinois fire marshals 
office churchich said 
he was being held in the madison county jail on 100000 bond 
the charge carries a penalty of three to seven years in prison upon 
conviction 
im just tremendously pleased that this has been solved 
churchich said i just wish somebody would come forth that would 
lead to the arrest of the other arson that happened in april 
the church founded in 1863 by former slaves who escaped the 
south was rebuilt after an april 16 fire with a 65000 
fundraising effort by its 25member congregation 
the sheriff said there was nothing to indicate that calvin 
absent without leave from the navy in san diego was linked to the 
earlier fire 
churchich said calvin told police he had been riding around with 
friends the night before the blaze and talk turned to satanism 
one of his buddies told him that the church was part of a devil 
worship cult said churchich noting his department has received 
information about such a group in the area 
jackson charged that local officials did not want to admit racism 
existed 
our prayers are with james russell calvin but i think he 
needs to tell the rest of his story the minister said 
last year racial epithets were carved in the walls and swastikas 
were spraypainted on the church in the town of 1000 across the 
mississippi river from st louis three men are awaiting trial in 
that incident 
elsewhere in southern illinois four crossburnings have been 
reported since july on property owned by black families in 
predominantly white neighborhoods in belleville and fairview heights 
authorities said they do not believe the crimes have been done by 
a single group

south africas foreign minister 
said tuesday the world is waiting for cuba and angola to respond 
to a us plan leading to cuban troop withdrawal from angola and 
independence for southwest africa 
leading newspapers said south africa agreed to the gist of a us 
proposal to grant independence to southwest africa also known as 
namibia within a year and let cuban troops remain in neighboring 
angola for up to two years 
south african forces would withdraw from namibia and 
unsponsored elections would take place 
while not confirming the contents of the us proposal foreign 
minister roelof botha said tuesday that south africa had responded 
to it and was prepared to be flexible while angola and cuba 
have yet to make up their minds 
south african officials waited three days in geneva for new peace 
talks to begin but left tuesday when it became clear that cuba and 
angola had never sent delegates diplomatic sources said speaking 
on condition of anonymity gen jan geldenhuys chief of south 
africas defense forces led the team 
the south african broadcasting corp said us envoy chester 
crocker canceled plans to fly to geneva on tuesday when it became 
clear the angolans and cubans had not responded to the proposal he 
made in new york last month 
crocker the assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
mediated months of peace talks 
botha said he still hoped for an agreement but in the meantime 
we have taken a position that has now landed the cubans and 
angolans in the situation where the whole world is waiting for their 
response 
tuesday had been the target date for implementing un resolution 
435 a 10yearold document outlining the process for namibian 
independence south africa has ruled the territory for 73 years and 
has previously linked its independence date to the departure of the 
estimated 50000 cuban troops supporting angolas marxist government 
south african analysts and diplomats in geneva speculated that 
the parties are apparently awaiting the outcome of nov 8 us 
presidential elections 
angolas official angop news agency quoted president jose eduardo 
dos santos as saying its possible implementation of namibian 
independence will begin some time in november december or 
january he was quoted as saying the nov 1 target date had been 
unrealistic 
us democratic party nominee michael dukakis has said he would 
end the reagan administration policy of aiding the unita national 
union for the total independence of angola rebels who have been 
fighting the angolan government and would not require cuban 
withdrawal 
in harare zimbabwe toivo ja toivo secretarygeneral of swapo 
the southwest africa peoples organization said tuesday he was 
cautiously optimistic south africa will honor pledges to grant 
his homeland independence 
but he told reporters swapo had long found that south africans 
are liars and insincere 
toivo went to harare the capital of zimbabwe for talks with 
president robert mugabes governing party on developments in namibia

soviet workers got a warning tuesday that paychecks 
no longer will be guaranteed and loafers can expect trouble 
it may have shocked those who follow the common soviet practice 
of loafing on guaranteed jobs to learn that politburo member nikolai 
n slyunkov said 
of course socialism is a society of guarantees but the 
guarantees are given under defined obligations the situation must 
be corrected to pay only for real results for work for quantity 
and quality of labor 
laziness has been a serious problem in the soviet union where 
workers have been required only to show up not to work 
slyunkov said the new system should be in place when the next 
fiveyear plan begins in 1991 and is critical to the success of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs program of economic and social 
reform called perestroika 
part of perestroika is the current attempt to determine the true 
cost of everything an enormous task in a nation where bureaucrats 
have set prices for decades without regard to the labor and 
materials invested 
gorbachev put the country on a plan of costaccounting a year 
ago slyunkov said monday it must extend all the way down to the 
workers 
workers must be given simple and understandable methods of 
defining results and calculating expenses slyunkov said people 
must see clearly that they receive everything they earn 
the payment for the labor of a worker a brigade a collective 
is not now dependent on the ultimate results of work on the 
product its quality the expense of material resources on the 
timely delivery of products to the next brigade and workshop 
calculating paychecks according to such results will force men 
and collectives to work for the common good slyunkov declared

opponents of a constitutional amendment to make 
english the official language of florida concede they already may 
have lost the fight 
well probably lose at a minimum by 2to1 said howard 
burkholtz a pollster hired by two lawyers who are trying to fight 
the amendment which goes before the voters on tuesday 
lawyers jon weber and stephen roof who oppose official english 
hired burkholtz for their campaign last summer 
i had assumed there would be this vast array of dollars and 
fundraising machinery weber says and i was surprised to find 
it was not there 
defeating the amendment would have taken between 1 million and 
2 million he said 
the two opposition campaign organizations english plus a 
predominantly hispanic group focusing on dade county and speak up 
now for florida a predominantly nonhispanic offshoot aiming for a 
statewide audience together have raised a little more than 
100000 they already have spent most of that on consultants and 
staff 
a statewide tv advertising campaign can cost as much as 500000 
a week 
weber and roof specialists in international law are members of 
the greater miami chamber of commerce which they had hoped would 
provide a source of funds for the antiamendment drive 
roof says that when defeat of official english became one of the 
chambers announced goals he figured funding support would follow 
webers firm in midjune hired burkholtz whose own polling found 
public sentiment running 41 in favor of the amendment his surveys 
showed that the margin dropped to a more competitive level once 
people had heard both sides of the issue 
there wasnt the quantity and depth of latin support there 
should have been even though there were notable exceptions weber 
said 
many hispanics oppose the amendment as discriminatory proponents 
of the policy change argue that official acceptance of bilingualism 
has kept nonenglish speaking immigrants from assimilating 
culturally and realizing their full potential economically

president reagan claimed tuesday that candidate 
george bush and the republican party espouse the policies and 
traditional values of the great democratic presidents franklin 
delano roosevelt harry truman and john f kennedy 
hopping on the namegame bandwagon of bush and his running mate 
dan quayle reagan campaigned in nevada and in his home state of 
california assailing democratic candidate michael dukakis for 
acknowledging earlier this week that he was a liberal in the 
tradition of fdr truman and kennedy 
reagan contended that the democratic candidate is no harry 
truman and hes no fdr tagging bushs rival with the 
cartermondale liberal agenda of high taxes and big government 
the opposition even after finally admitting their liberalism 
is still trying to deny that theyve left the mainstream behind and 
now belong to the party of sen george mcgovern and former vice 
president walter mondale thats the type of liberals they are 
reagan said 
no the fact is that today if you want america to be what fdr 
called a great arsenal of democracy if like harry truman you 
want to continue to help those resisting communism if you believe 
in lowering tax rates like john f kennedy did and in the 
traditional values that you grew up with then you should vote for 
our republican ticket because thats what we believe in and the 
selfproclaimed liberals dont reagan asserted 
for weeks reagan and bush have clubbed dukakis with the 
liberal tag insisting it carries with it policies of big 
government and high taxes instead of the more traditional image of 
personal liberty and resistance to absolute government 
the president also poked fun at dukakis populist slogan im on 
your side saying 
the liberals now are saying that theyre on your side i guess 
they think that that will make it easier for them to reach their 
hand around and put it in your pocket 
reagans comments came in remarks delivered at a rally on behalf 
of sen chic hecht rnev locked in a neckandneck race with the 
states popular democratic gov richard h bryan 
at the airport rally reagan shared billing with a live elephant 
named bertha who carried a sign saying stick with chic the 
elephant regularly performs at the nugget a hotel and casino in the 
reno area 
the rally within sight of the foothills of the sierra nevada 
mountains began under a light cloud cover but the sun broke 
through the clouds as hecht was introducing the president 
reagan told his nevada audience that there will be two 
democratic governors who want to go to washington on the ballot 
this year dubbing dukakis and bryan the tax and spend twins 
the president put in a plug for the staunchly conservative hecht 
who has suffered from an image problem due to sometimes awkard 
oratorical habits but pulled lately within striking distance of 
bryan 
chic doesnt grab headlines he doesnt showboat chics the 
kind of senator who doesnt make a lot of noise he just gets things 
done for his state reagan said pointing in particular to hechts 
work on behalf of raising the 55 mph speed limit to 65 mph 
nevadam with its four electoral votes is firmly in the bush camp 
according to published reports both bryan and hecht planned to 
spend at least 25 million in their hardfought contest which pits 
hecht a former banker and clothing store owners against bryan a 
highly rated state official 
earlier in the day reagan took a final campaign bow in his home 
state of california 
seeking votes to clinch the state for the vice president reagan 
tried to churn up votes in archconservative orange county at an 
exhuberant student rally at the local california state 
universityfullerton campus 
dont be fooled folks george bushs opponent is no harry 
truman and hes no fdr reagan said 
yes its the same cartermondale liberal agenda theyre 
pushing less defense more big government reagan said 
referring to former president jimmy carter and his vice president 
walter mondale the man reagan defeated in the 1980 landslide 
election 
the president also stoppd in middle class san bernadino where he 
spoke at a state gop rally near the famed riverside auto racetrack 
reagan planned to travel on tuesday evening to milwaukee where 
is he scheduled to add his prestige to the senate campaign of susan 
engeleiter republican leader of the wisconsin state senate public 
opinion polls show mrs engeleiter trailing behind herbert kohl the 
owner of the milwaukee bucks basketball team

a pharmaceutical company said tuesday that in 
preliminary studies a new drug eased symptoms of dementia of 
patients whose condition was caused by blood vessel disease in the 
brain 
if the drug denbufylline shows similarly successful results in 
larger trials now being conducted across europe it may be available 
to the public by the early 1990s said bob poyser of beecham 
pharmaceuticals 
dementia refers to the loss or impairment of mental powers the 
most common cause is alzheimers disease 
the new studies dealt with multiinfarct or cerebrovascular 
dementia in which the blood flow to the brain is obstructed because 
of blood vessel disease that causes perhaps 20 percent of dementia 
in the elderly and possibly another 20 percent includes both 
infarcts and alzheimers disease american federal authorities have 
estimated 
poyser beechams research controller for europe said the drug 
was tested on 110 patients with moderate multiinfarct dementia in 
two trials lasting three months each 
for both tests patients were selected randomly to receive either 
the drug or a placebo he said neither patients nor researchers 
knew during the experiments who was getting the drug and who was 
receiving the placebo 
in the first test involving 50 patients half were given the 
drug in dosages of 50 milligrams three times daily and half were 
given a placebo according to poyser 
he said by the end of three months significant improvement 
appeared among patients on the drug in 21 of 22 tests assessing 
mental functions some tests measured specific cognitive faculties 
faculties such as perception memory and judgment others used 
techniques traditionally employed by doctors and nurses to determine 
a clinical impression of a patients condition 
a second study involved 60 other patients we added the control 
of lowering the dose to 25 milligrams for 20 of the patients and 
although there was little improvement for them we found exactly the 
same success rate on the patients who were given 50 milligrams 
poyser said 
we dont want to raise false hopes it will be another year 
before we know we have a really useful drug but the early results 
are promising to say the least he added 
dr geoffrey dunbar a director of beechams medical department 
said that although the drug would not reverse the brains condition 
the hope was that it would enhance the brains ability to use its 
spare capacity 
he said patients who had taken the drug were more easy to live 
with less disturbed able to perform simple jobs around the house 
and use the telephone again 
that may not sound a lot but in terms of dementia that is a 
marked improvement 
dr nori graham chairwoman of the alzheimers disease society 
said she welcomed any drug that might alleviate suffering from 
dementia but she was cautious about how useful denbufylline might be 
to the majority of dementia sufferers 
i am delighted that the results seem promising but people with 
multiinfarct or cerebrovascular dementia whom this drug is seeking 
to treat are only a small percentage of those with dementia she 
said

family members of a missing vietnam war 
pilot said the government has inflicted emotional distress on them 
by relaying a report that he was seen in laos and then immediately 
labeling it not credible 
the family of lt col thomas hart iii last month won a 632000 
judgment against the military for anguish caused by the 
misidentification of seven bone fragments recovered in 1985 the 
remains were recovered at the site of harts plane crash 16 years 
ago in laos 
the family filed a motion in us district court on monday to 
reopen that case in light of these further horrendously 
aggravating circumstances 
the motion seeking unspecified additional damages was filed on 
behalf of the missing air force navigators wife anne hart of 
pensacola his mother vera hart of live oak and a daughter 
gillian hart of berkeley calif 
the motion alleges that anne hart has had to seek additional 
intensified psychological and psychiatric counseling and has been 
placed on medication a step she previously had refused to take 
anne hart received a phone call oct 13 seven days after 
testimony in the misidentification case ended from capt dale 
pangman of the air force casualty office at randolph air force base 
texas the motion states 
pangman told her the air force had received information that her 
husband and four other airmen whom he declined to name had been 
reported sighted alive in eastern savannakhet province 
a foreign national reported the sighting to the us naval 
attaches office in bangkok thailand on aug 22 
pangman then told mrs hart the report was being discounted 
because certain of the named servicemen including her husband and 
another member of his crew had been positively identified as dead 
yet the armed services graves registration office two years ago 
had rescinded that identification after an independent forensic 
anthroplogist working for the hart family determined it was 
impossible to tell whether the bone fragments were harts remains 
american and laotian officials recovered 50000 bone fragments 
and personal items from the site where harts ac130 gunship went 
down in december 1972 the army then positively identified all 13 of 
the planes missing crew members including hart but anne hart 
refused to accept that determination 
the motion to reopen the case includes a copy of an oct 4 
memorandum from col joseph a schlatter chief of the armys 
special office of prisoner of war and missing in action and a 
teletyped message from bangkok to the defense intelligence agencies 
collection team 
names of the other four missing men supposedly sighted are 
blacked out in the bangkok message but it does state all four are 
air force men and that two were captains and two technical 
sergeants it also identifies hart as a captain his rank at the 
time he disappeared 
schlatters memo states the source of the sighting information 
didnt have firsthand information but had obtained it from 
members of the socalled lao resistance whom he does not 
further identify 
laos one of the worlds poorest countries with four million 
people was taken over by communists in 1975 and resistance 
elements exist among refugees in neighboring proamerican thailand 
us officials have increasingly pursued talks with southeast asias 
communist governments however in seeking information about mias 
schlatter wrote that the report shouldnt be considered credible 
because some of the men supposedly sighted have been confirmed as 
dead 
further he wrote experience has shown that the lao 
resistance are notoriously untrustworthy and they have repeatedly 
failed to provide even the slightest shred of evidence to back up 
their various powmia claims 
schlatter wrote that efforts would be made to follow up on the 
report

nevada is the only state in which voters 
can cast their ballots for none of these candidates and one 
critic says its a cruel thing to do 
i think its a shame to have none of these candidates beat a 
candidate said ken haller a democratic state assemblyman from 
reno i know there are some candidates who sometimes are not the 
best in the world but it seems to me this law has no effect other 
than to be an embarrassment to the candidate 
its a cruel thing to do to people he said unfortunately 
we cannot have a writein candidate in nevada i think thats the 
proper approach 
the law allows the option to be chosen only in statewide races 
state sen don mello a democrat who as a state assemblyman 
introduced the plan in 1975 said it remains a valid method of 
expression that hasnt been abused 
mello said he came up with the idea during the watergate era when 
people were so disgusted with politicians they werent going to go 
to the polls 
its a freedom of choice issue and thats what elections are 
all about said mello why should you have to go to the polls 
and vote for the lesser of two evils 
haller believes that if the law is going to remain on the books 
in nevada then in fairness it should be extended to state senators 
and assemblymen as well 
and haller said that if none wins then i would say thats 
a case where we wouldnt have an election but i dont like it at 
all the bad outweighs the good 
there have been some embarrassing results in the 1980 
presidential preference primary none got 22493 votes not far 
behind president jimmy carters 25159 votes and more than the 
19296 votes sen edward m kennedy dmass received 
in the 1976 republican primary for what was then the states only 
congressional district walden earhart won the nomination with 9831 
votes but ran a poor second to none with 16097 votes under the 
law none cant actually win a race despite a majority

when the zzzz best carpet cleaning company hit 
wall street the firm was in debt for 7 million and was in the 
control of mobsters the companys whiz kid founder testified 
tuesday at his securities fraud trial 
barry minkow said that a growing cadre of organized crime figures 
who claimed connections to the genovese and colombo crime families 
dictated his every move in 1986 as he prepared a 15 million stock 
offering 
i was just a front man for the mob a tearful minkow insisted 
the 22yearold minkow who started his carpet cleaning firm at 
16 in his parents garage is charged with 57 counts of securities 
credit card and mail fraud ten other defendants have pleaded 
guilty accountant norman rothberg is on trial with minkow charged 
with taking a bribe to hide zzzz bests frauds 
there were constant threats of death minkow claimed and i 
seemed to get progressively more threats the more stakes there 
were 
although minkow sought to portray himself as a helpless puppet of 
organized crime he admitted that he became intoxicated with his 
public image and the millions of dollars that flowed into his firm 
i had my ferrari and i was the press golden boy he said 
bursting into tears 
at the same time he said he was throwing up blood every night 
from beatings by the mob 
minkow said he was conducting a road show to sell investors 
on the financial wonders of zzzz best while the business was 
actually a fraud 
it was important to puff up our income he said we were in 
the pricing stage of the public offering 
to do this he said he took out 7 million in loans from first 
interstate bank union bank bank hapoalim and others and opened 
five branch offices 
the offices were so we could show that we were the great 
7eleven of carpet cleaning he said referring to the 
convenience store chain 
it was just so i could say to the wall street bankers were 
wonderful buy our stock he testified and we were nothing we 
were losing money 
minkow said one time he bribed a bank officer 25000 to get a 1 
million loan the officer was not named 
as plans for the public offering of zzzz best progressed minkow 
said he was forced to take more loans some made to fictitious 
companies which then paid the money to zzzz best so that the carpet 
cleaning firm had income 
minkow seeking to deflate a prosecution claim that he was a 
skilled con man is presenting a defense of duress portraying 
himself as a young man in the clutches of the mob 
he testified that once a mobster held his head underwater and 
another time he was kicked in the testicles for resisting the loan 
scam 
defense attorney david kenner repeatedly asked minkow why he 
didnt go to police or try to escape he said he was scared 
i just felt there was nowhere to go anymore he said 
minkow named a long list of men he said participated in 
controlling his company but said the key figures in 1986 were the 
late reputed mobster jack catain and two exconvicts maurice rind 
and robert schulman 
minkow the first witness for the defense has been on the stand 
since oct 25 the prosecution rested its case on oct 21 after 
calling 47 witnesses and introducing thousands of documents and 
other exhibits

lloyd bentsen pushed hard tuesday to sell 
michael dukakis as someone wholl support a strong defense and he 
worked to deflect any harm to the ticket from dukakis 
acknowledgment that he was a liberal 
the texas senator hopped into the cockpit of an f16c jet fighter 
at the general dynamics plant in fort worth and told workers there 
the dukakisbentsen team opposed the reagan administration plan to 
reduce purchases of those planes next year from 180 to 100 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen support a strong national 
defense he said the f16 is an integral part of that he 
said pointing to the democratic proposal for more conventional 
weapons instead of more spending on star wars and nuclear weaopons 
bentsen continued emphasizing defense at a rally outside the 
courthouse in sherman where he told several hundred spectators that 
republican commercials in texas claiming that the democrats were 
going to shut down defense plants were absolutely untrue 
the democratic candidate stressed the same theme in owensboro 
ky telling a crowd of more than 2500 in a tobacco warehouse that 
the democrats support the creation of the best military in the world 
ill tell you what a secondbest defense system is bentsen 
said it has all the value of a secondbest poker hand all it 
does is cost you money 
joining bentsen at the podium were kentucky gov wallace 
wilkinson sen wendell ford dky and rep william natcher dky 
the rally ended with the singing of my old kentucky home and 
a balloon drop that didnt work the rope to release the balloons 
broke and they stayed netted to the ceiling 
bentsen questioned by reporters brushed aside suggestions by 
reporters that dukakis hurt himself in texas by calling himself a 
liberal most texans according to polls consider themselves 
conservative 
he said he was a liberal in the terms of jack kennedy and 
a harry truman and i dont think anyone ever questioned their being 
for a strong national defense bentsen said 
you know what you have to look at and read is how he stated 
it he said he talked about it in the terms of harry truman in 
the terms of jack kennedy in the terms of balanced budgets in the 
terms of paying your own way 
the republican administration talks about fiscal responsiblity 
and hasnt given us a balanced budget yet he said 
bob slagle the state democratic chairman who helped introduce 
bentsen in sherman said he didnt think dukakis did much harm 
i dont think its really hurting him he said they dont 
really attach that much to a label he said especially since 
dukakis identified himself with franklin roosevelt truman and 
kennedy 
but reggie bashur the spokesman for the bushquayle campaign in 
texas said calling himself a liberal hes really hurt himself in 
texas evidence of that damage was already showing up in tracking 
polls he said 
in texas he said the term liberal stands for the george 
mcgovern jimmy carter and walter mondale school of democrats i 
dont know what his handlers were thinking when they let dukakis 
say that he said 
after owensboro bentsen flew to st louis where he spoke to a 
chargedup crowd of about 2000 students jammed into a quadrangle at 
washington university 
he came to the stage with the speakers blaring aretha franklins 
version of the rolling stones jumpin jack flash and he urged 
the students to get out and vote 
the republicans he said were poppin those champagne corks but 
ill tell you on november 9 theyre going to have the worst hangover 
theyve ever had he said 
bentsen a bomber pilot in world war ii clearly enjoyed the stop 
at the general dynamics plant 
workers chanted bentsen bentsen and several employees yelled 
out in objection to george bushs running mate dan quayle calling 
him a draft dodger there were also bush supporters in evidence but 
they did not heckle or disturb the tour of the milelong plant 
which manufactures about 300 jets a year 
bentsen squeezed into the singleseat cockpit of a new f16c for 
the cameras and afterward declared it fits like a wetsuit he 
joked to reporters that hed fly it to the next campaign stop and 
meet his entourage there

election night because of a record 90000 requests for absentee 
ballots that could add hours or even days to the final vote tally 
people are afraid theyll have to wait in long lines at the 
polls particularly working people and older people who are 
afraid theyre going to have to stand in the polling booth for 20 
minutes said jay patterson the former registrar and special 
assistant in the chief administrators office 
californias ballot is unusually long this year because of 
numerous complex propositions 
the number of requests is more than twice the total of absentee 
ballots taken out four years ago and about 20000 more than during a 
1983 recall election for mayor dianne feinstein 
eileen mahoney spokeswoman for mayor art agnos said the crunch

the general assembly on tuesday voted in 
favor of the convention on the law of the sea and for the sixth 
consecutive year the united states cast its ballot against the 
resolution 
washington has said the convention would infringe on us rights 
to exploit seabed resources 
turkey joined the united states in casting its vote against the 
resolution that urged all nations to ratify the 1982 convention 
turkey is in a dispute with greece over exploration rights in the 
aegean sea 
the resolution was approved by a vote of 1352 with six 
abstentions the rest were absent 
sixty nations in the 159member assembly must ratify the 
convention before it would become international law so far 35 
countries have signed the pact 
it would establish an agency to govern uses of the sea in 
international waters traditionally an unrestricted area 
the agency would deal with commercial disputes protection of the 
marine environment safety rules antipollution measures and 
regulations against drug trafficking most of those provisions are 
acceptable to the united states 
the convention also states that the seabed belongs to all nations 
and it would restrict a single nations right to explore or exploit 
resources 
it declares that seabed production should not adversely affect 
the economies of developing countries which produce the same 
minerals to be found in the sea and an international authority 
would award production contracts based on trends in the world 
consumption of mineral resources 
noel l gross a us representative to the general assembly 
said that part of the convention runs contrary to us policy and 
to that of others who share our views concerning the future 
development of resources on the deep seabed 
the united states and its nationals like other states and 
their nationals have the legal right to explore and exploit deep 
seabed resources she said 
such operations are legal under existing international law she 
said and the united states intends to exercise these rights with 
reasonable regard to the interests of other states in their exercise 
of high seas freedoms 
she said the united states also opposes funding from the un 
general budget for law of the sea bodies the preparatory 
commission of the international seabed authority and the 
international tribunal forthe law of the sea 
those costs should be covered by nations that have signed the 
convention she said

the rightwing likud bloc and leftleaning labor 
party dueled head to head in tuesdays parliamentary elections with 
the small religious parties holding the balance of power 
likud leader yitzhak shamir appeared to have the edge in forming 
a ruling coalition and said he was convinced he could stay on as 
prime minister with the help of the religious parties 
but foreign minister shimon peres said his labor party still had 
a chance of luring religious parties into a laborled coalition 
the election was widely viewed as a crossroads in determining the 
future of the occupied territories and shaping israels policy for 
dealing with its hostile arab neighbors a palestinian insurrection 
has gone on for 11 months in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
claiming the lives of more than 300 palestinians and 10 israelis 
labor advocated an international conference to talk peace with 
the arabs and proposed sacrificing some of the occupied land for a 
negotiated settlement likud opposed both 
intense negotiations were expected to take place behind the 
scenes wednesday with labor leaders wooing the shas party 
projected to be the largest religious party with six seats 
with 95 percent of the 4800 polling stations reporting israel 
army radio said likud was projected to get 39 seats and labor 38 in 
the 120seat knesset or parliament 
likud and small rightwing parties together would have 46 seats 
labor and small leftist parties would have 56 
that would mean that labor and its allies would not have enough 
votes to block formation of a coalition between likud and the 
religious parties which appear more ideologically attuned to likud 
and are forecast to get 18 seats 
israel televisions exit polls predicted likud would have an edge 
in forming a governing coalition 
a smiling shamir told supporters at campaign headquarters he 
believed likud could get together a majority of 61 seats 
based on the facts we have before us it seems that the 
situation commands and enables the likud to form israels next 
government shamir said in a nationally televised speech 
in a later tv interview shamir opposed the idea of a national 
unity government like the one formed after 1984 elections ended in 
deadlock with labor winning 44 and likud 41 seats 
the 65yearold peres grimfaced said at labor headquarters his 
party was still in contention 
the results of the election are not yet final he said 
he urged his followerslets not lose faith and lets consider 
the options for forming a government in the next 24 hours 
yitzhak rabin the defense minister and a leading figure in 
labor said the key to who will put together a government is in 
the religious parites 
peres noted that for likud to win it would have to join with the 
moledet or homeland party the party headed by former gen rehavam 
zeevi advocates transferring the 15 million palestinians from the 
occupied lands to arab countries 
labor officials noted that rabbi yitzhak peretz of the shas a 
party oriented to sephardic jews of middle east origin left the 
door open to a possible alliance with labor 
the 73yearold shamir conceded that forming a government would 
not be easy and negotiations might last for days 
in an obvious bid to woo religious parties shamir said likud had 
never opposed a key orthodox demand to limit religious conversions 
to those approved by orthodox rabbis the move could alienate 
american jews many of whom are reform and conservative 
amnon rubinstein of the leftleaning shinui blamed a palestinian 
firebomb attack on sunday for hurting labors chances an israeli 
mother and three of her children were burned to death in the bus 
attack in the west bank town of jericho 
i think the terrible shocking event in jericho had a big 
effect on the results he said on israel radio 
for the deeply divided nation of 44 million whose 40year 
history is a calendar of war and violence tuesdays election is a 
crossroad in the future of the west bank and gaza strip which 
israel captured from jordan and egypt 21 years ago 
israelis voted in an atmosphere of violence created by the 
palestinian rebellion coupled with a sudden outburst of attacks on 
jewish civilians 
about 80 percent of the 29 million eligible voters turned out 
reflecting the galvanizing effect of the rebellion 
a huge force of 13000 police and other security personnel 
protected voting stations the army sealed off the occupied 
territories where the 15 million palestinian residents conducted a 
general strike 
likud and labor have spent four years in a tenuous national 
unity coalition because neither could make an alliance with minor 
parties after the indecisive 1984 election 
peres argued that the arabs were ready for peace negotiations 
but violence just before tuesdays election undercut his position 
on oct 19 a suicide carbomb killed eight israeli soldiers in 
south lebanon a firebomb attack on a bus last sunday in the west 
bank killed a jewish woman and her three sons on election day 
palestinians in arab east jerusalem hurled firebombs into a car 
carrying likud campaign workers setting a womans hair afire 
israel retaliated with four air attacks on guerrilla bases in 
lebanon after the car bomb and made its 20th raid of the year 
tuesday in apparent response to the firebombing of the bus

one of three palestinians who hijacked an 
egyptian airliner in 1985 admitted on tuesday that he killed two 
women passengers an american and an israeli 
lebaneseborn defendant omar mohammed ali rezaq 25 pleaded 
guilty to seven of nine charges when his trial opened in a heavily 
guarded courtroom 
the state dropped the two remaining lesser charges of firearms 
use and violation of maltese airspace to speed up the trial judge 
wallace gulia is expected to announce the verdict wednesday 
rezaq was one of three palestinian gunmen who commandeered an 
egyptair boeing 737 flying the athenscairo route on nov 23 1985 
sixty people including the two other palestinian air pirates 
died in the hijacking and the storming of the plane by egyptian 
soldiers 
rezaq pleaded guilty to killing scarlet maria rogenkamp of 
oceanside calif and nitzan mendelson an israeli woman he had 
denied the charges in pretrial testimony 
the two women were forced to go to the doorway of the plane after 
jewish and american passengers were singled out the women were shot 
and thrown from the plane to the tarmac 
conviction on the murder and hijacking charges could mean a life 
imprisonment sentence maltas stiffest criminal penalty for rezaq 
rezaq born in the sabra refugee camp in beirut testified that 
the hijacking was an act against egypts political system an act 
against egypts policy which was destroying the future of the 
palestinians 
rezaq wearing a dark suit and a white shirt unbuttoned at the 
neck said the hijackers had to land in malta because the plane did 
not have enough fuel to go elsewhere 
we came to malta in transit he said while making a plea of 
mitigating circumstances what happened in malta was an 
accident 
rezaq said the hijackers had intended to fly to an arab country 
which he declined to identify 
asked why the hijackers had fired at israelis rezaq said this 
is our principle he said they fired at americans because they 
are imperialists and there are other reasons too 
eyptian soldiers attacked the plane with gunfire and highpowered 
explosives 
most of the victims died from smoke inhalation in a fire touched 
off by an explosion which a maltese investigation said appeared to 
come after a hijacker tossed a grenade at egyptian soldiers 
two victims were killed by gunfire from the egyptians 
investigators found

nigerias population will more than triple 
by 2025 making it the fourth most populous nation after china 
india and the soviet union according to a un study released 
tuesday 
the west african nation was 10th in 1985 with 951 million people 
and will have 3013 million people by 2025 passing the 3007 
million projected for the united states by that year said the 
report called un world population chart 1988 
the populations of asia and latin america are growing more 
moderately than africas and of course in many countries in europe 
the population growth is almost stationary said rafeeuddin ahmad 
the undersecretarygeneral who presented the report at a news 
conference 
each woman in the world has on the average 34 children 
the number for africa is 62 and it is around 35 in latin america 
and asia in contrast women in europe and north america have 17 to 
18 children a number not sufficient to replace the existing 
population in the long run 
he said africas high birth rate offsets a life expectancy of 
only 52 years compared with an average of 60 for all developing 
countries and 73 for the industrialized nations 
china will have 149 billion people by 2025 india 144 billion 
and the soviet union 3514 million according to the report which 
said world population was 51 billion in mid1988 and will reach 6 
billion in 1998

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
is calling for a 70 million emergency relief campaign to aid up to 
25 million sudanese in need of food shelter and medical attention 
the sudanese were displaced by torrential rains aug 45 and 
subsequent floods with the problem compounded by civil war in the

men between the ages of 12 and 40 his report said 
many families have suffered personal attacks family members 
have been separated and lost and most are in an extremely poor state 
of nutrition and health 
there are large numbers of orphans or abandoned children above 
six years of age few below six years of age have survived 
the sudan peoples liberation army began a rebellion in the 
mostly christian and animist south in 1983 demanding greater 
autonomy and economic reforms

and has tried to institute islamic law in the sudan including the 
southern provinces 
up to 200 families a day leave the south and head for the 
relative safety of the north said the report perez de cuellar said 
these people were most urgently in need of help

a federal appeals court on tuesday rejected the 
oneida indian nations claim on more than 5 million acres of land in 
central new york state stretching from canada to pennsylvania 
the indians were seeking to overturn the states purchase of the 
land from their ancestors in 1785 and 1788 claiming those treaties 
violated an earlier treaty as well as the us law in effect before 
the constitution was ratified 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals sitting in manhattan 
upheld a lower court ruling that found the treaties acquiring the 
land were valid 
the oneidas joined by four of the five other tribes that 
comprised the oncemighty iroquois confederacy sought to overturn 
the treaties under which the land was sold 
in lawsuits first brought in 1978 they claimed the land 
purchases were invalid because the individual states could not buy 
the indians land without the central governments permission 
in a 52page opinion that quoted james madison thomas jefferson 
and other founding fathers the 2nd circuit described the appeal as 
unusual because it requires a federal court perhaps for the first 
time to determine whether actions of a state violated the articles 
of confederation 
the articles of confederation which left most power in the hands 
of the 13 states were in effect for nearly 10 years after the 
united states won its independence before the constitution was 
adopted in 1789 
at issue in the oneidas lawsuit was a strip of land 50 to 60 
miles wide running through the heart of new york from the st 
lawrence river down to the pennsylvania border the 5millionacre 
tract included parts of 12 counties 
lawyer allan vangestel who represented the 12 counties said 
this decision is expected to end one of the largest indian land 
claims in the eastern united states and will also have a big impact 
on future indian claims 
essentially the court had to interpret the meaning of the 
articles of confederation and what they said is that the state 
did not have to get permission from the central government to buy 
land from the indians he said 
arlinda locklear attorney for the oneidas called the ruling 
legally wrong and morally wrong 
reached at her knoxville md office she said she hadnt seen 
the opinion yet but expected to seek either a rehearing by the 2nd 
circuit or to petition the us supreme court for a hearing 
she said the 13000 indians she represented had a strong moral 
claim the failure of the united states to protect the oneidas in 
their dealings with new york state essentially the 2nd circuit said 
the words of the united states in the treaty predating the land 
purchases were meaningless 
the lawsuits were brought by the oneida indian nation of new 
york the oneida indian nation of wisconsin and the oneida of the 
thames band of ontario canada 
one of the six nations of the iroquois the oneidas were later 
joined in the suit by four of the remaining five the onondaga the 
mohawks the senecas and the tuscaroras the sixth nation in the 
confederacy which controlled much of upstate new york before the 
revolution is the cayuga 
the opinion was written by circuit judge jon o newman with 
judges amalya l kearse and ralph k winter concurring

the november sweeps are here but you would 
hardly know it 
the national love and sex test inside the sexes 
goddess of love this is not latenight cable unfortunately 
but real network tv shows scheduled to air this month 
normally in november as in february and may the networks load 
their schedules with top notch programming to help affiliates do 
well in local ratings but this november still rattles with 
vacancies created by the writers strike that ended back in august 
at least the strike forced abc to move up 18 hours of war and 
remembrance to fill the void left by production delays on regular 
series otherwise the networks are struggling just to get their 
regular schedules on the air and most of the special 
programming is realitybased or standard movieoftheweek fare 
all this might well prompt the average viewer to ponder how late 
the video store stays open 
this entire fall is a great opportunity lost to the networks 
due to the strike said david poltrack cbs vice president for 
marketing 
were going to go from a sweeps that still has premieres in it 
that has major extra programming and from then go into all the 
holiday specials were not really going to have a fix on regular 
network product until january 
poltrack estimates network audiences currently down from last 
season by about 8 percent will end up down 510 percent for the 
season if not for the effects of the strike he said network 
audiences probably would have been higher than last season thanks 
to the olympics the world series and the bigevent war and 
remembrance 
gerald jaffe nbcs vice president for research projects expects 
network shares or the percentage of viewing audience to be down a 
couple of points for the season but doesnt think the sweeps 
numbers will be that severely affected 
i think november will certainly be a really good indication 
other than for election night were definitely going to take a big 
hit it may cost us couple of network share points just that 
one night on the entire sweep it will certainly cost us at least 
one jaffe said 
on tuesday nov 8 the networks preempt their entire primetime 
schedules so the news divisions can cover the election there will 
also be paid political broadcasts taking up network time the day 
before 
its more of a twoday depressant than a oneday depressant 
said poltrack 
war and remembrance would be an anomaly in any sweeps 20 
percent of abcs primetime schedule devoted to one program it 
begins nov 13 the rest of the 32hour epic will air in february 
war and remembrance based on the herman wouk novel is a 
sequel to winds of war winds of war was an 18hour 
miniseries in 1983 that averaged a rating of 386 and a 53 share and 
became the third highestrated miniseries ever 
war and remembrance will probably win the sweeps period for 
abc but will have to contend with lower overall network viewing 
attributed to just the kind of grazing among channels that keeps 
viewers from committing to long projects although the miniseries is 
expected to get favorable reviews abc executives have said it will 
likely end up costing the network 20 million 
otherwise the only miniseries in november are a pair of 
twoparters on nov 67 cbs is internal affairs a sequel to 
doubletake starring richard crenna as a new york city police 
detective trying to solve a murder case nbc has the great escape 
ii the untold story a starstudded madefortv sequel to the 
1963 steve mcqueen movie about pows 
nbc has put wheel of fortune letterturner vanna white into 
her own star vehicle goddess of love on nov 20 brooke shields 
and twiggy star in the diamond trap on cbs the same night 
then there is the mishmash of realitybased specials a 
remnant from the writers strike since such shows are not subject 
to writers guild rules abc has worlds greatest stunts cary 
grant a celebration the national love and sex test a 
twopart crimes of the century and a barbara walters special 
cbs has inside the sexes and people magazine on tv on 
nov 17 cbs news commemorates the 25th anniversary of the jfk 
assassination on the actual anniversary nov 22 cbs entertainment

in the rugged rogue river valley of southern 
oregon the few people who had contact with irwin lehrer knew him as 
a man of few words 
but when president john f kennedy was assassinated lehrer took 
a pen and with a trembling hand but strong heart wrote a rare 
letter to the first lady 
i am just an old man living by myself way up in the 
mountains he wrote john f kennedy was the best president we 
ever had and you are the most wonderful woman in the world anyone 
tries to tell me different has me to whip twin fawns come in my 
yard to eat feed i put out for them ones name is caroline the 
other john john 
lehrers letter is now in a special file at the john f kennedy 
library created by the national archives from condolences sent to 
jacqueline kennedy 
most of the 300000 pages of letters selected from about 3 
million pages are still being catalogued but the couple hundred 
already on file reveal in simple touching and rarely mawkish 
prose how deeply personal the kennedy presidency and passing was 
for average americans 
there are letters from heads of state and celebrities but most 
are from the likes of a selfproclaimed nobody housewife from 
st louis from a retarded boy in riverside calif who labored for 
an hour to print his 45 words from a woman from ripley tenn who 
said that because of kennedy many southerners no longer accept an 
old saying that a child born of a black mama and a black papa his 
days will always be unhappy 
the most frequent reflections are on jfks vigor and humor his 
efforts on behalf of the mentally handicapped and minorities and 
his handling of the cuban missile crisis 
some letters note special personal connections lewis cagle of 
tennessee for instance whose life sentence kennedy commuted three 
days before the assassination and a crippled woman from boston whom 
kennedy once gave a ride when he spotted her struggling to keep up 
with marchers in a parade in his honor 
several of the dozen letter writers contacted 25 years later had 
only vague recollections of what they had written mrs kennedy but 
memories of the assassination and the president were strong and 
little changed 
deborah lynn dills of fort worth texas had written at the age 
of 12 to mrs kennedy when i heard your husbands speech that 
fatal morning i was glowing with pride because of the nice things he 
said about texans but now i am ashamed that i am a texan i wish i 
was not one 
dills is now a pediatric nurse whos back in love with her home 
state but unremitting in her devotion to a president and a period 
she believes was the last time people really felt proud 
she recalled getting the news of the assassination while in 
physical education class she cried and then i remember a girl 
saying good and my turning around and busting her one 
judy knight of orlando fla wrote as a high school senior that 
she was a bigot until kennedy inspired her with his civil rights 
stands and other programs and the riveting media attention given 
the assassination helped steer her to a career in communications 
now as a producer and writer for a commercial film company in 
washington dc she says this current washington scene is a very 
cruel comparison to what that was were all waiting for 
something like him to come back some part of us that feels if 
the right person would step out wed have camelot again 
virginia chetwynd of melrose mass told the ap this country 
simply turned around and got lousy when the both of them went 
referring to kennedy and his brother robert 
her condolences to the first lady included an account of her 
mother a polio victim once being given a ride by kennedy it was 
the highlight of her life she clipped and cut out everything in the 
papers about him it was like he was her own boy 
the letters to mrs kennedy often include notes like youll 
probably never see this but she read thousands of them and 
notations on some indicate that jbk found this one or that one 
especially touching 
in fact it was mrs kennedy who promised almost 25 years ago 
that such a file expected to be completed and available to 
researchers next year would be created 
she inspired many of the letters actor brian keith for example 
wrote the day after christmas 1963 that her courage had helped him 
and his wife when they lost a son nine days earlier 
the letters also shared with her glimpses of the backyard 
tributes that went on around america 
mrs gw robinson of deerfield ill wrote how her 14yearold 
son returned to a tree house he had long since outgrown he raised a 
flag from a halyard there and every morning in the cold dawn 
before school he raised it lowered it to half staff and in the 
chill afternoon quietly took it down 
cynthia biever of nappanee ind wrote that our neighbor 
children named our favorite shortcut path kennedy lane we 
christened it and everything 
a quarter of a century later and now cynthia montgomery of 
ludington mich she had little memory of the event but she 
believes kennedy was an influence in many of the major things of 
my life such as being active and aware politically 
at peninsula high school in gig harbor wash teacher ruth 
crook wrote the news came just before i was due to teach 
shelleys ode to a skylark you were at the hospital numb 
cold choked i put it to the class what do you do go home

with varying success new video remembrances of 
john f kennedy reflect the magic and the fears of his 1000 days in 
the white house 
theyre most effective when they show the young president 
speaking for himself in the witty repartee at news conferences 
for instance and when they let realtime recordings register the 
grief at his death a reporters voice breaking as he dictates from 
dallas a waiter sobbing into a starched napkin at the luncheon 
where jfk was headed that day 
onehour biographies can hardly tell a life story like kennedys 
in the end these retrospectives seem to move too fast missing 
milestones 
in presenting his personal life they show the outdoorsman 
sailing or playing touch football the father cuddling his kids the 
dashing husband of a dazzling wife the portrait that made the 
camelot myth the tabloids man of clay is nowhere to be found 
still its nice to hear a president straightforwardly admit a 
big mistake as kennedy does a year or so after the bay of pigs 
its nice to feel the energy of an administration that holds a 
summit with the soviet leader within six months of taking office 
its nice to see again and again that ohsoeasy smile 
here are glimpses of the new videos 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the most personal of the remembrances this one used 200 hours of 
film and at least as importantly 300 hours of voice recordings so 
jfk is heard narrating his life 
at one point as hes seen reviewing troops and meeting with 
advisers the familiar voice confides the responsibilities placed 
on the united states are greater than i imagined them to be and 
there are greater limitations upon our ability to bring about a 
favorable result than i imagined its much easier to make the 
speeches than it is to finally make the judgments 
there are lighter moments in the film which will air on hbo 
cable in november during a televised callin show when hes running 
for the senate a caller suggests his wife would make a better 
senator the smile then i agree with that but in any case i 
have the benefit of her advice so maybe ill improve

david l wolper was executive producer of this documentarystyle 
effort first released the year after the assassination under a 
foreboding musical score it follows the movements of jfk and of lee 
harvey oswald effectively splicing news film with reenactments by 
people who played supporting parts a cab driver who picked up 
oswald the shoeshop owner who spotted the fugitive and tipped 
police 
waiting for the motorcade the camera looks through a scope and 
fixes the crosshairs on passing traffic 
the script is full of detail the secret service had checked the 
table decorations at the luncheon jfk was going to and would select 
his steak at random from 2500 the elegant language of the script 
may seem dated but complements kennedys own rhetoric

a french diplomat quoting stendahl called kennedy a brilliant 
maybe and that neutrality is the theme here as abc news peter 
jennings narrates 
this documentary traces the presidential years using effective 
clips from speeches to show jfks inspiring style but noting that 
for example in civil rights reform he waited until unrest pushed 
him to act halfway through his presidency the new frontier had 
remained unconquered jennings says 
jfk built up troop numbers in vietnam but took the first steps 
toward coexistence with the soviets toward the end he was 
focusing on peace our most basic common link says kennedys 
voiceover is that we all inhabit this planet we all breathe the

it was just about sunset when the man 
from the tennessee valley authority drove by and spied the farmer 
sitting on a knoll off to the side of the country road 
the time was the early 1940s and the farmer was just sitting 
there staring at his farm in the hollow the house barn and 
smokehouse all aglow with light it was obviously the darnedest 
thing the farmer had ever seen 
a few days later the tva man was attending church when the same 
farmer stood to address the congregation 
brothers and sisters i want to tell you this the greatest 
thing on earth is to have the love of god in your heart the 
farmer declared and the next greatest thing is to have 
electricity in your house 
stories like this still bring a smile at tennessee valley 
authority offices in knoxville and chattanooga and muscle shoals 
theyre a wistful reminder of the good old days 
once tva was the savior of the tennessee valley a shining model 
of how government can develop a region the agency that switched on 
lights from asheville nc to tupelo miss 
in addition to cheap electricity tva provided jobs building dams 
during the great depression lured industry by opening the tennessee 
river to navigation and improved poor farming practices 
in our household tva was just considered wonderful the 
agencys former chairman s david freeman who grew up in 
chattanooga reminisced a few years back tva was right up there 
with religion and i came from a religious family 
but the good old days are gone 
now franklin d roosevelts new deal dream is an agency in 
transition some say shambles struggling to undo decades of 
bloated bureaucracy inefficiency and poor leadership 
tva is the largest electric utility in the country capable of 
producing more than 31 million kilowatts from 29 hydroelectric 
plants 12 coalfired steam plants four combustion turbines and one 
nuclear plant 
it serves 8 million people over 80000 square miles of the south 
thats almost all of tennessee a third of mississippi a quarter of 
alabama and smaller parts of kentucky georgia north carolina and 
virginia 
but the federal agency which started with a 100 million 
government loan in 1933 also faces a debt of 179 billion almost 
all of it from what was once the nations most ambitious nuclear 
power program 
of the 17 reactors that tva planned or started from 1966 to 1978 
only one unit 2 at sequoyah nuclear plant outside chattanooga is 
generating electricity today 
eight were scrapped in the early 1980s after tva realized it had 
misjudged how much power it needed four were delayed by tougher and 
costly safety regulations after the three mile island accident in 
1979 
and the five licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission were 
shut down in 1985 over concerns they could not be operated safely 
after accumulating more than 1 million in nrc fines the previous 
five years 
sequoyah unit 2 returned to action only in may and tva puts the 
bill to bring all five reactors back on line at 15 billion and 
still counting that doesnt include lost revenue about 1 million 
a day when all five units were down 
none of which helped tvas electric rates which after years of 
being among the cheapest in the country increased more than 500 
percent from 1967 to 1982 the rates are still well below the 
nations most expensive but many cities including atlanta and 
washington dc have lower industrial power rates 
it has been too easy for us tva chairman marvin runyon said 
of the agencys past willingness to pass its costs along to 
customers were going to stop that 
we could raise rates and continue to raise rates but the fact 
is tva used to be the yardstick for the cost of power in the united 
states and weve lost it weve got to get it back 
tvas problems go back at least to 1959 when congress authorized 
the agency to begin financing its power operation with electricity 
sales instead of federal appropriations 
from world war ii through the mid1960s power use by tva 
customers had climbed about 7 percent a year but rising coal prices 
and air pollution problems seemed to warrant against more coalfired 
plants 
with the freedom to borrow from the federal financing bank tva 
turned to nuclear power both cleaner and apparently cheaper than 
coal starting construction on seven plants in alabama mississippi 
and tennessee 
but by 1983 electricity use was growing just 1 percent a year 
and tva decided it was building more nuclear plants than it needed 
three of them after an investment of more than 4 billion were 
scrapped 
there were other power problems the 137 million tellico dam in 
eastern tennessee was delayed for nearly 10 years by a debate over 
whether it threatened the existence of a tiny fish called the snail 
darter 
in middle tennessee tva spent 80 million on the columbia dam 
then halted construction midway through the project saying it would 
be too costly to operate 
those were nothing compared to the nuclear woes however in 
1975 a 12hour fire knocked out controls used to cool fuel rods in 
the unit 2 reactor at tvas browns ferry nuclear plant near athens 
ala until three mile island it was the nations worst nuclear 
accident 
the low point came in 1985 in march tva shut down all three 
browns ferry reactors because they didnt comply with nrcs tougher 
safety regulations in august both sequoyah reactors were shut down 
initially tva thought it was a paperwork problem simply a 
matter of checking the plants and providing required but missing 
documentation to the nrc 
but as the checks went on actual safety defects were uncovered 
eventually leading to a major management shakeup and the january 
1986 hiring of retired navy admiral steven a white to head the 
nuclear overhaul 
white found an agency marked by low morale typified by thousands 
of employee complaints of harassment and intimidation for raising 
concerns about safety 
most of tvas problems though came from not spending enough 
money to maintain and operate the nuclear plants white said

calvin coolidge thought it was a bad 
idea so did herbert hoover insisting that a government agency 
competing with private business was the negation of the ideals 
upon which our civilization has been built 
but for franklin d roosevelt the tennessee valley authority was 
a chance to show what the government could do to help people help 
themselves in hard times 
tva now a sprawling controversial agency with an annual budget 
of more than 5 billion was born in 1933 as part of the new deal 
roosevelts remedy for the great depression 
like other roosevelt reforms such as the civilian conservation 
corps and the works progress administration tva was designed to put 
people back to work while improving their quality of life 
the result was a government entity unique in the united states 
an independent agency charged with nurturing an entire region with 
flood control navigation and cheap electrical power 
tva declared roosevelt should be clothed with the power of 
government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of 
private enterprise 
perhaps in any other period of american history or in any other 
region except the destitute south of the 30s tva wouldnt have 
worked 
but for people eking out an existence in the cotton fields of 
mississippi or the mountains of north carolina it was a 
bureaucratic blessing that raised them from darkness into light 
in 1933 the tennessee valley had a per capita annual income of 
168 only 45 percent of the national average about 62 percent of 
the people more than twice the national average farmed only 
286 percent half the national average worked in manufacturing 
trades and services 
by 1985 the regions per capita income was 776 percent of the 
national average just 44 percent of the population worked in 
agriculture while 742 percent were in manufacturing trades and 
services 
tva got its start when sen george norris of nebraska began 
introducing bills in the 1920s to make an idle munitions complex in 
muscle shoals ala part of a government agency to develop the 
tennessee river basin 
coolidge and hoover vetoed the measures but roosevelt endorsed 
tva as part of his ambitious recovery program 
the fledgling agency was given 100 million to start and 
promptly found itself in a dogfight with private utilities led by 
wendell willkie president of the giant commonwealth amp southern corp 
the tennessee river touches seven states and drains the 
nation said willkie 
but tva director david e lilienthal insisting that people 
wanted public power set out to create a demand by setting rates at 
rockbottom prices and selling electric appliances to tva customers 
in tupelo miss the first city to buy tva power consumption of 
electricity went up 83 percent in the first six months 
willkie was unimpressed every time somebody turns on a light 
in tupelo miss the entire country pays for it he said 
the battle ended in 1939 when the us supreme court upheld tvas 
constitutional right to exist and sell electricity 
in the meantime tva was working to fulfill the grand dreams of 
roosevelt and norris touching virtually every aspect of life in the 
tennessee valley 
in addition to creating construction jobs dams like norris and 
wheeler and chickamauga improved navigation and created floodfree 
sites that lured businesses already attracted by the prospect of 
cheap power 
there are 39 dams in tvas water control system and the agency 
estimates theyve prevented about 22 billion in flood damage 
more than five times tvas investment in the system 
the oncetreacherous tennessee river is now navigable 650 miles 
from knoxville to the ohio river in 1933 annual barge traffic was 
940223 tons now its more than 36 million tons a year 
the munitions complex in muscle shoals became a leader in 
developing fertilizer to enrich soil depleted by decades of growing 
corn cotton and tobacco 
new agricultural methods such as terracing contour farming 
strip cropping and soil surveys were introduced to regenerate the 
land and increase farm income 
although the region has 40 percent less farmland than in 1933 
the peracre yield has more than doubled 
more than 21 million acres stripped bare by poor logging 
practices were reforested steps were taken to control local pockets 
of malaria libraries established for tva construction workers were 
converted to regional use 
at the agencys 30th anniversary celebration in 1963 president 
john f kennedy said the work of tva will never be over 
there will always be new frontiers for it to conquer for in 
the minds of men the world over the initials tva stand for 
progress and the people of this area are not afraid of progress

compared to the nazi genocide that virtually 
wiped out europes jews a night of windowsmashing and arson would 
seem a pale subject for a documentary 
but kristallnacht the journey from 1938 to 1988 spotlights a 
moment in history when history could have been changed the world 
was shocked but did nothing and hitlers destruction of the jews 
went forward 
the onehour film will air over the public broadcasting service 
on nov 9 the 50th anniversary of crystal night when 
widespread nazi attacks on synagogues and jewish businesses and 
homes littered the streets with shattered glass 
it was hitlers last test to see how the world would react and 
the world reacted with silence said ronald lauder who underwrote 
the film through his ronald s lauder foundation a philanthropic 
organization that aims to preserve european jewish history and 
culture 
lauder heir to the estee lauder cosmetics fortune served as 
ambassador to austria from 198587 and was an outspoken critic of 
antisemitism at a time when austrians were electing former un 
secretarygeneral kurt waldheim as their president in spite of his 
nazi background 
lauder told a small group that gathered for a preview screening 
of the documentary that its purpose was to teach us a lesson that 
we have to speak out speak out whenever there is any type of 
bigotry governmentsponsored any type of religious persecution 
the film describes the events through rare pictures including 
neverbeforeseen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue and 
interviews with survivors and witnesses it later catches up with 
presentday austrians and germans who have varying opinions on their 
connection to the past 
kristallnacht is wellknown in europe but lauder said he was 
chagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of americans polled 
by his foundation had ever heard of it 
it became part of me when i was in vienna he said in an 
interview i began to realize all the different currents why they 
were happening i also saw in vienna there were very few synagogues 
left one of the major ones is today a parking lot i realized 
that this was a center of jewish life and theres a parking lot 
what happened 
after nov 9 1938 the world was never the same lauder 
said there was something different people couldnt put their 
finger on it but it was different it affects your life it affects 
my life it affects all our lives and thats why i did it i wanted 
people to understand it and no matter how much i explained to 
people when i travel what happened i couldnt get it across 
for producer robert frye a former abc news producer making 
lauders film was a difficult project since little visual material 
was available 
the nazis didnt want any evidence of the widespread nature of 
this frye said he held little hope for film footage until 
someone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum in 
germany 
that began a threefourmonth process frye said no one 
would tell us who owned the film after leaving austria on the 
actual shoot we drove to munich and on the way found out that 
the woman who owned the film lived near so we knocked on the door 
and completed the deal it is as far as i know the only footage 
that shows in motion picture terms what happened 
the film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses who 
lived in germany in 1935 as hitler was rising to power and finding 
little resistance to his propaganda campaign against jews 
a polish family forced to leave germany wrote a plaintive letter 
to a son in paris to protest the persecution of his family 
17yearold herschel grynzspan walked into the german embassy and 
shot a minor german official ernst vom rath retribution for vom 
raths death became an excuse for kristallnacht 
this was for good we knew the end of our normal life 
recalls witness paul grosz 
in presentday west germany fryes cameras follow israeli 
professor meier schwarz on his quest to find evidence of the jews 
who once lived in the germany of his boyhood in ansbach he watches 
workmen restoring a magnificent synagogue 
the main thing is to restore what happened here schwarz 
says to make a memory for our parents but he acknowledges 
there is no one to worship in the synagogue no jews live in ansbach 
anymore

a crisis in medicine is the crucial point at 
which it becomes clear whether the patient will live or die 
the worlds financial system suffering from a disease called 
third world debt has been in crisis now for six years ever 
since mexico in the summer of 1982 stopped paying interest on its 
debt because of tumbling oil prices 
some pointing to the improving balance sheets of creditor banks 
and growing export sales by debtor countries such as argentina and 
brazil say the crisis is over although the illness remains severe 
others say that from the perspective of those countries owing 
the debt the patient has gotten no better and perhaps worse those 
countries have dubbed the 1980s the lost decade because they 
have had to sacrifice the living standards of their citizens just to 
make interest payments 
indeed just last weekend seven latin american leaders whose 
countries collectively owe 420 billion to banks and international 
lending organizations said the crisis is acute enough to threaten 
the survival of their democracies and has produced serious 
deterioration in the quality of life of the regions peoples 
even though there is no agreement that the crisis has ended 
indeed some still fear the patient will not survive all sides 
agree that there is movement toward a new crop of strategies for 
coping with the 12 trillion in debt owed by developing countries 
which is about 400 billion more than when the crisis started 
when the crisis first blossomed a doomsday scenario was in 
vogue after another unexpected drop in oil prices or some other 
financial shock first one then more big debtors would default a 
big us bank would be pulled down the panic would spread and 
additional banks topple and finally the worlds financial system 
would collapse 
that hasnt happened at the end of 1982 the 17 biggest debtors 
including the five largest brazil mexico argentina venezuela 
and chile owed us banks 918 billion or 130 percent of their 
capital in other words if all 17 countries defaulted 
simultaneously us banks would have been broke 
at the end of june 1988 the debtor countries owed us banks 
nearly as much 822 billion but banks had set aside reserves 
and the debt represented only 64 percent of their capital 
the aggregate numbers mask differences among individual banks 
large regional banks have been the most aggressive in reducing their 
exposure the nine largest money center banks however were still 
on the hook for more than 100 percent of their capital at the end of 
1987 
the large banks have set aside reserves of about 30 cents a 
dollar on the loans and the regional banks have reserved at about 50 
percent but the loans in late october were trading on the 
international debt market at discounts averaging 60 cents per dollar 
developing country debt is clearly a serious problem but i 
dont think one would call it a crisis anymore said l william 
seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures deposits in us commercial banks 
comparing the situation to where we were the banks have 
improved their position by a very large margin he said 
banks last year posted their lowest earnings since the 
depression 37 billion largely because they added 25 billion to 
third world debt reserves but this year with the reserving behind 
them us banks in the first six months earned 105 billion and 
having restored brazils loans to paying status after an 18month 
interest payment moratorium are heading toward a record year 
this reflects obviously the health of the private sector around 
the world said john s reed chairmanof citicorp the nations 
largest banking company we are experiencing very much more normal 
credit circumstances maybe even an unusually good credit situation 
on a global basis 
willard c butcher chairman of chase manhattan bank one of the 
biggest lenders to developing nations argues that debtor countries 
also are better off 
brazil will probably have the third largest trade surplus of 
any country in the world this year mexico has more than 
quadrupled its nonoil exports since this crisis set in 
venezuela has literally reduced its debt chile has made major 
reductions butcher said 
since october 1985 the united states has pursued the baker 
plan named after former treasury secretary james a baker iii it 
called for new loans and stretching out the payments on old loans in 
exchange for internal economic reforms by debtor countries 
but critics such as sen bill bradley dnj argue that debtor 
countries need less not more debt if they are to improve their 
economies and the lives of their people 
even one of the architects of the plan richard darman former 
deputy treasury secretary acknowledged at a conference in 
washington a month ago that the strategy failed to bring as much new 
money to debtors as he and baker had hoped 
the sad and lamentable fact is there has not been much progress 
on the third world debt issue said bradley we have simply 
postponed the ultimate day of reckoning in the mistaken belief that 
this type of problem withers away with time

he concedes that the us banking system is on less precarious 
footing but he argues that if more is not done latin americas 
lost decade will haunt the united states in the form of rising 
political and economic turmoil south of the border also developing 
countries that had once been lucrative markets for us exports will 
no longer be able to buy american goods 
in mexico half of the population is under the age of 15 if 
mexico doesnt have the money to invest in its economy they cant 
generate the jobs if they dont generate the jobs theres only one 
place these people are headed and thats north bradley said 
if the developing countries are to pay less on their debts 
someone else must either the banks or the taxpayers of the creditor 
nations 
not suprisingly each wants the others to pay bankers look to 
the taxpayers politicians representing the taxpayers look to the 
banks and the debtors look to both the banks and creditor country 
governments 
but new alternatives to the baker plan are beginning to emerge 
in part because the banks are financially better able to consider 
limited debt forgiveness 
at the september meetings of the international monetary fund and 
world bank meetings in berlin japanese finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa advanced a plan for debtor countries to buy back their 
debts at a discount and then issue bonds to their creditors 
repayment of the bonds would be guaranteed through a fund managed by 
the imf president francois mitterand of france has proposed a 
similar plan 
the strategies have in common that they ask the banks to 
recognize loss and the taxpayers of the imf member nations to take 
some risk 
the united states at least for now has responded cooly 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said the baker plan has worked 
and the united states regards with skepticism plans that offer 
an illusion of progress 
that could change however 
i think once the election is over there will be a 
reassessment but not a dramatic shift said william cline an 
economist with the institute for international economics a study 
group funded by foreign and us foundations 
my own expectation is we will see a continuation of the basic 
baker strategy but it will evolve in the direction of voluntary debt 
relief he said i would not be suprised to see some form of 
public guarantee that could be set up on a basis on which the 
public would incur very little risk 
this has been one of the longerlasting crises that i can 
remember and it will be around a while longer he said 
vice president george bush in campaign position papers has 
backed the baker plans call for internal reforms in the economies 
of debtor nations he says the one realistic approach for helping 
debtor nations restructure their economies would be based on the 
american model of low taxes deregulation and entrepreneurship 
michael dukakis on the other hand says that he would ensure 
that borrowers and lenders share the burden of debt relief

the veterans administration effective today 
is lowering its maximum interest rate for federally backed va home 
loan mortgages by onehalf percentage point to 10 percent 
the va said it was making the change to reflect recent declines 
in interest rates in financial markets 
fixedrate mortgages for conventional home loans those not 
backed by a government guarantee dropped to a nationwide average 
of 1022 percent last week according to a survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp this rate had been 1042 percent at the 
end of september 
the market conditions permitting the drop reflect a continuing 
move from the high interest rates of the early 1980s said thomas 
k turnage administrator of veterans affairs 
it marked the fourth change in the va rate this year and the 
first drop since rates fell by a full percentage point to 95 
percent on feb 1 rates rose to 10 percent on april 4 and climbed 
to 105 percent on may 23 
the va said that effective tuesday a variety of other mortgage 
rates also will decline by onehalf percentage point graduated 
payment mortgages will drop to 1025 percent home improvement 
loans will decline to 115 percent and loans for mobile homes will 
decline to 125 percent 
the va rates apply to new loans not existing ones va mortgages 
peaked at 175 percent in september 1981 before beginning a decline 
which reached a low for this decade of 85 percent in early 1987 
for the 12 months ending on sept 30 the va said it guaranteed 
232638 loans totaling 173 billion this was down from a record 
348 billion in loans guaranteed in the previous 12 months when 
big declines in mortgage rates sent a record number of homeowners 
rushing to refinance at lower rates

managers of pension funds the backbone of 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos leveraged buyout machine are 
concerned that the aggressive buyout firms 203 billion bid for 
rjr nabisco inc teeters on hostility 
despite the potential for astronomic financial returns on their 
investment several fund managers said monday they would have to 
reconsider their commitment to the new yorkbased firm if nabiscos 
top management ultimately failed to embrace the deal 
last week kohlberg kravis launched a 90ashare tender offer 
for atlantabased nabisco that is contingent upon approval by the 
companys board 
nabiscos top managers who put their company in play by 
announcing they were considering taking the company private for 75 
a share or about 17 billion are not expected to be able to match 
kohlberg kraviss offer but they still are resisting the kohlberg 
kravis bid 
either of those offers would produce the biggest us takeover 
ever and kohlberg kravis was widely viewed as ready to fight to 
maintain its position as the premier buyout firm raising the 
question of whether it might be willing to make its first hostile 
takeover bid negotiations collapsed last week in an attempt to 
share the deal between kohlberg kravis and shearson lehman hutton 
inc nabiscos primary financial partner 
with a 56 billion warchest that can be leveraged tenfold 
by borrowing kohlberg kravis is backed by roughly 70 investors 
that range from the salvation army to the endowment funds of 
harvard and yale to the pension funds of new york wisconsin 
minnesota and other states among the corporations whose pension 
funds have pledged some assets are cocacola georgiapacific and 
united technologies 
minnesotas board of investment which invests state employees 
pension money committed about 200 million to kohlberg kravis on 
the basis that the firm would participate only in friendly 
deals those supported by the targets board 
if they change their procedures wed have to review the 
states commitment said howard bicker the boards executive 
director 
kkr has always said they are going to do friendly deals and 
from what we understand although this has been painted differently 
in some of the press this deal still is basically on friendly 
basis he said 
in the brief span of years that kohlberg kravis has been 
investing in risky leveraged buyout deals bicker said returns 
have averaged 30 percent to 40 percent annually enough to gladden 
any pension manager 
but industry observers note that these buyout funds have been in 
existence too few years to establish a definitive trend there 
isnt a long track record you cant look at 60 years of data 
like you can with the stock market said richard brody an 
investment consultant in the atlanta office of hewitt associates a 
pension consulting firm 
in the five years that the leveraged buyout has blossomed the 
business environment has been particularly favorable to this type 
of transaction brody said 
in a leveraged buyout roughly 90 percent of an acquisition is 
paid for with debt which is then reduced by selling off parts of 
the company or by dramatic costcutting that boosts cash flow 
kohlberg kravis is expected to provide only about 2 billion in 
cash most from its leveraged buyout fund to finance the nabisco 
deal 
pension fund managers note that investments in buyout funds or 
in the buyouts themselves are extremely risky most pension funds 
allocate between 5 percent to 10 percent of their total assets to 
what brody described as riskier and more esoteric forms of 
investment including real estate venture capital oil and gas 
exploration and leveraged buyouts 
a further problem is that there is little liquidity with 
leveraged buyouts it is not easy to get money out while the buyout 
wizards still are trying to sell a companys assets 
john donaldson controller at avon products inc said his 
companys pension fund has about 10 million invested with kohlberg 
kravis while the firms historic pattern of returns makes it 
worth looking at the volatility is much greater than with general 
equities he said 
we would rather they not do hostile deals as a matter of our 
corporate conscience but we do believe kkr does not do hostile 
deals he said 
but given that premise donaldson said that any time a money 
manager such as kohlberg kravis does something out of the 
ordinary something that departs from their historic activity we 
would review the investment 
some corporations that consider themselves potential takeover 
targets might shy from investing in leveraged buyout funds simply 
because they would not want to support an industry that one day 
might threaten them some experts speculated

market changes in the wake of a flurry of 
multibilliondollar buyout bids have prompted campeau corp to 
slash the public offering portion of a junk bond issue it will use 
to finance its acquisition of federated department stores inc 
in a registration statement with the securities and exchange 
commission torontobased campeau said monday it would offer 750 
million of highrisk highyield bonds 
campeau originally had planned to offer 115 billion in junk 
bonds but last week postponed the offering and said it planned to 
restructure it 
the remaining 400 million in financing will be obtained through 
the private placement of notes with institutional investors 
campeau said 
a source close to the situation said last week the bonds were 
not put up for sale as planned because of investor uncertainty over 
junk bonds 
bond traders were concerned about multibilliondollar buyout 
bids including those for rjr nabisco inc and kraft inc and 
trading in corporate bonds was at a near standstill last week 
of the bonds provided for in mondays registration statement 
500 million are due in 2000 and 250 million are due in 2004 
they supersede a planned offering of 300 million in notes due 
in 1994 300 million in notes with extendible due dates and 550 
million in debentures due in 2000 
proceeds of the issue are intended to pay off bridge financing 
supplied by first boston painewebber inc and dillon read amp co 
campeau paid nearly 671 billion for the federated shares but 
the total cost of the takeover was estimated at 88 billion 
last april several days after company chairman robert campeau 
won his battle with rh macy amp co inc for federated he told 
reporters he did not expect to issue junk bonds except for the 
transaction to create a separate campeau subsidiary for one 
federated division ralphs supermarkets 
however campeau changed his mind soon after that statement the 
source said because the potential of the debt was at the time a 
very attractive alternative 
campeau still believed junk bond financing was attractive the 
source said last week but when the market changes you have to 
please your investors some retail industry analysts have said 
investors are uneasy about campeaus financial health 
sales at campeaus federated and allied stores units have fallen 
recently and the two retail divisions reported hefty losses from 
high interest expenses in campeaus most recent quarterly report 
last thursday campeau denied a wall street journal report 
saying that first boston and other underwriters had pulled the bond 
issue back apparently after too many investors had shied away from 
it

ford motor co the nations secondlargest car 
maker has moved to increase its already substantial investment in 
the auto rental business by acquiring a chunk of nonvoting equity 
in budget rent a car corp 
budget announced monday that it was being acquired for 333 
million by an investment group led by the firm gibbons green van 
amerongen ltd and budgets own management budget the nations 
thirdlargest auto renter was the last major car rental company to 
be publicly held 
ford will acquire nonvoting equity in beech holdings corp a 
company being held by the investment group to help finance the 
deal 
the investment comes in addition to fords acquisition last 
december of 60 percent of the stock in hertz corp the nations 
biggest automobile renter 
budgets announcement on monday did not indicate how much equity 
ford would receive or how much money ford would invest budget 
spokeswoman jody wilson declined to discuss matters beyond the 
announcement and spokesmen for ford referred all questions about 
it to budget 
according to the announcement fords financing would be an 
investment in nonvoting preferred stock of beech holdings 
in connection with fords financing budget and ford have 
signed a longterm supply contract continuing their existing supply 
relationship the statement read 
wilson could not say when the current fordbudget contract was 
to expire or for how long the contract was being extended 
she also did not know how many ford cars were being rented from 
budget franchises except to say that in 1987 in the corporately 
owned fleet we think there is a preponderance of lincolnmercury 
cars 
privately owned franchises contract for their own supplies she 
said 
hertz also carries a large share of ford vehicles and some of 
its advertising reads reserve a ford or other fine car 
ford has always had a longstanding relationship with them 
hertz said ford spokesman tom foote when the automaker 
acquired hertz it had to meet a variety of federal regulations 
including those ensuring that the deal would not violate antitrust 
laws 
its a form of vertical integration said professor 
malcolm salter of harvard university called the investment a 
form of vertical integration a process in which one company takes 
over another company it normally would supply 
the question is whether fords acquisition of budget is going 
to give ford a claim on budgets car purchases that they would not 
otherwise have had said economics professor james hamilton of 
wayne state university in detroit 
ford had the account with budget anywayand nobody got 
kicked out of budget he said my instinct that this particular 
arrangement is not likely to have any anticompetitive effects 
ford is not the only automaker with an auto rental investment 
general motors corp acquired a minority interest last month in 
national car rental gm spokesman bill winters of new york city 
reveal the size of the interest or how much gm invested 
from the mid1920s to 1953 gm held an interest in a hertz

stubborn newsprint buyers and a lack of support 
from us manufacturers have forced one large canadian newsprint 
producer to reduce and delay its next scheduled price increase 
canadian pacific forest products ltd of toronto has cut its 
previously announced price increase by a third and says it will 
wait an extra 30 days before trying to push it through 
instead of raising the price to 695 a metric ton on jan 1 from 
650 as initially announced cp forest has told its us customers 
that it will charge 680 starting in february 
the decision comes after major us customers and competitors 
resisted the efforts by a number of canadian and one us newsprint 
producer bowater inc to raise the price as originally planned 
other companies are thinking about similar moves company 
officials said 
we knew it was going to be hard to get said adam zimmerman 
chairman of noranda forest inc of toronto one of the companies 
that announced the original price hike 
if too many companies back off on the increase it means we 
wont get it at all he said 
cp forest said it had notified its customers of the revised 
price hike 
the company was one of a number that announced in late september 
that prices for standard newsprint sold in the eastern us market 
would rise by about 7 percent on jan 1 
canadian companies which provide about 56 percent of 
thenewsprintused in the united states said they needed the 
increase because the effects of last januarys 66 percent rise 
were erased by a decline in the us dollar they also said their 
raw material costs had risen 
newspaper executives in turn contended that demand for 
newsprint was down dramatically due largely to a fall in retail 
advertising and the planned increase therefore was not warranted 
they also said a buildup in newsprint inventories would enable them 
to cut orders for higherpriced paper

budget rent a car corp is going private with the 
help of ford motor co in a move one analyst says may be matched by 
other domestic automakers 
ford will help finance the 333 million deal by purchasing an 
undisclosed amount of nonvoting stock in beech holdings corp 
which is acquiring budget for 30 a share budget said monday 
ford already owns a majority stake in hertz corp the nations 
no 1 rental car company budget is the thirdlargest car rental 
agency behind hertz and secondranked avis 
charles finnie a securities analyst with alex brown amp sons of 
baltimore said fords involvement in the deal highlighted the 
trend toward car company ownership of rental car agencies 
general motors corp has expressed an interest in owning part of 
national car rental 
rental car companies buy about 10 percent of all the new cars 
produced finnie said so when car manufacturers own rental car 
companies you control your supply and you control your 
customers i think this is a trend that will continue 
finnie said the strong performance of rental car companies an 
offshoot of an increase in air travel also has made them 
attractive takeover targets 
budget is the only publicly owned rental car company in the 
united states 
neither ford nor budget would reveal the amount of money ford 
was putting into the deal 
however budget said it had signed a longterm supply 
agreement to continue buying ford cars which make up the bulk of 
budgets corporately owned fleet 
budget now purchases a large number of products from ford and 
we want to maintain that said jerry sloan a spokesman at fords 
headquarters in dearborn mich 
budget spokeswoman jody wilson said she had been directed not to 
comment beyond the text of the companys twopage statement but 
she said the chicagobased company expected to release more 
information later in the week 
budget is traded on the overthecounter market and closed 
monday at 2725 a share up 925 
more than half of budgets stock is owned by gibbons green van 
amerongen ltd the new yorkbased investment banking firm and 
budgets management purchased the company from transamerica corp 
in sept 1986 for 205 million plus the assumption of some 296 
million of budget debt 
budgets management as a group owns about 10 percent of budgets 
stock 
the car agency went public in may 1987 at 14 a share 
beech holdings the company acquiring budget is controlled by 
an investment group of which gibbons green is the general partner 
katherine schipper a professor of accounting at the university 
of chicago said budgets owners appeared to be taking the chunk of 
the company currently owned by the public and selling it to ford 
what youre describing may be some sort of displacement of 
public with private ownership that carries with it first of all 
deep pockets she said in a telephone interview ford makes 
cars budget buys cars so there certainly is some economy of scope 
to be realized here 
although the plan calls for ford to purchase only nonvoting 
shares of beech holdings i imagine there will be some implicit 
monitoring or input by the automaker ms schipper said 
budget reported its thirdquarter earnings rose 57 percent to 
88 million compared with 56 million in the third quarter of 
1987 
its thirdquarter revenue was 1521 million 32 percent higher 
than the 1156 million recorded for the same period of 1987

the government said today that its main 
forecasting gauage of future economic activity edged down 01 
percent in september its second decline in the last three months 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators rose 05 
percent in august and 15 percent in june but fell 07 percent in 
july 
economists believe this rollercoaster performance is a signal 
that the economy which was expanding at a robust pace in the first 
six months of 1988 is slowing down 
indeed overall economic growth as measured by the gross 
national product dropped to an annual rate of 22 percent from july 
through september and many analysts believe that this modest pace 
will continue in the current quarter and for most of next year 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said that the 
leading index was signalling a welcome slowdown which would give 
the economy breathing room and lower inflationary pressures built 
up by heavy demand and tight labor markets 
the 01 percent decline in the leading index was a bit weaker 
than expected many private forecasters were calling for a 02 
percent rise the august index however was revised upward to show 
a 05 percent gain instead of the originally reported 04 percent 
increase 
the index by focusing on forwardpointing business statistics 
is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into 
the future 
many economists who had at one time been fearful that the next 
president would face a recession in his first year in office have 
revised that view and now believe the next downturn will not come 
until 1990 
but the leading index is signalling slower growth for the last 
12 months it has risen just 07 percent compared to an increase 
of 67 percent in the previous 12month period 
for october the biggest factor holding the index back was a 
drop in plant and equipment orders followed by a fall in building 
permits other factors depressing the index were a decline in raw 
materials prices and slower growth in the money supply falling 
prices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand 
in all five of the available nine indicators made positive 
contributions the biggest positive force came from an increase in 
the average workweek other positive factors were a fall in initial 
unemployment claims a rise in stock prices a slowdown in filling 
orders and a rise in orders for consumer goods 
the various changes left the index at 1933 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he is 
predicting gnp growth of just 2 percent next year reflecting a 
slowdown of the export boom which accounted for half of this years

the export boom is clearly gone capital spending has tailed 
off and consumers havent been too eager to spend either said

charles schwab amp co the nations largest 
discount securities broker acknowledged that an internal 
investigation found it made as much as 2 million from unauthorized 
customer trades 
the company said the improper trading has ceased and that it has 
informed the new york stock exchange of the situation 
the schwab trades came to light in the current issue of business 
week magazine in which an unidentified employee said the company 
profited by trading in securities warrants and rights owned by 
customers without their permission 
the employee claimed the practice was sanctioned by the company 
from 1985 until last month 
hugo quackenbush a schwab senior vice president said his firm 
began its internal investigation into the trades oct 6 before the 
magazine story surfaced 
quackenbush said the amounts involved were very small except in 
a couple of cases however he said over the last four years the 
firm may have generated between 1 million to 2 million in 
additional income from these activities and that should be 
returned to the customer 
its a murky area its a complex issue how to deal with this 
if a guy gets 2 cents on one of these trades should we spend 39 
cents on the postage to let him know quackenbush said 
often these deals were not viable for individual shareholders 
but wre profitable for the brokerage 
for example quackenbush said a broker might have sold 10000 
or more expiring rights to purchase stock and have earned a 
commission of 2 cents on each right

a subsidiary of the chubb insurance 
group could be forced to pay more than 16 million in claims to 
illinois farmers if the state can prove the company used deceptive 
and unfair practices in selling what farmers thought was drought 
insurance 
the state department of insurance on monday cited nine alleged 
violations of illinois law in administrative charges filed after a 
fourmonth investigation of federal insurance co a chubb 
subsidiary 
chubb officials had not seen the charges and could not comment 
on them said gail devlin a senior vice president of the company 
in a telephone interview from new york 
the department said federal sold insurance against inadequate 
rain a type of policy not authorized by state law to farmers 
who thought they were buying coverage for extensive droughtrelated 
crop losses 
even if they had issued policies to every farmer who applied 
for and paid premium for this coverage it could have meant a 
windfall for some farmers and provided no protection at all for 
others even if their comparative crop losses were identical said 
robert enoex chief attorney for the insurance department 
state insurance director john washburn scheduled a hearing on 
the charges dec 1 in springfield 
if the charges are proved washburn said federal could be 
required to pay 168 million in claims to 702 farmers and might 
also face suspension or revocation of its insurance license 
insurance agents in the midwest advertised the insurance and 
accepted premiums in late spring when many farmers already 
suspected that a dry growing season was in store 
the state charged that federal allowed farmers to assume they 
had received coverage after filing an application and paying a 
premium but then began rejecting the applications nearly halfway 
through the threemonth term of the policies 
federal also arbitrarily changed the amount of insurance it 
planned to make available in each of several different midwest 
regions whenever it seemed to fit their needs said richard 
carlson assistant director of the insurance department 
federal has paid nearly 6 million in claims to 246 illinois 
farmers and has made an additional 14 million in goodwill 
payments to 720 farmers who applied for but didnt receive 
coverage the insurance department said 
farmers from all over the country who paid premiums are party to 
a classaction lawsuit in us district court in cincinnati that 
seeks to force chubb to extend coverage to anyone who paid a 
premium and still wants the insurance

us automakers built 64 percent fewer cars in 
the 1988 model year than in the previous year and assembled the 
lowest number of cars since 1983 an industry trade journal says 
in mondays edition automotive news said manufacturers in the 
united states made 6903518 cars down from 7375359 in the model 
1987 year 
in 1983 us automakers assembled 5768893 cars 
only ford motor co and american honda motor co showed gains in 
production during the 1988 model year over the 1987 model year 
ford increased its output by 1934 percent and honda went up by 
1575 percent 
ford benefited from strong demand for lincoln continentals and 
ford escorts during the 1988 model year 
general motors corp production fell 1426 percent between 1987 
and 1988 partly because of the sixmonth closing of its 
framingham mass plant chrysler corp production dropped 1778 
percent with the largest percentage production drop coming in its 
plymouth cars at 2428 percent 
production at nissan motor manufacturing co usa fell 3358 
percent in part because its plant in smyrna tenn was producing 
trucks during parts of the year 
new united motor manufacturing inc the joint venture between 
gm and toyota motor corp produced 4324 percent fewer cars in the 
1988 model year compared with 1987 partly because of slow sales of 
the chevrolet nova 
during the 1988 model year volkswagen of america inc ceased 
production at its pennsylvania plant and mazda motor manufacturing 
began production at its plant in flat rock mich

mcorp has filed a lawsuit against the federal 
reserve board challenging a regulatory order that prohibits it from 
paying dividends on its preferred stock 
the suit is the latest clash between mcorp and federal regulators 
over the shape of the recapitalization of the troubled bank holding 
company 
the fed issued its order to stop payment on preferred stock 
dividends on oct 19 two days later mcorp said it would suspend 
such payments but also announced it would put a moratorium on 
payments of about 470 million in debt 
mcorp which recently sought a federally assisted bailout said 
the order came after it notified regulators of its intention to take 
the two actions according to the suit which was filed friday 
mcorp told regulators sometime after oct 7 that the two actions 
would be considered at a board meeting on oct 21 
since mcorp already had come up with a plan to stop the dividends 
and debt payments the order from the fed was unfounded the suit 
said 
mcorp never had and does not have any intention to dissipate 
its assets the suit said moreover the orders are 
unreasonable oppressive and render impractical the conduct of the 
normal business operations of mcorp 
fed officials declined comment on the suit 
the suit comes three weeks after mcorp texas secondlargest 
banking company asked for federal help in a managementled 
reorganization that would include 400 million from the holding 
company 400 million raised from private investors and shareholders 
and an undetermined amount from the federal deposit insurance corp 
analysts estimate the fdic would have to provide about 1 billion

billionaire tsai wanlin the richest man 
in taiwan and one of the wealthiest in the world is a 
ragstoriches midas who shuns publicity loves solitude and finds 
comfort in quiet evenings at home 
the younger of two sons of a poor rice farmer near taipei tsai 
and his brother ran a fruit and vegetable stand as teenagers later 
they purchased a soy sauce factory and branched out into real estate 
today the 64yearold tsai owns taiwans largest insurance 
company and a major real estate and construction conglomerate 
together their total assets of 132 billion taiwan dollars about 
45 billion is equivalent to roughly onefourth of taiwans 
annual national budget 
in july forbes magazine ranked tsai as the worlds eighth 
richest man with a personal fortune estimated at 56 billion 
but wealth a respected taiwan business magazine says tsai is 
even richer the result of a profitable killing on the volatile 
taiwan stock market this year when share prices of his cathay life 
insurance co tripled tsai and his family own roughly 90 percent of 
the companys stock 
tsai has seldom discussed his wealth publicly and he has never 
been interviewed his associates say the reclusive executive doesnt 
like to talk about his business practices and draw attention to his 
fortune 
but cathays managing director liu chialin said tsai told his 
executives once that being a billionaire does not mean very much 
to me and i would be pleased if i could make those who work for me 
millionaires 
a short energetic and solidlybuilt man tsai still spends eight 
hours daily at his office and maintains a lifestyle that is 
conservative when compared to those of other local tycoons 
for instance he has rejected suggestions he trade in his 1987 
mercedez benz 560 sel for a rolls royce because he doesnt want to 
show off said liu also liu said tsai prefers to spend quiet 
evenings at home with his family rather than wine and dine fellow 
businessmen and government officials in the common practice here 
tsai and his family live in an unpretentious apartment building a 
block from his insurance companys new 28story headquarters in 
taipeis business district each of his three sons who work at 
cathay or its affiliate companies have separate apartments in the 
building 
on weekends tsai and his wife of 40 years usually relax at their 
twostory villa in the exclusive yangmingshan suburb of taipei 
he has no hobbies but occasionally plays golf alone because he 
enjoys solitude associates say cathays liu says there is another 
reason why tsai plays alone he walks too fast on the golf course 
and others have a hard time catching up 
tsai and his brother wanchun who died last year established 
cathay life insurance co in 1962 when the government approved 
licenses for taiwans first eight private insurance companies 
for the next few years tsai traveled extensively throughout 
taiwan visiting branch offices and assembling an aggressive sales 
staff today cathay controls almost 60 percent of the insurance 
market 
as cathay profited it became the cornerstone of taiwans second 
largest conglomerate that included extensive interests in financial 
institutions restaurants shipping construction real estate and 
advertising companies 
tsai acquired sole ownership of cathay life insurance in 1979 
when he and his brother agreed to divide their fortunes the younger 
tsai received the flagship insurance company and several affiliates 
cathay now owns 120 office buildings mostly in lucrative 
downtown taipei and a dozen more are under construction the 
company has a policy of renting rather than selling office space 
in the past year cathays purchase of vast tracts of land has 
been blamed for soaring real estate prices that have doubled 
last year when the government liberalized its monetary policies 
cathay began searching for overseas investments earlier this year 
it invested 90 million in the united states and japanese stock and 
bond markets 
liu says tsai remains a cautious businessman and keeps a firm 
grip on each of cathays affiliates he diversifies into allied 
businesses only when he is confident his affiliates are solidly 
profitable 
to boost employee morale tsais conglomerate has a 
profitsharing plan and workers receive generous bonuses last year 
each of the conglomerates 22000 employees received a traditional 
yearend bonus equivalent to six months salary 
in 1985 tsai had to battle to prevent damage to his empire in 
taiwans worst financial scandal blamed on elder brother wanchuns 
second son chenchou 39 a freespending member of parliament 
chenchou was accused of issuing bad checks and diverting 200 
million in loans from a major savings and loans cooperative where he 
was chairman to his other financially troubled companies 
although tsai was not directly involved in the scandal his 
insurance company was threatened because of his family ties tsai 
dispatched 10000 salesmen to placate his clients and made a 
personal loan of 75 million to his nephews savings and loan 
cooperative but refused further assistance 
the government eventually intervened and suspended the operations 
of chenchous cooperative chenchou was convicted of various 
charges and sentenced to jail where he died last year from a liver 
ailment

as hospitals nationwide feel a financial pinch and 
some face the possibility of closing industry officials are turning 
to a traditional source of money theyve seldom tapped 
philanthropists 
despite dire predictions about the effects of new tax laws on 
private contributions industry surveys show that hospitals 
throughout the country are depending more and more on the cash gifts 
of individual donors 
in an attempt to attract those private dollars members of the 
national association for hospital development recently met in dallas 
to unveil a 2 million national campaign seeking private hospital 
contributions 
its goal is to double philanthropic donations to hospitals in the 
united states and canada by 1992 said association spokesman ron 
childress according to an nahd survey 3 billion was given to 
hospitals in the two countries last year 
hospitals do need to look at alternative sources of funding 
childress said philanthropy just seems to be an untapped resource 
its something that hospital ceos and administrators are 
becoming aware of 
economic pressures are so severe for some institutions theyve 
turned to philanthropic contributions to meet operating expenses 
said michael anstendig public relations representative for the 
national association 
there are a lot of hospitals teetering on the edge of financial 
foreclosure he said 
others are investing contributions in new plant and equipment 
for instance at alexandria hospital in alexandria va 125000 in 
contributions from 50 area corporations is helping to fund an 
express care center for the hospitals emergency department at 
cooper hospitaluniversity medical center in camden nj a 
380000 donation is going toward reequipping the hospitals 
cardiac catheterization laboratory 
while colleges and other institutions have long cultivated their 
fundraising efforts hospitals are just starting to get more 
professional in their approach he said 
nahd an organization of 2300 industry officials representing 
1450 nonprofit hospitals has produced public service 
announcements narrated by gregory peck for the organizations new 
campaign 
childress said the campaign concentrates on individuals rather 
than corporations although corporate donations to hospitals have 
not increased significantly in recent years and in some years have 
declined nahds annual surveys show that individual donations have 
gone up 
in 1987 individuals accounted for more than 1 billion in cash 
contributions to hospitals that responded to an association survey 
corporations accounted for 199 million in cash contributions 
those figures compare with a similar survey in 1984 that revealed 
individuals gave 475 million and corporations gave 180 million to 
the hospitals responding 
the number of people donating to hospitals has increased as well 
shooting from 14 million in 1984 to 34 million in 1987 
nahd president and chief executive officer bill mcginly 
acknowledges that philanthropy alone will not cure the increasingly 
troubled hospital industry but he said hospitals are starting to 
recognize its importance 
i know weve seen a tremendous attention to it particularly 
in the last two years mcginly said 
thats the case for the nation at large but in texas which 
leads the nation in hospital closings officials have found the 
economic slowdown is discouraging philanthropic gifts 
i do not see a trend toward private contributions said joe 
dasilva senior vice president for public affairs for the texas 
hospital association 
dasilva said the problem is the slow texas economy its a 
hurdle that the hospitals just cant clear 
so far this year 16 texas hospitals have closed and at least 20 
are expected to have shut down by the end of the year 
like other us hospitals the texas institutions are facing 
financial crises because of a change in medicare reimbursements 
instead of repaying hospitals for a patients actual medical 
expenses the government pays a set rate for a particular diagnosis 
often leaving hospitals without full reimbursement 
other factors include the general trend away from inpatient 
hospital stays and moves by private corporations to cut back on 
medical expenses 
winston c beard president of the hendrick medical center 
foundation in abilene and nahd conference committee chairman said 
tax reform laws that went into effect in 1987 apparently have not 
affected charitable donations 
after 1986 people who do not itemize their tax returns were 
unable to deduct charitable contributions and that raised concern 
that donations to hospitals and other nonprofit organizations might 
drop 
i was amazed at how many billions of dollars they were talking 
about there beard said 
however he said according to the 1988 edition of the 
publication giving usa 937 billion was donated to charities 
throughout the country in 1987 that was up from 88 billion in 1986 
beard said that shows tax deduction apparently is not the primary 
reason people give to charities

in a state where bank holding companies 
are battling to stay afloat by reverting to nontexan control 
fourthgeneration banker tom c frost is confident his cullenfrost 
bankers inc will survive the tough times much as it did during the 
depression 
the 120yearold company founded by a former texas ranger and 
confederate officer is the last holdout in an industry pounded by 
dropping petroleum and real estate prices other texas banks have 
been forced to seek buyers or merge with outofstate groups to keep 
running 
cullenfrost with 13 banks in san antonio dallas houston 
austin and corpus christi has more than 3 billion in assets it 
was the only texas bank holding company with assets of more than 
15 billion to make a profit last year 
frost the fourth generation chief executive officer as a youth 
witnessed the bank survive the depression and later sat through 
board meetings with his relatives he says he isnt surprised his 
holding company has so far weathered the bailout storm 
we werent so brilliant the 60yearold frost says of the 
banks survival we used a cultural longstanding way of doing 
business and that served us well 
i will criticize myself for being less innovative i was taught 
that we made our progress through longterm relationships and not 
through individual transactions and that is kind of the key in the 
real estate business he said 
cullenfrost with its conservative moneylending attitude has 
withstood an economic crisis that in the last two years has gobbled 
up texas commerce bancshares allied bancshares banctexas group 
inc first city bancorporation texas american bancshares national 
bancshares corp and most recently mcorp 
bill carden a former banker and now a bank consultant in waco 
texas says many banks were living high on the hog in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s and failed to see the trouble ahead 
it was just a classic example of a case of a state that shot 
itself in the foot carden said next year is going to be 
another tough year you dont recover from 10 years of bad lending 
in one or two years 
he says cullenfrosts conservative attitude helped it as well 
as frosts dedication 
i always had the feeling that cullenfrost was a pretty 
well run company carden said their lead bank in san antonio 
has always been a wellrun bank and tom frost is kind of a legend in 
the business he has surrounded himself with a lot of good people 
col tom frost who led a confederate company during the civil 
war founded a mercantile trade business that later became frost 
national bank in 1868 the colonels son tom jr guided the bank 
during a money panic in 1907 and several years later helped 
incorporate the federal reserve bank of dallas 
another of the colonels sons jh frost guided the bank 
through the depression surviving a huge depositors run j h 
frost eventually turned the operation over to tom frost iii his 
nephew and the father of the current bank leader tom frost iv 
in 1977 frost bank merged with houstons cullen bank founded by 
the descendants of hugh roy cullen a houston businessman and 
philanthropist in 1982 the kempner family of galveston merged 
their united states national bankshares into cullenfrost 
in the past three years the plunging petroleum industry and the 
reeling real estate market began to take a toll on numerous banks 
around the state and cullenfrosts were no exception 
the company had to write off 53 million in bad energy loans 
during 1983 and 1984 it could have turned to the real estate 
industry to recoup them but didnt partly because of the 
generationsold philosophy of doing business with longterm 
customers the tradition proved to be a wise course for cullenfrost 
i remember my uncle specifically telling me tom remember we 
lend to people who happen to be in the cattle business who then 
obviously have cattle to offer as collateral he said 
we make the assessment beginning with taking care of the 
customer and trying to build a relationship and dont just leap to 
the fact that anybody who walks in with a head of cattle is honest 
and we will lend xamount of dollars to 
cullenfrost was able to make profits by selling its credit card 
business for 57 million in 1986 last year it sold its highrise 
san antonio headquarters which will generate a 17 million profit 
over 13 years 
frost who had wanted to become a petroleum engineer some 40 
years ago now is glad he chose the family business he predicts 
more rocky times ahead but is confident his banks will survive 
because it has more equity than nonperforming assets 
the real estate market has not come out of it in texas he 
said there are still problems developing in the banking industry 
and for us too but we look upon ours as manageable and that we can 
handle with our own resources

even before the latest hotstock mania the one 
based on rumors about which company is likely to be raided next the 
stock markets had become rabbit warrens 
there are many animals on wall street but the most familiar of 
them are bulls who are aggressively optimistic beasts and bears 
who are generally more dour and often less active and there are 
rabbits 
rabbits run here and there nibbling all the time rather than 
settling down for a good dinner they taste the grass then the 
clover and lettuce and turnip greens they seldom stay long in a 
spot something always looks better 
they are speculators and measurements of their activities show 
how active theyve become between 1940 and 1975 investors on the 
new york stock exchange held their stocks an average of five years 
now the average is 17 months 
rabbits generally are institutions rather than individuals and 
again the statistics demonstrate this finding individuals own 60 
percent of all common stocks but they account for less than 20 
percent of nyse volume 
gerald w perritt editor of the chicagobased newsletter 
investment horizons and a former college professor of 
mathematics offers this startling observation 
if institutional investors traded with the same frequency as 
individual investors daily volume would shrink by 64 percent the 
share turnover rate would drop to approximately 26 percent and the 
average holding period would be lengthened from 165 months to 
nearly four years 
perritt whose curiosity and skill draw him into areas unfamiliar 
to other market analysts loaded his computer recently with data on 
the trading behavior of equity mutual funds over the past four years 
heres what i found he said over the period 19841987 
the annual portfolio turnover rate for equity funds averaged 75 
percent that is the typical equity fund held on to its stock 
purchases an average of 16 months 
furthermore portfolio turnover has been on the rise the 
turnover rate averaged 69 percent in 1984 about 73 percent in 1985 
77 percent in 1986 and a whopping 80 percent last year 
perritt found that nine of the 288 equity funds surveyed had 
portfolio turnover rates in excess of 300 percent last year that 
is they turned their portfolio over at least three times in 12 
months causing him to observe 
if your stock broker maintained this turnover rate in a 
discretionary account he could be successfully sued by a customer 
for churning the account 
after viewing such figures there remains no mystery about why 
the stock market is so volatile and sometimes erratic it has become 
a market of inout trading of speculation it has become a 
gathering of rabbits 
portfolio insurance program trading and various 
computeroperated buy and sell programs are at the root of the 
ballooning trading volume it becomes a contagious thing those 
ordinarily inclined to hold stocks for the long term for example 
are drawn into the speculative game simply to survive 
and that leads to another irony numerous surveys down through 
the years have shown that more stable longterm investing patterns 
provide small investors with either better or at least equally good 
results 
moreover longterm traders dont pay the big commissions or fees 
that are paid by speculators they sleep better too and so long as 
they dont sell they also get a tax deferment they pay no capital 
gains taxes until they sell 
if all this frightens you perritt offers a possible alternative 
head for the smallfirm segment of the stock market he says 
turnover is much less there and many of the smaller companies have 
better growth rates too 
in addition some of these smaller companies are undervalued 
why because says perritt they are too small to attract the big 
institutional portfolio managers the rabbits who churn the bigger 
markets

chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson under 
increasing pressure over britains surging inflation rate trade 
deficit and interest rates on tuesday predicted what economists 
call a soft landing for the british economy next year 
economic growth was expected to slow to 3 percent in 1989 
following a fasterthanexpected expansion of 45 percent this year 
lawson said in his annual autumn statement in parliament 
growth next year is forecast to return at a sustainable 
level lawson said while inflation will resume its downward 
path 
under the british budgetary process the chancellor outlines the 
governments public spending plans in the autumn statement and its 
revenue raising plans in the march budget he uses both occasions to 
make economic forecasts 
the annual inflation rate would rise to more than 6 percent in 
the fourth quarter peak at an unspecified level in the middle of 
1989 and then fall back to 5 percent by the end of next year lawson 
predicted 
the countrys current account deficit which includes invisible 
trade such as overseas investment earnings would balloon to a 
largerthanexpected 13 billion pounds 23 billion this year and 
then shrink somewhat to 11 billion pounds 195 billion next 
year lawson said 
unemployment which has fallen sharply and stands at 8 percent 
was expected to fall further lawson said 
the new forecasts showed that lawsons march predictions of 3 
percent economic growth 4 percent inflation and a current account 
deficit of 4 billion pounds 71 billion this year were way off 
the mark 
there have been increasing concerns that the economy currently 
growing at an annual rate of 4 percent is overheating as the 
inflation rate has risen to 57 percent from 33 percent in january 
this has prompted prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
government to push up britains benchmark interest rate the 
commercial banks base lending rate to its current 12 percent level 
from 75 percent in june 
lawson attributed the expected fourthquarter increase in 
inflation to higher mortgage rates following the governments move 
to push up interest rates 
the chancellor reiterated his commitment to raising british 
interest rates to curb resurgent inflation which is mrs thatchers 
no 1 economic priority 
without specifying lawson said interest rates would be kept at 
whatever level is necessary to curb inflation 
the financial markets had little reaction to lawsons speech 
which dealers said contained no major surprises 
the pound was little changed at 17620 afterward and the 
financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished the day 54 
points or 03 percent higher at 18578 
he did predict a soft landing for the economy as had been 
expected said ian harwood an economist at the london investment 
firm warburg securities 
but to cheers from the opposition benches labor party member 
gordon brown attacked the speech saying this is an autumn 
statement that compounds rather than corrects the errors of the 
budget 
mrs thatchers cabinet agreed to the spending plans for the year 
starting april 1 at a tuesday morning meeting 
lawson said britain would enjoy a biggerthanexpected fiscal 
budget surplus of 10 billion pounds 177 billion in the current 
year compared with a previously forecast surplus of 3 billion 
pounds 53 billion 
lawson announced in march that there would be a surplus the 
first in nearly 20 years at that time he slashed the top income 
tax rate from 60 percent to 40 percent and the basic rate from 27 
percent to 25 percent 
many government critics blame those cuts for the current consumer 
spending boom in britain 
on tuesday the chancellor said public spending for 19881989 was 
expected to amount to 1535 billion pounds 272 billion less than 
the 15675 billion pounds 277 billion previously planned partly 
thanks to a drop in social security spending because of lower 
unemployment 
that meant total public spending which mrs thatcher has aimed 
to curtail would represent less than 40 percent of national income 
this year the lowest level in 20 years lawson said

can sears really do it can an oldstyle merchant 
adopt a 1980s retailing strategy and fast 
those were the questions tuesday one day after the nations 
largest retailer announced a drastic shift in its merchandising 
strategy in an effort to recapture lost profits 
optimism was running low that sears roebuck and co struggling 
to catch up to its younger and more successful competitors could 
pull off such a fundamental change in the way it does business 
you can bring your prices down but its going to take awhile 
to change your image said joseph ronning a retail industry 
analyst with the investment firm brown brothers harriman inc 
sears said monday it was switching to a policy of everyday low 
pricing and away from the regular prices and frequent sales the 
102yearold retailer has been known for 
sears stung by three consecutive quarters of declining profits 
announced the change as part of a restructuring that also included 
the planned sale of the sears tower in chicago and the companys 
coldwell bankers commercial real estate subsidiary as well as a 
buyback of 10 percent of its 380 million outstanding shares 
the company said it would concentrate on consumeroriented 
businesses retailing insurance residential real estate and 
financial services 
these changes however sweeping are easy compared with the task 
of changing the publics perception of sears 
the company is seen as a stodgy oldfashioned retailer where 
you can get good car batteries and appliances but its no longer 
the store many consumers think of first before they go shopping 
in terms of raw sales numbers sears runs far ahead of the 
nations other big retailers through september the company racked 
up 2017 billion in sales compared to 1692 billion at k mart 
corp and 1232 billion at walmart stores inc 
but sears has failed to keep up with retail trends and changing 
american lifestyles and discount and specialty stores have eroded 
the companys market share by offering wider selection and more 
exciting shopping atmospheres 
theyve been criticized for losing the old sears customer who 
goes to shop somewhere else for lower prices said edward johnson 
an analyst with prescott ball amp turben inc 
one of the companys biggest rivals 25yearold walmart 
rocketed to the forefront of the retailing industry on the same 
everyday low pricing strategy that sears is now embracing 
walmarts sales have risen at a doubledigit percentage rate 
while other retailers have eked out much smaller gains during a 
continuing retail sales slump 
theres an increasing awareness that the everyday low pricing 
policy is the successful way to go in the current marketplace 
said ronning the brown brothers harriman analyst 
in spite of that growing awareness sears continued to offer 
periodic sales on items that were regularly priced most of the time 
noted johnson their customer doesnt read the paper enough times 
to follow when the promotions are 
as a result consumers who wanted to be sure of a better price 
went to stores like walmart k mart and other discounters 
abandoning sears in the process 
sears also has been slow to adopt other successful retailing 
strategies 
the company only recently began selling national brand appliances 
next to its kenmore line although specialty retailers like circuit 
city have drawn customers away by providing more variety 
and even when montgomery ward amp co added names like maytag 
general electric sony and panasonic to its appliance line several 
years ago and saw its sales go up sears stuck by its private label 
the slow pace of change at sears is what casts doubt on the 
companys ability to turn its sales around 
analysts looking beyond the companys selling floor are 
concerned by the unwieldy bureaucracy that has clung to tradition 
johnson noted that the company recently set up two separate 
buying operations for its store and catalog divisions which serve 
very different customers that should have been done earlier he 
said 
he said tuesday of sears plans well see 
ronning said the company must undertake a major advertising 
program to persuade customers to come back 
sears has to show the consumer it is competitively priced and 
they have to do something to make the store somewhat more 
exciting he said 
investors also seemed unsure about prospects for a turnaround 
sears stock was unchanged at 4175 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading tuesday after having fallen 187 following the 
announcement monday

a delaware judge on tuesday ordered 
polaroid corp to give investor roy e disney the names and 
addresses of workers who participate in an employee stock plan 
handing disney a minor victory in his battle to buy the instant film 
company 
the ruling by delaware chancery court vicechancellor carolyn 
berger if unchallenged would ease the way for disney to promote 
his hostile 26 billion buyout offer to polaroid employees 
the ruling was announced here late tuesday by disneys shamrock 
holdings inc the case is in delaware court because that is where 
polaroid is incorporated 
a spokeswoman at polaroids headquarters in cambridge mass 
marcia phillips would not comment when asked if polaroid would 
appeal the decision 
polaroids new employee stock ownership plan created as part of 
a recent restructuring is seen by some as an antitakeover defense 
disney nephew of famed animator walt disney has made his buyout 
offer conditional on dismantling of the plan 
polaroid had refused a shamrock request for a list of names and 
addresses of employees in the plan 
that legal wrangle is separate from a suit by polaroid also in 
delaware chancery court seeking an order blocking shamrocks 
42ashare tender offer for polaroid stock trial of that suit is 
set to begin thursday 
in another development tuesday shamrock extended the deadline 
for acceptance of its tender offer from monday to nov 17 and said 
about 68 percent of polaroid stockholders had offered to sell their 
shares as of monday 
a parallel offer from shamrock offers 44 a share if polaroid 
management negotiates a friendly takeover

continuously published daily newspaper announced tuesday it would 
start a sunday edition just months after it narrowly averted 
extinction 
the tabloid newspaper is to begin a sunday edition march 5 it 
will sell for 1 
plans to launch it came after repeated requests and offers of 
support from our major advertisers and dealers said peter s 
kalikow who bought the post from rupert murdoch in march 
kalikow also predicted the post after years of losing money 
would begin to show a profit sometime next year current losses are 
in a range that are acceptable to me he said but declined to 
provide specifics 
kalikow a realestate development millionaire said he would 
invest 25 million in the new sunday edition next year and increase 
the papers staff by about 60 people including 30 reporters and 
editors he said he expected an initial press run of 500000 copies 
per sunday 
the post was on the verge of ceasing publication until kalikow 
and murdoch its owner since 1976 negotiated major concessions and 
buyouts from the papers unions 
union reaction to the sunday edition was favorable said tom 
pennacchio secretary treasurer of the newspaper guild which 
represents the posts editorial staff 
although new yorkers already have their choice of the new york 
times the daily news and new york newsday on sundays kalikow and 
post publisher peter price say there is room for another the sunday 
times sells for 125 while the daily news and newsday sell for 1 
kalikow said the posts losses were a minor fraction of the 
650000 per week the tabloid was losing when he purchased it from 
murdoch and that advertising was expanding average daily 
circulation was about 600000 during october he said 
eric philo an analyst who follows the newspaper industry for the 
investment firm goldman sachs said he didnt see a place in the 
citys highly competitive newspaper market for another sunday paper 
and predicted it would only increase the financial drain on the post
