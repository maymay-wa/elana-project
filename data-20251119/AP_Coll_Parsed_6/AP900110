use the shuttles 50foot robot to capture the science satellite 
that is in danger of falling back to earth 
once she grasps it she will hold it and turn it frequently for 
as long as five hours so other crew members can photograph each of 
the exterior experiments to document their condition in case they 
dont all withstand the trip back to earth 
mrs dunbar 40 has simulated the satellite retrieval at least 
100 times 
i feel comfortable with it she said in an interview im 
really anxious to see how it really responds on orbit

a letter was posted in norway with 
only the family name of the addressee on the envelope yet 
delivered correctly to a family in an english village six days 
later the recipients said 
we are just full of admiration for the post office but we 
cant imagine how they managed it said marit torkildsen of great 
baddow near chelmsford essex 30 miles east of london 
she said an elderly friend wrote family torkildsen on the 
envelope and posted it on dec 14 from rjukan in the telemark 
district of southern norway it was delivered on dec 20 but the 
story has only just emerged in the local essex chronicle weekly 
mrs torkildsens husband tore said maybe the post office 
in rjukan saw our friend buy the stamp or post the letter and knew 
it was for britain so they put it in the british bag and maybe 
some sorter in london knew the torkildsens lived in essex so he put 
it in the essex bag the whole thing is a mystery to us 
post office headquarters in london said it knew nothing of the

chinese scientists have discovered near the 
northeastern city of shenyang what they say is the worlds largest 
and oldest known meteorite an official newspaper said today 
geologists estimate the meteorite known to local farmers as 
huashitai hill is 45 to 46 billion years old and fell to earth 
19 billion years ago the china daily said 
they said the meteorite mound located about 12 miles southeast 
of shenyang is roughly 600 feet long 250 feet wide and 300 feet 
high it weighs about 2 million tons and is covered with granite 
the daily said geologists discovered the meteorite in 1984 after 
deposits of ferronickel ore were detected there further 
excavation found substances distinctively different in structural 
composition and geological age from the surrounding area 
the scientists found in the area around the granite foundation a 
glasslike substance which was formed under high temperatures and 
pressure when the meteorite hit the earth 
geologists have since found evidence of a large group of 
meteorites covering up to 120 square miles in the suburbs of 
shenyang 
the daily said the meteorite predates the oldest rock 
originating on earth believed to be about 36 billion years old 
and its nodular structure is a byproduct of the formation of the 
solar system 
the earth is believed to be bout 45 billion years old 
study of the meteorite will provide valuable information about 
the secrets of the universe it said 
a planetarium is to be built on the site and the place will be 
declared a stateprotected nature reserve

in a former communist party 
neighborhood headquarters near the center of bucharest some proud 
old men gather each day to talk about treason 
that crime and its punishment is a topic these men understand 
perhaps better than anyone else in romania 
i was accused of high treason of plotting to take up arms 
against the communist order said 69yearold vasile boaru 
were you guilty asked a reporter 
of course laughed boaru triumphantly 
boaru and about a score of other men had come monday to the old 
party building to join the association of former political 
prisoners 
the organization has enrolled about 1000 members in bucharest 
since it was founded jan 2 days after the overthrow and execution 
of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a popular uprising 
more are joining the organization every day as the word spreads 
and it is trying to form chapters throughout of the country 
this association proposes to defend the rights of former 
political prisoners said dumitru secara an official with the 
new organization 
it wants to push the new government to clear the name of all 
former political prisoners and to count their time in prison as 
work years toward their retirement said secara 75 
the association also intends to form action groups to help 
entertain and care for former political prisoners too sick to care 
for themselves and secara said it wants to organize education 
programs for the public to dramatize romanias years of tyranny 
secara spent 13 years in prison from 1949 to 1963 for high 
treason his crime was passing information about the trial of a 
dissident to british military officers 
he recalled being held with two other prisoners in a 
1squareyard cell and of other times when he was chained in a cell 
so small he could not sit down 
members of the association of former political prisoners want 
the world to also remember there was a communist tyranny before 
ceausescus rule from 1945 to 1964 there were about half a 
million political prisoners secara said 
never again can we accept the idea of communism said boaru 
who in october 1947 began 17 years in prison 
ask these men about the prisons where they treated us like 
animals worse than animals where they chained our hands and feet 
where they beat us and where they didnt give us food 
these reds werent men they were beasts beasts who slowly 
over the years killed thousands of romanians he said 
boaru held out an old newspaper with a short story about his 
trial he and two codefendants were given lengthy prison terms 
and three others were executed by firing squad 
we want to show by our numbers just how big of a protest there 
was against the communists said member dumitru latea 
latea 75 served 15 years in prison after he was convicted in 
1948 of taking part in an armed plot against the communist order 
octavian radulescu jailed eight years for treason said he 
believes the association gives former prisoners a way to restore 
the human dignity that was stolen from us until now 
there can be no more hiding of the truth this association 
will help us bring our feelings out of the dark said radulescu 
60 
boaru agreed describing the association as a kind of refuge for 
men whose lives had been destroyed by tyranny 
i will do everything i can for this association for the rest 
of my life said boaru for me it will be my home until i 
die

nicolae ceausescu ordered troops to 
fire on protesters at the start of romanias uprising and his wife 
told soldiers who didnt want to shoot a pregnant woman to run her 
down with a tank instead the interior minister says 
interior minister mihai ghitac the former military commander of 
the bucharest garrison and one of the first generals to side with 
civilians seeking ceausescus ouster said in an interview tuesday 
that about 800 armed ceausescu loyalists had been captured since 
the uprising began dec 15 
he also said the army knew the location of the few still at 
large and was preparing to close in on them 
the daily newspaper adevarul said tuesday that ceausescus 
youngest son nicu a former party secretary in sibiu southern 
transylvania personally ordered army and police units to shoot on 
revolutionaries in the city last month 
the dictator and his wife elena were toppled in the popular 
revolt convicted of grave crimes and executed dec 25 
the stocky lieutenant generals eyes misted with tears as he 
spoke of the massacre in middecember of unarmed demonstrators in 
timisoara 300 miles northwest of bucharest the atrocity that 
unleashed the popular revolution 
ceausescu gave strict orders to shoot ghitac said 
special units had been sent to infiltrate army ranks and 
these units provoked general genocide in timisoara 
mrs ceausescu the virtual secondincommand was no less 
harsh ghitac said 
they telephoned the wife of the despot that they could not 
shoot because there were women and children he said she was 
told over the telephone that a pregnant woman told the soldiers 
shoot and you will kill two people 
the tyrants wife said if you cant shoot go with tanks 
against them 
he depicted the ceasescus after their capture and in the final 
days as blind to the reality of a romania impoverished because of 
their irrational economic and social policies 
an interrogator asked them why did you leave the romanian 
people without food children without food ghitac said the 
answer was have you seen anyone die of hunger in romania 
government officials last week said about 2000 ceausescu 
supporters had been detained but that figure appeared to encompass 
those who resisted the army and others who did not fight but were 
suspected of serious wrongdoing under the dictator 
ghitac also said he intended to open strictly ethnic romanian 
police ranks to members of the hungarian and german minorities 
he said this would reduce the resentment by those groups of what 
they saw primarily as a force directed against them under ceausescu 
other senior romanian officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said some police officers recently had been lynched in 
parts of transylvania home to most of romanias 17 million 
ethnic hungarians by vengeful members of the minority group 
ghitac would not comment beyond saying that some ethnic 
hungarians had demonstrated in an extremist way recently and 
we had to move some police to other parts of the country 
the minister said an amnesty of political prisoners declared 
after the ceausescus execution last month extended to those 
incarcarated by preceausescu communists more than four decades ago 
it was likely that some of those freed had actually been in 
prison for more than 40 years ghitac said adding that he knew of 
no examples 
ghitac whose ministry was in charge of all police spoke from a 
spacious office where walkin closets harbored massive safes left 
locked but keyless by his predecessor 
this was securitate secret police said ghitac suggesting 
the safe contained incriminating ceausescuera documents but we 
dont want to wreck them unless we have to 
the feared department of state security which ran the secret 
police was disbanded after the ceausescus downfall

with its vindictive police closed courtroom and 
western outrage the trial of dissident sergei kuznetsov seemed a 
throwback to the repression of the brezhnev era 
but there was one big difference kuznetsov won 
an appeals court overturned the dissident journalists 
threeyear prison sentence monday and he was free and recuperating 
from repeated hunger strikes in a hospital tuesday human rights 
activists said 
the action capped a yearlong legal battle that turned kuznetsov 
from a littleknown dissident in the ural mountains city of 
sverdlovsk into the most celebrated victim of human rights abuse in 
mikhail s gorbachevs soviet union 
the late nobel peace prize winner andrei d sakharov western 
diplomats and international human rights groups took up kuznetsovs 
cause barraging soviet authorities with protests against his 
treatment the underground journal he worked for carried almost 
daily reports of his struggle 
kuznetsovs victory monday was only partial he had been 
convicted of libel and resisting police the appeals court reduced 
the libel conviction and threw out the charge of resisting police 
it cut his sentence to less than the time he has already been 
imprisoned and accused the police of serious mistakes 
his case served as a signpost of how far the soviet union has 
come from its persecution of dissidents under leonid i brezhnevs 
regime in the 1960s and 1970s to gorbachevs vision of a more just 
state ruled by law 
kuznetsovs lawyer np yurchenko told the court in remarks 
broadcast on soviet tv public opinion in the world and in this 
country will judge the progress of perestroika according to the 
outcome of this trial 
western diplomats say trials of dissidents are unusual in 
todays soviet union 
its impossible to say how many other kuznetsovs there are out 
there said a diplomat who spoke on condition he not be 
identified but as far as we know it was the only ongoing case 
where someone was being persecuted because they were an active 
member of a human rights committee 
in an aboutface from the scorn they used to display toward 
dissidents the soviet public and media clearly sympathized with 
kuznetsov 
staterun tvs sunday night news program seven days 
reporting the latest on kuznetsovs appeal asked pointedly what 
was kuznetsov punished for for crime or for dissent isnt there a 
hidden political motive here 
the progressive newspaper moscow news branded the judges 
uncivilized for handing kuznetsov 35 a threeyear sentence 
when he was so weak from a 34day hunger strike he had to be 
brought into court on a stretcher you must not exchange the 
mantle of a judge for that of an inquisitor it said 
kuznetsovs saga began when he was arrested in december 1988 at 
an unsanctioned rally in sverdlovsk protesting the detention of 
political prisoners dissidents say 
a member of the anticommunist democratic union he had been 
distributing leaflets that according to the moscow news accused 
the local police chief of being a collaborator with murderers and 
drowning in corruption and the police in general of being 
murderers 
he alleged police beat him in prison and began a hunger strike 
on feb 22 1989 taking nothing but water for weeks the trial 
which started in april and dragged on until november appeared 
irregular in that it went on behind closed doors and the judge 
barred kuznetsov from the courtroom saying his behavior was 
disruptive sergei kotov another kuznetsov lawyer stalked out of 
the courtroom in protest at one point 
soviet legal experts say there was no justification for holding 
the trial in a closed court and that violation alone was enough to 
require the sentence be canceled many observers also considered it 
excessively harsh that kuznetsov was held in custody during the 
entire pretrial and trial period although it is legal under 
soviet law 
there also were questions about whether the leaflets kuznetsov 
distributed actually constituted libel in a time when even 
politburo member yegor k ligachev has been accused publicly of 
corruption 
legal expert alexander larin said in the moscow news that it was 
difficult to understand how kuznetsov could be accused of hitting 
policemen while according to the conviction papers his arms and 
legs were held by five policemen 
the questions festered and the western and soviet human rights 
advocates continued to press as 1989 ended things appeared to 
begin to go kuznetsovs way 
after two soviet parliamentarians visited in late december and 
said kuznetsov should be transferred from jail to a hospital he 
was moved although he remained under guard 
when his appeal opened last week the press was allowed to 
attend and seven days commented from the courtroom that public 
opinion strongly opposed the threeyear sentence 
interior ministry officials said monday there were no longer any 
political prisoners in the soviet union western and some soviet 
human rights groups continue to dispute that

the kremlin has canceled half its standing order 
of 12000 copies a day of britains communist newspaper the 
morning star threatening the survival of the daily that for years 
was a faithful friend to moscow 
the action by the morning stars main customer to meet 
moneysaving guidelines under mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
economic restructuring has thrown the 23500circulation tabloid 
into financial disarray 
industry observers believe the 60yearold newspaper could fold 
unless it is revamped radically 
with moscow refusing to support it where does it go i cant 
see czechoslovakia hungary and romania diving in to fill the 
breach said tony loynes news editor of the uk press gazette 
a british media trade journal 
its very hard to see how its going to survive without 
significant funding of some sort its not a viable enterprise 
he said in an interview tuesday 
chief executive mary rosser said the 17member committee that 
administers the newspaper will meet friday to discuss a strategy 
for survival 
options include raising the newspapers 48cent cover price 
investing in new technology to boost circulation or firing some of 
the 80 employees but a combination of measures is most likely 
mrs rosser said 
its a crisis but its not one that we cant overcome she 
said in an interview the papers history is one of crisis 
weve got a terrific team who are deeply committed to the 
paper and a devoted readership thats been highly supportive 
she said 
the mezhkniga company the distributor in moscow has bought 
12000 copies a day for decades making the morning star one of the 
few englishlanguage newspapers available in moscow during the cold 
war years on dec 25 however the distributor halved its order 
after the communist party ordered it to operate on quasicommercial 
lines 
the company told the morning star it has been forced to reduce 
its expenditures of badly needed foreign hard currency 
copies are flown to moscow by the state airline aeroflot and 
sold from hotels kiosks and by subscription to institutes 
libraries and schools where it is used an englishlanguage teaching 
aid 
another london newspaper the independent reported that 
thousands of copies of the morning star are dumped unsold 
in 1984 moderate leaders of the communist party of great 
britain lost a twoyear struggle to regain control of the morning 
star from hardliners who opposed the party leaderships often 
critical stance on matters affecting the communist countries the 
hardliners later joined others in forming the breakway communist 
party of britain 
but morning star newsroom sources quoted by the independent said 
the communist daily might now shift toward the center following 
the soviet example in an effort to woo new readers 
the morning star will lose an estimated 660000 of its annual 
income of 28 million because of the soviet cut 
since 1946 the newspaper has survived partly on a fighting 
fund of reader donations it is appealing for 25000 in january 
and asked readers to bear in mind the urgent necessity for a 
blockbuster donation every month this year 
the newspaper which marked its 60th anniversary last week laid 
off nearly onefourth of its print workers in 1986 after a string 
of annual deficits including a 500000 loss in 198586 
its circulation has dropped from a 1947 peak of 143000 
alongside a parallel decline in membership of the communist party 
the newspaper is the most sober of britains tabloids devoid of 
the topless models sex scandals and bingo games churned out by 
some of its rivals although it does include a twopage sports 
section embracing superior horse racing tips 
even in a time of turmoil in the communist world the morning 
stars focus is resolutely on britain the opening of the berlin 
wall rated a single column on page one beside a huge headline on a 
local labor dispute

pressure for change in frances troubled communist party whose 
hardline leader and stalinist views are losing support both in the 
party and at the polls 
george marchais the party leader for 17 years is battered by a 
reformist wing within his own party as well by other political 
adversaries 
among the recent allegations are that marchais maintained close 
ties including vacation outings with ousted romanian dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
when marchais was a rising star in the mid1950s the party 
dominated the left in french politics and took a quarter of the 
vote in recent national elections it has been hardpressed to get 
10 percent 
party membership once officially set at 700000 is now 
believed to be less than 200000 
reformers who advocated changes introduced by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev have been purged in keeping with the french 
partys stalinist traditions 
like other large communist parties in europe the french party 
maintained it saw glasnost coming and prepared for it with 
eurocommunism a 1970s attempt to reconcile communist orthdoxy with 
life in a western parliamentary democracy 
but the reformist wing maintains the party has not been able to 
adjust to the reality of modern french society the shrinking of 
the bluecollar population that long was its power base and the 
emergence of a high technology serviceoriented economy 
it would like to fashion leftwing rainbow politics 
reaching out to embrace such issues as ecology womens rights and 
educational reform 
editorial cartoons in rightist and leftist daily newsapers have 
poked fun at marchais recently while reporting on the growing 
dissent within the party 
in reply the communist daily lhumanite published two pages of 
letters tuesday from the sackloads it said were arriving each day 
supporting marchais and his policies 
it also published four pages of pictures of ceausescu posing 
with other french leaders from the left and right showing that 
marchais was not alone in cozing up to the romanian dictator 
in a tv interview marchais said he met ceausescu three or four 
times the last time in 1984 at a meeting of communist party 
leaders he said he took a few days off in romania after those 
talks and had not returned since 
replying to those who want him to give up the leadership 
marchais said he had no intention of resigning but wanted to work 
unremittingly to develop party policies in line with my 
responsibilities 
several prominent members of the reformist wing known as the 
renovators have called for a special party congress to halt the 
partys decline rather than waiting for the scheduled congress at 
the end of the year 
some reformers say at the last congress in 1987 resolutions 
expressing concern about the situation in eastern europe were 
prevented by party hardliners from reaching the floor 
party rules specify that a special congress can be held if more 
than half the members are in favor let them try and we will 
see marchais said 
one of the leaders of the reformist wing felix daumette a 
former member of the central committee said the party cannot 
afford to wait until the end of the year if it wants to halt its 
decline 
he said the communist parties in eastern euorope that collapsed 
came from the same mold as the french party and therefore are 
caught up in the same failure 
the french party must redefine itself and might even have to 
consider as the italian communist party is doing whether its name 
should be changed he said

divers pulled a gun from a river tuesday giving 
investigators hope they have another piece to the puzzle of the 
stuart murder mystery 
the registration numbers on the gun recovered from the pines 
river matched those on a pistol reported stolen from the fur shop 
where charles stuart worked the boston globe reported in wednesday 
edition citing unidentified sources 
it certainly does look promising as the gun that was allegedly 
thrown into the river on the night in question suffolk county 
district attorney newman flanagan said earlier were encouraged 
by the evidence in that it corroborates statements that people have 
made to the police 
flanagan said a grand jury would convene friday to hear 
witnesses 
on tuesday night several hundred people gathered at a church in 
mission hill the neighborhood where stuart and his pregnant wife 
carol were shot oct 23 for a service aimed at easing racial 
tensions 
moving on thats what the city of boston is doing here 
tonight mayor raymond flynn who helped organize the ecumenical 
healing service told the racially mixed crowd at mission church 
stuart who committed suicide at age 30 thursday after his 
brother implicated him in the slaying of his pregnant wife had 
claimed he and his wife were shot by a black man a black man was 
named as a suspect in the case but was later cleared 
since thursday police had searched the pines river in revere 
for the 38caliber nickelplated snubnose revolver 
stuart originally told police he and his wife were shot by a 
mugger who forced his way into their car when they left a hospital 
birthing class he was seriously wounded his wife carol died 
hours after the shooting and their premature son christopher 
delivered by caesarean died 17 days later 
but stuarts brother matthew told authorities last week that 
he had met charles stuart in the area that night and that his 
brother passed him his wifes handbag which contained some 
personal items plus a handgun 
matthew stuart 23 told his attorney he was not aware then that 
mrs stuart or his brother had been shot he took the bag to revere 
and threw it and the gun separately into the river 
police recovered the handbag the same day stuart committed 
suicide 
the gun found tuesday fits the description said larry 
gillis a spokesman for the metropolitan district commission police 
flanagan said the gun would be sent to the fbi crime laboratory 
in washington for tests police divers said the gun had begun to 
rust 
jack decourcy special agent for the fbi in boston said it was 
possible to detect fingerprints on a gun found in salt water 
depending on how long it was submerged how rusty it was and 
whether it was found in silt 
it is possible itd be difficult but its possible 
decourcy said tuesday 
a 38caliber gun was reported stolen from the boston fur store 
where charles stuart was a manager and flanagan said the weapon 
recovered tuesday was the same type as the one taken from the store 
jay kakas coowner of the fur store issued a statement tuesday 
saying the stores gun was unused and stored in the company safe 
for many years it did not occur to me to make any connection 
between chuck stuart and the gun in the safe until after i heard 
chuck stuart shot his own wife kakas said 
flanagan said divers would search for other evidence but he 
refused to be more specific 
were looking for additional evidence to corroborate some 
testimony from one of the individuals that has talked to the police 
regarding this particular matter he said 
meanwhile publishing houses in new york and boston are 
receiving proposals from writers who want to recount the grisly 
tale 
weve heard about at least 10 book proposals being floated 
james frost editor in chief at warner books inc in new york said 
tuesday i think everybody wants to know what makes the killer 
tick what makes a man murder his pregnant wife 
he noted the firms tiein with film production companies may be 
one reason why it has received so many offers 
little brown and co of boston also has reported several 
proposals 
police have not disclosed a motive for the crime among the 
theories being investigated are that charles stuart was hoping to 
cash in insurance polices and that he might have been having an 
affair with another woman

one month after a bloody coup 
attempt a mood of uncertainty still prevails in the philippines 
despite president corazon aquinos moves to reorganize and 
revitalize her administration 
government and military officials claim the situation has 
returned to normal after thousands of military mutineers launched 
their nineday unsuccessful bid to topple mrs aquino on dec 1 
but rumors of a new coup attempt are widespread and many key 
leaders of the latest attempt remain at large 
a man claiming to speak for the rebels said tuesday that 
mutinous soldiers will try again within a few weeks unless mrs 
aquino resigns or promises to close us military bases here 
if she does not step down we have no choice we will 
launch not just another but we will keep on launching them he 
said 
there was no comment from the presidential staff to the latest 
threat made in a telephone call to the associated press 
stock brokers say many investors particularly foreigners are 
staying on the sidelines because of the instability occupancy 
rates in major manila hotels have fallen sharply 
it seems the consensus that president aquino has to do 
something dramatic to rally the people behind government in order 
to preempt anyfuture coup attempts wrote the business star in a 
recent frontpage editorial 
faced with the gravest crisis of her nearly fouryear 
administration mrs aquino reorganized her 27member cabinet on 
dec 31 removing several secretaries who had been widely 
criticized as inept 
she also announced a reorganization of the presidential staff 
setting up committees of advisers to coordinate between cabinet 
departments and speed up policy implementation 
it remains unclear whether any reorganization no matter how 
extensive would deter military rebels who have tried six times to 
topple mrs aquino since she took power on feb 25 1986 in a 
popular uprising that toppled the late president ferdinand marcos 
several key rebel leaders including former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan have been involved in previous coup attempts 
the government shakeup appeared to have been aimed at winning 
support from filipinos who may not have supported the coup attempt 
but were disillusioned by rising prices rampant crime official 
corruption decaying infrastructure and the slow pace of reform 
as in the previous attempts mrs aquinos popularity increased 
after the recent failed coup 
the social weather station polling firm in a survey of 500 
manila residents last month found that 43 percent were satisfied 
with mrs aquino a 12 percent increase from before the coup 
attempt 
the survey found that 67 percent opposed the use of force to 
redress grievances but that 73 percent believed there was a basis 
for the rebels demands for efficient government and an end to 
corruption 
some business sources speaking on condition of anonymity say 
it will take about six months to see whether the government changes 
will be effective 
but already many political commentators have expressed doubts 
that the shuffle will enhance the effectiveness of an 
administration widely criticized as inept and lacking a coherent 
national vision 
changes in her cabinet appeals for trust and confidence 
are not enough to make the feeling of skepticism and uncertainty 
now prevailing all over the nation fade away wrote columnist 
nestor mata in the manila standard 
cory should learn to rise above her own fears injustices and 
suspicions and resentments and act fast he added referring to 
mrs aquino by her nickname 
disappointment has been most pronounced among liberals and 
leftists who had hoped mrs aquino would usher in a period of 
social and economic reform when she took power 
instead most reforms have been in the structure of the 
government a bicameral legislature independent judiciary and 
liberal legal and constitutional guarantees that are often ignored 
during the cabinet revamp she named a young leftleaning 
congressman florencio abad as secretary of agrarian reform 
but most other changes reflected the influence of centerright 
groups including business and the roman catholic faction led by 
cardinal jaime l sin archbishop of manila 
for example mrs aquino retained trade secretary jose 
concepcion widely criticized for high prices alleged conflicts of 
interest and excessive protectionism of selected industries 
concepcion is prominent in roman catholic lay circles 
the mixed reactions of the public indicate the limitations of 
the presidents choices wrote columnist fermin adriano in the 
manila chronicle evidently the new faces in the cabinet were 
chosen to provide a continuation of policies laid down by their 
predecessors 
at least 113 people were killed in the december coup attempt 
during which us f4 phantom jets provided air cover to government 
troops 
tuesdays caller to the ap claiming to represent the reform the 
armed forces movementsoldiers of the filipino people asked the 
us government to refrain from helping forces in the event of 
another assault 
it is the us government responsibility if it chooses to 
stick its finger where it does not belong this is a fight between 
the filipino people and the ruling elite the caller said

a program to try to save the florida 
panther from extinction by breeding them in captivity was 
unanimously approved tuesday by a joint federalstate panel 
biologists estimate that only about 50 of the cats roam 
undeveloped lands in south florida 
without the program the florida panther could be extinct in the 
next 25 to 40 years according to a presentation john christian 
made to the fourmember florida panther interagency committee 
christian the us fish and wildlife services deputy regional 
director for endangered wildlife in atlanta said it was possible 
the subspecies could be completely wiped out at any time by an 
outbreak of disease 
the captive breeding programs goal is to increase the panther 
population to 500 animals 200 in captivity and 300 in the wild in 
florida and elsewhere in the southeast by the year 2010 
under the plan eight adult panthers and 18 kittens would be 
removed from the wild over the next three years and up to six 
adults and 12 kittens would be removed over the following two years 
three zoos in miami jacksonville and tampa have expressed an 
interest in participating in the program christian said white oak 
plantation a private exotic animal breeding facility in north 
florida is also interested 
christian emphasized that captive breeding would only be a tool 
and could not replace management of wild populations 
what were proposing to do is to take animals out of the wild 
to start the core of a captive breeding plan that can be used both 
for increasing numbers of florida panthers in captivity for 
preserving their genetic makeup and then second to provide stock 
for reintroductions back into the wild he said 
as for the wild populations christian said the areas had not 
yet been decided but that wildlife officials didnt think florida 
alone could maintain three different populations 
the committee was also told tuesday that mercury contamination 
was a serious threat to the continued existence of the florida 
panther 
biologists suspect that mercury has already killed one panther 
and know of three other cats who have elevated mercury levels high 
enough to be of immediate concern 
the interagency committee is comprised of officials of the state 
game and fresh water fish commission the state department of 
natural resources the us fish and wildlife service and the 
national park service

a respite from holiday cold is hastening 
replanting of devastated winter vegetable crops in florida but the 
vast winter wheat areas of the great plains are left without 
protective snow cover 
the governments joint agricultural weather facility said 
tuesday that temperatures in the first week of january also eased 
livestock stress over much of the nation although variable 
readings contributed to pneumonia among animals in parts of iowa 
lack of snow cover continued to cause concern for winter wheat 
producers in the central and northern great plains except for 
montana where snow cover was mostly good the agency reported 
in another report the agriculture department said freezing 
christmas weather that ripped into winter vegetable areas of 
florida and texas was blamed for sharply reduced acreages of 
broccoli celery lettuce and tomatoes for winter harvest 
overall farmers are expected to have about 191000 acres of 
seven selected winter vegetables for harvest down 8 percent from a 
year ago the report said no actual production estimates were 
included 
in texas for example no carrots are expected to be harvested 
although acreages are up in california and florida 
celery for harvest in florida is down 14 percent from a year 
ago however and the sweet corn acreage was reported down by 35 
percent the texas lettuce acreage was reported to be cut 79 
percent from last winter while the florida tomato acreage is down 
32 percent 
but the florida harvest of winter strawberries is expected to be 
5400 acres up 2 percent from last year 
growers saved most plants from the christmas weekend freeze by 
forming ice caps on plants with overhead sprinklers the report 
said the freeze will lower yields because fewer pickings will be 
made virtually all plants are expected to survive if temperatures 
remain moderate for the next few weeks 
looking at the carrot situation most of floridas crop was 
destroyed although growers are expected to replant most if not 
all of the lost acreage the report said part of the severely 
damaged crop in the rio grande valley of texas may be salvaged by 
hand harvesting if the price is high enough 
department analysts have said that although citrus and fresh 
vegetable prices are expected to rise in the first quarter overall 
consumer food prices in 1990 are still expected to go up a modest 3 
percent to 5 percent compared with 57 percent in 1989 the 
sharpest gain since 1981 
one reason is that vegetable fields can be replanted quickly so 
that theres a minimum lag in supplies they said 
the report by the joint agricultural weather facility said 
florida vegetable farmers enjoyed warm weather in major producing 
areas in the first week of the new year 
planting and replanting was active under nearly ideal weather 
conditions the report said harvest continued but supplies of 
most crops were reduced 
the facility which is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments said freeze damage in texas became more evident in 
the rio grande valley 
lettuce and celery were severely damaged and onions also 
suffered some loss it said

the soviet union has begun to use a renewed 
subsidy allocation under an agriculture department program to buy 
more us wheat at cutrate prices 
officials said tuesday that moscow bought 480000 metric tons of 
wheat for delivery next month under a longterm grainsupply 
agreement 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said 10 private companies shared in 
the sales 
the wheat was sold under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep which provides subsidies to exporters selling us 
commodities to designated foreign markets 
dickerson said 1534200 tons of wheat remain in the soviet 
unions current eep allocation a new purchase line of 2 million 
tons was announced dec 19 in addition to 14200 tons remaining in 
a previous allocation 
only wheat has been approved for sale to the soviet union under 
the pricesubsidy program 
the seventh year of the ussoviet grain agreement began oct 
1 with the latest sales the soviet union has bought about 13 
million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and more than 11 million 
tons of corn plus some soybeans and soybean meal all of the wheat 
was sold under eep arrangements 
in the sixth year of the agreement the soviet union bought 
about 54 million tons of wheat and more than 163 million tons of 
corn plus soybeans soybean meal and grain sorghums all but about 
700000 tons of the wheat was bought under eep 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 480000 tons are equal to 176 million bushels worth 
around 67 million at recent us farm prices 
dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of 2050 per 
ton or about 56 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
dickerson said the 480000 tons of wheat were sold by alfred c 
toepfer international inc 100000 tons harvest states

democracy in latin america is at an alltime 
high with strong encouragement coming from the united states but 
american officials acknowledge that only rarely has there been less 
support in the hemisphere for us policies on key issues 
the united states has been in the minority in the last three 
weeks on two votes by the organization of american states 
criticizing the us invasion in panama 
us officials are worried the drug summit president bush is 
expected to attend next month in colombia may be overshadowed by 
complaints about the more assertive american stance recently 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler conceded tuesday 
that leaks about a proposed us antidrug interdiction effort off 
the colombian coast have complicated the hope of enlisting 
colombias cooperation in the initiative 
word of the proposed effort coming days after the us invasion 
of panama has touched off rumors around the hemisphere that the 
united states may try to blockade colombia or perhaps even invade 
as an encore to the panama intervention 
us officials scoff at such suggestions 
an oas resolution two days after the panama invasion expressed 
regret over the action monday night the united states again was 
in the minority as the oas voted to criticize as a violation of 
international law the dec 29 incursion by us troops into the 
panama city residence of the nicaraguan ambassador 
the administration complained that in view of the us admission 
that a mistake had been made the oas meeting served no purpose 
other than antius propaganda 
curiously the rallying of hemispheric opinion against the 
united states is occurring as the ranks of countries adhering to 
democratic principles has never been greater 
in the us view dictatorial rule in panama ended with the 
installation of president guillermo endara an hour before the us 
invasion began endara was widely seen as the winner of the may 7 
election which gen manuel antonio noriega annulled rather than 
surrender power 
six days before the invasion chile laid the groundwork for a 
formal end to 16 years of military rule with the election of a 
civilian president who will take office in march 
that leaves only cuba and haiti without multiparty systems 
among hemispheric countries although officials acknowledge that in 
some nations the democratic process is not fully developed 
us officials insisting on anonymity are worried the drug 
summit scheduled for feb 15 in cartagena colombia may get bogged 
down by latin complaints over us policies 
peru was angered earlier this week by the deployment of us 
troops around its embassy in panama city as part of a search for 
noriega loyalists in addition to the us and peru the scheduled 
summit participants include colombia and bolivia 
the most immediate source of concern for the administration is 
colombia where nationalistic sentiments are raising doubts about 
the ability of the united states to win that countrys cooperation 
in an antidrug crackdown 
defense secretary dick cheney is expected to make final 
proposals to bush on use of a us aircraft carrier group off the 
colombian coast to monitor drug trafficking operations 
as evidence of colombian reluctance to cooperate colombian 
officials reportedly refused to meet with a us team last week to 
discuss the issue 
asked whether the furor in colombia has left the administration 
embarrassed ms tutwiler said tuesday 
were not embarrassed but it certainly has complicated the 
consultation process

it was just a little printing error but as 
many as 566000 couples and individuals have been told to send 
their federal tax returns to the wrong address 
its no big deal says the internal revenue service and it 
wont delay refunds 
this shouldnt present a problem for the irs or for 
taxpayers irs spokesman steve pyrek said tuesday 
in fact pyrek said if you are one of the form 1040 filers who 
received the wrong envelope in your taxinstruction package you 
may use it as is correct it or substitute an envelope of your own 
the irs says the problem apparently affects only about 05 
percent of the 107 million taxreturn packages mailed out last 
month specifically the wrong envelopes were included only in some 
of the kits marked package 1 in the lower right corner of the 
cover which contain only a 1040 and schedules a for deductions 
and b for interest and dividends 
the problem has not shown up in 1040a or 1040ez packages 
the irs isnt sure why it happened but says the improper 
envelopes apparently originated with one of the several private 
printers it hires to produce the taxinstruction packages 
we think there was some kind of problem in the list the 
printer used to stuff the envelopes into the packages pyrek 
said its not clear to us yet 
the irs believes the problem envelopes are spread out among 
taxpayers in eight of the 10 regions so far the agency has heard 
of no problem among taxpayers served by the ogden utah service 
center all the west except southern california hawaii and new 
mexico or the memphis center alabama arkansas louisiana 
mississippi north carolina and tennessee 
how do you know whether the envelope in your package has the 
wrong address check the list of servicecenter addresses on page 5 
of the 1040 instructions 
pyrek said a taxpayer who received a misaddressed envelope may 
use another envelope 
use the irs envelope but mark out the wrong address and the 
postal service bar code 
use the irs envelope wrong address and all that wont delay 
any refund pyrek said 
errors are not unknown at the irs which produces nearly 100 
different individual tax forms and schedules and dozens of 
publications to explain them already this year the irs has 
corrected a goof on form 2441 which parents use to claim a credit 
for childcare expenses 
the form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6 
reading 
if the result here is zero or less stop here you cannot 
claim the credit 
that sentence should read 
if the result is zero or less skip lines 7 through 11 enter 
zero on line 12 and go to line 13

polands diplomats no longer must ask the 
state department each time they want to travel from washington to 
their diplomatic missions in chicago and new york 
the relaxation of the travel restrictions which went into 
effect last month is a response to the demise of communist rule in 
poland the state department said tuesday poland last year 
installed a government led by the independent solidarity trade 
union 
similar restrictions on us diplomats in poland were also 
eased the department said in response to a question 
the united states is considering easing travel restrictions for 
diplomats from other eastern european countries that have been 
taken over by reformists in recent months officials said 
we have spoken to the state department about this and they 
told us they have to consult with other parts of the government but 
that it could happen said one eastern european diplomat who 
asked not to be named 
a state department official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was too early to lift travel restrictions on all 
eastern european diplomats but we might see some relaxation 
limitations on diplomats are generally imposed on a reciprocal 
basis in other words when the soviets curtailed the movement of 
american diplomats the united states did the same here the 
restrictions also help the fbi monitor the movements of soviet bloc 
diplomats 
until now polish diplomats were required to arrange all their 
trips within the united states through the state department and to 
give notice of their intention to travel two working days in 
advance 
under the new policy they may travel between washington new 
york and chicago without notifying the state department 
most eastern european diplomats in washington except 
hungarians are subject to similar restrictions although the 
ambassadors are exempt 
restrictions are tougher for soviet diplomats who are confined 
to within a 25mile radius of washington if they want to go beyond 
that limit they must notify the state department 
eastern european and soviet diplomats at the united nations are 
also banned from traveling beyond a radius of 25 miles 
the state department announced last month that it would grant 
permanent building passes to polish and hungarian journalists who 
regularly cover the state department previously those reporters 
could only enter the building with an official escort

the bush administrations fiscal 1991 budget 
will be released later this month without a plan for financing the 
bailout of the savings and loan industry officials say 
how and when the bailout financing is done will be a crucial 
perhaps the crucial element in determining how easily the 
administration meets the 64 billion deficit target under the 
grammrudman law 
the administration told the house ways and means committee in 
november that it intended by jan 15 to formulate a plan to borrow 
50 billion to 100 billion for sampls 
although officials have narrowed the financing options to just a 
few they will not be able to meet that deadline three 
administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
tuesday 
the key question is how much of the financing will count toward 
the deficit officials hope to resolve the matter within 60 days 
but a decision will not come in time for the jan 29 release of the 
fiscal 1991 budget 
two officials said the administration is likely to combine 
several financing methods leaving part of the financing on 
budget and part off budget 
one official said the bulk of the financing likely will be on 
budget meaning the borrowing would balloon the budget deficit 
however the other said the administration would retain 
considerable flexibility to shift back and forth between on and 
offbudget methods 
legislation enacted in august provides 50 billion through 
fiscal year 1992 for the resolution trust corp an agency created 
to dispose of about 600 failed thrifts 
however the agency needs to borrow an additional 50 billion to 
100 billion in working capital which would be repaid when it 
sells off the bad loans real estate and other assets owned by the 
bankrupt sampls 
the budget document will discuss working capital but will not 
resolve the issue according to one official another official said 
at least one financing option has been eliminated chartering a new 
offbudget agency to raise cash by selling shortterm notes to 
investors 
the administration still is considering borrowing from the 
federal home loan bank system a quasipublic system of 12 regional 
banks created to provide lowcost funds to savings and loans that 
wouldnt count on the budget 
additional cash could be raised onbudget through the federal 
financing bank a government entity through which agencies such as 
the postal service and general services administration borrow 
money however it is unclear whether the rtc can legally tap this 
resource 
the effort to remove the legal obstacles to federal financing 
bank borrowing and the need to negotiate with federal home loan 
bank officials has delayed the working capital plan beyond the 
original jan 15 deadline 
if the rtc cannot use the federal financing bank another 
alternative would be a direct line of credit through the treasury 
however that would require approval from congress which would 
likely sharply limit the borrowing something the administration 
wants to avoid 
if the administration eventually settles on mostly onbudget 
financing it could complete most of the borrowing before sept 30 
inflating the deficit in the current fiscal year for which 
grammrudman deadlines have expired then as sampl assets are sold 
the revenue would reduce the deficit probably by a small amount in 
1991 and then by a huge amount after that 
the revenue gains would make the peace dividend look like 
peanuts one official said 
as an adjunct to working capital borrowing the administration 
is considering creating a centralized brokered deposits desk for 
failed sampls the 281 sampls under government control rely on about 
13 billion in highcost deposits placed by money brokers 
the administration hopes to act as its own money broker and 
lower the cost of those deposits it would hope to attract sums 
from institutional investors in the tens of millions of dollars and 
then split the money into insured 100000 chunks and divide it 
among its failed sampls 
in a pinch the brokered deposits operation could be expanded to 
serve as the source of working capital one of the officials said 
when failed institutions were sold to new investors the rtc could 
retain a shell institution in its portfolio that would consist of 
bad assets and brokered deposits the deposits would be paid off as 
the retained assets were sold

civil rights leaders are applauding president 
bushs strong vocal support of racial justice and equality but 
theyre urging him to back up his words with billions of dollars to 
alleviate poverty in inner cities 
on tuesday as bush gathered civil rights activists at the white 
house to watch him sign a martin luther king jr birthday 
proclamation and denounce a wave of hate bombings in the south the 
national urban league released a bleak report on the state of 
black america 
the league proposed cutting the 300 billion defense budget in 
half using 100 billion to cut the deficit and 50 billion to 
launch an urban marshall plan to reclaim americas cities and 
urban poor 
the end of the cold war must mean the start of a renewed drive 
to bring america into the 21st century by investing in its people 
and its economy said league president john e jacob 
the 50 billion is needed jacob said for housing health care 
education and other needs 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said america still must 
maintain a strong defense even without fiscal restraints she 
added it would be hard to come up with the sums the national urban 
league cited 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp had measured 
praise for bushs record on civil rights 
after eight years of the reagan administrations being very 
anti as it relates to civil rights hooks said this present 
administration i think has moved cautiously and judiciously in 
the field 
bush has made many very excellent statements and in the next 
few months we will be moving to get him to go further on it 
hooks said 
bush spoke movingly of martin luther king jr as he signed the 
proclamation declaring monday a holiday as it has been since 1986 
after president reagan dropped his opposition 
it would have been the 61st birthday of the civil rights leader 
struck down by an assassins bullet in memphis on april 4 1968 
bush called king a force against evil his life was a metaphor 
for courage 
wherever he found hatred he condemned it wherever there was 
bigotry he assailed it and wherever there was segregation he 
defied it said the president 
he endured death threats and these obscene phone calls in the 
dead of the night and he refused to be intimidated through his 
courage dr king changed forever america for the better bush 
said 
when we hear of bombings obscene phone calls hate mail each 
one of us must speak out bush said there is no place for 
bigotry in the united states of america 
a person or group calling itself americans for a competent 
federal judicial system claimed responsibility for killing us 
circuit judge robert vance on dec 16 at his home outside 
birmingham ala and robert robertson a savannah ga lawyer and 
civil rights leader two days later federal authorities 
intercepted bombs intended for the federal courthouse in atlanta 
and a jacksonville fla naacp office 
this administration will not let up in the fight against 
racism bush said we will work to bring the perpetrators of 
these hideous crimes to justice 
hooks emerged from the oval office saying he was fairly 
satisfied with federal efforts to solve the bombings but was 
seeking further assurance that the sense of urgency extends to 
the fbi and justice department as well as the white house 
we did not ask for any federal protection and he did not offer 
it said hooks adding he is not interested in leading a 
straitjacket life 
civil rights groups have complained of bushs support for recent 
supreme court rulings limiting affirmative action and they helped 
torpedo his nomination of a michigan sheriff william lucas to the 
justice departments top civil rights post lucas now a liaison 
official at justice attended the signing ceremony

mayor marion barry says a reporter who 
portrayed him as combative and denigrating jesse jackson was 
motivated by racism 
barry lashed out tuesday at los angeles times reporter bella 
stumbo alleging in a letter to the newspaper that her profile 
published in sundays editions ranged from prejudicial opinion to 
total falsehoods and slings mud along the way he demanded an 
apology 
ms stumbo could not be reached for comment 
the story was a balanced and perceptive portrait of the mayor 
as he revealed himself over 18 hours of interviews c shelby 
coffey iii editor and executive vice president of the times said 
in a statement the story is fair and speaks for itself 
the newspaper said it had taperecorded barrys comments 
barry was quoted in ms stumbos story as saying jackson the 
twotime presidential candidate supported by barry dont wanna 
run nothing but his mouth the paper also quoted barry as saying 
jackson would become the laughingstock of america if he ran for 
mayor of washington a topic of speculation in the capital 
the mayors comments according to the times came as barry sat 
late one night in november sipping wine in a bar with ms stumbo 
in his letter barry said the reporter had told him she wanted 
to learn whether there was racism against black mayors 
she said she wanted to look at racism she did all right 
through her own prejudiced eyes she looked at it and embraced it 
fully he said 
as for the comments attributed to him about jackson the mayor 
said i know i did not use the words ms stumbo put into my 
mouth he added in no way did i denigrate jackson 
barry also denied using what he called the black dialect 
attributed to him in the interview 
people who do not know me would think i leaped from the screen 
of an amos and andy show he wrote referring to an old radio and 
television series considered offensive by many blacks 
jackson said monday that he had accepted barrys assertions that 
he did not make the statements attributed to him 
but sources close to jackson said the newspaper assured him 
that there are tape recordings of the interviews 
barry has criticized the media for the nationwide attention 
given to his relationship with convicted drug dealer charles lewis 
since it was reported that barry visited lewis several times in a 
washington hotel 
ive told him more than once that the washington post didnt 
put him in that hotel room with that drug dealer says lawyer max 
n berry who chaired barrys 1986 reelection effort he gets 
himself into this trouble and then he wants to turn around and 
blame the people who write about it 
lewis pleaded guilty in november to drug conspiracy charges and 
testified under oath that he supplied barry with cocaine as part 
of his plea bargain agreement lewis is cooperating with 
prosecutors who continue to probe his ties to the mayor

even people who understand groups of 
governments known as g5 g7 g10 and g77 are 
having trouble with the new g24 there are two of them they 
do different jobs and they have different member countries 
the new group of 24 met last month in brussels belgium to 
help the governments of eastern europe move away from communist 
systems toward private enterprise it includes the united states 
japan australia new zealand and the countries of western europe 
the old group of 24 was drawn from the third world and 
usually meets in washington it first came together in 1972 with 
countries from asia africa and latin america the present chairman 
is finance minister jeanpierre lemboumbalepandou from the western 
african republic of gabon 
christian obame speaking for the old g24 says the new group 
may seem to slight the third world gathering 
it bothers us some he said it seems to be putting us off 
to one side well have to find out just what its going to do 
obame is a permanent representative of gabon at the headquarters 
in washington of the international monetary fund and its sister 
organization the world bank he said gabons finance minister will 
raise the question of the two g24s at the end of the month when 
many of the worlds financial leaders meet in washington 
the old g24 has essentially represented third world needs to 
the more prosperous members of the bank and fund members who make 
up the new g24 
though this meeting of the funds interim committee has not yet 
been officially set it is expected to be needed for a decision on 
how much to increase the 117 billion the imf has available for 
lending much of the increase would be made available to eastern 
europe in return for promises of new economic policies 
michel camdessus the funds managing director toured africa 
after attending the meeting of the new g24 to assure senior g24 
members that their needs would not be forgotten in the effort to 
help warsaw pact nations 
all the members of the old g24 belong to the third worlds 
g77 but dont be misled by the title the g77 has 129 member 
countries 
other groups are smaller and more powerful the g5 the united 
states japan west germany britain and france has long taken on 
the major financial and economic decisions often meeting in secret 
at dinner 
those are the nations that agreed in 1985 in new york to drive 
down the price of the dollar usually the member governments are 
represented by the us secretary of the treasury and the other 
countries ministers of finance 
italy and canada joined those nations in a separate grouping to 
make up the group of seven some experts think the g5 still makes 
the major decisions and brings the other two in later 
the g10 includes the g7 plus belgium the netherlands sweden 
and switzerland that makes 11 since switzerland joined in 1984 
but the old name is still kept it was set up in 1962 under the imf 
to lend the fund extra money when needed

the justice department is trying to deal with 
the thorny problem of whether the flamboyant us attorney in miami 
will be the lead prosecutor at manuel antonio noriegas drug trial 
sources say 
us attorney dexter lehtinen known among miami lawyers and 
justice department officials for his volatile temper has said 
through spokeswoman diane cossin that he plans to lead the 
prosecution team 
but justice department spokesman david runkel said no decision 
had been made about who will be the lead prosecutor the 
government runkel said will be well represented 
ordinarily it would be lehtinens prerogative to try the case 
because the justice department would be reluctant to tell a us 
attorney how to run his office 
but lehtinen is a courtappointed us attorney who is being 
considered by the white house for a fouryear appointment subject 
to senate confirmation 
runkel said lehtinens background check by the fbi has been 
completed and that he expected his name would be forwarded to the 
white house for final consideration 
but an administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the justice department may offer lehtinen the 
choice of prosecuting noriega or running the us attorneys 
office which oversees federal cases in south florida 
no decision has been made the official said but the department 
is concerned that lehtinen would have difficulty running a large 
office and overseeing such a potentially complex case 
the justice department may also consider lehtinens reputation 
for having a volatile temper including his feuds with law 
enforcement officials and theatrics such as waving a plastic 
assault rifle during a staff meeting on drug traffickers 
runkel declined to comment 
i am not going to get involved in speculation about how the 
case is going to be presented in court he said 
the noriega case is expected to last more than a year with 
complicated pretrial motions involving defense requests for 
sensitive government documents covering the deposed panamanian 
leaderss career as a cia informant 
another government source said senior justice department 
officials were well aware of lehtinens reputation as having a 
volatile temper 
lehtinen publicly spurned an offer by the former prosecutor who 
put the noriega indictment together two years ago to assist in the 
case 
the prosecutor richard gregorie was lehtinens rival for the 
us attorneys job in 1988 after the resignation of leon kellner 
lehtinen is described by miami lawyers who once worked in the 
office as a very shorttempered man who enforces a militarystyle 
chain of command 
one former senior prosecutor in the miami office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said lehtinen alienated many career 
prosecutors and has openly feuded with federal law enforcement 
agencies about policy matters 
essentially he treats everybody like infantry said the 
former prosecutor now in private practice theyre just some 
very talented people treated like infantry 
during one staff meeting lehtinen waved a plastic ak47 while 
giving prosecutors a pep talk about fighting drugs according to 
published reports confirmed by the former prosecutor 
a florida native who graduated at the top of his law school 
class at stanford lehtinen was an organized crime strike force 
prosecutor in miami before going into private practice and later 
running for the legislature 
his wife republican ileana roslehtinen won a special election 
in august for the congressional seat left vacant by the death of 
rep claude pepper dfla 
the administration official noted the choice of prosecuting 
noriega or getting a fulltime appointment as us attorney might 
be a difficult one for lehtinen 
prosecuting noriega could be a feather in the cap of someone 
with political ambitions the official said 
robert merkle former us attorney in tampa ran unsuccessfully 
for the senate in 1988 after successfully prosecuting colombian 
cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas

surgery to stop the rapid growth of a 
7yearold soviet boy who stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds 
appears to have gone well but surgeons say he may need more 
treatment 
in a threehour operation tuesday at the mayo clinics st marys 
hospital doctors removed all that was apparent of a large tumor on 
igor ladans pituitary gland 
but surgeons said some cells of the tumor which had resulted in 
an overproduction of growth hormone may remain and additional 
medication or radiation therapy may be needed to lessen the 
likelihood that the tumor will grow back 
igor came to the clinic with his mother svitlana ladan in 
september from their home in the ukrainian city of kiev following a 
worldwide search for doctors who could treat the rare tumor 
the tumor had risen up out of the pituitary gland and was 
pressing on the brain the clinic said in a statement 
doctors first used drug therapy to reduce the tumor by about 30 
percent then decided to operate when tests showed no further 
reduction in the tumors size said dr donald zimmerman a 
pediatric endocrinologist who is part of the team treating the boy 
some of the possible complications from the surgery include 
serious bleeding blindness or vision loss and stroke the clinic 
said 
tumors similar in size to igors tend to grow around arteries 
and vital structures of the pituitary making complete removal of 
the tumor difficult or impossible the clinic said 
mayo clinic physicians have treated more than 60 children with 
pituitary tumors

plans to release up to 50 caribou in a 
protected wilderness park as part of an effort to bring the animal 
back to maine were unanimously rejected tuesday by the baxter state 
park authority 
the privately funded project sought to release dozens of the 
north american reindeer extinct in maine for 80 years from crates 
carried by helicopter to an isolated section of the 200000acre 
park known as the klondike 
the bowlshaped area inaccessible by road is the only area in 
the state known to be a calving area for caribou 
project leader mark mccollough a university of maine wildlife 
biologist said he may try to address the authoritys concerns and 
return with a new request he said another option would be to 
release the animals in one of several alternate sites in the state 
members of the threemember authority and its advisory panel 
pummeled mccollough with questions and complaints about the way the 
3yearold project has been run prior to the authoritys vote 
maine attorney general james e tierney chairman of the 
authority said he found constant shifts and turns in the 
reintroduction projects plans very frustrating 
without any exhaustive analysis youre simply asking us to 
put more animals into the wild said tierney 
others expressed concern about the noise created by the two to 
three planned weekly airplane flights over the klondike to check on 
the caribou 
park director irvin buzz caverly jr who is not a member of 
the authority said the only time communications have been good 
were when you wanted something from us 
caverly said he was disturbed when he heard or read news reports 
of caribou deaths before project officials informed him 
mccollough acknowledged a failure to provide a comprehensive 
written report on the progress of the effort and offered to improve 
communications he said no alternative release plan had been 
approved by the project board 
the planned release would have been the second in a year in 
baxter park which is in northcentral maine 
of the dozen let go from an enclosure deep in the woods last 
april 10 are known to be dead from attacks by other animals 
disease or accidents 
mccollough who maintains that 80 to 100 caribou must be 
released in order to make the reintroduction effort viable wanted 
to release about 25 caribou now living in pens near the state 
university in orono in baxter in april 
he wanted to release an additional 25 caribou the canadian 
province newfoundland has agreed to give maine this year if the 
animals are rounded up before april 
the project began in 1986 when more than two dozen caribou were 
rounded up after being shot by dart guns from helicopters in 
newfoundland those animals were used as a nursery herd to 
breed caribou for releases

the energy department is launching a special 
study of oil company profit margins in response to a congressional 
outcry over extraordinary increases in home heating fuel prices 
last month in the northeast and midwest 
the energy information administration an independent office 
within the energy department agreed to conduct the study after 
members of a house panel demanded a public accounting of who 
profited from the price increase of as much as 50 percent 
with the acrosstheboard increases we have suffered it would 
seem likely that antitrust violations have occurred said rep 
toby roth rwis in testimony before the energy and power 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
the oil industry blames the price rise on a combination of 
unusual circumstances including high demand for fuel as a result 
of extreme cold in the northeast and midwest relatively low levels 
of company fuel inventories transportation bottlenecks caused by 
cold weather and refinery shutdowns due to accidents 
wholesale prices of home heating oil and propane have been 
falling in recent days in response to a break in the cold spell 
but the declines have not yet reached the consumer level retail 
prices of home heating oil in the northeast surged from about 90 
cents a gallon in late november and still stood as high as 150 a 
gallon last week at the retail level 
helmut merklein chief of the energy information administration 
told the panel his office by may would have a comprehensive study 
of the december price increases to tell you where in the chain 
the profits were made and to determine whether there was evidence 
of oil industry collusion to gouge consumers 
merklein indicated that there was no such evidence at this time 
several members of the panel complained that merkleins study 
would take too long and later merklein agreed to launch 
immediately a quicker preliminary assessment of profits during the 
december price spiral he didnt say when it would be completed 
john easton assistant secretary for international affairs and 
energy emergencies told the panel price increases were due mainly 
to unprecedented demand he said this was caused by the harsh 
december weather which in the northeast was the coldest in at 
least 60 years 
the current tight market conditions should ease shortly when 
additional supplies of products flow into the regional markets from 
domestic and offshore sources he said adding that would put 
downward pressure on energy prices 
easton said supplies coming to the market should suffice for 
the rest of the winter but he added if the weather should 
turn again we once again could see short supplies 
easton came under heavy attack from several subcommittee members 
rep jim cooper dtenn accused him of acting as a mouthpiece 
for the oil industry and suggested that the administration tacitly

a supreme court decision may change the 
traditional method of selecting college and university professors 
for lifetime faculty appointments 
the court ruled tuesday that institutions of higher learning 
generally may be forced to disclose confidential peer review 
records when accused of illegally denying tenure to a faculty 
member 
the ruling puts a university on the same footing as any 
employer accused of illegal discrimination said sarah burns of 
the national organization for womens legal defense and education 
fund 
knowing this those responsible are more likely to see to it 
that the peer review process is a fair one she said 
but sheldon steinbach of the american council on education 
which had urged the court to find an academic freedom privilege 
to withhold such information said the decision could make the 
process less candid 
it may have a substantial impact on how much candor a 
schools peer review committee members are willing to put in 
writing he said the decision may drive portions of the 
process underground for example phone conversations may play a 
larger role 
writing for a unanimous court justice harry a blackmun said 
the costs associated with racial and sexual discrimination in 
institutions of higher learning are very substantial few would 
deny that ferreting out this information is a great if not 
compelling government interest 
if there is a smoking gun to be found that demonstrates 
discrimination in tenure decisions it is likely to be tucked away 
in peer review files 
the decision is a key preliminary victory for a former 
university of pennsylvania professor challenging her denial of 
tenure 
penns appeal from a federal appeals court ruling that 
disclosure is required had been supported by princeton brown 
stanford harvard yale and the american council on education 
rosalie tung then an associate professor of management at penn 
was denied tenure in 1985 at penns wharton school 
ms tung filed a complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission charging she was the victim of illegal 
discrimination against women and people of asian descent 
after the university refused an eeoc request for peer review 
documents the agency subpoenaed them 
in the ensuing court fight university officials argued in favor 
of a balancing test approved by some federal appeals courts that 
would allow the school to keep the information secret unless it was 
shown to be essential to the discrimination claim 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in 1988 rejected that 
argument and its ruling was upheld tuesday 
the supreme court has resolved an issue that has divided the 
federal appeals courts for a decade steinbach said its very 
hard to find much pleasure in a 90 vote against your position 
im very delighted with the decision said ms tung now a 
business professor at the university of wisconsin i fought for 
the principle and im glad that i won it 
in other decisions the court 
struck down a major portion of a dallas antipornography 
ordinance ruling 63 that its licensing requirements for sexually 
oriented businesses violates freespeech rights 
unanimously ruled in an indiana case that the internal revenue 
service may not tax as income the deposits utility companies charge 
their customers to ensure payment of future bills 
bush administration lawyers said more than 150 such cases 
involving more than 300 million in potential taxes are pending in 
lower courts and before the irs

when l douglas wilder takes the oath of 
office in virginia on saturday he faces the pressures of a budget 
crunch and of history he will be the nations first elected black 
governor 
i feel that but its not a weight says wilder a 
lawyer who became the states first black lieutenant governor four 
years ago 
wilder who turns 59 in a week said he recognizes he is a model 
for other blacks seeking high political office 
i am aware that any mistakes i make will hamper or curtail the 
momentum he said in an interview i will be working very much 
so to see that that doesnt happen 
wilders inauguration comes as the states economic boom of the 
1980s is slowing gov gerald l baliles has ordered cuts to close 
an 181 million revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending june 
30 he has proposed further cuts in the 199092 budget 
wilder has taken plenty of ribbing that he picked a bad time to 
become governor but he disagrees 
the true test of leadership sometimes doesnt come when things 
are good he said it requires innovation i welcome that 
challenge 
wilder may even benefit from the economic hard times if he shows 
he can hold down state spending observers say 
he knows that hes not terribly upset by all this said 
larry sabato a political analyst at the university of virginia 
if he can assure that western civilization doesnt collapse 
hell be hailed as having accomplished a great deal 
wilders 20 years of experience in public office and his 
magnetic personality bode him well legislators and analysts say 
doug wilder knows the system hes a product of it said 
state delegate clifton a chip woodrum a democrat doug 
wilder can charm the bark off a tree 
but wilder also has a reputation for ruthlessly punishing his 
political enemies 
hes a very complex person he can be enormously charming he 
can also be extremely vindictive we have to see what side of the 
personality predominates during the term sabato said 
former republican state sen ray l garland who served with 
wilder in the senate said the democratic governorelect gets along 
with most of the states 140 legislators and has managed to remain 
independent of the states powerful business lobby 
i think he will take a very independent line garland 
said the one negative is hes never had any experience running 
any sizable enterprise 
analysts said wilders portrayal of himself as a fiscal 
conservative which began with his run for lieutenant governor in 
1985 should help him if he seeks a us senate seat or national 
political office after his fouryear terms ends virginia governors 
cannot succeed themselves under state law 
wilder has said the states financial crunch may keep him from 
filling a campaign pledge to cut sales taxes on food and 
nonpresciption drugs 
his administration may be haunted by another tax break approved 
last year for retirees to satisfy a us supreme court ruling the 
legislature approved pension tax relief that will cost 235 million 
during the next two years the state could have to pay 400 million 
more to retirees if the courts rule the tax break must be made 
retroactive for three years 
wilder also faces challenges in the areas of health and 
corrections where demand and costs are rising 
to curb the costs of health care wilder said he would consider 
limiting medicare benefits for the elderly who can afford their 
health costs 
in corrections wilder said he would support more alternatives 
to incarceration such as electronic monitoring of offenders in 
their homes and greater use of prison labor on state projects 
wilder said he wants to build on previous transportation trade 
and education initiatives but also wants to distinguish his 
administration as one devoted to youth and family 
with such an ambitious agenda im going to have more on my 
plate than i can say prayers over wilder said

the senate ethics committee is paying 150 an 
hour to private lawyers investigating seven senators more than 
other panels recently permitted but far less than the going rate 
for a major civil or criminal defense 
attorneys robert s bennett henry f scheulke iii and n 
richard janis have openended contracts for a 150 hourly fee the 
ethics panels staff director wilson abney said tuesday 
their associates receive 125 or 150 hourly and services of 
paralegals bill 50 an hour said abney who declined to reveal how 
much the lawyers have been paid so far 
the private lawyers hired last year are prominent washington 
attorneys with major firms top law firms in washington are known 
to charge between 275 and 400 per hour for similar work 
nonetheless the top rate has risen when compared with the 
hourly fee paid outside counsel in recent cases 
last year the house ethics committee paid a chicago law firm 
125 an hour to investigate jim wright who was then the speaker of 
the house the firm received the same fee to advise the panel on 
whether to pursue an investigation of house republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia 
but while the top rate was lower all lawyers billed the 
committee the same fee 
the fee was even less 100 an hour for the private lawyers 
who assisted the house judiciary committee last year in the 
impeachment cases of two judges walter nixon and alcee hastings 
bennett known for winning acquittals for whitecollar criminal 
defendants is conducting two committee investigations 
in a case that has reached something akin to a grand jury 
investigation bennett is advising the committee on whether sen 
david durenberger rminn evaded honoraria limits when he 
collected speaking fees to promote a book he authored 
another aspect of durenbergers conduct hasnt quite advanced 
that far an allegation that the senator improperly profited by 
renting his minneapolis condominium to himself 
bennett also is handling the case centering on senators who met 
with federal bank regulators on behalf of charles h keating jr 
when his lincoln savings and loan was under examination by 
regulators the government took over the thrift last april and is 
expected to spend more than 2 billion a record for a thrift 
institution failure to protect depositors 
keating and his associates contributed some 13 million to the 
campaigns and causes of the five senators republican john mccain 
of arizona and democrats dennis deconcini of arizona john glenn of 
ohio donald w riegle jr of michigan the banking committee 
chairman and majority whip alan cranston of california all have 
denied wrongdoing 
scheulke a former assistant us attorney and janis the 
lawyer for irancontra figure albert hakim are investigating sen 
alfonse m damato rny 
a complaint against damato filed with the committee by a 
former political opponent charged the senator steered department 
of housing and urban development money to his friends and campaign 
contributors 
meanwhile senators in the keating case are responding to an 
ethics committee request for all available documents that would 
help the panel according to spokesmen for several of the senators 
glenns spokeswoman rebecca bell said the request asked for 
documents that reflect a relationship with charles keating 
american continental corp lincolns parent company and lincoln 
savings and loan and with the federal home loan bank board the 
former name for the thrift regulatory agency

an oral typhoid vaccine approved by the food 
and drug administration has fewer side effects than the injected 
vaccines that are currently available 
this vaccine will be important to tourists business people 
and the military traveling to remote lessdeveloped areas where 
sanitation is poor said louis sullivan secretary of the 
department of health and human services parent agency of the fda 
the fda announced tuesday that it had approved the new vaccine 
called typhoid live oral ty21a 
typhoid fever is rare in the united states about 400 to 500 
cases are reported annually and in the majority of them the 
infection was contracted in other countries the fda said 
the disease is caused by a bacterial organism called salmonella 
typhi which is spread through contaminated food and water 
infection is marked by prolonged fever headache and malaise about 
10 percent f untreated cases and fewer than 1 percent of treated 
cases are fatal the fda said 
antibiotics are used to treat the infection but the fda said 
the recent emergence of drugresistant strains can make the disease 
harder to treat 
immunization against typhoid is recommended for people traveling 
to central and south america africa india and southeast asia 
the injectable vaccine can cause severe sometimes 
incapacitating side effects including fever about 20 percent to 
25 percent of people who are immunized by injection experience side 
effects severe enough to prevent them from working said fda 
spokeswoman faye peterson 
in tests on more than half a million people the new vaccine was 
found to be as effective as the injected form without the side 
effects the fda said 
the vaccine was developed and is made by the swiss serum and 
vaccine institute in berne switzerland berna products corp of 
coral gables fla will distribute the vaccine as vivotif berna 
vaccine

a resort billboard that urges wouldbe 
skiers to go ahead call in sick and hit the slopes in midweek 
has drawn complaints 
we all have different senses of humor we really thought that 
this was so bold that it would be obvious we were kidding robert 
j shannon jr director of marketing at stratton mountain said 
monday 
the sign along interstate 91 which went up in november has 
caused at least 17 people to write letters of complaint to the 
resort 
because of the letters a new billboard will replace the old one 
this week with the lessoffending message more white less 
green 
i just figured that if we had that many complaints there were 
five or six times that many out there shannon said we said 
instead of infuriating any more of the western massachusetts 
populace well just take it down

boris andreyevich grebenyuk a leader in the 
soviet unions coal strike last summer wished he had some soviet 
officials along for his look inside a west virginia mine 
i would have liked to have someone from our government take a 
look at the wonderful working conditions at this mine grebenyuk 
said tuesday if they would have they wouldnt be saying our 
demands are unreasonable 
grebenyuk was one of eight soviet coal miners who toured 
consolidation coal cos blacksville no 2 mine the states 
largest underground mine the visit was arranged by the united mine 
workers of america and the aflcio 
the group of russian ukranian and kazakh miners all were 
prominent players in a strike that ended after soviet leaders 
agreed to recognize the miners dissident union and negotiate for 
better salaries and work conditions 
the group arrived in the united states last week and visited 
union leaders in new york and washington dc before traveling to 
west virginia 
the soviets began their tour of the 4squaremile mine by 
trading sport jackets and ties for green overalls wide leather 
safety belts yellow hardhats safety glasses and batterypowered 
lamps 
in the soviet union we dont have belts like these we use 
string or rope or anything we can find said alexey dimitriyevich 
bokarev 35 who led the strike at the soviet unions donetsk coal 
operation 
after a safety demonstration the group descended 640 feet in a 
caged elevator the start of a threemile train ride to the coal 
face 
the tour through the consol mine was designed to show the 
soviets how trade unions and management work in the united states 
the mine was not part of the ninemonth umw strike against the 
pittston co which affected 1700 miners in west virginia 
virginia and kentucky negotiators have reached a tentative 
agreement to the end that strike but the unions rank and file has 
yet to ratify it key issues are health care and retirement 
benefits 
after tuesdays tour an exuberant bokarev gave a thumbsup sign 
at the mines portal just outside this tiny coal town located 
about 25 miles west of morgantown 
its number 1 bokarev said its truly an ideal working 
situation i will tell my fellow miners that we were justified in 
going on strike after seeing conditions such as these 
grebenyuk agreed we saw humane treatment and a real concern 
for the workers its much easier to work here than in our mines 
he said now we understand why coal mining in the united states 
is a financially viable occupation

president bush on tuesday praised martin 
luther king jrs courage in the face of threats and promised to 
bring to justice the bigots responsible for a wave of bombings 
against civil rights leaders two decades after kings death 
dr benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp a prime 
target of the hate campaign emerged from the oval office saying he 
was fairly satisfied with federal efforts to solve the 
bombings but was seeking further assurance that from the 
presidency down there is a sense of urgency 
bush invited civil rights leaders and students to the white 
house to witness his signing a proclamation in connection with 
mondays holiday in marking kings birthday 
later after meeting privately with hooks bush said he 
reassured the naacp leader that my administration will not 
tolerate bigotry and racial prejudice we must finally leave the 
tired old baggage of bigotry and racial hatred behind us 
bush said his administration will not let up in the fight 
against racism and will work to bring the perpetrators of these 
hideous crimes to justice 
mail bombs last month claimed the lives of a federal judge in 
alabama and a civil rights leader in georgia federal authorities 
intercepted other bombs aimed at the federal courthouse in atlanta 
and an naacp office in jacksonville fla threats have been aimed 
at the 600000member naacp and security has been stepped up at 
its 600 branches across the south 
monday is the 61st anniversary of the birth of king leader of 
the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s that brought an 
end to legal segregation king was assassinated in memphis on april 
4 1968 his birthday has been a federal holiday since 1986 
bush paid tribute to king saying his life was central to the 
story of america his goal was an america where equality and 
opportunity could coexist 
he endured death threats and these obscene phone calls in the 
dead of the night and he refused to be intimidated through his 
courage dr king changed forever america for the better the 
president said 
while he did so much there is much that remains to be done 
particularly when we hear of bombings obscene phone calls 
hate mail each one of us must speak out 
he promised to use the presidency always to denounce and work 
to bring to justice the bigots who stain this good and decent 
land 
despite the cordial words bushs own civil rights appointees 
and stances on judicial rulings have often been the target of 
criticism by civil rights leaders civil rights lobbyists last 
summer helped defeat the nomination of william lucas a former 
michigan sheriff to the justice departments top civil rights 
post lucas now a department liaison official attended the king 
day proclamation signing 
while bush and hooks were meeting leaders of the national urban 
league were unveiling a report decrying black poverty in america 
and calling for an urban marshall plan to close the blackwhite 
economic gap 
hooks said the naacp will be looking for future dates with bush 
to address such social needs and he said he wants money now going 
to the pentagon diverted to social programs 
referring to the reagan administration hooks said the last 
eight years have been very anti as it relates to civil rights 
this present administration i think has moved cautiously and 
judiciously in the field 
he added that bush has made many very excellent statements and 
in the next few months we will be moving to get him to go further 
on it 
we did not ask for any federal protection and he did not offer 
it said hooks adding that he is not interested in leading a 
straitjacket life 
the 600000member naacp is increasing security for its 2200 
branches with advice from the government hooks said adding i 
am satisfied that the president wants to do what is right on this 
thing 
a person or group calling itself americans for a competent 
federal judicial system claimed responsibility for killing us 
circuit judge robert vance on dec 16 at his home outside 
birmingham ala and robert robertson a savannah ga lawyer and

carol stuart who was raised in a 
closeknit family headed by a pizzadough maker was a little 
cinderella a friend said her fairy tale though ended with a 
bullet in her head 
after a week of silence her anguished family is beginning to 
talk about the horror of discovering that the soninlaw they had 
invited to dinner after her death may have been the one who plotted 
the shooting 
its unbelievable we never would have guessed it in a million 
years mrs stuarts brother carl dimaiti said tuesday 
he said even looking back now no one in the family could recall 
a clue of discord between his sister and her husband 
dimaiti said his sister had a totally happy life he and 
others said she was devoted to her family she talked to her mother 
every day and she idolized her father according to one friend 
carols father secondgeneration italianamerican is still 
paying off the cost of carols education and the cost of her 
lavish 1985 wedding 
she was a little cinderella said carol dunn who worked 
closely with carol from the time she started at suffolk university 
law school in boston in 1983 she was a shining light she was so 
bubbly and outgoing i never saw her in a bad mood 
darkhaired and petite 30yearold carol stuart worried about 
her weight and almost always ate salads but mostly dunn said 
she worried about other people and took care of them 
dunn was especially impressed with carols close relationship 
with her family and her thenboyfriend whom everyone called chuck 
tall handsome charles stuart a former altar boy was as 
reserved as carol was vivacious 
he was quiet and she always had something to say so it was 
like carol was the little spotlight and no one paid attention to 
him said dunn who remembers charles stuart faithfully picking 
carol up at school each night you got the impression he was her 
solid rock when she got her engagement ring she was on cloud 
nine 
carol met charles stuart at a restaurant in his hometown of 
revere 10 years ago she was a waitress and he was a cook and 
dishwasher 
remy sharrillo 69 of medford who knew carol and her family 
since she was 15 said her parents never wanted her to marry 
charles 
he was a dishwasher sharrillo said the father didnt 
like him at all and the wife wasnt that crazy about him either 
they finally gave in when she wanted to marry him she idolized the 
guy she was nuts about him 
carols parents giusto and evelyn dimaiti have remained in 
seclusion since carols death they have been under sedation at 
times 
the dimaitis had some of charles stuarts siblings to their 
house while he was hospitalized and invited charles to dinner two 
days before the 30yearold killed himself by jumping off a boston 
bridge 
charles brother matthew told his lawyer that he told some 
friends and family members about the killing after it occurred 
that knowledge is one of the hardest things to face said carl 
dimaiti carols older brother and only sibling 
carl presented a moving eulogy at his sisters funeral in which 
he said she would forgive her killer 
he said his most enduring memory of her was how much she loved 
her family and chuck

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell 
wednesday while the us dollar edged up against the yen 
the dollar closed at 14530 yen up 033 yen from tuesdays 
close of 14497 yen the currency opened at 14533 yen and ranged 
between 14525 yen and 14590 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 25495 points or 067 
percent ending the day at 3769651 it shed 34350 points tuesday 
and fell below the 38000point mark for the first time since dec 
12 when it closed at 3780353 
dealers attributed the fall to a continuing plunge in bond 
prices prices of 10year future government bonds lost 094 yen to 
9945 yen or 70 cents overnight to fall to their lowest level 
since september 1988 
the decline in bond prices raises bond yields which discourages 
stock investment 
nomura securities analyst masahiro umemori said the drop 
occurred after a rumor reported by kyodo news service that soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev is to resign 
whenever the market is weak any news or rumor could affect 
trading and this is what happened today he said 
in currency dealings the dollar continued to rise after opening 
higher following an overnight jump on overseas markets 
as the gorbachev rumor ran across the market japanese investors 
discarded the yen and bought the dollar said yuji nakao a trader 
with chemical bank 
plunges in the stock and bond markets tumbled the foreign 
exchange market which has lacked stability due to political 
uncertainties here and overseas he said 
nakao said investor concerns over domestic politics have had a 
stronger influence on trading than have economic fundamentals such 
as interest rates 
the bank of japan sold 3 million to 4 million intermittently 
he said the intervention would not work unless the us feds and 
bundesbank concertedly intervene he said the central bank does 
not officially comment on its monetary actions 
concerns over the ruling liberal democratic party which 
could still lose in the next election are largely discouraging 
yenbuying especially on overseas markets he said 
a national election for the lower house of parliament is 
expected in midfebruary 
the ldp lost its longheld majority in the upper house of 
parliament last year in a show of public dissatisfaction over the 
partys involvement in stock scandals and the introduction of an 
unpopular consumer tax

hundreds of panamanians used 
blowtorches and chainsaws to tear down the military headquarters of 
manuel antonio noriega then carted off furniture and pornography 
belonging to the toppled dictator 
hundreds of residents went to the bombedout national defense 
headquarters after us troops left the fourstory cement compound 
which had been ringed by soldiers and coils of barbed wire since 
the invasion dec 20 
tell the world that this is not looting said lolita del 
alvarado of the poor neighborhood of chorrillo nearby this is 
money that belongs to the people we had no medicine no schools 
nothing people in this neighborhood lived terribly 
american troops were bulldozing dilapidated and bulletriddled 
apartments and buildings in the area site of some of the heaviest 
fighting of the invasion and are to rebuild the neighborhood 
it was a family outing as parents went with their children 
grandparents and other relatives to the building where noriega once 
commanded his 14000member defense forces 
no one stopped the looters many of whom ransacked noriegas 
office and removed track lighting and wood paneling 
one man showed a visitor a copy of european pornographic 
magazines hidden among pages of official memos 
many sported illfitting military uniforms and shoulder patches 
belonging to noriegas army and laughed and danced in the streets 
bright colored murals depicting noriegas army in action atop 
armored cars and communicating via walkie talkies adorned the 
walls of the compound 
panamanians stopped to stare and snickered when they came upon 
the words every man must at one time in his life decide whether 
he dares go for victory risking everything or sit down and watch 
the victors walk by 
noriega went into hiding the night of the invasion and on 
christmas eve sought refuge inside the vatican embassy he remained 
there until he surrendered to us troops a week ago and was flown 
to miami to face drugtrafficking charges 
panamanians used blowtorches chainsaws hammers and ice picks 
to tear down the gates and iron fences surrounding the compound and 
carted off pieces of wall window frames and corrugated tin roofs 
outside the compound a truck with war material painted on 
its side was picked apart and sat without wheels other vehicles 
lay on their sides nothing but corrugated steel carcasses 
earlier tuesday between 150 and 200 protesters marched against 
the invasion in the first demonstration of its kind they passed 
out leaflets lambasting the savage invasion which cut an open 
wound in our national sovereignty 
another 8000 people attended a mass and celebrated noreigas 
downfall chanting viva panama and waving white handerchiefs 
archibishop marcos mcgrath urged the crowd to forget rancor and 
hatred to build a new panama 
both events commemorated the day of the martyrs a national 
holiday in memory of 23 panamanians who died in antiamerican riots 
in 1964 
dozens of us soldiers ringed the peruvian ambassadors 
residence where 11 of noriegas top officers had sought refuge 
monday 
the peruvian government said it had granted asylum to noriegas 
security aide capt gonzalo gonzalez who is on the us 
mostwanted list the others included noriegas secretary capt 
marcela tason his top press spokesman maj edgardo lopez 
grimaldo and maj heraclides sucre a commander of the elite 
battalion 2000 
perus foreign ministry spokesman jose torres told the 
associated press in lima that they would be allowed to come to peru 
if they wished but that there had been no discussions on the 
matter 
it is supposed that they will try to go to some friendly 
country perhaps peru torres said 
president alan garcia has roundly criticized the us invasion 
and refused to recognize the government of guillermo endara 
peruvian charge daffairs luis sandiga denied panamanian claims 
that the residence was sheltering lt col luis papo cordova 
one of noriegas mostwanted associates 
in peru foreign minister guillermo larco cox said cordova had 
sought refuge in the ambassadors residence but peruvian officials 
refused 
he said cordova was considered a persona non grata and left 
the residence of his own will the foreign minister did not say 
whether cordova was apprehended by us troops or if he had left 
before the troops surrounded the residence

nearly three weeks after the invasion of 
panama the pentagon says it estimates 220 panamanian civilians 
were killed during operation just cause 
pentagon spokesman bob hall briefing reporters tuesday 
stressed the figure was an estimate and that us military 
authorities and panamanian officials were working to refine the 
accuracy of that figure 
the us military in panama is working in concert with 
representatives of all the hospitals several agencies across the 
spectrum of the panamanian government and various relief and 
humanitarian organizations to determine the number of panamanians 
killed hall said 
ever since the military attempt to oust gen manuel antonio 
noriega began dec 20 us military officials have been unable to 
offer any sound estimate of the number of civilians killed in the 
fighting and social chaos that erupted 
hall said the institute for legal medicine which acts as the 
governments coroner has counted 203 civilians killed as a direct 
result of the military operation 
however hall said that organization still has a number of 
cases to review and he said us official expect the number to rise 
were being conservative we think therell be a few more we 
expect the figure to rise slightly hall said of the institutes 
figure 
hall said 203 individuals were included in the 220 estimate 
reached by us officials and that both numbers include 
panamanian defense forces and dignity battalions not in uniform 
and otherwise unidentifiable as well as looters and bona fide and 
innocent civilians 
the institute has been unable to make any determination 
whether the deaths were caused by us military pdf dignity 
battalions looters or other civilians hall said 
officials estimate nearly 300 panamanian soldiers were killed in 
the fighting the us military death toll was 23 
the spokesman said some 23000 us troops remain in panama but 
that about 4000 have returned to the united states about 13000 
troops were stationed in panama before the invasion 
hall said he could offer no timetable for the return of the 
remaining us troops he said about 700 were deployed in panama in 
nationbuilding exercises to help reestablish civil and 
governmental operations 
defense secretary dick cheney plans to discuss troop withdrawal 
with gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
later this week the spokesman said 
hall said us troops detained 4320 panamanians in the course 
of the military operation and 675 remained in detention by us 
military authorities 
those still in custody were being held pending background checks 
or until the panamanian legal and justice systems are rebuilt 
pentagon officials said 
hall also said us troops were searching vehicles leaving the 
peruvian embassy in panama city because there have been some 
reports that people may or may not be in the embassy 
in panama government officials said the troops surrounded the 
embassy because two of noriegas top associates had taken refuge 
inside 
hall said decisions about the conduct of us troops are made by 
the southern command headed by gen maxwell thurman and policy 
considerations were taken into account in the movement of us 
troops in the region 
general thurman has the complete confidence of cheney 
powell and president bush hall said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said us 
officials know who was in the peruvian embassy but she would not 
identify them she declined to discuss the legal authority of us 
troops involved in surrounding the embassy

the international drug trade threatens 
the stability of entire nations and the battle against drug 
cartels can only be won if efficiently waged on a global scale 
according to a un report released today 
despite unprecedented counteraction taken by the world 
community an interlocking network of criminal drug trafficking 
organizations heavily financed and armed has become even bolder 
and more ruthless the 39page survey says 
in its review of 1989 the viennabased international narcotics 
control board warns that the danger of undermining and paralyzing 
political institutions and economies of some countries has never 
been greater 
the traffickers declaration of war against a single country 
endangers the security and integrity of all countries and 
constitutes war against the whole international community the 
board said 
to overcome the assault the response of the international 
community must be concerted swift more forceful more 
comprehensive more innovative 
the boards 13 members elected by the un economic and social 
council do not represent their governments the board also 
cooperates with other international agencies concerned with drug 
control 
for the criminal trafficking organizations linked often 
with terrorist insurgents to prevail in the struggle in any one 
country would imperil all countries the report says the war 
to defeat them must be waged globally 
a situation as we see it at present has never existed 
before board secretary abdelaziz bahi said in an interview 
there have always been drug traffickers but now they not only 
want money they want to seize power in the state he said 
since 1988 illicit production of narcotics has increased and 
involved more countries the report says citing as an ominous 
development the spread of opium poppy cultivation to guatemala 
and colombia 
in its survey the board says it considers a milestone the 
conclusion in december 1988 of the convention against illicit 
traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances 
as of november 77 countries and the european economic community 
were signatories to the convention the board said 
the survey analyzing drug abuse in several regions noted a 
continued increase in drugrelated deaths in western europe that 
has been escalating sharply in recent years drug abuse and 
illicit trafficking remain widespread throughout the region 
drugrelated crime is rising quicker than any other type of 
criminal offenses 
in the united states a national household survey on drug 
abuse shows that the estimated number of people abusing drugs at 
least once a month has dropped 37 percent the report attributed 
the us findings to a change in the general national attitude 
toward drug abuse 
nevertheless the frequent abuse of cocaine is estimated to 
have doubled since 1985 the survey said of drug use in the 
united states 
in that year abuse of cocaine in the highly addictive form of 
smokable crack began to spread particularly in the inner cities 
and generated greater crime and violence 
this has led to a 28fold increase since 1984 in hospital 
admissions involving the smoking of cocaine which is now regarded 
by authorities as the most pressing national drug abuse problem 
the report says 
the board voiced particular concern over the heavily armed drug 
cartels in latin america 
to pursue their activities these cartels with enormous 
financial resources continue their ruthless efforts to undermine 
political institutions disrupt national economies murder 
officials and private citizens the survey says 
also of great concern is that drug abuse is spreading 
throughout the continent and the countries of the region are at 
risk of becoming major consumers 
in colombia where authorities have declared an allout war on 
drug traffickers cocaine seizures in 1988 reached the highest 
level since 1984 the report says 
some 25 tons of cocaine were seized and more than 800 
laboratories destroyed the report said it did not give figures 
for 1989

and these markets have affected each other he added

sen dave durenberger acknowledging that 
depositions in the ethics case against him appear to support key 
allegations has canceled a 10day to moscow in part because of 
time spent on preparing what he insists will be a strong defense to 
present to the senate ethics committee 
i have a full legislative plate for this next congressional 
session the minnesota republican said tuesday in a statement 
and admittedly my time has been taken up by more personal 
concerns in the last month which have delayed my preparations for 
the state of congress 
meanwhile he outlined his determination to prevail in the 
ethics investigation in interviews with minnesota newspapers 
nobody out there is going to run me out on a rail he told 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch nobody out there is going to 
tell me to resign 
the ethics committee is investigating allegations that 
durenberger laundered speaking fees through a book contract and 
used special interest groups to underwrite personal trips to 
boston the committee is also looking into real estate transactions 
through which durenberger was reimbursed by the senate for renting 
his minneapolis condominium to himself 
durenberger said he read his attorneys summary of depositions 
taken in his case for the first time tuesday and concluded the 
ethics committee is focusing on his book promotions not on his 
trips to boston and him condominium he said the depositions taken 
at face value appear to support the charges against him 
some people allege that they didnt know that i was speaking 
pursuant to a relationship with a publisher he told the pioneer 
press dispatch they thought i was responding to a request to 
give an honorarium speech sometimes allegedly people were not 
informed that i was making a speech on behalf of a publisher 
durenberger suggested to the minneapolis star tribune that his 
ethics problems may be the result of sloppy legal work by top 
aides he relied upon heavily to handle his personal finances

accelerator to an engineering blueprint theyre finding that

59 billion

exxon initially said it had lost only 5000 gallons 
the report did not say how much more oil leaked because the 
operator restarted the pipeline but joe mcmillan a company vice 
president defended the workers actions 
the company summary did not mention the faulty leakdetection 
system mcmillan said only that the operator whom he would not 
identify had noticed erratic signals from one system that 
detected the leak after a malfunction in an automatic valve and 
meter disabled another shutdown system 
were still trying to chase down the erratic signals he 
said 
mcmillan said the operator restarted the pipeline because the 
system appeared to be normal on pipeline monitors typically he 
said a plant operator restarts the flow of oil after a shutdown to 
confirm there is a problem 
mcmillan said the plant operator did not get a confirmation of 
the problem each of the three times that he restarted the system 
the third time however he decided against resuming the flow of 
oil 
the oil oozed through a gash in an underwater pipeline for six 
hours before the pipeline was finally shut down the summary said 
the cause of the crack hasnt been determined and exxon plans to 
remove the pipeline next week for metallurgical testing 
ash complained that exxons safety procedures dont even begin 
to meet the basic housekeeping needs of a major organization thats 
passing this much oil from one facility to another under a 
metropolitan water body 
the pipeline runs beneath the arthur kill between exxons bayway 
refinery in linden and a company distribution terminal in bayonne 
mcmillan said the internal report released to state and federal 
investigators is preliminary 
the summary released a week after the spill ended corporate 
silence that public officials had criticized as stonewalling 
a new jersey grand jury is investigating exxon for possible 
violations of the state oceanpollution law in the spill which 
fouled ecologically sensitive marshland killed at least 150 birds 
and partially closed the shipping channel 
exxon also was involved in the nations largest oil spill the 
grounding last march of the tanker exxon valdez in alaska in which 
more than 10 million gallons of crude spilled

france will reopen its embassy in afghanistan 
becoming the first major western power to do so since a usled 
exodus just before the soviet army withdrew last year a foreign 
ministry spokesman said today 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
embassy would be headed by a charge daffaires he said the 
diplomat had not yet been named and a date for the reopening was 
not yet set 
the announcement was first made tuesday in islamabad by edwige 
avice frances deputy foreign minister who said the decision had 
no political significance 
speaking to reporters during an official visit mrs avice said 
the action should not be considered support for the existing kabul 
regime and noted that pakistan a strong supporter of the 
antigovernment rebels has kept its kabul embassy open 
the united states britain and other countries withdrew their 
diplomatic personnel from kabul before the february 1989 withdrawal 
of soviet forces citing fears the capital might be overrun by 
antigovernment guerrillas 
in the past year the afghan government has shown greater 
staying power than expected although kabul has come under rocket 
attacks it has not proved especially dangerous for the diplomatic 
personnel who remained 
nevertheless western countries were reluctant to return to 
kabul for that could be seen as conceding that the usbacked 
rebels were not close to defeating the government of president 
najib which moscow continues to support 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the french 
decision came over us objections 
reports that france was planning to return diplomats to kabul 
came to light months ago and secretary of state james a baker iii 
raised the matter with foreign minister roland dumas in st martin 
on dec 16 the times said 
we explained that we dont recognize this government that we 
consider it an illegitimate government and we shouldnt be sending 
in diplomats because that gives the impression of business as 
usual the newspaper quoted a state department official as saying 
moslem rebels have been seeking to overthrow the kabul 
government since communists seized power in an april 1978 coup the 
soviets intervened in december 1979 but were unable to end the 
insurgency pulling out after 15000 soviet troops were killed

the american civil liberties union presented a 
plan to the school board advocating searches of specific students 
suspected of carrying weapons board members and a parents group 
welcomed it 
the aclu which had sued the school district over random sweeps 
for weapons gave the detroit board of education a 13point 
proposal on how to boost security without stepping on students 
rights 
im extremely pleased and enthused that the aclu made the 
decision to be more proactive board president lawrence c 
patrick said after receiving the proposal tuesday theyre not 
only helping us identify the problems theyre helping us identify 
positive solutions 
the group black parents for a quality education also applauded 
the plan which was drafted by an aclu task force and referred to a 
school board committee for review 
what we see now is the aclu reaching out a hand to the 
board group spokeswoman helen moore said i dont think the 
aclu is changing their position i think theyre trying to qualify 
the issues and qualify the rights of students 
as the number of the guns and knives seized from the 171000 
students in the district has risen district officials have called 
for more security 
but the aclu challenged sweep searches in a 1987 lawsuit against 
the school district leonard grossman president of the aclus 
metropolitan detroit chapter said the legal action forced schools 
to give advance notice of searches and draft a policy on how 
searches would be conducted 
the aclu considers random mass searches an ad hoc and panicky 
way of dealing with the problem said howard simon the groups 
executive director for michigan 
the districts own records show that searching specific 
students based on specific tips is 10 times as effective as the 
mass searches 
thirtyone guns were confiscated from students between aug 28 
and nov 30 compared with 24 for the period last year 
searches of specific individuals are one part of the aclu plan 
but its main thrust grossman said is teaching the democratic 
process to students 
we cant lower the level of violence in schools unless we 
teach students how to live in a democratic society said 
grossman the aclu recommends a speakers bureau and field trips to 
lawenforcement agencies to accomplish that goal 
other proposals include using police cadets parent patrols and 
other volunteers to bolster security in and around schools 
expanding the districts anonymous hotline program to get tips on 
students carrying weapons and setting up alternative schools for 
students expelled for weapons violations

firecrackers didnt work neither did rubber 
bullets now scientists hope a little romance might make sea lions 
forget about the easy catch at the ballard locks 
for years sea lions migrating from california have parked just 
outside the locks and adjacent fish ladder through which salmon 
and steelhead trout migrate on their way to spawning beds in 
streams and rivers that feed lake washington 
the sea lions have devastated steelhead runs last year only 
700 of the fish made it past the sea lions wildlife officials say 
fisheries officials noting that only male sea lions make the 
winter trek to washington want to carry the sea lions back to the 
channel islands off southern california where female sea lions 
linger 
maybe these transplanted males will develop other interests 
aside from returning to the puget sound area to eat steelhead 
said joe scordino of the national marine fisheries service 
even if romance doesnt bloom it would take the sea lions more 
than a month to swim back to washington meaning they would miss 
the peak steelhead run of midfebruary to midmarch scordino said 
fisheries officials are waiting to see if congress approves the 
150000 to 175000 the program will require if money is 
approved they also must convince california officials the sea 
lions will do no harm there 
first we have to get the money and then we will worry about an 
agreement with california scordino said 
the marine mammals have caused problems for the fisheries of 
both states since their numbers began to multiply after passage of 
the marine mammals protection act of 1972 scientists say there now 
are more than 177000 sea lions 
last year 39 were captured at the locks which separate puget 
sound from the lake washington ship canal two died and the rest 
were driven to long beach peninsula near the oregon line and 
deposited back in the sea 
but a few days later 13 of the animals each weighing 500 to 
600 pounds were back at the locks gorging themselves on steelhead 
in recent years fisheries officials have tried scare tactics by 
using firecrackers rubber bullets and taped recordings of orca 
whales the animals natural predators 
theyve also tried harassing them by boat tossing them 
foultasting fish and erecting nets to keep them away from the 
locks nothing has worked

a west berlin prosecutor freed east germanys 
former top foreign trader after refusing to extradite him on fraud 
charges saying the man could unfairly wind up facing treason 
charges in his homeland 
treason carries a maximum penalty of death in the communist 
nation 
alexander schalckgolodkowski wanted for alleged embezzlement 
and illegal weapons dealings abroad was released from a west 
berlin jail on tuesday said prosecutor dietrich schultz 
schalckgolodkowski had been in custody since he turned himself 
in to west berlin authorities on dec 6 
schultz said east germanys leaders had failed to ease concerns 
that further charges such as that of treason could be hidden 
behind the accusations of massive embezzlement 
schultz also said it ultimately became clear that the east 
german accusations against schalckgolodkowski 61 apparently 
related to another former top official whom he did not name 
east german authorities who demanded schalckgolodkowskis 
extradition expressed dismay about the west berlin decision said 
adn the nations official news agency adding that an 
international warrant for his arrest would stay in effect 
also tuesday east germanys official news agency adn said 
former communist party leader egon krenz quit his parliament seat 
his last public office 
krenz stepped down as party leader on dec 3 after just six 
weeks in office because of mounting criticism of the party and his 
ties to hardline leader erich honecker 
honecker was ousted oct 18 after east germans took to the 
streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand an end to 
authoritarian oneparty rule 
adn said east germanys environment minister hans reichelt 65 
also quit citing his age opposition groups have severely attacked 
ministry policies saying they have turned east germany into one of 
europes most polluted countries 
meanwhile franz schoenhuber head of west germanys 
extremeright republican party told a news conference in west 
berlin that the organization soon will set up electoral groups in 
east germany 
the party has been branded a neonazi group by east germans 
communists 
we will find ways and means to get tons of campaign material 
into the german democratic republic said schoenhuber a former 
nazi waffen ss soldier 
he predicted that at least 10 percent of the voters in free 
elections promised for may 6 would vote for candidates favored by 
the republicans 
that figure would give the republicans a prominent role among 
the numerous factions jockeying for control of east germany 
east germanys communists have warned of rightwing extremism 
and have vowed to keep the republicans out of the elections 
the communists themselves are fighting to maintain their still 
considerable hold on east germany 
they still control the nations media major meeting places and 
supplies of essentials like paper but shortages low worker morale 
and resignations from the party are challenging their dominance 
the communist party newspaper berliner zeitung reminded its 
readers tuesday that opposition groups are running for the first 
time and claimed many candidates feel the need to almost shove 
opponents out of the way 
all this leads to the fear that it could get especially rough 
in the coming weeks the berliner zeitung said referring to the 
campaign 
the newspapers commentary said all sides should reach a 
fairness agreement specifying campaign conduct

separatists exploded in the office of a senior hindu police 
official in punjab today killing him and three others on the spot

rest below the desk of senior superintendent of police govind ram 
they said 
the blast occurred at jalandhar 50 miles southeast of the sikh 
holy city of amritsar 
ram was on the hit list of sikh militants campaigning for an 
independent sikh nation in punjab state the militants had accused 
him of torturing sikhs who were in police custody 
jalandhar superintendent of police suresh araro said the blast 
killed ram and three other policemen at least 20 other people 
mostly policemen were injured 
the blast was so powerful that the small building housing rams 
office collapsed it was a very powerful time bomb araro said 
when reached by telephone we normally do not see these things in 
the hands of the terrorists 
rams 18yearold son rajen was killed by sikh separatists 
last year in revenge for the policemans alleged actions against 
sikh militants 
todays deaths brought the total number of people killed by sikh 
militants in the punjab in the first 10 days of this year to 69 
last year 1821 deaths were blamed on the militants whose violent 
separatist campaign began in 1982 
sikhs make up 2 percent of indias 880 million people but they 
have a slight majority in punjab a prosperous northern farming 
state 
sikh militants allege they are discriminated by hindus who make 
up 82 percent of the nationwide population

the release of jailed black 
nationalist nelson mandela is only a matter of time 
governmentrun radio said today in the strongest signal yet that 
his freedom is imminent 
the editorial by the south africa broadcasting corp also said 
mandela the countrys best known black leader can play a central 
role in opening blackwhite political dialogue 
it has been clear for some months that it is only a matter of 
time before mr mandelas release is announced the radio said 
moreover by identifying himself with the ideals of peaceful 
development he has redefined his position 
in recent weeks there has been almost daily speculation in the 
media on mandelas release and president fw de klerk is widely 
expected to make an announcement on mandelas status when he opens 
parliament on feb 1 
for most of mandelas 27 years in prison the whiteled 
government has portrayed him and other members of his outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement as terrorists and 
communists 
but recently it has described mandela in favorable terms in an 
apparent attempt to prepare the white community for his release 
he would be in a position to make an important contribution to 
the creation of the conditions in which blackwhite talks could 
get under way the sabc said 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
he has refused to renounce the ancs guerrilla campaign saying 
he will do so only if the organization is legalized and south 
africas apartheid system of racial segregation is dismantled 
the citizen a progovernment daily said a planned visit within 
the next month by us political leader jesse jackson may affect 
the date of mandelas release 
the government does not want to give mr jackson an 
archcritic of south africa any kudos as a result of the release 
of mandela which would be the case if an announcement were made 
during his visit the citizen said citing unidentified 
government sources 
the government has said it will grant jackson a visa but no 
dates for his trip have been announced 
mandela has received a steady stream of visitors in recent 
weeks ranging from cabinet ministers to prominent antiapartheid 
leaders he met dec 13 with de klerk at the presidential office 
business day the countrys leading financial daily said the 
speculation on mandelas release is filled with an expectancy 
that borders on religious fervor as though it were the coming of a 
savior 
the reality is likely to be much more complicated the 
editorial said mandelas release must be seen as part of the 
jockeying if not the struggle for power within the antiapartheid 
forces 
de klerk wants to open negotiations on a new constitution with 
black leaders but says the anc must commit itself to peaceful 
solutions before it can participate 
the anc in a statement monday marking its 78th anniversary 
said its guerrilla campaign remained an important part of its 
struggle for black political rights 
the nationwide unrest that rocked the black townships from 1984 
to 1986 has subsided and the ancs guerrilla campaign has been 
largely dormant for more than a year however the country remains 
under a 43monthold state of emergency

a judge postponed a bail hearing for manuel noriega 
and ordered that the ousted panamanian dictator not be moved from 
miami without the courts permission while he awaits a 
drugtrafficking trial 
judge william hoeveler said during a hearing that federal 
marshals must submit any plans to transfer noriega whom sources 
say has been held in a special area below the courthouse since 
arriving in miami last thursday 
the us district judge also set a jan 26 bail hearing for 
noriega who attended tuesdays onehour session dressed in dark 
slacks and a lightblue shirt 
the session was held on a motion by the us attorneys office 
for a bail hearing after defense attorneys last week waived an 
immediate bail hearing at noriegas arraignment on drug trafficking 
charges 
but hoeveler postponed the hearing at the request of defense 
attorneys who said they needed more time 
the judge said defense attorneys would be able to respond to any 
request to move noriega but requests and responses concerning any 
move will be sealed 
this case is at its beginning hoeveler said and it is 
very important the defendant is entitled to whatever time he 
needs to prepare his defense 
defense attorney steven kollin told hoeveler he opposes any move 
of noriega who was toppled by the us invasion of panama 
i dont want a change my client doesnt want a change 
kollin said 
prosecutor dexter lehtinen did not say if he wanted noriega to 
remain in miami noting that marshals will decide if he should be 
transferred 
it could not be determined whether marshals made any such 
request after the hearing because of the order to keep them 
confidential 
us marshals and noriegas attorneys refuse to disclose his 
whereabouts although meetings with defense counsel have been held 
in the courthouse 
the new york times quoting an unidentified source reported 
tuesday that noriega probably would be moved from miami most 
likely to the federal penitentiary in atlanta 
but angie sheffer spokeswoman for the atlanta prison said no 
preparations were being made for noriegas arrival 
federal officials believe the metropolitan correctional center 
a federal prison near miami does not offer adequate security to 
hold noriega the times said 
noriegas quarters below the courthouse reportedly are lavish 
compared to the spartan room at the vaticans papal nunciate in 
panama city where noriega took refuge for 10 days following the 
us invasion 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that noriega was being held in an area principally 
used for the federal witness protection program 
it includes a bedroom living room with a television and radio 
and kitchen although noreigas food has been brought from the 
outside 
kollin and cocounsel frank rubino said they have met daily with 
noriega charged with taking 46 million in bribes from colombian 
cocaine traffickers to turn his nation into a way station for 
smugglers 
they said they will likely challenge the courts jurisdiction 
over noriega who they claim is a head of state and subject to 
diplomatic immunity from prosecution defense attorneys also claim 
the february 1988 grand jury indictment of noriega was politically 
motivated and the invasion violated international law 
the grand jury indicted noriega and 15 others on drug 
trafficking charges 
one of them eduardo pardo 44 pleaded innocent tuesday before 
a federal magistrate pardo accused of transporting drug money 
from the united states to panama is being held at the metropolitan 
correctional center

a former junkie who later attended yale university 
said he would continue his brand of aids prevention work after a 
judge cleared him of a charge of distributing clean needles and 
syringes to drug addicts 
jon parker 35 was acquitted of one count of distributing the 
materials after a oneday nonjury trial in boston municipal court 
parker said the judges decision was courageous 
asked if he would continue distributing needles he said i 
dont want to flout the law let me just say the work will 
continue 
when pressed he said he would give out a clean needle on his 
way home after the trial if a drug addict offered to turn in a 
dirty one 
before tuesdays trial parker said he hoped to change a state 
requirement for a prescription to buy a hypodermic needle 
his lawyer arnold abelow said the ruling should send a message 
to the legislature where proposals to legalize needle possession 
and to establish a needleexchange program in boston have bogged 
down 
judge sally a kelly said the facts showed parker possessed the 
needles but that possession even without prescription is not in 
and of itself evil 
prosecutors said the decision conflicted with law 
the law is pretty specific and her verdict was contrary to 
the facts said assistant district attorney mary orfanello 
parker is founder of a 50member group called the aids brigade 
comprised of former yale graduate students as well as former 
addicts and convicts it was formed about five years ago and 
distributes aids education materials bleach to clean needles and 
syringes in boston new york city new haven conn and new jersey 
among those who testified in support of parkers program were a 
british physician in charge of a needle exchange program in 
liverpool england and the aids adviser to mayor raymond flynn 
flynn endorsed a needle exchange program that was rejected by 
the city council last year 
critics of needle exchange programs maintain it encourages drug 
abuse 
parker has said his background makes him well qualified to bring 
aids prevention to the streets 
he shot heroin as a teenager and robbed drug stores for money 
and supplies at 17 he served time in prison earning his high 
school equivalency diploma in jail a month after his 1974 release 
he was caught violating parole and was allowed to check into a drug 
rehabilitation center 
he later entered hampshire college in amherst where he studied 
biology and then went to yales school of epidemiology and public 
health 
last year the nations first fullscale governmentsponsored 
needle exchange program to fight the spread of aids was approved by 
the tacomapierce county board of health in washington state

rose kushner a medical writer and psychologist 
and forceful advocate for women with breast cancer has died of the 
disease at age 60 
kushner who resided in kensington md died sunday the new 
york times reported today 
she gained national fame in 1975 with the publication of why 
me what every woman should know about breast cancer to save her 
life an account of her own battle with the disease 
breast cancer specialists initially rejected many of the steps 
she advocated including less radical surgery which now are common 
kushner focused her energies on the breast cancer crusade in 
1974 when she discovered a lump in her breast but refused to 
submit to the thenroutine onestep procedure 
in the mid70s a woman undergoing treatment would be 
anesthetized the lump removed for biopsy and if malignant the 
breast would be removed the patient would not know until she awoke 
whether the breast was gone 
kushner fought against the onestep procedure arguing that 
women needed time after a diagnosis to find the best surgeon after 
18 phone calls she finally found a general surgeon who would 
remove just the lump 
now the onestep procedure is no longer used 
she is probably the single most important person in leading to 
this major change in breast surgery dr bruce a chabner once 
said chabner is the director of the division of cancer treatment 
at the national cancer institute in bethesda md i dont think 
the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had 
not been so persistent in her efforts 
kushner founded and was director of the breast cancer advisory 
center through which she provided women with information about 
their options when faced with the disease 
this year she was scheduled to be awarded the james ewing award 
from the society of surgical oncology for the outstanding 
contribution by a nonphysician to the fight against cancer 
her husband harvey kushner called this poetic justice in 
1975 the societys members had booed her off the stage after she 
challenged their standard procedures 
kushner is survived by her husband her sons gantt of silver 
spring md and todd of rockville md a daughter lesley kushner 
of san francisco and three brothers

a special parliamentary panel has found 
grounds to investigate ousted communist leader todor zhivkov for 
possible prosecution on charges of illegally stashing state funds 
in swiss bank accounts 
lyuben koulishev a member of the panel set up after zhivkovs 
nov 10 ouster said on television tuesday night the committee has 
enough information to pursue an investigation against zhivkov 
the huge amount of state money used to publish numerous books 
by the former bulgarian leader gives grounds to bring a case 
against him the state news agency bta quoted the panel as saying 
the panel is looking into abuses of official power under the 
zhivkov government 
no figure was given on the amount of money zhivkov may have in 
swiss banks 
koulishev said the foreign ministry is in contact with the banks 
little is known about zhivkovs daytoday life after his 
ouster there have been rumors that his movements are restricted 
there have also been rumors he has undergone medical tests 
zhivkovs hometown is pravets about an hours drive from sofia 
he is reported to have more than 20 other residences as well and 
it is unclear where he is currently living 
at a meeting in sofia in november the ruling communist partys 
politburo decided to turn over to the public a series of official 
residences and hunting retreats mostly used by zhivkov and his 
guests 
at least 13 plush official residences were turned over to 
charitable student and tourist organizations including one at 
pravets bta reported 
in addition some six hunting retreats that had been used by 
zhivkov and his friends and guests were made available to the 
ministry of agriculture and to an organization promoting 
international hunting tourism 
petar mladenov who replaced zhivkov on nov 10 has promised to 
steer bulgaria out of its stalinist past and corruption and into a 
democratic future 
but a fascinating account of zhivkovs ouster indicates the 
former leader who had been in power for 34 years did not go 
willingly and probably still enjoys the support of some communists 
according to ventsel raichev a bulgarian journalist who wrote 
the story for the soviet weekly moscow news zhivkov had resisted 
all calls for reform in bulgaria and had decided to crush 
opposition inside and outside the party

hong kong governor sir david wilson arrived today 
for talks aimed at easing tensions between china and britain and 
reviving flagging confidence in the future of hong kong 
wilson making his first trip to beijing since the bloody june 
suppression of the prodemocracy movement was to meet with a 
chinese leadership that has been increasingly firm in opposing 
political reform in the british colony 
during his threeday stay he was to talk with premier li peng 
and vice foreign minister zhou nan ji pengfei head of the hong 
kong and macao affairs office in the state council 
wilson said upon arriving that he hoped he would have an 
opportunity to explain the views of hong kongs people and try to 
reestablish a dialogue which is so important for dealing with the 
various issues we have facing us 
we need to have a correct understanding of the position of 
both sides so that we can find ways to deal with any particular 
problems that we face he said 
the visit will be a last chance for britain to express its views 
before the final meeting in canton next week of the 
chinesedominated body drawing up the laws that will govern hong 
kong after it reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
relations between china and britain have deteriorated since the 
army marched on beijing june 34 and crushed the studentled 
prodemocracy movement killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
china has criticized britain for permitting prodemocracy 
activities in hong kong which it has said are aimed at 
overthrowing the chinese government and for trying to 
internationalize debate over the colonys future 
the chinese government on dec 30 also accused britain of a 
gross violation of past agreements in its decision to give 
50000 hong kong families the right of abode in britain before 1997 
the british decision was aimed at providing guarantees for the 
future of hong kongs most talented people whose confidence in 
life under communist rule was badly shaken by beijings bloody 
suppression of dissent 
chinas condemnation of the move came several weeks after prime 
minister margaret thatcher dispatched foreign policy adviser sir 
percy cradock on a secret mission to beijing to try to defuse 
controversies between the two sides 
wilson was likely to discuss chinas objections to the 
introduction of more democratic government in hong kong which 
britain says is crucial to the stability of the colony 
vice foreign minister zhou at the airport to greet wilson 
acknowledged that we have had some problems and this is what we 
dont like to see he said he believed that through sincere and 
friendly talks theres no problem we cant solve

an indiana jones stunt attraction and 
a 1930sstyle hollywood backlot attraction are among possibilities 
for what may be disneylands biggest expansion in its 35year 
history park employees said 
disney officials are keeping mum about specifics of the 
expansion plans until an announcement friday by disney chairman 
michael eisner 
the expansion is in keeping with walt disneys founding 
philosophy that the park will never be completed as long as there 
was imagination left in the world disneyland spokesman bob roth 
told the orange county register in a report published tuesday 
it involves the next 10 years but i cant tell you anymore 
he said 
but employees who last week were shown preliminary plans by 
president richard nunis told the newspaper the park plans to build 
two new theme areas mickeys birthday land and a partial 
reproduction of a hollywood studio tour attraction at walt disney 
world in florida 
those plans also included a stunt attraction based on the 
indiana jones movies and rides based on the animated movie 
character roger rabbit and the muppets they said disney bought 
the rights to the muppet characters last year 
they said none of this was guaranteed disney employee 
christy bauer said but i got the impression that it was probably 
going to happen because everything was really detailed 
in their presentation to employees disneyland officials gave no 
construction timetables or cost estimates 
it would be the first major expansion since bear country now 
called critter country was added in 1972 disney has about 78 
acres available for expansion in anaheim including about 30 acres 
within the park

here are excerpts from premier li pengs speech 
wednesday lifting martial law in beijing the text was translated 
by the official xinhua news agency 
comrades and compatriots 
i am here tonight making an important announcement the state 
council has issued an order on lifting as of january 11 1990 the 
martial law imposed in parts of beijing 
this is a big event of concern to the people of the capital and 
the whole country the lifting of the martial law imposed in parts 
of beijing indicates that the situation in the capital and the 
country as a whole has become stable social order has returned to 
normal and a great victory has been won in checking the turmoil 
and quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
this fact shows once again to the whole country and the whole 
world that the chinese communist party the chinese government and 
the chinese people are capable of running their own affairs well 
and maintaining a longterm stable political economic and social 
development no matter what may happen in the world we shall 
unswervingly follow the socialist road 
we all remember what it was like before martial law was imposed 
in parts of beijing at that time school classes were suspended 
traffic disrupted workers blocked on their way to work order of 
production and life severely damaged and the capital in a state of 
anarchy 
in those circumstances had the government not taken the 
resolute measure of imposing martial law and stopping the turmoil 
and riots in time the fruits of revolution earned by several 
generations through protracted struggle the achievements made in 
the four decades of socialist construction and in the decadelong 
reform and opening to the outside world would have been destroyed 
our country would have been split up and hundreds of millions of 
people would have again fallen into the abyss of misery 
developments of the situation in the past seven months or so 
since the imposition of martial law have shown that our country is 
stable politically economically and socially production and life 
are in good order commodity supplies are sufficient and people 
live and work in peace and contentment 
the officers and men of the martial law enforcement units of the 
peoples liberation army and the vast numbers of the cadres and men 
of the police and the armed police have resolutely carried out the 
decision of the party central committee the state council and the 
central military commission and performed immortal historic feats 
in maintaining order and security in the capital and in defending 
the communist party leadership and the socialist system for this 
the people will never forget them 
the imposition of martial law in parts of beijing won support 
and backing from vast numbers of workers peasants intellectuals 
students cadres at all levels and urban residents in the capital 
as well as from the people of all nationalities in the country 
during the martial law period there were lots of moving deeds in 
which troops loved civilians civilians supported troops 
disregarding their own safety and fighting in unity 
we have made tremendous achievements in reform and opening to 
the outside world over the past decade practice shows that the 
principle for reform and opening to the outside world is absolutely 
correct and it will remain unchanged because it has been rooted in 
chinas soil and in the hearts of the people 
at present some unstable factors still exist in our society 
the hostile forces in and outside the country will not give up 
their attempt to subvert the socialist system in our country there 
are some temporary difficulties our country needs to overcome in 
improving the national economy we must have a sober understanding 
of this 
it is our conviction that no matter how the international 
situation changes our people will under the leadership of the 
chinese communist party steadily push ahead the great cause of 
building socialism with chinese characteristics

the commerce department has ruled tentatively 
that computer software is merchandise subject to unfair trade laws 
in a preliminary ruling announced monday the department said 
imports of computeraided software engineering products from 
singapore are being subsidized and thus are subject to 
countervailing duties 
the department pointed out that the software is sold as a 
prepackaged product which can be purchased offtheshelf rather 
than as an intangible such as electronically transmitted material 
the government of singapore had argued that the software is not 
within the scope of the countervailing duty law because it is not 
merchandise 
the software is used in the disk operating sytems of personal 
computers 
if the preliminary ruling is confirmed by further commerce 
investigation the government will impose countervailing duties to 
offset what was said to be an estimated net subsidy rate from 
singapore of 1525 percent 
countervailing duties are placed on subsidized imports to offset 
their price advantage pending the final determination due by 
march 26 the customs department will require a cash deposit or 
bond on all imports of the software 
the department said the software was developed by the 
information technology institute a singapore government agency 
which commercialized the product by entering into a marketing 
arrangement with computer systems advisors a private company 
the departments preliminary investigation found the existence 
of a subsidy because the software was developed and transferred by 
singapore to a private sector firm for a royalty insufficient to 
cover the cost of developing the software 
ordinarily the international trade commission would have to 
rule separately that the subsized product materially injures or 
threatens to injure us industry before countervailing duties are 
imposed 
however singapore is not a member of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade and an itc ruling thus is not required 
the departments investigation was prompted by a petition filed 
on behalf of the us industry by visible systems corp of waltham 
mass

more than 1000 striking rail 
workers marched on management offices today and union officials 
accused nonstrikers of an unprovoked attack that left seven dead a 
day earlier 
the union officials also accused police of standing by during 
the 45minute battle tuesday when at least 60 people were injured 
in addition to those killed 
the violence at a train station in germiston southeast of 
johannesburg was the worst single incident in a 10weekold strike 
by black workers of the south africa transport services 
the congress of south african trade unions said it would seek a 
court order against management and the police to restrain them from 
making further attacks on striking workers 
the union said nonstriking workers armed with knives and 
clubs attacked a group of strikers arriving at the station police 
initially made no effort to intervene the union said 
management denied any role in the fighting which involved about 
2000 men police said that because of the large number of 
combatants the officers on duty had to wait for reinforcements 
before they could break up the fighting 
prior to tuesdays conflict 10 men had been killed in 
strikerelated violence and several dozen railway cars destroyed by 
arson 
in cape town meanwhile more than 1000 strikers marched today 
on the offices of the transport services and demanded the company 
enter negotiations in good faith there was a heavy police 
presence and no incidents were reported 
about 25000 workers went on strike against the transport 
company in early november demanding their minimum monthly wage be 
increased from 225 to 560 
more than 22000 strikers have been fired the company says it 
would rehire 50 percent of the fired workers but it has not 
offered a wage increase 
the strike is illegal under legislation that bars industrial 
action against essential services the transport company employees 
about 170000 people and runs rail and harbor operations 
nationwide

chinas liberal ambassador to hong kong who 
once wrote an essay praising capitalism is retiring and will be 
replaced by a conservative foreign affairs official it was 
announced today 
a western political analyst said the move could signal a 
hardening of chinas attitude toward hong kong a british colony 
that comes under chinese rule in 1997 
the new ambassador will be zhou nan a 62yearold diplomat who 
is vice foreign minister in charge of european affairs zhou is 
considered a conservative and is known as a tough negotiator the 
analyst said 
xu jiatun 74 will step down by the end of this month said pan 
zengxi deputy director of chinas official xinhua news agency 
the chinese ambassador here is actually head of xinhuas hong 
kong branch 
the announcement comes during troubled times for hong kong and 
china whose relations are at their lowest point since the cultural 
revolution of the 1960s 
relations soured in june after the chinese military crushed a 
prodemocracy movement in beijing resulting in hundreds and 
possibly thousands of deaths 
the crackdown caused fears in hong kong that china would not 
live up to its agreement to preserve the territorys freewheeling 
economic and social system for 50 years after hong kong reverts to 
beijings rule 
the most recent tussle aggravating the tension concerns the 
british plan to accept up to 225000 hong kong residents who want 
to settle in britain 
hong kongs governor sir david wilson made his first trip to 
the city today since the crackdown arriving in china wilson said 
he hoped to reestablish a dialogue which is so important for 
dealing with the various issues we have facing us 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd comes to hong kong on 
saturday and will talk with wilson about his trip 
xu told several leading industrialists of his retirement plan 
tuesday night at a dinner according to a hong kong government 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity during the party xu 
also said hong kong should not worry about losing its best and 
brightest residents because there are many talented people in china 
ready to take their place 
nearly 1000 hong kong residents emigrate from the colony every 
week interest in leaving has risen dramatically since the 
crackdown 
xu became head of the hong kong xinhua branch in 1983 and 
cultivated ties to the business community 
in 1988 he wrote an essay praising capitalism in the 
development of hong kong a member of the central committee of the 
chinese communist party xu was known for his independent style and 
for possessing sufficient power to carry out initiatives on his own 
the western analyst said zhou who does not occupy a high party 
position appears to be weaker than xu and thereby his leadership 
in hong kong will closely follow the prevailing hardline in 
beijing 
zhou is an old hand at hong kong affairs having worked in 1984 
on the agreement with britain concerning hong kongs future 
western sources have said china was considering appointing ye 
xuanping the governor of chinas prosperous guangdong province to 
the xinhua post but ye apparently resisted the move they said 
ye a leading reformer has also successfully opposed plans to 
transfer him to beijing where he could be better controlled the 
sources said

premier li peng today lifted martial law in 
beijing more than seven months after imposing it to quell 
prodemocracy protests the action was largely cosmetic because 
strict laws banning dissent remain in force 
the announcement which takes effect at midnight in the capital 
appeared at least partly intended to ease foreign criticism and 
allow the resumption of loans and highlevel exchanges halted after 
the governments bloody suppression of the reform movement in june 
li said he represented the ruling communist party and government 
in thanking the peoples liberation army for restoring order 
saying the people will never forget 
china is now stable politically economically and socially 
production and lives are in good order commodity supplies are 
sufficient people live and work in peace and contentment he 
said 
his 10minute speech made this morning was broadcast on 
national radio and television tonight a day after authorities 
originally planned to make the announcement the reason for the 
delay was not immediately clear 
the government may have been moving cautiously to gauge public 
reaction to the news and allow itself flexibility in case of 
attempted antigovernment protests 
the official radio followed lis speech with an editorial 
praising the move and a program of triumphant martial music 
li wore a dark gray westernstyle suit and sat at a desk his 
hands folded in front of him most of the time 
his calm manner was in sharp contrast to his agitated 
armwaving delivery when he announced the night of may 19 that the 
government would not permit the studentled protests to continue 
the next day he signed the order imposing martial law in central 
beijing for the first time since the peoples republic was founded 
40 years ago 
when students refused to quit their occupation of central 
tiananmen square the army shot its way to the square on june 34 
and dispersed them killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
li said today that martial law could be lifted because the army 
had fulfilled its task apparently trying to avoid any appearance 
that the government was bowing to western pressure 
a great victory has been won in checking the turmoil and 
quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion he said this 
shows once again that the chinese communist party the chinese 
government and the chinese people are capable of running their own 
affairs well 
no matter what may happen in the world we shall unswervingly 
advance along the socialist road he said 
western diplomats linked the lifting of martial law to the 
december visit of us national security adviser brent scowcroft 
who sought an easing of chinas hardline political policy in 
exchange for normalization of bilateral relations 
the move would enable president bush to say that the 
controversial scowcroft visit and bushs easing of other sanctions 
against china paid off 
however even without martial law chinese security forces have 
wide authority to quell dissent the government passed a law in 
november banning all but progovernment demonstrations and strikes 
and putting up political posters are already illegal 
the constitution forbids any action that might undermine the 
socialist system 
wellplaced chinese sources had said they were assured that li 
would make the announcement tuesday night and that martial law 
would be ended at midnight tuesday some work units told their 
employees to watch the tuesday evening news and chinese reporters 
said they waited late into the night for the official notice 
however li did not record the speech until this morning he 
spoke in the great hall of the people the sources said all that 
could be seen on the television was the desk at which he sat and 
bookshelves behind him 
several people interviewed on the street said lifting martial 
law would be a good move and one said it could make it easier for 
students to resume protests 
however most people said it would make no difference to them 
it wont have any effect on most peoples lives said a 
young woman of course they may feel more lighthearted to know 
that martial law is gone but thats all 
soldiers brought into beijing in june have gradually withdrawn 
into walled compounds in and around the capital but their numbers 
remain far above premartial law levels

the offer would give citizenship in transkei but not south 
africa however there are no border posts so regardless of 
citizenship a person can travel freely between transkei and south 
africa 
in recent years many businessmen from taiwan set up operations 
in the homelands largely to take advantage of generous government 
subsidies 
oconnor said the homeland plans a concerted campaign to attract 
more hong kong residents and would sponsor a stall at an upcoming 
emigration fair in the british colony the report said 
the families of investors and key employees also would be 
granted citizenship according to the report 
many hong kong residents are eager to leave the colony before it 
reverts to chinese control in 1997 
transkei is located on south africas southeast coast and has 4 
million residents it is one of four homelands to accept nominal 
independence none of the homelands which are poor and lacking in 
resources is recognized abroad 
the south african government meanwhile has been recruiting 
skilled workers from east germany and elsewhere in eastern europe

a plan to breed florida panthers in 
captivity and then return them to the wild to save them from 
extinction has won statefederal approval and captured the interest 
of zoos around the state 
under the plan approved tuesday by a joint panel eight adult 
panthers and 18 kittens would be removed from the wild over the 
next three years and up to six adults and 12 kittens would be 
removed over the following two years 
if the programs goals are met panthers in the wild would 
increase over two decades from the 50 big cats now roaming south 
florida to some 300 in several southeastern states an additional 
200 would be in captivity 
the florida panther is a tawny brown cat that resembles a 
cougar it ranges range from 60 to more than 100 pounds 
without the program the florida panther could be extinct in 25 
to 40 years john christian told the joint florida panther 
interagency committee 
in addition the florida panther could be wiped out at any time 
by an outbreak of disease said christian deputy regional director 
of endangered wildlife for the us fish and wildlife service 
what were proposing to do is to take animals out of the wild 
to start the core of a captive breeding plan that can be used both 
for increasing numbers of florida panthers in captivity for 
preserving their genetic makeup and then second to provide stock 
for reintroductions back into the wild christian said before the 
four committee members voted to approve the project 
three zoos in miami jacksonville and tampa have expressed 
an interest in participating christian said interest also has 
been expressed by white oak plantation a private exotic animal 
breeding facility in north florida

president bush riding high on his successes 
in panama and malta is trying to utilize some of that popularity 
to prod a stalled domestic agenda 
but he may run afoul of congressional electionyear politics 
even though the extended hand bush again is offering 
congress is a strengthened one some analysts suggest foreign 
policy triumphs dont necessarily translate into legislative 
victories 
still bush advisers are urging him to strike while his ratings 
in public opinion polls are high bushs approval rankings surged 
in the aftermath of the capture of former panamanian dictator 
manuel antonio noriega and a successful summit with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
the president displayed that new assertiveness in a speech 
earlier this week to the american farm bureau in orlando fla in 
which he called democratic opponents of his capital gains tax cut 
demagogues 
its time it is past time for congress to tend to some of 
its unfinished business bush declared and by that it was clear 
he meant his own languishing agenda 
however with congressional midterm elections approaching its 
not too clear how far bush will get with his renewed appeal to 
bipartisanship 
in a likely sneak preview of his jan 31 state of union address 
bush served notice on congress that he will push again for those 
items that fell by the wayside last year 
these include the lower capital gains rate a revamping of the 
clean air act child care tax credits and anticrime and education 
programs 
but even the demagogue remark appeared to be backfiring 
annoying at least one conservative democrat bush could use in his 
corner senate finance chairman lloyd bentsen of texas 
bentsen whose committee has jurisdiction over the capital gains 
issue had indicated in recent days that he might support a capital 
gains reduction as long as it was part of a package of investment 
and savings measures 
but after hearing bushs demagogue remarks on television 
bentsen called a boston globe reporter who had interviewed him 
earlier in the day to complain that bushs comments tend to make 
it a more partisan issue if he chooses to make it a partisan 
issue it will become much more difficult 
although the house approved a reduction in the capital gains 
rate that won white house support the measure was sidetracked in 
the senate by democratic leaders 
by nearly any account bush had a successful year on the 
international front and aides insist that can only help him push 
his programs in the democraticcontrolled congress that reconvenes 
jan 23 
but that doesnt automatically mean the popularity will rub off 
i dont think theres any doubt that george bush is coming 
into this session of congress as a strengthened president public 
approval tempers the way congress reacts to a president and 
therefore he starts off with a stronger hand said thomas 
griscom who was white house communications director in the reagan 
administration 
griscom who teaches political science at the university of 
tennessee said although congress can rally behind a president on 
foreign policy issues domestic policy is much more like guerrilla 
warfare in which congress more aggressively asserts its own agenda 
although he was one of the most popular of presidents reagan 
himself fared poorly in winning congressional approval of his 
domestic proposals 
after initial successes early in 1981 in curtailing the growth 
of social programs and winning approval of a sweeping tax cut 
reagan had few other domestic legislative victories in the 
succeeding seven years 
in fact reagan budgets became a joking matter on capitol hill 
as one after the other were proclaimed dead on arrival 
even while the senate was in republican hands from 1985 to 
1987 reagans white house spent much of the time bickering with 
senate republicans on budget issues 
former president jimmy carter spent his four years battling with 
a congress controlled by his own party few of his programs won 
enactment and his major domestic initiative a rash of energy 
conservation proposals were heavily modified and watered down 
now praise for him is across the spectrum said norman 
ornstein a political analyst at the american enterprise institute 
but the more interesting question is how much of a residue will 
remain when it really matters 
my guess is that by the fall of 1990 many many other things 
will have happened to cut into bushs leverage ornstein said 
ornstein also disputed that bushs high ratings would help other 
gop candidates 
the popularity of a president has very little effect in terms 
of offyear elections he said

the state department says the new romanian 
government may have earned the right to lower tariffs for exports 
to the united states by relaxing emigration restrictions and moving 
toward a multiparty system 
in a statement tuesday night the department said it applauded 
the steps taken by the national salvation front government and 
would consult with congress about making it easier for romania to 
sell its products in this country 
romania had been rewarded for years with what is called 
mostfavored nation status for permitting tens of thousands of 
jews to emigrate to israel and for showing a streak of independence 
in foreign policy from the soviet union 
unlike most other communist governments romania was exempted 
from the strictures of the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment which 
raises tariffs to countries that keep their citizens from leaving 
in february 1988 however the countrys ruler nicolae 
ceausescu renounced the conditions he was executed last month in 
a political upheaval this week the new government in bucharest 
abrogated the fallen leaders decree 
we applaud the announcement the state department said as 
well as the governments recent decree relaxing travel restrictions 
and expediting passport issuance procedures these steps constitute 
further evidence that the national salvation front is moving 
forward in extending human rights to all romanian citizens 
the statement said restoring trade privileges to romania 
requires a waiver from president bush the romanian governments 
steps towards freedom of travel and emigration as well as movement 
toward a pluralistic multiparty democracy will be relevant to our 
consideration of a waiver it said

the united states is considering 
withdrawing up to 5000 troops from south korea the us embassy 
said today 
the decision on such a reduction will be made after secretary of 
defense richard cheney meets with his korean counterpart said a 
statement issued by the embassy cheney is expected to visit seoul 
feb 14 
an assessment of the souths ability to defend itself against 
the communist north is under way and will be considered in the 
decision us officials said 
also today president roh taewoo said he wants to meet with 
north korean leader kim il sung to discuss free travel across the 
korean peninsula 
discussions of american troop withdrawals are sensitive in korea 
and many people in the country have been alarmed by reports that 
the us government may bow to congressional pressure for spending 
cuts and reduce the 43000 troops stationed in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact 
todays statement was issued after korean media quoted us 
ambassador donald gregg as telling journalists in the city of 
kwangju on tuesday that a reduction of 4000 to 5000 troops was 
expected 
the report is inaccurate said the statement the thrust 
of ambassador greggs remarks was thatthe us troops will 
remain in korea as long as the people and governments of both 
countries wish them to remain 
when pressed for an answer on how many troops might be 
withdrawn the ambassador noted that the us troop level at the 
beginning of the reagan administration was about four or five 
thousand less than now and that a return to this level was an 
option under consideration the statement said 
radicals and dissidents a small but vocal minority have staged 
violent demonstrations demanding withdrawals claiming the presense 
of us troop hinders dialogue for unification with communist north 
korea 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
the capitalist south in 1945 the north invaded the south to start 
the 195053 korean war and the two sides remain bitter enemies 
despite repeated northsouth talks there has been little 
progress at easing hostilities and both seoul and washington have 
said us troops will remain until there is a reduction of the 
threat from north korea 
regarding rohs call today for freer travel on the peninsula 
the president said a northsouth summit should be held as quickly 
as possible and he urged communist north korea to respond 
positively 
speaking at a nationally televised news conference roh said he 
would seek an interkorean travel and communication agreement as 
soon as possible 
if it takes time for the two parts of korea to agree to free 
travel and full opening then exchanges of correspondence and 
telephone calls and free home visits by dispersed relatives should 
be implemented first he said 
on tuesday north korea said it wanted to send two envoys to 
south korean leaders bearing letters concerning the norths latest 
reunification proposals

the supreme court by a 54 vote today 
refused to create a new exception to the rule barring unlawfully 
obtained evidence from criminal trials 
the court ruled in an illinois case that statements a criminal 
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by 
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness trial testimony 
the socalled exclusionary rule created by the court 75 years 
ago generally prohibits the use at trial of any illegally obtained 
evidence but the court later carved out an exception by allowing 
prosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a defendants own 
trial testimony 
today the justices refused to expand that exception to let 
prosecutors use such evidence to rebut or discredit other 
witnesses testimony 
the illinois supreme court was wrong to allow such an expansion 
justice william j brennan wrote 
finding this extension inconsistent with the balance of values 
underlying our previous applications of the exclusionary rule we 
reverse brennan said 
he was joined by three liberal allies justices thurgood 
marshall john paul stevens and harry a blackmun and by justice 
byron r white usually one of the courts most conservative 
members on lawandorder issues 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia dissented 
writing for the dissenters kennedy said where the jury is 
misled by false testimony otherwise subject to flat contradiction 
by evidence illegally seized the protection of the exclusionary 
rule is perverted into a license to use perjury free from the 
risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances 
the illinois court had voted to allow the introduction of 
illegally obtained evidence in the trial of darryl james sentenced 
to 30 years in prison for a 1982 murder 
james was 15 when arrested in his mothers beauty parlor for a 
pair of aug 30 1982 shootings he was tried as an adult 
prosecutors said james shot and killed geliria boyd and wounded 
another youth in a latenight confrontation on a south chicago 
street 
five prosecution witnesses identified james as the triggerman 
and testified that on the night of the crime he had long 
reddishbrown hair 
at his trial james had short black hair 
james did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in his 
behalf one said that james had short black hair the night of the 
shootings 
prosecutors then won the judges permission to let a police 
detective testify that james when arrested said he had long 
reddishbrown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hair 
dyed and cut at his mothers shop 
the judge initially had disallowed such testimony ruling that 
james arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not have 
a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing a 
crime 
todays decision means james is entitled to a new trial at 
which the statement obtained during his unlawful arrest will not be 
allowed as evidence 
but the five eyewitness identifications could be used at the new 
trial 
in a separate criminal law decision involving evidence the 
court ruled by a 63 vote that federal juries may be told about a 
defendants alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trial 
on those charges ended in an acquittal 
white wrote the courts majority opinion in that case and 
brennan marshall and stevens dissented 
the ruling upheld the bank robbery conviction and 70year prison 
sentence of reuben dowling convicted of robbing 7000 from the 
first pennsylvania bank in frederiksted st croix in the virgin 
islands on july 8 1985 
federal appeals courts had been divided over whether such 
evidence could be used 
the cases are james vs illinois 886075 and dowling vs us 
886025

columbias astronauts smoothly put a 
navy communications satellite into orbit today and sped on to a 
rendezvous with a science laboratory they want to pluck from space 
before it falls to earth 
we had a good deploy it looked real great reported 
mission specialist david low as the 15200pound syncom satellite 
slipped out of its berth and spun away like a frisbee leaving the 
cargo bay empty and ready to receive the science package on friday 
we copy congratulations mission control replied 
fortyfive minutes after release an onboard motor fired to 
propel the satellite toward its permanent working post 22300 miles 
above the pacific 
the 85 million syncom built by hughes aircraft will complete 
a network of five satellites through which the pentagon 
communicates with its planes ships and bases around the world 
its going to be a busy day mission control told the 
astronauts as it wakened them early today with a rousing rendition 
of bing crosbys whats more american 
columbia commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee 
steered the spaceship through a series of maneuvers in their 
continuing pursuit of the long duration exposure facility a 
21400pound satellite orbiting 202 miles up 
when they soared into space tuesday they trailed their quarry 
by 1725 miles when they released syncom they were about 900 
miles behind 
flight director al pennington said columbia the oldest shuttle 
continues to fly beautifully the lady of the fleet is really 
working fine for us right now 
traveling in a slightly lower orbit at about 17400 mph 
columbia takes about a minute less to circle the globe enabling 
the shuttle to catch up gradually 
atmospheric drag has been pulling the errant satellite to earth 
about half a mile a day and that rate is increasing if the 
astronauts do not bring it back the satellite is expected to make 
a fiery death dive through the atmosphere about march 9 that would 
destroy all of its scientific experiments 
on friday mission specialist bonnie dunbar will reach out with 
columbias 50foot robot arm and snag the satellite which will be 
tucked into the cargo bay for the trip home 
scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how 
various materials and systems withstood the long stay in orbit 
information that will help in designing a permanent space station 
and the star wars defense system 
ldef is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology 
information said william kinard chief scientist for the project 
scientists may reap a big bonus because the satellite has been 
in space five years longer than intended it was to have been 
retrieved 10 months after a shuttle put it into orbit in 1984 but 
scheduling problems and the 1986 challenger disaster delayed the 
retrieval 
as they chased the satellite mission specialists marsha ivins 
low and dunbar plunged into a busy day of experiments 
concentrating on materials processing and tests of how well the 
human body adapts to living in weightless space 
columbias 10day mission the secondlongest in 33 shuttle 
missions is a stepping stone to even longer flights leading to 
extended stays in space of several months aboard space station 
freedom later in this decade 
columbia will be modified for 16day flights starting in 1993 a 
new orbiter being built endeavour will be capable of 28day trips

lithuanian demonstrators chanting 
freedom rallied to demand independence today one day before 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visits the republic to try to 
halt its defiance of moscow 
banners displayed among 20000 protesters in central cathedral 
square ranged from one polite welcome to more blunt calls for 
gorbachev to go home and take the soviet army with him 
we didnt join the soviet union you grabbed us read one 
banner referring to the soviet unions annexation of the baltic 
republic in 1940 
gorbachev is expected thursday for three days of meetings with 
factory workers collective farmers members of ethnic minorities 
and communist party activists to try to reverse the lithuanian 
communist partys decision dec 20 to split from the national party 
and support independence for the republic 
it was the first such break since the communists took power in 
moscow in 1917 the soviet leader has consistently and sharply 
criticized lithuanian communist leaders for the move for 
independence 
leaders of sajudis a grassroots lithuanian political movement 
hope to draw 1 million of lithuanias 37 million people to vilnius 
on thursday to show gorbachev the extent of support for 
independence 
a spokesman for sajudis rimantas kanapienis said the 
organization rejected a call by kremlin ideology chief vadim a 
medvedev sent to lithuania in advance of gorbachevs visit to 
call off the rally today 
medvedev indicated tuesday that the moscow leadership favors 
granting lithuanians more autonomy as part of the union but remains 
opposed to lithuanian secession 
demonstrators waving the red yellow and green flag of 
independent lithuania made it clear today they felt it is too late 
for gorbachev to change the course for independence 
lithuania has already decided said one sign 
lithuania was recognized as an independent country by soviet 
founder vladmir lenin but josef stalin annexed it in 1940 as part 
of a secret nazisoviet treaty 
one sign read lenin recognized lithuania stalin took away 
its independence and gorbachev 
gorbachev last visited one of the baltic republics in february 
1987 when he traveled to riga latvia lithuanian activists say he 
hasnt been to their republic in a decade 
activists in lithuania which was absorbed by the soviet union 
along with the other baltic republics of latvia and estonia have 
been approaching the call for independence for 18 months some say 
independence is still several years away even in their most 
favorable scenarios 
the stakes for the gorbachevs visit are high because the 
lithuanian party split could encourage others across this vast 
country to follow suit breaking up the soviet empire 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev warned monday of a 
domino effect

government delegations from bolivia 
colombia and peru met today under heavy police protection to 
prepare for the drug summit that will be attended by their leaders 
and president bush 
the us delegation led by a state department deputy assistant 
secretary michael skol was scheduled to arrive thursday to help 
plan the feb 15 summit in cartagena colombia 
the summit planned by president bush and the leaders of 
bolivia columbia and peru has been clouded by negative reaction 
to the us invasion of panama and a us plan to place warships 
off colombias coast to intercept drugs 
police today guarded the posh hotel in santa cruz where the 
delegation met the tropical city a cocaine trafficking center is 
355 miles east of la paz the bolivian capital 
the session will work out an agenda and preliminary agreements 
that will be announced at the summit which bush and presidents 
virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia will 
attend 
perus president alan garcia said he will attend only if the 
us troops that invaded panama dec 20 withdraw first he was 
sharply critical of the us action and has said he cannot meet 
with the leader of an invading power 
peru may send a highranking official in garcias place 
the colombian and bolivian governments also criticized the 
united states for invading panama saying it violated the principle 
of nonintervention but they said they will go ahead with plans to 
participate in the summit 
colombian representatives in santa cruz were expected however 
to bring up the dispute over us plans to establish a naval sea 
and air presence off its coast to intercept drug smugglers 
in bogota a spokesman for barco today said he had no comment on 
the plan and us officials said it will not be carried out 
immediately 
peru and bolivia impoverished nations that supply nearly all of 
the coca leaf used to make cocaine have said they will stress the 
need to see the drug problem as a social rather than criminal 
problem they are pressing for aid from wealthy countries to 
develop alternative crops and reduce the poverty that makes 
trafficking an attractive proposition 
bolivias information minister manfredo kempf said his 
nations delegation would stress the importance of alternative 
development without ignoring policies and programs related to 
interdiction and prevention 
security at the cartegena meeting is a major concern for the 
united states which sees bush as a prime target for colombias 
powerful cocaine cartels

charles stuart may have been looking to open a 
restaurant and stood to collect about 660000 in life insurance on 
his wife when she was killed in a shooting he blamed on a mugger a 
newspaper reported today 
the boston globe citing unidentified sources said that stuart 
stood to gain from three policies on carol stuart 
the globe reported that stuart also had reading material in his 
home indicating he was studying how to start a business and that 
his friends told investigators they had planned to go into the 
restaurant business with stuart 
investigators have refused to say publicly whether they believed 
that stuart who jumped to his death off a bridge thursday after 
his brother implicated him in the slaying of his wife had an 
insurancerelated motive 
authorities did confirm that a 38caliber revolver pulled from 
a river in suburban revere on tuesday appears to be one missing 
from the fur store stuart managed and is believed to have been used 
to kill his pregnant wife and wound him 
the globe in a column today quoted a law enforcement source it 
did not further identify as charging that stuart killed his wife 
for the insurance money to open a restaurant 
one element of the newspapers report came into question today 
the globe said a 480000 insurance check to stuart had been 
processed by prudential insurance co on thursday but a prudential 
spokesman said this morning that his company had no record of 
insurance being taken out on stuarts wife 
the spokesman talked to the associated press on the condition he 
not be identified he said the company did not usually disclose 
whom it insured but wanted to correct an erroneous newspaper report 
a grand jury on friday will begin an investigation said 
district attorney newman flanagan 
stuart 30 told police he and his wife were shot by a black man 
who forced his way into their car as they left a childbirth class 
oct 23 a black man was named as a suspect in the case but was 
later cleared 
mrs stuart died hours after the shooting their son 
christopher delivered prematurely by caesarean section died 17 
days later 
the globe also said transcripts of telephone conversations on 
jan 2 between two of stuarts siblings show that his siblings 
planned to tell their parents of suspicions that he was involved in 
the killing 
the transcript was from a call on a line at revere fire 
department where his brother michael is a firefighter the globe 
said 
were going to tell mom and dad stuarts sister shelley 
yandoli told michael 
what are you going to tell them michael responded 
were going to tell them we know that chuck was involved 
were not going to say that he killed her she reportedly 
answered the globe did not say whether she told her parents 
divers recovered the snubnose revolver from the pines river in 
revere on tuesday said larry gillis a spokesman for the 
metropolitan district commission police 
the guns registration numbers matched those on a pistol 
reported stolen from the fur shop where charles stuart worked the 
globe said citing unidentified sources 
it fits the description said gillis hopefully a major 
piece of the puzzle has fallen into place 
flanagan said the gun would be sent to the fbi crime laboratory 
in washington for tests the gun was beginning to rust police said 
jack decourcy fbi agent in boston said it was possible to 
detect fingerprints on a gun found in salt water depending on how 
long it was submerged how rusty it was and whether it was found 
in silt pines river is brackish 
flanagan said divers also planned to search for other evidence 
though he declined to be more specific 
stuarts brother matthew told authorities last week that he met 
charles stuart at a car on the night of the shooting matthew also 
told authorities charles had passed him mrs stuarts handbag 
which contained some personal items and a 38caliber handgun 
matthew told his attorney that he was not then aware that his 
brother or mrs stuart had been shot he said he took the bag to 
revere and threw it and the gun separately into the pines river 
police recovered the handbag the day stuart committed suicide 
the killing attracted national attention in part because of 
stuarts dramatic telephone call on his car phone to police after 
he and his wife were shot after stuart identified a black as the 
suspect it increased racial tensions 
on tuesday night several hundred people gathered at a church in 
mission hill the neighborhood where the stuarts were shot for a 
service aimed at easing racial tensions 
moving on thats what the city of boston is doing here 
tonight mayor raymond flynn who helped organize the ecumenical 
service told the racially mixed crowd at mission church

the government has given tens of 
thousands of gold prospectors access to more than a million acres 
of disputed forest land after ordering them off adjacent indian 
property 
justice ministry spokesman vinicius becker said today there is 
no guarantee the miners will not return to the yanomami indian 
reservation which they have been illegally mining for the past two 
years 
under an agreement announced tuesday night the government said 
it would stop removing miners from the reservation in return for 
them giving their guns to police and voluntarily leaving the 
reservation in brazils northwest corner 
they will be moved to three adjacent areas totaling 16 million 
acres which originally belonged to the tribe and is still claimed 
by yanomamis one of the worlds largest primitive indian tribes 
this is the peaceful solution to the problem there will be no 
shock or confrontation becker said by telephone from brasilia 
the capital

police blocked highways today and an official 
said 15000 people were detained following the assassination of a 
former defense minister the most prominent victim of the nations 
10yearold guerrilla war 
enrique lopez albujar was killed tuesday when three shining path 
rebels armed with machine guns killed him near a shopping center in 
a lima suburb police said he died at a military hospital with at 
least 10 bullet wounds 
witnesses said the four gunmen fled in an automobile 
police units aided by six helicopters searched through lima and 
its outskirts tuesday night and early today stopping about 8000 
cars in a search for suspects police said most of the 15000 
detained were taken in for not carrying documents and are expected 
to be released in the next few days an interior ministry spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity 
lopez was the first person who had served on the cabinet to be 
killed in guerrilla violence that has claimed the lives of hundreds 
of federal and local officials more than 130 in 1989 alone 
the main guerrilla faction is the shining path a fanatical 
maoistinspired group that has been fighting to topple perus 
elected governments since 1980 
witnesses interviewed by the associated press said lopez had an 
office in the shopping center and usually arrived at the same time 
every day often accompanied by a bodyguard 
speaking to reporters at the government palace president alan 
garcia said lopez was entitled to a military guard and that he 
didnt understand why lopez was alone when he was attacked 
it pains me and i regret that he was alone in spite of the 
situation of war we are living in garcia said 
lopez was named the countrys first defense minister by garcia 
taking office in 1987 when the ministry was formed previously the 
army navy and air force had their own ministries 
he served until may when he was replaced by army gen julio 
velasquez 
shining path began its insurgency in ayacucho in the andes 
mountains 235 from the capital in the past year it has stepped up 
assaults in lima 
last fall it tried to disrupt municipal elections by killing 
local officials across peru but peruvians defied death threats and 
turned out in large numbers to vote on nov 12 
peruvians expect the shining path to step up attacks as 
presidential elections slated for april draw closer 
the shining path operates throughout the highlands including in 
the huallaga valley part of the cocaproducing jungle in the 
northeast and the single largest source of cocaleaf in the world 
authorities say the rebels operate in league with 
drugtraffickers in the valley protecting them from police in 
exchange for a share of drug profits 
the government says more than 17500 people including 
government forces civilians guerrillas and american reporter todd 
smith of the tampa tribune have been killed in the insurgency 
authorities routinely accuse the shining path of massacring 
peasants but in november amnesty international accused government 
forces of becoming equally savage in their effort to crush the 
insurgency 
the londonbased human rights group said both sides were guilty 
of torture mutilation and murder

vice president dan quayle today called chinas 
lifting of martial law a positive step forward for human rights 
and a vindication of president bushs efforts to reopen diplomatic 
ties with beijing 
a white house spokesman said there was no change in the us 
economic sanctions against china but hinted that the united states 
stands ready to back world bank loans for china for humanitarian 
needs 
quayle applauded the chinese governments action in a brief 
exchange with reporters at the outset of a meeting with the 
visiting japanese minister of trade and industry hikaru matsunaga 
but he deferred to the state department questions about whether 
the move might prompt a change in us sanctions against china 
imposed last june after the chinese government sent in tanks to 
tiananmen square to crush prodemocracy demonstrations 
quayle said we view chinas decision to lift martial law as a 
step forward i believe that you begin to see dividends from the 
presidents policy toward china 
the los angeles times reported today however that the 
administration has decided to oppose the resumption of a 700 
million loan program to china until the leadership in beijing 
changes its hardline antidemocracy and economic policies 
at a white house briefing deputy press secretary roman popadiuk 
said there was no change in the us sanctions but he said from 
the start bush has wanted to avoid actions that hurt the chinese 
people 
the united states therefore will take a close look at loans 
that meet basic human needs and will consider them on a 
casebycase basis said popadiuk 
the white house was informed by the chinese embassy late tuesday 
about the lifting of martial law we would like to think that 
general brent scowcrofts trip played a part in this the 
spokesman said 
obviously we must assess the full scope of this action after 
observing its implementation said popadiuk this is another in 
a series of positive steps that we have witness over the past few 
weeks we will continue to monitor developments in china 
to critics who argue that lifting martial law does not mean an 
easing of chinas oppressive human rights policy quayle replied 
it is a positive step forward for human rights 
but on capitol hill rep william s broomfield of michigan the 
ranking republican on the house foreign affairs committee said the 
lifting of martial law was more blue smoke and mirrors and would 
not fool anybody in congress into believing that the chinese 
leadership was moderating its oppressive rule 
he said the chinese action was intended to silence critics 
worldwide especially members of congress who have attacked chinas 
crackdown on prodemocracy movements 
bush has sent his national security adviser scowcroft and 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger on two missions to 
china since the june massacre to lay the groundwork for normalizing 
relations again the first scowcroft mission was conducted in 
secrecy coming to light only after his trip last month following 
bushs malta summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bush has rejected criticism of his handling of uschinese 
relations and said it serves no good to try to excommunicate 
the communist regime and its 1 billion people from the rest of the 
world 
scowcroft sought an easing of chinas hardline policies in 
exchange for normalization of relations 
the united states continues to provide a refuge in its embassy 
in beijing for fang lizhi an astrophysicist and prominent 
dissident and his wife 
premier li peng lifted martial law today but strict laws 
banning dissent remain in force

gov james r thompson has signed a law 
curbing smoking in public places but said the legislature should 
make it tougher 
the law which takes effect july 1 was called an important 
first step by the governor on tuesday 
the law makes it an offense punishable by a fine of up to 500 
to smoke anywhere other than in a designated area in most public 
buildings restaurants stores theaters and other public places 
may designate smoking areas 
bowling alleys bars factories warehouses foundries and 
industrial complexes not generally open to the public would be 
exempt 
sen bob kustra called the law is a victory for tobacco 
companies because municipalities that now lack a nosmoking 
ordinance cannot have restrictions tougher than state law 
by comparison a smoking law that went into effect this month in 
new york state bans smoking in auditoriums elevators gymnasiums 
food stores and shared taxis and restricts it to certain areas in 
larger restaurants and other public places new yorks law is 
touted as the nations toughest after minnesotas 
during debate on the illinois measure which passed the house 
1013 and the senate 500 opponents said the bill was so weak that 
even national groups such as the american cancer society and the

the bush administration while critical of 
progress toward the feb 25 elections in nicaragua has no plans to 
use panama as a precedent and invade the central american nation 
the white house said today 
the administration has justified the dec 20 invasion of panama 
in part by pointing out that that countrys elections last may 7 
were widely viewed as fraudulently stolen by nowdeposed dictator 
manuel antonio noriega 
asked about senate republican leader bob doles comment that 
managua should view the invasion of panama as an example of what 
happens to a country that cheats on elections white house 
spokesman roman popadiuk said 
weve called for free and fair elections in nicaragua there 
is an election process under way we expect free and fair elections 
to take place 
he added weve noticed that the nicaraguans have been 
harassing the opposition to a great extent all of which is 
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly 
this is something that troubles us this is something that we and 
the rest of the international community will be looking at 
however popadiuk said questions about an invasion amounted to 
a wild guess 
when reporters pressed him saying he had not ruled it out the 
spokesman replied there are no plans to invade nicaragua 
popadiuk said president bush this morning telephoned nicaraguan 
opposition presidential candidate violeta chamorro who he said is 
receiving treatment in a houston hospital for a knee ailment 
the purpose of the call was to inquire about her health 
and discuss the state of her election campaign thr spokesman

red wing minn republican eagle on oil spills 
nine months after the horrible spill from the exxon valdez oil 
tanker its clear the effects on mother nature will be long 
lasting its also apparent that no matter how wellprepared oil 
companies think they may be their ability to deal with massive 
spills remains miserably inadequate 
memories of the spill were rekindled by the explosion and 
subsequent spill aboard the iranian tanker khark 5 though its not 
nearly as disastrous to the environment as the spill of 11 million 
gallons of crude oil in the prince william sound of alaska crews 
are struggling off the coast of morocco in an attempt to control a 
100squaremile spill of goo 
as expected the economic and environmental effects of a spill 
are enormous alaskan fishery authorities have continued to shut 
down commercial fisheries in prince william sound after renewed 
sightings of oil slicks they fear contamination of catches and 
fishing gear 
indeed the spill of the exxon valdez was a rarity but it 
doesnt take many events of such magnitude to take their toll on 
the environment

the times leader wilkesbarre pa on noriega 
it was one of historys better moments when manuel noriega 
stepped outside the vatican embassy in panama city and 
surrendered to us authorities 
not only does noriega deserve to be held accountable on charges 
that he helped funnel huge amounts of illicit drugs into the united 
states over the years he must be deterred from ever again having 
an army at his command in other words general noriega must remain 
precisely what he is today general nothing 
he will of course be held accountable by virtue of the fair 
trial he said he wants and which the bush administration promised 
he would receive and if the results of that trial favor us 
prosecutors noriega will never again muster an army or rule over a 
nation because thats practically impossible to do from behind 
prison bars where noriega could end up spending the rest of his 
life 
so its high fives and a hearty salute to everybody who played a 
role in bringing noriega to justice from the bush administration 
on down to every last one of the 26000 members of the us 
military who contributed to the success of operation just cause 
deserving of a special salute are the 23 us soldiers who made 
the ultimate sacrifice in the panamanian victory hats off also to 
the vatican officials in panama for rendering what president bush 
called their evenhanded statesmanlike assistance 
bush said noriegas apprehension and return to the united 
states should send a clear signal that the united states is serious 
in its determination that those charged with promoting the 
distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice 
it certainly does send such a signal whether the rest of this 
worlds drug kingpins take heed however is something else 
entirely that is why the united states must keep the heat on 
whenever and wherever it has jurisdiction and cause to do so

the providence ri journalbulletin on noriega 
on the whole we would have preferred it if general noriega had 
found safe haven in one of his allied homelands in cuba say or 
perhaps nicaragua but the bush administration was determined 
to get their man and get him they did 
now that we have him what do we intend to do with him there is 
no doubt that manuel noriega is an odious individual politician 
gangster drug kingpin killer and the people of panama are 
delirious with joy that he is out of their jurisdiction 
it is difficult to discern how american laws can be violated by 
a panamanian citizen while resident in panama even by the broad 
postnuremberg standards of international law the case against 
general noriega in american courts is problematical 
perhaps the single greatest deficiency of our system of justice 
delay will solve the problem for us by the time the prisoner 
has been read his rights booked fingerprinted indicted 
arraigned and appeals the drug war might be won the defendant 
declared too feeble to stand trial at his age and the matter 
declared moot

the jackson mich citizen patriot on noriega 
the surrender of manuel noriega to the united states government 
is a relief of global proportions and if president george bush 
seemed untypically restrained in announcing the surrender you 
have to believe things were different offcamera surely there was 
unbridled joy in the white house president bush has every 
right to relish this moment it not only represents the completion 
of all four us military objectives in panama it was a personal 
victory for the president 
bushs military invasion had as one of its basic objectives 
bringing general noriega to the united states to stand trial the 
ousted dictator faced lengthy indictments in the federal courts 
alleging complicity with illicit drug traffic 
but the initial failure to capture general noriega was an 
embarrassment for days as the military tracked their prey from 
one place to another it seemed as though he was destined to 
outsmart the americans when he threw himself on the mercy of the 
catholic church by seeking sanctuary many believed he had thwarted 
his enemies after all didnt the church say repeatedly that it 
would not hand over general noriega to the us government 
in the end the church didnt hand him over general noriega 
stripped of position and power made the decision to hand himself 
over to the us government considering his limited options going 
on trial in the united states may have seemed to be the best 
alternative the government has assured general noriega that he 
would receive a fair trial and not in any case face the death 
penalty 
the promise of fairness will be a great test of us 
jurisprudence especially given the intense characterization of 
manuel noriega as a coldblooded dopepeddling dictator still he 
will get the best defense that money can buy and he has nothing to 
fear if the evidence does not support the allegations for unlike 
panama under his rule the united states is a nation of law due 
process and justice 
welcome to our venue general noriega

idahonian moscow idaho on noriega 
deposed panamanian leader manuel noriega is behind bars in 
miami and president bush has declared the us invasion and 
occupation of panama an unqualified success 
not so fast george jailing noriega may have fulfilled one of 
the stated purposes of the largest us military action since the 
vietnam war but it doesnt make any less tragic the deaths of 
dozens of us soldiers and hundreds of panamanians nor does it 
excuse the flagrant disregard for international law that has 
occurred in the name of bringing noriega to justice and imposing 
our version of democracy on panama 
sure its nice to have noriega out of power but ousting him 
has come at a terribly high price loss of life destruction of the 
homes of thousands of panamanians weakening of principles of 
diplomatic immunity erosion of us prestige in latin america

still salvadoran president alfredo cristianis announcement 
that members of his countrys armed forces formally have been 
implicated in the brutal nov 16 murder of six prominent jesuit

it is a welcome sign that the criminal investigation is 
proceeding as promised and appears to be serious this time 
that hasnt occurred before in the 10 years that the salvadoran 
civil war has raged heinous crimes have never been resolved 
despite or perhaps because of evidence implicating top military 
officials 
he promises that punishment will be meted out down to the last 
person implicated given the moderate and nononsense style that 
he has demonstrated so far one is inclined to believe that he 
intends just that

the bakersfield calif californian on democracy in eastern 
europe and at home 
take a moment to consider whats been happening around the 
world and then look at the united states the dichotomy slaps you 
in the face people in eastern europe and other parts of the world 
risk their lives for democracy here it seems taken for granted 
americans could learn a lesson from the poles the east germans 
the romanians the czechoslovakians and especially from the 
students in beijing history is full of examples of brutal 
repression of every little attempt they made for a taste of 
freedom for two generations we have watched and felt pity now 
perhaps we should envy them 
granted very few true democracies in which everyone votes on 
everything exist in the world simply because it is too 
cumbersome and inefficient in our representative democracy we 
choose people to do the job of making laws and carrying out the 
functions of government it is ironic that these elected positions 
have become less competitive in a society that boasts free market 
competition more than 90 percent of incumbents are returned to 
office in the house of representatives 
in eastern europe a politician now knows the people will come 
out and vote on the substantial issues he represents in america 
as humorist dan bennett put it an elected official is one who gets 
51 percent of the vote cast by 40 percent of the 60 percent of 
prospective voters who have registered 
is it not possible to do something to reinvigorate our 
democracy if the repressed peoples of the world can rise up and 
change their system why cant we insist on our own meaningful 
reforms

programs according to government sources quoted by the associated 
press bush will propose spending 30 million on programs that 
currently receive 200 million a year

supplies poor families with insulation weather stripping and other 
energysaving materials a 25 million effort to help schools and 
hospitals save energy and a 10 million program to help states 
publicize and support conservation measures such as van pooling 
the weatherization program has saved an equivalent of 45 
million barrels of oil a year by insulating 18 million american 
homes since 1977 according to the department of energy 
bushs actions dont match his words he proclaimed april 
22 as the 20th annual earth day saying he was making

the sun bremerton wash on thornburghorganized crime 
attorney general richard thornburgh has completed a 
reorganization of us strike forces against organized crime and 
many offcials are wondering why he did it 
since the government began putting the units together in 1968 
they have made impressive inroads against the mafia and other 
criminal conspirators in major american cities the brooklyn strike 
force alone has since 1980 convicted six leaders of the colombo and 
bonanno crime families along with more than 65 other organized 
crime figures more than 50 union officials eight members of 
congress more than 200 business figures and several local 
officials 
the strike forces were composed of government prosecutors and 
agents of several federal investigative agencies they reported 
directly to the organized crime and racketeering section of the 
justice department in washington 
under thornburghs reorganization the prosecutors assigned to 
the strike forces will become assistants to the us attorneys in 
their jurisdictions thornburgh has said this will lead to 
substantial management benefits because there will no longer be 
two separate federal prosecutors in the same jurisdiction 
sen sam nunn dga remarked at a committee hearing this is 
the first time i can remember where government officials seem 
determined to reform a program that everyone agrees has been a 
tremendous success 
well the deed is done and now well see how well the new 
system which really is the old prestrike force system works

the 1968 sovietled invasion of 
czechoslovakia killed at least 72 people and seriously injured 266 
a newspaper reported wednesday in the first official disclosure of 
the casualty toll 
the newspaper lidova demokracie listed the toll as of sept 3 
1968 13 days after warsaw pact tanks and troops entered the 
country quoting a report by the czechoslovak prosecutor general 
authorities are weighing whether to charge former communist 
officials considered responsible for inviting the forces of 
five warsaw pact countries into czechoslovakia 
hardliner vasil bilak and other former senior officials are 
widely held responsible for issuing the invitation although no 
evidence has been published 
lidova demokracie said the prosecutors office has concluded 
the possible actions which brought about military occupation of 
the country fulfilled the factual essence of the criminal act of 
high treason 
earlier reports said bilak would not face charges because of the 
20year statute of limitations some lawyers say that since bilak 
was immune from prosecution by virtue of his post as a 
parliamentary deputy for 21 years he could now face trial 
lidova demokracie said the prosecutors office tentatively 
decided against prosecution but might reexamine the issue

vice president dan quayle told a meeting of 
astronomers today that the nations space program in the future 
will emphasize unmanned science experiments and work toward 
establishing astronomical observatories on the moon 
his speech to the american astronomical society was 
interrupted several times by applause as the vice president 
emphasized that unmanned science probes would be a major element of 
the bush administrations space effort 
we are committed to a balanced scientific program quayle 
said in a comment that drew applause the large exploration 
programs we are planning will not emphasize human activities at the 
expense of scientific excellence 
he reaffirmed the administrations plans to establish a 
permanent base on the moon and later to mount a manned expedition 
to mars 
at some point we hope to establish lunar astronomical 
observatories to build on the foundations of earlier unmanned 
scientific satellites he said 
quayle said the exploration of mars will begin with an 
expanded series of unmanned scientific probes perhaps including a 
return of mars surface samples 
the vice president head of the national space council spoke on 
the opening day of the 175th national meeting of the aas a 
gathering that includes more than a thousand astronomers 
many astronomers who depend on governmentfinanced satellites 
and telescopes have long complained that the federal emphasis has 
been on manned space exploration and provided fewer funds for robot 
craft 
following quayles remarks john bacall the presidentelect of 
aas applauded the vice presidents statement that unmanned science 
would not be shortchanged in the administrations space program 
the vice presidents comments said bacall indicate they 
understand the importance of unmanned science 
he said quayles support for astronomical observatories on the 
moon creates a challenge for americas astronauts we as 
astronomers have to come to grips with the possibility of there 
being facilites on the moon and on mars and what we can best do 
with them he said 
bush announced plans july 20 the 20th anniversary of the first 
apollo moon landing to commit the nation to establishing a 
permanent moon base in the next century and then to mount a manned 
mission to mars 
bush offered few details in that speech but said that quayle 
and the national aeronautics and space administration would work 
out realistic timetables for the ambitious effort 
since then the administration has not announced specific plans 
for the financing and timing of the projects 
the cost of the proposed moon and mars program was estimated 
last summer at between 800 billion and 900 billion 
the proposal got a cool reception in congress even by those who 
usually are enthusiastic about the nations space effort 
sen albert gore dtenn a member of the senate committee that 
oversees space spending said that because the administrations 
space program included no money no timetable and no plan bush 
offers the country not a challenge to inspire us but a daydream to 
briefly entertain us 
the american astronomical society meeting which ends saturday 
is expected to include hundreds of scientific reports on studies of 
the stars the planets and the formation of the universe 
a major paper is expected to include the first reports by 
project scientists of readings taken by the cosmic background 
explorer a nasa satellite launched in november 
the satellite is designed to pick up faint radiation left over 
from the big bang the explosion 15 billion years ago that 
scientists say created the universe 
other reports will address the discovery of what are believed to 
be twin quasars large stellar objects that emit powerful light and 
radio waves a new theory that suggests the milky way galaxy which 
includes the sun may be shaped differently than previously 
believed and new findings on rapid movements of some galaxies that 
are close in astronomical terms to the milky way

mayor jacques chirac unveiled a plan wednesday to 
beautify the champs elysees one of the worlds most famous streets 
overrun in recent years by hamburger joints street vendors and 
parked cars 
the longawaited project to be completed before the end of 
chiracs mandate in 1995 involves eliminating parking on the 
singlelane corridors running parallel to the champs two 
underground lots will replace the 390 places lost 
the plan also calls for planting about 250 trees installing 
specially designed trash cans and phone booths and replacing the 
narrow broken sidewalks with granite slabs widening the paths to 
70 feet 
chirac did not give an estimate for the cost of the program 
facades of several large buildings will be classified as 
historical monuments in the hope of attracting highclass hotels 
and a cultural center 
the champs elysees should once again become the privileged 
place for promenades it was meant to be once again become the 
most beautiful avenue in the world chirac said 
the champs elysees celebrated in song and fiction and 
stretching from the rond point to the arc de triomphe was laid out 
in 1667 by louis xivs finance minister jeanbaptiste colbert 
todays visitors have difficulty making their way down the 
avenue navigating among professional beggars and vendors 
the plan is the brainchild of pierreyves ligen the urban 
planner who directed renovations at the louvre and designed the 
modernistic furniture at the musee dorsay

the school cafeteria wall that blew in 
during a windstorm nov 16 killing nine youngsters was improperly 
designed state officials concluded today 
the masonry portion of the collapsed wall was structurally 
flawed by a design error that left it unsupported by lateral or 
vertical bracing the state disaster preparedness commission said 
in a letter to gov mario cuomo 
nine children were fatally injured in a hail of brick concrete 
and glass when a storm shattered the wall at east coldenham 
elementary school in newburgh as the youngsters were having lunch 
fifteen students were injured 
the commission recommended that state and local agencies improve 
review of construction plans for new school buildings and other 
public facilities 
state and local agencies should also improve emergency alert 
systems the commission headed by health commissioner dr david 
axelrod recommended in its report today 
engineers concluded that the masonry cafeteria wall by itself 
could withstand no more than 45 mph winds but was given added 
support by the series of metalframe windows in the wall the 
school was built in 1959 
the 1959 building code which didnt apply to schools at the 
time but reflected engineering practices then current called for 
walls designed to resist 75 mph wind such walls can actually 
resist 120 mph wind the commission said 
the day of the collapse wind speed was estimated at 90 mph to 
100 mph said axelrod there have been conflicting reports on 
whether it was a tornado that struck the school state officials 
said they believed it was not a tornado but that the effect was the 
same 
engineering consultants hired by the state believe the wall 
did not receive proper engineering attention because it was not a 
load bearing wall and therefore not analyzed for strength said 
commission said 
last month workers began shoring up walls at four schools north 
of new york city after engineers found they were similar to the one 
that collapsed

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 
decision wednesday overturning contempt fines against four yonkers 
ny councilmen 
chief justice william rehnquist wrote the opinion of the court 
this case is the most recent episode of a lengthy lawsuit in 
which the city of yonkers was held liable for intentionally 
enhancing racial segregation in housing in yonkers the issue here 
is whether it was a proper exercise of judicial power for the 
district court to hold petitioners four yonkers city council 
members in contempt for refusing to vote in favor of legislation 
implementing a consent decree earlier approved by the city we hold 
that in the circumstances of this case the district court abused 
its discretion 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the issue before us is relatively narrow there can be no 
question about the liability of the city of yonkers for racial 
discrimination the district court imposed such liability on the 
city its decision was affirmed in all respects by the court of 
appeals and we denied certiorari nor do we have before us any 
question as to the district courts remedial order the court of 
appeals found that it was within the bounds of proper discretion 
united states v yonkers bd of ed 837 f 2d at 1236 and we 
denied certiorari our focus then is only on the district courts 
order of july 26 imposing comtempt sanctions on the individual 
petitioners if they failed to vote in favor of the ordinance in 
question 
petitioners contend that the district courts orders violate 
their rights to freedom of speech under the first amendment and 
they also contend that they are entitled as legislators to absolute 
immunity for actions taken in discharge of their legislative 
responsibilities we find it unnecessary to reach either of these 
questions because we conclude that the portion of the district 
courts order of july 26 imposing contempt sanctions against the 
petitioners if they fgailed to vote in favor of the courtproposed 
ordinance was an abuse of discretion under traditional equitable 
principles 
before discussing the principles informing our conclusion it is 
important to note the posture of the case before the district court 
at the time it entered the order in question petitioners were 
members of the city council of the city of yonkers and if the city 
were to enact legislation it would have to be by their doing but 
petitioners had never been made parties to the action and the 
district courts order imposed liability only on the named 
defendants in the action the city of yonkers and the yonkers 
community development agency 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in selecting a means to enforce the consent judgment the 
district court was entitled to rely on the axiom that courts have 
inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders 
through civil contempt shillitani v united states 384 us 
364 370 1966 
given that the city had entered a consent judgment committing 
itself to enact legislation implementing the longterm plan we 
certainly cannot say it was an abuse of discretion for the district 
court to have chosen contempt sanctions against the city as 
opposed to petitioners as a means of ensuring compliance the 
city as we have noted was a party to the action from the 
beginning had been found liable for numerous statutory and 
constitutional violations and had been subjected to various 
elaborate remedial decrees which had been upheld on appeal 
petitioners the individual city councilmen on the other hand 
were not parties to the action and they had not been found 
individually liable for any of the violations upon which the 
remedial decree was based although the injunctive portion of that 
decree was directed not only to the city but to its officers 
agents employees successors and all persons in active concert or 
participation with any of them app 20 the remaining parts of 
the decree ordering affirmative steps were directed only to the 
city 
the nub of the matter then is whether in the light of the 
reasonable probability that sanctions against the city would 
accomplish the desired result it was within the courts discretion 
to impose sanctions on the petitioners as well under the 
circumstances of this case 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sanctions directed against the city for failure to take actions 
such as required by the consent decree coerce the city legislators 
and of course restrict the freedom of those legislators to act in 
accordance with their current view of the citys best interests 
but we believe there are significant differences between the two 
types of fines the imposition of sanctions on individual 
legislators is designed to cause them to vote not with a view to 
the interest of their constituents or of the city but with a view 
solely to their own personal interests even though an individual 
legislator took the extreme position or felt that his 
constituents took the extreme position that even a huge fine 
against the city was preferable to enacting the affordable housing 
ordinance monetary sanctions against him individually would 
motivate him to vote to enact the ordinance simply because he did 
not want to be out of pocket financially such fines thus encourage 
legislators in effect to declare that they favor an ordinance not 
in order to avoid bankrupting the city for which they legislate 
but in order to avoid bankrupting themselves 
this sort of individual sanction effects a much greater 
perversion of the normal legislative process than does the 
imposition of sanctions on the city for the failure of these same 
legislators to enact an ordinance in that case the legislator is 
only encouraged to vote in favor of an ordinance that he would not 
otherwise favor by reason of the adverse sanctions imposed on the 
city a councilman who felt that his constituents would rather have 
the city enact the affordable housing ordinance than pay a 
bankrupting fine would be motivated to vote in favor of such an 
ordinance because the sanctions were a threat to the fiscal 
solvency of the city for whose welfare he was in part responsible 
this is the sort of calculus in which legislators engage regularly 
we hold that the district court in view of the 
extraordinary nature of the imposition of sanctions against the 
individual councilmen should have proceeded with such contempt 
sanctions first against the city alone in order to secure 
compliance with the remedial orders only if that approach failed 
to produce compliance within a reasonable time should the question 
of imposing contempt sanctions against petitioners even have been 
considered

premier li peng lifted beijings 7monthold 
martial law wednesday night and said that by crushing prodemocracy 
protests the army had saved china from the abyss of misery 
the largely symbolic action appeared intended chiefly to ease 
foreign criticism of chinas harsh crackdown on dissent and cue the 
world bank and industrialized nations to restore badly needed soft 
loans 
vice president dan quayle called the move a step forward for 
human rights and a dividend of recent us overtures to china a 
white house spokesman said there was no change in the us economic 
sanctions against china but hinted that the united states stands 
ready to back world bank loans for china for humanitarian needs 
western diplomats in beijing linked lis action to the december 
visit of us national security adviser brent scowcroft who sought 
an easing of chinas crackdown in exchange for normalizing 
bilateral relations 
li however sought to portray the end of martial law as a sign 
of its success he said it proved that the chinese communist 
party the chinese government and the chinese people are capable of 
running their own affairs well 
martial law officially ended at midnight wednesday 11 am est 
wednesday 
li imposed martial law in beijing for the first time in 40 years 
of communist rule on may 20 after more than 1 million people had 
filled beijing streets to support studentled prodemocracy 
protesters 
in his 10minute speech wednesday night broadcast on national 
tv and radio li said martial law was timely necessary and 
correct if he had not acted he said chinese would have again 
fallen into the abyss of misery 
china is now stable politically economically and socially 
production and lives are in good order people live and work in 
peace and contentment he said 
he stressed that the party was not softening its opposition to 
efforts to attempts to subvert the socialist system 
the party newspaper the peoples daily used even stronger 
language declaring it is imperative to smash the sabotage of 
hostile forces 
beijing streets and college campuses remained quiet after the 
speech several students said the end of martial law made no 
difference and noted that tight campus security would remain 
asked if any students were likely to try to renew calls for 
democracy one woman student said were about to go on winter 
holiday weve all already bought our tickets to go home 
there was little outward sign of the lifting of martial law in 
october the government pulled army guards off the streets 
although they remain in and around the city in walled compounds 
special armed police who had guarded the perimeter of tiananmen 
square the focal point of the spring protests withdrew at 
midnight but others remained at the flagpole in the square and the 
monument to revolutionary martyrs both guarded even before martial 
law 
police officers said civilians can now enter the square freely 
unlike during martial law but they still tried to wave away 
passing bicyclists who stopped and climbed over a metal railing 
into the square a new sign went up saying the steps of the 
monument used by the protesters as a speaking platform will 
remain offlimits 
early thursday police checkpoints remained on major beijing 
roads 
documents distributed to government officials this week said li 
would announce the lifting of martial law on tuesday 24 hours 
before he actually did there was no explanation for the delay 
he spoke sitting at a desk his hands folded in front of him 
most of the time and wore a westernstyle suit 
on may 19 when he announced the government would not permit the 
studentled protests to continue he wore a more ideologically 
conservative mao suit and waved his arms agitatedly he issued the 
martial law order the next day 
even without martial law chinese security forces have wide 
authority to quell dissent the government passed a law in november 
banning all but progovernment demonstrations and strikes and 
putting up political posters are already illegal 
students and other chinese said lifting martial law would make 
little difference to them 
it wont have any effect on most peoples lives said a 
young woman of course they may feel more lighthearted to know 
that martial law is gone but thats all 
in hong kong some drivers honked their car horns after hearing 
the news 
but martin lee a member of hong kongs legislative council and 
advocate of democratic reform said the move was simple political 
posturing 
they have changed nothing he said they might just be 
done for the time being with bloodshed

justice brennan with whom justice marshall justice blackmun 
and justice stevens join dissenting 
i understand and appreciate the courts concern about the 
district courts decision to impose contempt sanctions against 
local officials acting in a legislative capacity we must all hope 
that no court wil ever again face the open and sustained official 
defiance of established constitutional values and valid judicial 
orders that prompted judge sands invocation of the contempt power 
in this manner but i firmly believe that its availability for such 
use in extreme circumstances is essential as the district court 
was aware 
the issues transcend yonkers they go to the very foundation 
of the system of constitutional government if yonkers can defy the 
orders of a federal court in any case but especially a civil 
rights case because compliance is unpopular and if that situation 
is tolerated then our constitutional system of government fails 
the issues before the court this morning are no less significant 
than that 
the court today recognizes that it was appropriate for the 
district court to hold in contempt and fine the city of yonkers to 
encourage the city councilmembers to comply with their prior 
promise to redress the citys history of racial segregation yet 
the court also reprimands the district court for simultaneously 
fining the individual councilmembers whose continuing defiance was 
the true source of the impasse holding that personal sanctions 
should have been considered only after the city sanctions first 
proved fruitless 
i cannot accept the parsimonious view of the district courts 
discretion to wield the power of contempt judge sands intimate 
contact for many years with the recalcitrant councilmembers and his 
familiarity with the citys political climate gave him special 
insight into the best way to coerce compliance when all cooperative 
efforts had failed from our detached vantage point we can hardly 
judge as well as he which coercive sanctions or combination thereof 
were most likely to work quickly and least disruptively because 
the courts ex post rationalization of what judge sand should have 
done fails to do justice either to the facts of this case or the 
art of judging i must dissent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after according no weight to judge sands cautious and 
contextual judgment despite his vastly superior vantage point the 
court compounds its error by committing two more first the court 
turns a blind eye to most of the evidence available to judge sand 
suggesting that because of the councilmembers continuing 
intransigence sanctions against the city alone might not coerce 
compliance and that personal sanctions would significantly increase 
the chance of success second the court fails to acknowledge that 
supplementing city sanctions with personal ones likely would secure 
compliance more promptly minimizing the overall disruptive effect 
of the city sanctions on city services generally and longterm 
compliance with the consent decree in particular 
as the events leading up to the contempt order make clear the 
recalcitrant councilmembers were extremely responsive to the strong 
segments of their constituencies that were vociferously opposed to 
racial residential integration 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the court in addition to ignoring all of this evidence before 
concluding that the city sanctions alone would eventually coerce 
compliance also inexplicably ignores the fact that imposing 
personal fines in addition to sanctions against the city would not 
only help ensure but actually hasten compliance 
given these ancillary effects of city sanctions it seems to me 
entirely appropriate indeed obligatory for judge sand to have 
considered not just whether city sanctions alone would eventually 
have coerced compliance but also how promptly they would have done 
so 
in sum the record does not support the courts casual 
conclusion today that judge sand should have perceived a 
reasonable probability that sanctions against the city alone 
would accomplish the desired result ante at 12 rather the 
city councilmembers vehement and unyielding defiance of judge 
sands remedial orders and his political acumen borne of eight 
years firsthand experience with the yonkers political environment 
led him quite reasonably to believe that city sanctions alone would 
have induced compliance only slowly if at all and at great cost to 
the city and longterm remedial success and that personal 
sanctions would enhance both the promptness and ultimate likelihood 
of compliance under these circumstances judge sands cautious 
exercise of contempt power was within the permissible bounds of his 
remedial discretion the courts determination to play district 
courtforaday and to do so poorly is indefensible 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i concede that personal sanctions against legislators 
intuitively may seem less appropriate than more traditional forms 
of coercing compliance with court orders but this intuition does 
not withstand close scrutiny given the circumstances of this case 
when necessary courts levy personal contempt sanctions against 
other types of state and local officials for flouting valid court 
orders and i see no reason to treat local legislators differently 
when they are acting outside of their sphere of legitimate 
legislative activity tenney 341 us at 376 
the key question here therefore is whether judge sand abused 
his discretion when he decided not to rely on sanctions against the 
city alone but also to apply coercive pressure to the reclcitrant 
councilmembers on an individual basis given the city councils 
consistent defiance and the delicate political situation in 
yonkers judge sand was justifiably uncertain as to whether city 
sanctions alone would coerce compliance at all and if so whether 
they would do so promptly the longer the delay in compliance the 
more likely that city services would be curtailed drastically and 
that both budgetary constraints and growing racial tensions would 
undermine the longterm efficacy of the remedial decree under 
these conditions judge sands decision to supplement the city 
sanctions with personal fines was surely a sensible approach the 
courts contrary judgment rests on its refusal to take the 
fierceness of the councilmembers defiance seriously a refusal 
blind to the scourge of racial politics in yonkers and dismissive 
of judge sands wisdom borne of his superior vantage point 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the courts decision today that judge sand abused his remedial 
discretion by imposing personal fines simultaneously with city 
fines creates no new principle of law indeed it invokes no 
principle of any sort but it directs a message to district judges 
that despite their repeated and close contact with the various 
parties and issues even the most delicate remedial choices by the 
most conscientious and deliberate judges are subject to being 
secondguessed by this court 
i hope such a message will not daunt the courage of district 
courts who if ever again faced with such protracted defiance must 
carefully yet firmly secure compliance with their remedial orders 
but i worry that the courts message will have the unintended 
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test 
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal courts 
thereby postponing the day when all public officers finally accept 
that the responsibility of those who exercise power in a 
democratic government is not to reflect inflamed public feeling but 
to help form its understanding

the paperwork generated by the takeover 
battle between paper giants georgiapacific corp and great 
northern nekoosa corp has become so immense that a judge has 
stepped in to free up the court clerks copy machine 
ever since georgiapacific began its unsolicited 38 billion 
bid to acquire great northern nekoosa in october and great 
northern began court fights to stop its rival the joke has been 
that the legal jockeying will consume enough paper to keep both 
companies in business for years 
counsel on all sides of this case have by virtue of their 
written submissions given ample evidence of their devotion to the 
mercantile interests of the paper industry us district judge 
gene carter said during a december hearing 
as the battle wore on the flow of paper and countless requests 
for copies finally overwhelmed the court clerks office 
carter issued an order filed tuesday and made available 
wednesday that the clerks office begin sending everything 
involved in the companies five lawsuits to a nearby xpress copy 
store so the store can make copies and sell them to the public 
the volume of copy people wanted from them was too much for 
them said philip rhinelander whose xpress copy store can 
produce 20000 pages an hour from our perspective this is just 
another job 
ironically the judges order will save money for lawyers 
reporters and others buying copies of the various legal papers the 
court clerk charged 50 cents a sheet while xpress copy is charging 
21 cents including delivery 
georgiapacific had no estimate of how much paper the legal 
battle here and in bridgeport conn could eventually consume 
heaven only knows spokeswoman gail smith said from atlanta 
ive got a huge stack of stuff thats been issued but i have no 
idea how much will be generated in the future 
rhinelander was unsure whether the paper he will use would come 
from either georgiapacific or great northern mills most paper 
comes out under brand names that would not indicate which mill it 
had come from and xpress copy buys from whichever supplier offers 
the best rates he said 
the legal struggle is going on in both portland and bridgeport 
because great northern is incorporated in maine but has its 
headquarters at norwalk conn 
court workers in bridgeport report a whole lot of paper is 
being generated there but not enough to cause problems

the columbia astronauts put a navy 
communications satellite into orbit wednesday and continued to 
close in on the path of a floating science laboratory they hope to 
snatch from space 
it was an outstanding morning flight director al pennington 
said shortly after the release of the 15200pound syncom 
satellite so everything looks real good right now its a great 
ship up there theyre flying and it continues to perform 
beautifully 
after the satellite was released the astronauts turned their 
attention to the other major task of the mission tracking down the 
21400pound long duration exposure facility so it can be brought 
back to earth 
commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee steered the 
space shuttle through additional maneuvers to help the orbiter 
catch up to the bussize ldef if the astronauts fail the 
satellite is expected to be pulled to its destruction in a fiery 
dive through earths atmosphere on march 9 
columbia is in a slightly lower orbit than ldef which enables 
it to circle the globe a little faster and gradually narrow the 
distance between it and the satellite the shuttle was closing in 
on ldef at a rate of about 40 miles per 91minute orbit wednesday 
when the shuttle lifted off from cape canaveral fla on 
tuesday it was 1725 miles behind ldef by the time the five crew 
members ended their workday wednesday afternoon they were about 
750 miles from their target 
the chase should end friday morning when mission specialist 
bonnie dunbar plans to use the shuttles 50foot robot arm to latch 
onto ldef and tuck it into the cargo bay for the trip home 
scientists are eager to see what has happened to the 57 
selfcontained experiments aboard during nearly six years of 
exposure to spae ldef was to have been retrieved 10 months after a 
shuttle put it into orbit in 1984 but scheduling problems and the 
1986 challenger disaster delayed the retrieval 
columbia mission specialists dunbar david low and marsha ivins 
worked on several experiments of their own concentrating on 
materials processing and tests of how well the human body adapts to 
living in weightlessness 
the major task wednesday deploying the 85 million syncom 
satellite was completed in the morning when it slipped from its 
berth in the cargo bay and spun away fortyfive minutes later an 
onboard motor fired to propel the satellite toward its permanent 
working post 22300 miles above the pacific 
the satellite built by hughes aircraft will complete a network 
of five satellites through which the pentagon communicates with its 
planes ships and bases around the world 
columbias 10day mission is the secondlongest in 33 shuttle 
missions it is a step toward even longer flights leading to 
extended stays in space of several months aboard space station 
freedom later in this decade 
columbia will be modified for 16day flights starting in 1993 a 
new orbiter being built endeavour will be capable of 28day trips

a seemingly skeptical supreme court heard 
arguments wednesday in the complex case of an arkansas mass 
murderer who wants to be executed 
in comments from the bench five of the nine justices questioned 
whether the court could use the case of r gene simmons who killed 
16 relatives and acquaintances in 1987 to decide whether state 
appellate courts must review all death sentences 
little rock lawyer arthur allen who represents another arkansas 
death row inmate called the states death penalty law 
unconstitutional as applied to mr simmons 
this may in fact be a person who is not eligible for the 
death penalty under the law allen said of simmons 
but arkansas attorney general steve clark defended the law and 
argued that allens client convicted killer jonas whitmore lacks 
the proper legal standing to challenge the law in simmons place 
whitmore would love to frustrate the death penalty in 
arkansas clark said but should not be allowed to do so because 
his personal stake is speculative conjectural and hypothetical 
in questions posed to allen during an hourlong argument 
session five justices appeared to agree with clarks assessment of 
whitmores legal standing 
if the court were to rule that whitmore lacks the proper legal 
standing to challenge states death penalty law in this case the 
way would be cleared for simmons execution 
such a decision in practical terms would insulate any states 
death penalty law from legal challenge in a case in which the 
defendant chose not to appeal 
the courts decision is expected by july 
in what prosecutors called a murderous rampage simmons 49 
gunned down his wife three sons four daughters a soninlaw a 
daughterinlaw four grandchildren and two acquaintances within a 
few days of christmas 1987 
after his convictions simmons said he wanted to die by lethal 
injection as soon as possible and would not appeal 
three days before simmons was to die last march 16 whitmore 
sought to challenge the states death penalty law in his behalf 
on the eve of the execution the high court postponed simmons 
death to study whitmores argument that the constitution requires 
state appellate courts to review all death sentences even when 
the convicted defendant asks to die 
under arkansas practice the state appellate courts select only 
certain death penalty cases in which to inquire whether the death 
penalty is a proportionate punishment having been used in 
similar cases 
under questioning by chief justice william h rehnquist allen 
conceded that whitmores standing to challenge the lack of such 
review in simmons case is less than overwhelming 
allen said whitmore could be affected if his death penalty now 
being challenged in federal court is overturned and he then is 
convicted in a new state court trial 
why isnt that hypothetical justice antonin scalia asked 
theres nothing really about to happen to him 
similar questions were asked by justices anthony m kennedy 
sandra day oconnor and byron r white 
death is different it is entitled to higher safeguards 
allen said at one point noting that past decisions have emphasized 
the importance of appellate review in capital cases 
but the states attorney general said the state which has 32 
men on death row does not impose the death penalty in an 
arbitrary capricious or freakish manner 
of simmons clark said clearly there has been a knowing and 
intelligent waiver of his right to appeal 
but simmons could change his mind right up to the time of his 
execution clark said and an appeal would move forward 
the case is whitmore vs arkansas 887146

a sharply divided supreme court today 
overturned contempt fines imposed against four yonkers ny city 
councilmen who defied a federal judges order to adopt a housing 
desegregation plan 
by a 54 vote the court said the judge who imposed the fines 
exceeded his authority 
dissenting justices said todays ruling which follows a series 
of decisions last year that generally narrowed the scope of civil 
rights laws could hamstring judges in dealing with officials who 
defy antidiscrimination court orders 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
us district judge leonard sand acted too hastily in holding the 
councilmen in contempt 
the judge should have waited to see whether a contempt order 
against the city that threatened to bankrupt it succeeded in 
forcing compliance with sands desegregation order rehnquist said 
only if that failed the chief justice said should contempt 
sanctions against the individual council members even have been 
considered 
the imposition of sanctions on individual legislators is 
designed to cause them to vote not with a view to the interest of 
their constituents or of the city but with a view solely to their 
own personal interests rehnquist said thi sort of individual 
sanction effects a much greater perversion of the normal 
legislative process than does the imposition of sanctions on the 
city 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said the 
ruling may intimidate judges and give public officials more reason 
to defy reasonable court orders 
i worry that the courts message will have the unintended 
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test 
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal 
courts he said 
the end result could be the delaying of civil rights progress 
brennan said 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens 
joining rehnquist were justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor anthony m kennedy and antonin scalia 
steven shapiro a lawyer with the american civil liberties 
union said i think the decision is more significant as a 
political symbol than legally it will be perceived as a further 
step away from the courts commitment to civil rights 
councilman edward fagan one of the four said its a great 
vindication it proved the things i did were justified it adds a 
whole new impetus to continue the fight against the housing 
im looking forward to getting my money back he added he 
was fined 3500 
the court in 1989 limited affirmative action made it tougher to 
prove job discrimination and restricted remedies for onthejob 
racial harassment those decisions touched off angry protests by 
civil rights leaders 
the yonkers case attracted national attention in the summer of 
1988 as the defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as 
fines and the city faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey 
sands orders 
faced with massive layoffs of city workers the city council 
reversed itself and on sept 10 1988 voted to comply with sands 
order to build 1000 lowcost homes to desegregate middleclass 
areas of the city just north of new york city 
but yonkers still had to pay 819000 in fines and the four 
councilmen 3500 apiece for being in contempt of the judges order 
from the previous aug 2 
in other action today the court 
refused by a 54 vote to create a new exception to the rule 
barring unlawfully obtained evidence from criminal trials 
the court ruled in an illinois case that statements a criminal 
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by 
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness trial testimony 
in a separate criminal law decision involving evidence the 
court ruled by a 63 vote that federal juries may be told about a 
defendants alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trial 
on those charges ended in an acquittal 
limited the ability of multinational corporations to challenge 
state taxes in federal court 
the justices ruled unanimously that a law generally barring 
federal courts from handling lawsuits that attack a state tax 
applies to foreignbased multinational businesses 
the yonkers case stems from a justice department lawsuit begun 
by the carter administration in its waning days in 1980 
sand in 1985 ruled that yonkers officials intentionally and 
unlawfully promoted racial segregation through their housing and 
school policies he ordered the city to desegregate the school 
system and build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections 
of the city 
city officials agreed in january 1988 to build 200 units and 
make plans for 600 more but later sought to back out of the 
agreement 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in august 1988 said sand 
acted properly in holding the city and the four councilmen in 
contempt after the council voted 43 against a package of financial 
incentives designed to attract development of the 800 low and 
moderateincome homes 
sand imposed fines against the city starting at 100 a day and 
doubling daily until it complied with the desegregation agreement 
the appeals court put a cap of 1 million a day on the fines and 
upheld the judges 500aday fines for each councilman 
the threat of jail terms was lifted after the council relented 
and adopted the desegregation plan 
the four councilmen are fagan nicholas v longo peter chema 
and vice mayor henry spallone 
they said their freespeech and lgislativeimmunity rights were 
violated by the contempt citation 
the cases are spallone vs us 88854 chema vs us 88856 
longo vs us 88870

at st josephs seminary in yonkers he was ordained a deacon the 
highest position a layman may attain last month

years ago the vatican said american bishops could ordain some 
anglican or episcopalian priests who were married and who had left 
their churches and converted to catholicism 
since then more than 50 married converts have been ordained as 
roman catholic priests in the united states the archdiocese said

a government lawyer told the supreme court 
wednesday that the army correctly refused to bargain over teacher 
wages and fringe benefits at two armyrun schools in georgia 
because congress never meant for the pay of any federal employee to 
be negotiable 
christopher j wright an assistant to the us solicitor 
general urged the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling 
that the army must negotiate monetary issues with unions for 
teachers at schools the army operates for the children of military 
and civilian personnel at fort stewart 
no one ever said on the floor of congress that employees like 
the teachers could bargain over pay wright said 
the teachers union at the two elementary schools an affiliate 
of the national education association sought a 135 percent wage 
increase in 1987 and various fringe benefit improvements 
the army refused to negotiate the monetary issues but was 
ordered to do so by the federal labor relations authority an 
independent agency set up within the executive branch to mediate 
disputes between federal employees and federal agencies 
the armys appeal of the flra decision was rejected by the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals in atlanta and the supreme court 
then agreed to review the case which could affect all federal 
employees whose pay is not fixed by law 
william e persina lawyer for the flra said federal agencies 
are required by law to negotiate with employee unions over 
personnel policies practices and working conditions unless 
such matters are specifically spelled out in law 
thus he said the salaries of 97 percent of the federal 
workforce clearly are not negotiable because they are fixed by law 
but congress never has established salary schedules for the other 3 
percent including school employees 
if congress had wanted to make the pay of these teachers 
nonnegotiable it would have said so in the statute persina 
argued just as it did for the overwhelming majority of the 
workforce whose pay is set by law 
wright argued that requiring the army to negotiate over wages 
would interfere with the armys right to set its own budget and 
would violate an army rule that teacher salaries in its dependents 
schools should be comparable to those paid teachers in local public 
schools 
but persina said the army never made any attempt to prove to the 
flra that the unions wage and fringe benefit proposal would force 
the army to seek additional unbudgeting funds from congress 
before citing the budget to refuse to negotiate a monetary 
proposal persina said the army must show that the proposal 
entails significant and unavoidable costs that are not offset by 
other compensating benefits including such intangibles as 
improved employee morale and lower turnover 
as for the army rule requiring comparable teacher pay persina 
said it does not preclude negotiations over wages and fringe 
benefits because comparable pay is not an essential element of a 
comparable education which is the only requirement congress has 
spelled out in law for the dependents schools

indonesias foreign minister met with 
cambodian guerrilla leaders wednesday and said they appeared 
inflexible in efforts to settle their 11yearold war against the 
vietnameseinstalled government 
sources in phnom penh confirmed that explosions had hit the 
capital and that khmer rouge guerrillas had attacked near the 
secondlargest city over the weekend but they said khmer rouge 
claims of success were exaggerated 
cambodias communist premier hun sen said he feared the khmer 
rouge could return to power and said he would bolster government 
forces at all costs 
diplomatic attempts to settle the conflict have intensified 
since september when vietnam said it withdrew all its troops 
the indonesian official ali alatas met in bangkok with khmer 
rouge leaders and those from the usbacked noncommunist forces 
of prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer peoples national 
liberation front 
asked if the khmer rouge had become more flexible in their 
demands he said everybody is persistent on their own 
positions 
fears of a battlefield victory by the khmer rouge the strongest 
of three guerrilla groups have risen with its reports that khmer 
rouge guerrillas forced the communist leadership to flee the 
capital in grenade attacks saturday and briefly captured cambodias 
no 2 city over the weekend 
khieu kanharith editor of the governmentsponsored weekly 
newspaper kampuchea said four or five plastic explosives went off 
in the streets of phnom penh on friday and saturday night causing 
no injuries or damage 
there werent even any broken windows he said by telephone 
kanharith denied khmer rouge guerrilla claims that grenades were 
used and that the blasts had forced vietnameseinstalled president 
heng samrin to flee 
in battambang fighting was limited to villages six to nine 
miles away said kanharith that city also was quiet wednesday he 
said 
the official phnom penh radio said 100 to 200 communist khmer 
rouge guerrillas attacked at midnight friday through four suburbs 
of battambang in an attempt to blow up an bridge 
our armed forces repelled the enemies forcing them to retreat 
completely and leave behind nine bodies on the battlefield along 
with nine weapons said the tuesday night broadcast a transcript 
was seen in bangkok on wednesday 
fighting has raged in cambodia since vietnamese troops in late 
1978 ended the brutal 3year reign of pol pots khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians while trying to create a 
primitive agrarian society 
the khmer rouge has said it would fight until a coalition 
government including hun sens government and the guerrilla groups 
was formed 
alatas also met with the foriegn minister of thailand which 
backs the guerrillas and with an envoy from australia which has 
proposed that cambodia be administered by the united nations until 
free elections are held 
alatas a key player in several regional peace efforts and a 
un conference last summer hoped to meet sunday or monday with 
vietnamese foriegn minister nguyen co thach and hun sen 
asked about the possibility of a new round of peace talks the 
minister replied it is still open 
the five permanent members of the un security council 
britain china france the soviet union and the united states 
will meet in paris on monday and tuesday to discuss peace 
proposals including the australian plan 
the resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk said wednesday 
in beijing that he supported a proposed un administration 
including a un military presence in his country for up to 10 
years but would not give up the un seat until hun sens 
government is dismantled 
the official radio said hun sen has agreed to a un role in an 
interim administration only if the un seat held by the guerrillas 
first is vacated 
hun sen made his appeal for more government troops in a speech 
saturday a copy of the speech was received in bangkok on wednesday 
this duty must be carried out at all costs he said we 
must strengthen the armed forces without the armed forces we 
cannot survive

a worker helping build the channel tunnel 
between britain and france was struck by an underground train and 
killed wednesday the fifth person to die on the project kent 
county police said 
police identified the victim as keith lynch 34 and said the 
accident occurred in the tunnel about a halfmile from the 
shakespeare cliff site at dover 
construction of the 34mile tunnel began in december 1987 and

the united states on wednesday defended 
surrounding the peruvian ambassadors residence in panama city 
saying the action was being taken at the request of the new 
panamanian government 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the us 
troops are on the lookout for suspected criminals who may have 
taken refuge in the residence and are carrying out their role of 
providing security assistance until the government of guillermo 
endara is able to solidify its own police force 
tutwiler acknowledged that peru had formally protested the us 
action in a letter to the us ambassador in lima anthony 
quainton but sought to minimize the protest saying only that the 
issue had been formally raised 
the letter complained that the action creates an unnecessary 
climate of tension and impedes the normal development of activities 
of our mission in panama 
threeway talks are under way among diplomats from panama peru 
and the united states to resolve the situation tutwiler said 
peru which has been among the harshest critics in the 
hemisphere of the us invasion of panama has granted asylum to a 
dozen panamanians including some military officers loyal to 
deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega 
among those granted asylum is gonzalo gonzalez identified by 
panamanian authorities as noriegas former chief of security peru 
has said the 12 will be allowed to come to peru if they wish 
tutwiler said the united states hopes peruvian president alan 
garcia will attend a drug summit with president bush and other 
andean presidents on feb 15 in cartagena colombia 
following the us invasion garcia said he would not attend 
but has been softening that stance and said sunday he would go if 
us troops are first withdrawn from panama 
tutwiler said us troops over the last few days have been 
surveilling persons whom the panamanian government may wish to 
investigate regarding past criminal activity 
she added that panama was in the process of taking over this 
responsibility and was still in the early stages of screening 
people associated with noriega for possible criminal prosecutions 
some individuals who are under us indictments are also 
believed to remain at large in panama she said

the government has given gold 
miners 16 million acres of land claimed by yanomami indians in 
exchange for the prospectors promise to leave a yanomami 
reservation that has been mined illegally for years 
the agreement announced tuesday night and criticized by 
environmentalists does not guarantee the miners will stay off the 
reservation although it ended a tense standoff between thousands 
of prospectors and government officials under pressure to preserve 
the mineralrich indian land 
this is the peaceful solution to the problem there will be no 
shock or confrontation justice ministry spokesman vinicius 
becker said wednesday in brasilia the capital he said the 
agreement would be signed this week 
under the deal the government called off efforts to remove an 
estimated 40000 miners from the reservation by force the 
prospectors agreed to surrender their guns and move from the 
reservation onto 16 million acres of mostly virgin forest 
bordering it 
the yanomamis one of the worlds largest primitive tribes also 
claim this land but the government has declared it national forest 
becker acknowledged there is no way to ensure the miners will 
live up to their part of the deal 
the only thing that keeps them out of the reservation is the 
constitution we expect the miners to keep the agreement if there 
are violations the government will act he said 
the yanomami tribe once claimed 23 million acres in brazils 
remote western amazon territory near the border with venezuela 
over the years the government whittled the indians property 
down to 5 million acres declaring the remainder national parks and 
forests 
an illegal gold rush began in 1987 after studies indicated a 
wealth of gold tin bauxite and diamonds on yanomami land 
environmentalists say the invasion devastated the peaceful tribal 
life of the approximately 9000 yanomamis 
prospectors destroyed rain forest spread disease and polluted 
rivers with mercury used in panning for gold 
because of the presence of miners many indians have malaria 
tuberculosis and venereal diseases there also is a lot of 
malnutrition because fish and game have disappeared from some 
areas said col airton alcantara gomes the no 2 official at 
the national indian office 
olimpio serra president of the virgin forest foundation ecology 
group said the latest decision was a defeat for the indians and 
will not solve the problem of rain forest destruction 
we should find a solution that gives prospectors access to 
other ore deposits further oppressing the weak is an unacceptable 
decision said serra 
under the new agreement the miners promised to use filters to 
eliminate mercury becker said 
critics accused the federal government of caving in to local 
political interests 
the deal was proposed by territorial gov romero juca who is 
expected to run for the senate in november when the region attains 
full statehood as roraima and increases its number of congressmen 
indians dont vote this absurdity explains in large part 
whats going on in roraima the newspaper folha de sao paulo said 
wednesday 
international outrage over the destruction of yanomami land 
forced the government to begin trying to remove the miners who 
vowed to resist such efforts 
the 4 million expulsion operation began monday when federal 
police with submachine guns occupied the airport in boa vista the 
capital of roraima and the main supply point for the miners other 
police teams closed dirt air strips and seized supplies and fuel 
destined for the prospectors 
the miners protested and federal police chief romeu tuma flew 
to boa vista on tuesday to negotiate the agreement

the united states on wednesday expressed 
disappointment with frances plan to reopen its embassy in 
afghanistan saying the move would be used by the kabul government 
to claim it has international support 
a french foreign ministry spokesman had announced its intention 
to reopen the outpost earlier tuesday frances deputy foreign 
minister had insisted it had no political significance 
but margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman told 
reporters the situation in kabul remained precarious and said 
the united states has no plans to reopen its embassy which was 
closed just before the soviet army withdrew last year 
even though the french have said that the decision had no 
political meaning it is disappointing because it will be portrayed 
by the illegitimate government in kabul as an indication of support 
for their regime tutwiler said 
france will become the first major western power to go back into 
kabul since the united states led a diplomatic exodus before the 
february 1989 withdrawal of soviet forces 
the sovietbacked government has proven more tenacious than 
expected and the united states believes any reopening of embassies 
could signal that usbacked rebels are not close to defeating the 
regime

former premier jacques chirac a twotime loser as 
a presidential candidate has come under assault within his own 
conservative party which could drop him as leader at a convention 
next month 
the attack came tuesday from both the right and left flanks of 
the neogaullist rally for the republic party which chirac created 
in 1976 and has dominated ever since 
two men who both served as cabinet ministers under chirac 
charles pasqua leader of the partys conservative wing and 
philippe seguin a leader of what is known as the renovators on 
the left issued a statement saying the party has not recovered 
confidence in itself and as a result has never seemed so far away 
from regaining the confidence of the french people 
they offered their eightparagraph text as a motion to be voted 
on at the feb 11 party congress 
the pasquaseguin statement made no direct reference to chirac 
but no one was fooled 
its a struggle for power it involves destabilizing jacques 
chirac and myself the partys secretarygeneral alain juppe 
said in a radio interview wednesday who said pasqua and seguin 
made an odd couple 
its a bizarre alliance juppe said several months ago 
philippe seguin thought i was much too conservative and charles 
pasqua thought i was much too understanding toward the renovators 
pasqua has urged the party to compete for votes with the 
extremeright national front while seguin has been more interested 
in luring centrist supporters 
about all that seguin and pasqua seem to share is a sense that 
after following chirac to defeat in two straight presidential 
elections the time has come to find a new candidate 
chirac who served as premier from 197476 and again from 
198688 ran for the first time in 1981 drawing only 18 percent of 
the vote he seemed to have a much better chance in 1988 but fell 
to socialist francois mitterrands successful reelection bid in 
the runoff chirac drew 46 percent of the vote to mitterrands 54 
percent 
known throughout his career for his boundless energy chirac has 
been notably quiet since his may 1988 defeat retreating to the job 
he still holds as mayor of paris even friendly observers have 
asked whether the loss had sapped his appetite for the political 
struggle 
but within hours after pasqua and seguin issued their statement 
chirac announced he would run again for the party leadership at the 
february convention a job that automatically makes him the partys 
candidate if a presidential election is called 
while chirac looks more vulnerable than even he has one big 
advantage there is no clear alternative with strong support inside 
the party and good prospects in a presidential campaign 
voters are next scheduled to choose a president in 1995 but the 
election could come sooner if the 73yearold mitterrand who has 
served more than eight years already steps down or dies in office 
the rally for the republic is not a conventional political 
party it is descended from the union of democrats for the 
republic the grouping of gen charles de gaulles supporters de 
gaulle always insisted he drew from both the left and right of the 
political spectrum but over time the gaullists have become a 
conservative party 
the gaullist movement was in disarray in 1976 when chirac quit 
as premier saying conservative president valery giscard destaing 
did not give him enough latitude to deal with the countrys economy 
chirac then refounded the party under a new name the rally for 
the republic and has been its unchallenged leader ever since 
the party known as the rpr from its french initials competes 
for conservative votes with an array of rightist centrist and 
centerright parties most of which are allied in the union for 
french democracy udf 
a coalition of the rpr and udf won the 1986 parliamentary 
elections forcing the socialist mitterrand to name a conservative 
government led by chirac which ran the country for the next two 
years under an uncomfortable arrangement called cohabitation

secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressing impatience told arabs and israelis on wednesday that 
other areas of the world are clamoring for his attention while 
the two camps hesitate on opening mideast peace talks 
the statement issued through spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
appeared to be a veiled warning to the two sides to come to terms 
on holding talks here or risk losing us help in mediating their 
dispute 
baker hopes to bring the israeli and egyptian foreign ministers 
to washington soon to discuss holding an election among palestinian 
arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
but sparring over whether the palestine liberation organization 
should have a role has delayed the setting of a date 
there are many other areas in the world clamoring for his 
attention areas where the circumstances are producing change 
tutwiler said we hope to see the same kind of impulse that will 
produce change in the middle east and were prepared to do all we 
can to promote it 
earlier baker talked on the telephone with israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens on monday he spoke with egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdel meguid 
we have continued to try to make progress and lay the basis 
for a trilateral meeting ms tutwiler said if this effort 
does fail it certainly wont be due to a lack of effort or will on 
the part of this president or this secretary of state 
on monday baker expressed his frustration with the middle east 
to kjell magne bondevik the norwegian foreign minister in a 
meeting at the state department 
bondevik is chairman of the christian peoples party which 
follows developments in the middle east closely 
at a news conference afterward the norwegian said baker was 
not very optimistic about prospects for negotiations 
after some arduous diplomacy baker last month won agreement in 
principle from egypt and israel to send their foreign ministers 
here to discuss prospects for elections among the 14 million 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
both sides registered reservations however and a date for the 
talks was not scheduled 
israel basically wants to prohibit the palestine liberation 
organization from influencing the elections egypt on behalf of 
the plo is trying to secure a behindthescenes role in the 
negotiations for yasser arafats organization

the price of the navys new a12 attack plane 
totals about 100 million apiece according to congressional 
documents which inadvertently contained figures on the top secret 
aircraft 
the january 1989 budget included a12 production through 
fiscal year 1994 of 106 aircraft for 102 billion said the 
entry in the 888page transcript of hearings held in 1989 by the 
house appropriations subcommittee on defense 
the transcripts prior entries on the twinengine twoseat 
fighter equipped with radarevading stealth techonology deleted the 
cost figures for the classified program but in one category on 
medium attack aircraft the cost of producing the plane is simply 
stated 
navy spokesman lt james wood said wednesday that the service 
had no official comment on the transcript revelation which was 
originally reported in the philadelphia inquirer 
the navy plans to replace its aging fleet of a6 planes with the 
a12 the a6 however cost considerably less about 20 million 
each in 1986 prior to a halt in production 
it is the navys desire that there will be no active 
operational a6e aircraft operating in fiscal year 2005 said the 
newly released transcript the presidents budget includes a12 
procurement 
a pentagon source who spoke on condition he not be identified 
said the 100 million figure was inaccurate citing the absence of 
additional information on whether the cost of spare parts training 
and research and development was included in the total 
the source said the navy was disappointed with the editorial 
error but would deal with it as such 
the cost disclosure is expected to prompt criticism in congress 
where initial calls have been for cuts in military spending in 
light of a lessening soviet threat

rivers bloated by days of of heavy rain remained out of their 
banks wednesday in washington state and an estimated 1000 people 
had been forced to flee but high water in some oregon communities 
began receding 
rainfall eased during the morning with the national weather 
service predicting only scattered showers for the next couple of 
days after a series of windy storms that began saturday the wind 
blew down thousands of trees broke power lines and blew off roofs 
flooding in some areas of washington was expected to continue 
through the weekend 
three deaths were blamed on the storms in the northwest with a 
body found floating wednesday in a flooded area in lewis county 
two earlier deaths were reported in oregon 
the worst flooding in washington was in centralia a town of 
about 11000 in southwestern washington where as much as 4 inches 
of rain fell in 24 hours fire chief chuck newbury said about 400 
people were evacuated after a dike along the skookumchuck river 
failed during the night 
newbury said water in one neighborhood was 3 to 4 feet deep 
wednesday 
the dike has been breached and they couldnt hold it back with 
sandbags newbury said its just threatening property at the 
moment we dont foresee any lifethreatening problems 
officials also evacuated the centralia convalescent center 
which has about 60 patients because of flooding from the chehalis 
river the skookumchuck joins the chehalis just outside town 
berg said he thought perhaps 2000 people countywide might be 
out of their homes but that some may have just stayed away as a 
precaution 
lewis county officials estimated about 30000 sandbags had been 
used to shore up riverbanks and protect buildings 
sheriffs sgt john mccroskey said pe ell parts of winlock and 
other communities in western lewis county were virtually 
inaccessible by road 
elsewhere in western washington officials evacuated 83 
residents of a nursing home in mckenna about 20 miles east of 
olympia 16 families along the white river about 40 miles southeast 
of seattle and about 100 people along the nisqually river between 
olympia and tacoma 
along the northern coast of oregon water was receding wednesday 
in clatsop and tillamook counties where severe flooding prompted 
the governor to declare a state of emergency tuesday 
in downtown nehalem a town of 240 people 25 miles north of 
tillamook 2 feet of water covered us highway 101 tuesday but 
the water had dropped to less than a foot by late wednesday 
morning city manager merlin brown said 
its more serious than weve had for a lot of years but not 
total disaster by any means he said 
clatsop county sheriff john raichl said flooding in the southern 
part of his county was the worst in decades aat the height of the 
flooding water was 6 feet deep on some county roads 
businesses also were flooded along us highway 101 in north 
tillamook and in southern clatsop county a total of 37 people were 
evacuated from homes in lowlying areas of southern clatsop county 
and along the lower nehalem river in northern tillamook county 
flooding is a perennial occurrence and people have become 
complacent said paul levesque assistant director of emergency 
services for tillamook county 
when they saw the need to leave they no longer had the 
capability their vehicles were under water and they couldnt leave 
on foot he said 
twentyfive people were evacuated from along the lower nehalem 
river which crested nearly 12 feet above flood stage the rivers 
highest level since records first were kept in 1971 
levesque said a mudslide had blocked the entrance of cape 
lookout state park southwest of tillamook and probably wouldnt be 
removed for at least a week

some of polands little piggies finally 
went to a free market but their owners said they wished theyd 
stayed home 
few private buyers were willing to pay what farmers were asking 
for their pigs or calves wednesday but many farmers refused to 
sell them to state slaughterhouses for less 
it makes no sense to sell i havent sold anything since 
december said kurek polikarp a farmer from a nearby village 
who was asking 31 cents a pound for his two 3weekold calves but 
had hoped prices would hit 50 cents a pound at the market 
the state however offered only 23 cents a pound for the 
healthy 99pound calves 
the competitive market in radzymin has been open since summer 
but wednesday was the first time farmers have refused en masse to 
sell many say they wont sell unless they can get a better price 
polikarps beef with the prices is in part the result of a 
radical economic reform program drawn up by the solidarityled 
government 
the plan aims to achieve a marketoriented economic system in a 
country where prices were regulated and enterprises and agriculture 
subsidized for decades 
the previous communist government freed almost all food prices 
aug 1 in a first step toward free markets the solidarityled 
government freed the rest jan 1 when the price of gasoline and 
electricity also rose 
the new government also has scrapped a policy of paying 
subsidies for agricultural products to try to make farmers more 
efficient and fight inflation 
angry farmers are refusing to sell to the state slaughterhouses 
because they say the prices wouldnt cover their mounting costs 
the large state slaughterhouses supply a chain of state food 
stores and the increasing reluctance of farmers to sell has left 
shelves bare despite the high prices 
gabriel janowski the new leader of private farmers solidarity 
movement has warned of unrest in the spring if the situation does 
not imporove by then 
its pure robbery said stefan wyszynski when asked to 
comment on the price that the state slaughterhouse was offering for 
pigs 
the radzymin slaughterhouse one of two operating at the market 
was offering to buy pigs at 30 cents a pound and the zeran 
slaughterhouse at 28 cents a pound in contrast to the 31 cents per 
pound price quoted on the free market 
farmers said none of those prices is enough to break even they 
say that for the sale of 220pound pig they should be able to buy 
2200 pounds of feed but now they can only buy about 1540 pounds 
those who who did sell said they had to in order to get cash 
farmers are no longer eligible for cheap credits and must pay the 
same 38 percent as other citizens on bank loans 
i need the money so i have to sell said krzystyna 
dabrowska the owner of a 6monthold pig which she bought four 
months ago and hoped to sell when it was 9 months old 
dabrowska has four pigs four cows chickens ducks and geese on 
her 12 acres farm she said she wanted to sell the pig for cash to 
buy feed for the other animals 
the farmers seemed hopeful the government would achieve its goal 
of stabilizing prices and bringing down the rate of inflation but 
they are determined not to sell at a loss 
if i dont sell these pigs i will take them home and wait 
until there is a good price said one young farmer displaying 
four healthy 9monthold pigs

each week since hurricane hugo smashed 
into south carolina a plain envelope addressed in a childs hand 
and usually containing 1 has arrived at the local american red 
cross office 
the envelopes apparently contain a portion of an unidentified 
pennsylvania youths allowance red cross director glenn ellis said 
wednesday 
agency officials would like to thank the child for his or her 
generosity which now amounts to about 17 but have no idea who 
he or she may be ellis said 
the only clue is a postmark of rossiter pa a community of 
about 750 people located about 65 miles northeast of pittsburgh 
a 1 bill was enclosed in each of the envelopes except one which 
contained 58 cents the only writing on the envelope was the 
address of the red cross office and the designation it was to be 
used for hugo relief 
red cross officials plan to contact newspapers which serve the 
rossiter area in an attempt to try to find the youth 
meanwhile although the red cross has stopped its fund raising 
for hugo relief money continues to arrive each day 
the most amazing thing is the kids ellis said adding that 
one child sent 125 saying he wanted to give his weeks allowance 
to the relief effort 
in the days before christmas the red cross got more offers of 
toys and gifts than it could handle and had to ask other agencies 
to handle the distribution 
the generosity of the american people is just amazing he 
said we still get money every day we have stopped our fund 
raising but every day we still get checks 
nationwide more than 129 million was raised by the red cross 
for hurricane and earthquake relief in the caribbean the us 
mainland and california about 93 million of that has been spent 
in south carolina 
hurricane hugos 135 mph winds smashed into south carolina on 
sept 21 causing an estimated 6 billion damage and claiming 29

the chairman of the house judiciary committee 
warned wednesday that the white house is so far behind in 
appointing judges it jeopardizes the work of the federal courts 
unless timely action is taken our judicial system will grind 
to a virtual standstill under this staggering workload thereby 
undermining the valiant efforts of our law enforcement officials to 
bring drug criminals to justice rep jack brooks dtexas wrote 
to president bush 
brooks said he would consider expanding federal resources for 
the federal judiciary but the question of judicial vacancies must 
first be addressed 
according to brooks there are 59 federal court vacancies 18 
at the appeals court level and 41 at the district court level at 
the same time only eight nominations are pending before the senate 
to fill those openings 
whatever the cause for inaction i would strongly urge you to 
move to fill the existing vacancies without delay brooks told 
bush 
the administrative office of the us courts meanwhile is 
recommending the creation of 75 new federal judgeships nationwide 
brooks told bush he stands ready to give serious consideration 
to the expansion of resources for the federal judiciary if 
warranted but that decision awaits movement to fill existing 
vacancies 
average caseloads for district court judges have increased 53 
percent in the past 20 years while appeals court judges have seen 
average caseloads grow more than 100 percent brooks said 
given that astonishing growth he said this large number 
of empty slots and the slowness of the nominating process is all 
the more distressing moreover the war on drugs has placed and 
will continue to exert a particularly heavy burden on the system 
brooks said drug cases now represent as much as 60 percent of 
new criminal filings in some districts and that the problem is 
particuarly acute in border states like texas where heavy 
illegal drug activity is reported along the rio grande

vice president dan quayle hinted wednesday 
that nasa may lose its monopoly on american space exploration with 
the government turning to a program that could include commercial 
and defense elements 
quayle speaking at a meeting of the american astronomical 
society said he has been told by space experts that changes are 
needed in how the united states conducts its space exploration 
the vice president who is chairman of the national space 
council said the organization is looking across the traditional 
divisions among civil commercial and national security 
activities in reassessing the american space program 
we are building a program that is more than the sum of these 
parts said quayle 
quayle gave no specific details how the national space effort 
might be split between various agencies 
but a source at the national aeronautics and space 
administration said that some in the agency have interpreted his 
remarks as suggesting that some other agencies may assume a larger 
role in the us space program the source said such a division of 
efforts have been discussed within the agency 
quayle said president bush has asked the space council that we 
shape a space program that is aggressive and innovative and that we 
challenge accepted ways of doing business 
quayle said he has met with groups of space experts and i 
heard much the same thing from almost all of them they told me 
that we simply can no longer accept the status quo i agree 
as chairman of the national space council quayle said i 
intend to bring the kind of innovative approaches to the space 
program of the 90s that were characteristic of polaris atlas 
apollo voyager and some programs in the defense advanced research 
projects agency 
quayle said that a major effort of a revamped space program 
would be development of expanded space launch capabilities systems 
to launch into space he said are as vital to space travel as 
the interstate highway system is to motor travel 
launch systems he said cannot be considered only within the 
context of a single government agency they cannot be built to meet 
the needs only of a specific space program they must be structured 
to accommodate both current needs and future programs 
one of the most serious effects of the 1986 challenger explosion 
that grounded the space shuttle fleet was that it virtually left 
america without a way to launch large satellites the shuttle had 
been developed with the promise that it would serve all of the 
nations space launch needs 
quayle reaffirmed bush administration support for plans to 
return humans to the moon and eventually send astronauts to mars 
but the vice president said the us space effort will continue 
to include unmanned space probes such as the voyager craft that 
recently completed a flyby exploration of the planet neptune 
that mission taught all of us how central unmanned exploration 
is to space science and discovery he said let me reaffirm our 
commitment to the unmanned as well as the manned exploration of 
space 
quayle pledged that the moon and mars exploration will not 
emphasize human activities at the expense of scientific

he said the moon exploration will include establishing permanent 
astronomical observatories on the lunar surface 
a nasa source said that some have suggested within the agency 
that observatories on the moon could be operated by other agencies 
such as the national science foundation or one of the federal 
laboratories 
quayle said he has asked the national academy of sciences and 
the aerospace industries association to look at the current space 
program and tell us about new better approaches 
an audience of astronomers repeatedly applauded quayles remarks 
about supporting unmanned space exploration many astronomers have 
complained in the past that the expense of sending astronauts into 
space has taken away funds from building and launching cheaper 
unmanned space probes 
john bacall presidentelect of the aas said quayles speech 
suggests that the bush administration understands the 
importance of unmanned science probes in space 
american astronomers he said have to come to grip with the 
possibility of there being facilities on the moon and mars and what 
we can best do with them

mexico complained wednesday that nbc news 
interviews following segments of the drug wars television 
miniseries unfairly gave the impression that the mexican government 
is corrupt and involved in drug smuggling 
an nbc news official replied that the embassy had declined the 
opportunity to have a mexican representative interviewed on the 
program but said that the program nonetheless gave the point of 
view of the mexican government as well as of its critics 
drug wars a threepart miniseries produced by nbcs 
entertainment division dealt with the 1985 killing of us drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena 
after each of the episodes which were broadcast sunday through 
tuesday nights nbc news presented a 15minute interview segment 
the segments were taped sunday at the dea laboratory in washington 
embassy spokesman javier treveino said at a news conference that 
some assertions made by the interviewer reporter and guests are 
the product of sheer ignorance imprecise unfair lacking of any 
evidence and maybe in bad faith 
lloyd siegel executive producer for special broadcasts at nbc 
news said the network took pains to see that mexicos point of 
view was represented and we do not accept the charge that there 
were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in its reporting 
siegel said nbc even sent a vice president of news gordon 
manning to the embassy in an effort to persuade officials there to 
provide a representative to be interviewed 
they did not see their way clear to doing that he said 
what they did however is to recommend an expert someone to 
represent their views and we included him 
the news executive said the expert guido belsasso of the 
university of california at san diego very forthrightly and 
clearly stated that there had been great progress in terms of drug 
enforcement in mexico and efforts to root out corruption in the 
mexican government 
he said this view was echoed by federal drug policy director 
william bennett and by drug enforcement administrator john c lawn 
on the other two nights and we are somewhat puzzled by the 
position they mexican officials are taking now 
gustavo gonzalez legal adviser to the embassy said mexican 
officials declined to be interviewed partly because they were 
apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by 
attorneys representing the men charged with camarenas murder 
camarena 37 was kidnapped feb 7 1985 in guadalajara 
mexico his mexican pilot alfredo zavala avalar was kidnapped a 
few days later their bulletriddled bodies showing signs of 
torture were found march 5 1985 wrapped in plastic bags and 
buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of 
guadalajara 
rafael caro quintero 37 ernesto rafael fonseca carillo 56 
and 10 other men have been prosecuted and sentenced in mexico for 
the killings 
treveino said the killings were the criminal action of drug 
traffickers whose interests were being seriously affected and 
were by no means imputable to the mexican government 
we categorically deny statements lacking of any evidence 
that top mexican officials are involved in drug trafficking and 
that corrupion goes to the highest level of the mexican 
government the embassy spokesman said 
he took exception to a statement by brian ross an nbc reporter 
who appeared on the program quoting us authorities as saying 
that mexico is just like panama in that drug corruption is deep 
and pervasive and that almost in every part of the country there 
is a local noriega a comandante a general a governor getting 
rich by dealing with colombian cartel drug bosses to bring cocaine 
to the us through mexico 
treveino said this assertion is not only irresponsible and 
malign but it also deeply hurts the mexican people and 
institutions that are courageously fighting drugs every day 
siegel said based on brians long experience and active 
coverage of this area obviously we stand by his report

the 10nation communist trading bloc 
comecon agreed on wednesday that the system was outdated and needed 
a complete overhaul 
but soviets and the more radical eastern europeans remained 
split at the end of the twoday comecon summit over how far and how 
fast reforms should go 
delegates apparently compromised on a soviet proposal tuesday 
that all comecon trade by 1991 should be done at world market 
prices and in hard currency 
the eastern europeans long dependent on soviet fuel and energy 
supplies claimed such a fast liberalization would be disastrous 
for their economies already strapped for hard currency 
the delegations said in a final statement that their 45th 
session underlined the necessity for decisive renovation of the 
whole system of mutual cooperation within the council for mutual 
economic assistance as comecon is formally known 
the statement also called for radical restructuring of the 
activities of the council a reexamination of its functions and 
aims and a new statute suitable to current and longterm 
requirements of member nations 
a 40year period is coming to an end bulgarian premier 
georgi atanassov said at the closing session this meeting marks 
a real new start with new rules of the game 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov who held separate talks with 
several new eastern european prime ministers while in sofia told 
reporters moscow was satisfied with the outcome 
the soviet union is happy with the meeting because it means 
comecon has a future he said 
officials indicated however that most comecon trade in the 
future would be on a bilateral basis diminishing soviet dominance 
as eastern europeans abandon centralized fiveyear plans that were 
the bulwark of four decades of stalinist economic management 
a gradual switch to world market prices on a hard currency basis 
will take place within the bloc which cut itself off from most 
other global commerce since its founding in 1949 
delegates agreed to set up a commission to discuss the changes 
and work out in the shortest possible time drafts for new basic 
documents of comecon the statement said 
hungarys deputy premier peter medgyessy told the associated 
press details will be decided by a workin commission that will 
report to comecons moscowbased headquarters and then to the 
blocs next summit in budapest 
a bulgarian official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he thought it would take three to five years to move from current 
trading practices based on barter and artificial currency exhange 
rates 
we went for a softlanding scenario he said indicating the 
soviets agreed to phase in the transition 
but the lack of details in the statement reflected apparent 
discord among members over when and how reforms should be put into 
effect 
delegates from more reformminded members such as 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland were clearly pushing for 
swifter action wednesday 
it doesnt take an einstein to figure out whats wrong with 
comecon said vaclav klaus czechoslovakias outspoken finance 
minister and an advocate of freemarket policies 
we dont want to pay for new commissions to make more nice 
blueprints we want to go ahead by trial and error if 
necessary 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland said later i will 
be satisfied if radical reforms come into effect adding that 
depended on each countrys success with internal reforms and 
overall eastwest integration in europe 
a czechoslovak official who also demanded anonymity said 
pragues suggestion was rebuffed that an extraordinary plenary 
meeting take place as early as march to discuss commission findings 
he said a summit before june was sought to try to avoid chaos in 
the bloc with poles czechs and hungarians possibly trading 
bilaterally in hard currencies while other members still used fixed 
rates 
warsaw and prague have already said they will begin trading in 
hard currencies and will link their own currencies in a direct 
rate bypassing the ruble comecons nonconvertible accounting 
unit 
comecon finance ministers will meet next tuesday through 
thursday in prague for further discussion klaus said 
he said he saw a future comecon as a loose umbrella 
organization for trade agreements that could be signed by a 
few some or all members 
hungary has already broken with one comecon key practice which 
assigned production of certain goods to individual countries by 
signing an agreement with japans suzuki co to manufacture cars 
for sale at home and abroad 
in comecon previously only east germany romania the soviet 
union and czechoslovakia were allowed to build cars 
the organization includes the soviet union poland romania 
hungary bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany vietnam mongolia 
and cuba

a woman serving a life sentence for 
killing a man is seeking a new trial claiming her abusive husband 
forced her to admit to a crime he committed 
ann mcmaugh 33 and her husband bernard 43 are serving life 
sentences for the 1980 shooting death of gregory j dube in nearby 
smithfield 
mrs mcmaugh had said she shot dube as she tried to throw her 
husbands pistol into the back seat of their car while her husband 
and dube were fighting 
but now she says she had nothing to do with the shooting and is 
seeking a new trial on the murder charge 
at a hearing monday a psychologist said mrs mcmaughs claim is 
possible because some abused women feel they have no chance of 
reversing their lot in life 
mrs mcmaugh suffered from battered womens symdrome at the time 
she said she was forced to lie about a slaying her husband 
committed testified angela brown an expert in domestic violence 
the hearing resumes jan 17 
ms brown who wrote when battered women kill said she 
interviewed mrs mcmaugh for 21 hours from december 1987 through 
august 
ms brown said mrs mcmaugh told her mcmaugh often placed a gun 
between them while they slept in their nearby central falls home 
and that her husband often choked her punched her flung her 
around by her hair and forced her to have sex with others 
within minutes of the shooting a policeman stopped the 
mcmaughs car and was told by mcmaugh youre looking for me i 
just shot someone the policeman said he saw two guns on the 
console with the barrels facing mrs mcmaugh who was hysterical 
in the passenger seat 
ms brown testified that after the shooting mcmaugh began 
rehearsing the incident with his wife and forced her to agree 
with his version of the events what was his version 
mcmaugh was indicted in the killing but two years later mrs 
mcmaugh came forward and said she accidently killed dube they both 
stood trial and were convicted of murder 
during the trial two witnesses said mcmaugh fired the fatal 
shot from the drivers seat and forensic experts said the shot was 
fired about 12 inches from dubes head 
richard gelles a dean at the university of rhode island who has 
written books on family violence and child abuse said its 
pretty likely the scenario described mrs mcmaugh and ms brown 
is true gelles is not involved in the case 
thirteen percent of battered women feel things are completely 
hopeless its perfectly reasonable that they would do anything 
their batterer told them to do gelles said if he told them 
the sky was green they would doubt their own senses

justice department officials are concerned 
over the prospect of miamis flamboyant us attorney heading the 
prosecution team at manuel noriegas drug trial sources said 
wednesday 
us attorney dexter lehtinen who has not tried a case in a 
decade has said through spokeswoman diane cossin that he plans to 
be the lead prosecutor of the deposed panamanian dictator 
known for his temper and theatrics which included using a 
plastic ak47 rifle as a prop during a pep talk on the drug war 
lehtinen has appeared at court proceedings in the case since 
noriega was brought to miami 
but justice department spokesman david runkel said thursday that 
no decision has been made on the makeup of the prosecution team 
there will be discussions between people here and mr lehtinen 
and his staff he said 
normally the justice department is loathe to tell a us 
attorney who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the 
senate how to conduct a case under his jurisdiction 
but lehtinen is a courtappointed acting us attorney whose 
appointment to a full fouryear term is now under review at the 
white house 
an administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the justice department is concerned that lehtinen would not be 
able to both run a large us attorneys office and personally 
conduct a complex criminal case expected to run more than a year 
attorney general dick thornburgh may ask lehtinen to choose 
between being us attorney and heading the noriega trial team 
said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
assistant us attorney myles malman who has also represented 
the government in the case is the likely head of the trial team 
said the source 
lehtinens reputation for having a temper is known to 
thornburghs advisers said another source who also spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
in response to questions about lehtinens role in the case 
cossin said 
we do not comment on rank speculation i can assure you that 
the prosecution team has not been announced what has happened is 
that both mr lehtinen and mr malman have appeared numerous times 
on behalf of the government in the case 
the statement contrasted with her previous assertions that 
lehtinen would be the lead prosecutor in the case 
lehtinen whose wife ileana roslehtinen was recently elected 
to the house seat left vacant by the death of rep claude pepper 
dfla is politically well connected with the bush family 
both bush and jeb bush the presidents son campaigned for ms 
roslehtinen during her successful bid to win peppers seat in a 
special election 
lehtinen 43 is known among justice department officials and 
miami lawyers for his temper and flamboyant behavior 
he once appeared at a staff meeting waving a plastic ak47 rifle 
to demonstate his commitment to the war on drugs according to 
published reports confirmed by a former senior prosecutor in the 
office 
many career prosecutors have been alienated by the 
militarystyle chain of command that lehtinen imposed on the 
office former prosecutors say 
essentially he treats everybody like infantry says one 
former prosecutor who now practices law in miami theyre just 
some very talented people treated like infantry 
last summer lehtinen was roundly rebuked by a federal judge for 
trying to prosecute an art collector on charges of violating the 
1963 trading with the enemy act for selling the work of cuban 
artists 
i find it somewhat unusual that the us attorney has 
announced publicly hes not going to prosecute less than five 
kilograms of cocaine and then expends his resources going after 
paintings said us district judge kenneth ryskamp who 
dismissed the charges and ordered the return of 219 seized 
paintings 
lehtinen has also feuded with richard d gregorie the former 
assistant us attorney who obtained the noriega indictment in 1988 
lehtinen has refused gregories offer of help on the case which 
former prosecutors say is an imprudent move 
the insight and advice of the prosecutor who developed witnesses 
and presented the evidence to the grand jury is invaluable in a 
complex criminal case say former prosecutors 
its not that you cant do without the former prosecutor its 
just not wise said one former prosecutor its like taking the 
bar examination without having the review course you could do it 
its not smart

south korean president roh taewoo 
said wednesday he is ready to meet with his north korean 
counterpart kim il sung to discuss free travel between the two 
koreas 
gone are the days when north korea was our rival roh said 
at a new years news conference televised live nationwide 
he made the remarks in response to a proposal by kim in his new 
years address that free travel be allowed across the heavily 
fortified korean border on the condition that south korea destroy a 
concrete wall on its side of the demilitarized zone which 
separates the two countries 
i welcome the proposal of the top north korean leader for 
free travel and total opening between the south and the north even 
though hardtounderstand preconditions were attached to it roh 
said 
south korean officials had said kims reference to the alleged 
concrete wall in the south was merely propaganda aimed at 
giving the false impression that there is a barrier like the berlin 
wall on the korean peninsula 
there simply is no such wall in the south the south korean 
defense ministry said in a statement 
roh said wednesday he wants to meet kim to discuss free travel 
and other tensioneasing measures on the peninsula which was 
divided into the capitalist south and the communist north in 1945 
the two koreas fought a threeyear war in the early 1950s 
i reaffirm my conviction that a southnorth summit should be 
held as quickly as possible to that end roh said i once again 
urge north korea to positively respond to this 
rohs previous calls for a southnorth summit have gone unheeded 
he said his country hopes to conclude a travel and communication 
agreement with the north 
roh praising recent sweeping reform in east europe said he 
hoped similar changes would happen on the korean peninsula he 
noted that no mail telephone calls or visits are allowed between 
the two koreas 
if it takes time for the two parts of korea to agree to free 
travel and full opening then exchanges of corredpondence and 
telephone calls and free home visits by dispersed relatives should 
be implemented he said 
a proposed family exchange the second since the division of the 
korean peninsula four decades ago fell apart last month after 
north korea insisted on staging a revolutionary opera live on south 
korean television 
the two koreas have held talks on and off since the early 1970s 
but have made little progress on personnel parliamentary and 
cultural exchanges each side tends to distrust the others 
proposals 
the korean border is one of the most heavily fortified in the 
world guarded by about 15 million troops on both sides the two 
koreas technically are still at war because no peace treaty was 
signed 
unification minister lee hongkoo said in an interview wednesday 
with the staterun broadcasting network kbs that south korea 
would move its troops down from the border if north korea took 
similar measures 
during the nearly threehour news conference roh also said 
south korea and the united states have decided to scale back this 
years joint team spirit military exercises to help ease 
tension on the peninsula 
us and south korean officials announced wednesday this years 
exercises an annual event since 1976 will be held for two weeks 
starting march 14 in various parts of south korea 
us military spokesman bill fullerton said this years 
exercises would involve fewer troops and weapons but did not 
say the extent of the scaleback last years exercises involved 
200000 soldiers from both sides 
despite rohs assurances that the scaleback was intended to 
promote interkorea dialogue and ease tension it was unclear 
whether north korea would welcome it in past years the north 
boycotted all talks with south korea to protest the military 
maneuvers

the bush administration objects to what it 
sees as interference with its nicaraguan electoral assistance but 
has no plans to use a panama precedent and invade nicaragua the 
white house said wednesday 
part of president bushs justification for the dec 20 invasion 
of panama was the us contention that elections there last may 
were stolen by nowdeposed ruler manuel antonio noriega us 
troops installed president guillermo endara who independent 
observers had said was the winner of that election 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said wednesday that there 
are no plans to invade nicaragua despite a suggestion by senate 
minority leader bob dole that managua should look carefully at what 
happened in panama 
nicaragua has elections scheduled for feb 25 bush 
administration officials have been critical of the preparations 
accusing the sandinista government of harassing and stacking the 
election deck against the opposition 
in addition popadiuk said it was troublesome that some of 
the 9 million the united states has sent to assist the nicaraguan 
opposition has been held up in banking bureaucracy and red tape 
dole said last week that nicaraguan president daniel ortega and 
cuban president fidel castro perhaps would get the message that 
people will only be oppressed for so long whether its in eastern 
europe or central america or wherever 
i think ortega will understand now that its probably in his 
interest to have free and fair elections in february dole said 
asked about doles comments popadiuk said there is an 
election process under way we expect free and fair elections to 
take place 
however he added weve noticed that the nicaraguans have 
been harassing the opposition to a great extent all of which is 
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly 
this is something that troubles us 
bush has stated that the circumstances of nicaragua are much 
different from panama where noriega was wanted on a us drug 
trafficking indictment and where the united states had substantial 
panama canalrelated interests 
regarding impediments to the flow of the us electoral aid 
state department officials said wednesday there were indications 
the obstacles were being removed and the money would be received 
by the civic election monitoring group ipce 
later however another official said although nicaraguan vice 
president sergio ramirez promised to eliminate the problems ipce 
officials were told wednesday they still were not properly 
registered in nicaragua and it would take six months to file the 
paperwork 
the 15 million designated by the united states for ipce the 
letters represent a spanish acronym had been held up since early 
december one source said 
further delay in releasing the money will be seen as a 
deliberate roadblock by managua rather than just red tape said 
one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the political opposition party uno for national opposition 
union when unable to have its funds wired to the central bank 
ultimately began purchasing vehicles and materials it needed and 
arranging for the vendors to be paid from foreign banks said the 
official 
bush telephoned unos presidential candidate violeta chamorro on 
wednesday to inquire about her health and discuss the election 
popadiuk said she is being treated in houston for a knee ailment 
he said 
congress approved the 9 million in electoral aid to be 
administered through the quasigovernmental national endowment for 
democracy ipce is to spend its 15 million for such activities as 
supporting poll watchers and checking voter registration lists 
uno was to receive 18 million for such political activity as 
voter registration and organization under nicaraguan election law 
50 percent of any foreign contribution to the election process 
would must go to the countrys supreme electoral council thereby 
also benefiting the government 
the rest of the funds were designated for other observer groups 
and to administrative and auditing costs including those of the 
national endowment and the state departments agency for 
international development

the month gen manuel antonio noriega 
was indicted on us drug trafficking charges he received an 
outpouring of support from around the world according to documents 
recently uncovered 
political maverick lyndon larouche was one of noreigas 
wellwishers apologizing for the actions of the us government 
a person who called himself a real american said he was glad 
there was someone like noriega unafraid to fight the communist 
buildup in nicaragua 
and an international virgin talked of bringing paradise down 
to earth 
those were a few of the congratulatory telexes noriega received 
in february 1988 shortly after he was indicted on drug smuggling 
and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury in florida 
according to copies of the telexes obtained by the associated 
press the former dictator had backing from his diplomats his 
defense forces and many foreigners and organizations 
i extend to you my apologies for what the government of the 
united states is doing to the republic of panama wrote larouche 
in a telex dated feb 28 1988 larouche was then running for 
president as a democrat 
i reiterate to you what i have stated publicly that the 
reagan administration current policies towards panama are 
absolutely an offense to your nation and all of latin america 
said larouche 
larouche was convicted on dec 16 1988 of conspiracy to commit 
mail fraud involving more than 30 million in defaulted loans 11 
counts of actual mail fraud involving 294000 and conspiring to 
defraud the internal revenue service he is serving a 15year 
prison term 
his telex was one of dozens bound under the title cables and 
telexes received feb 1988 
one sent feb 29 was signed by a real american from council 
bluffs iowa 
our selfserving congress hasnt the guts to prevent the 
communist buildup in nicaragua so it is left to individuals like 
yourself thats what they are mad about it said 
noriega was indicted on feb 4 1988 he has claimed the united 
states began a campaign against him after he refused to help 
usfunded contra guerrillas fight nicaraguas sandinista 
government which is leftist but denies it is communist 
thenpanamanian president eric delvalle tried to dismiss noriega 
as commander of the armed forces but noriega outmaneuvered 
delvalle and it was the president himself who was out of a job 
the outcome earned noriega plenty of cheers 
a swedish antidrug organization based in stockholm telexed 
noriega and offered him congratulations we stand behind you and 
the real fight against drugs 
a telex dated feb 26 and signed by an american citizen and 
patriot in stockholm saidyou are right and they are wrong 
indict elliot abrams then in charge of latin american affairs at 
the state department escalate the fight against injustice 
there were only a handful of critical messages noriegas days 
are numbered warned one unsigned telex dated feb 29 
the inter american press association and the parisbased 
international federation of newspaper publishers sent telexes 
strongly protesting the closure of dailies critical of noriega 
but mostly noriega had support 
my general as long as there is a uniform and a weapon you 
have in this citizen a soldier ready to fight wrote one civilian 
one of noriegas captains vowed general we are united with 
you not one step back 
there were also many civilians from latin american countries 
expressing solidarity wrote one honduran dont let panama be 
another grenada a reference to the 1983 us invasion of the 
caribbean island 
noriega also got a small portion of unsolicited advice one 
person signing off as the international virgin said 
what is the meaning of life answer to bring down the 
paradise to earth

investigators and government 
officials from five countries conferred in secret wednesday to 
assess progress in the hunt for the bombers of pan am flight 103 
but the officials refused any comment following the sevenhour 
meeting in lockerbie the small scottish town devastated by the 
crash of the airliner a year ago 
the dec 21 1988 bombing killed all 259 people on board the 
jetliner flying from london to new york as well as 11 people on 
the ground 
wednesdays meeting was the fifth in a series attended by 
investigators from the united states britain west germany sweden 
and malta 
at the police incident center in lockerbie set up to control 
the bombing investigation a police officer said no statement 
has been issued and i do not anticipate that any will be made 
security was tight at the hotel where the conference took place 
with police and dogs posted at the grounds and more police inside 
the building 
observers speculated that the investigators were discussing 
possible legal moves against a palestinian mohammed abu talb 35 
who was jailed for life in sweden last month for bombings in 
northern europe in 1985 
abu talb was discovered to have visited malta about the time the 
bomb may have been prepared and the weapon was reportedly wrapped 
in clothing from malta 
talbs swedish attorney said at the time of the trial that his 
client denied involvement in the flight 103 bombing and said his 
trip to malta was an unrelated business visit 
among the 30 people taking part in the conference were 
representatives of lord fraser the lord advocate who as 
scotlands chief law officer would be in charge of any prosecution 
previous meetings took place in lockerbie washington london 
and meckenheim west germany flight 103 originated in frankfurt 
changing planes at londons heathrow airport 
in a related development british transport secretary cecil 
parkinson told the house of commons in london wednesday that there 
had been 460 hoax bomb warnings to british airports and airlines 
last year 
it is a sad reflection on the sick minds of these people that 
the number has increased substantially since lockerbie parkinson 
said 
he said the british side of the investigation has so far cost 
116 million and that police in dumfries and galloway the region 
where the plane was blown up have taken more than 14000 
statements and more than 35000 photographs and recorded about 
16000 items of property in the debris 
parkinson said measures had been taken since the bombing to 
tighten security at airports and he said he would be in washington 
thursday for further talks on security with us transportation 
secretary samuel skinner 
parkinson was speaking during a debate on the aviation and 
maritime security bill to strengthen safeguards against terrorism 
the bill would mean stronger checks of all people working in 
aircraft and airports including firms doing maintenance cleaning 
and catering

defense secretary dick cheney has ordered top 
pentagon officials to review strategy and some major weapons 
programs in light of expected tight budgets and liberalization in 
eastern europe defense department sources said wednesday 
paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy will 
direct the reassessment of overall strategy while john betti 
undersecretary for acquisition has been asked to review the 
pentagons most expensive aircraft projects the sources said 
in part its because of whats happening in eastern europe 
said one pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified by name 
the official said that while such studies are usually under way 
all the time somewhere in the pentagon the rush of events in 
eastern europe and the prospect of declines in defense budgets 
added urgency to cheneys request 
cheney should receive reports by march the official said 
the recommendations will guide early deliberations for budgets 
in the 1992 fiscal year and after 
spending recommendations in the budget that president bush will 
present to congress later this month are for the 1991 fiscal year 
which begins oct 1 they are expected to include some weapons 
cutbacks and result in a 2 percent drop in pentagon spending after 
accounting for inflation 
but because of the balky and complex pentagon budgetbuilding 
process the 1991 budget is not expected to reflect a major 
adjustment in the us military response to the sweeping changes in 
the soviet union and europe the source said 
much of the nations military planning and spending are focused 
on fighting a war with allies in europe against the soviet union 
and its allies and have been ever since nato was formed in 1949 
a military source who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said cheneys memorandum dated middecember says the review 
should begin from basic principles 
the source said the memo does not specifically mention which 
aircraft are to be studied but that it is clear the secretary is 
interested reviewing requirements for the top four billiondollar 
programs the b2 stealth bomber the c17 transport plane as 
well as the air force and navy advanced fighter jets still under 
development 
the memo doesnt give a list of airplanes but its obvious 
that he wants a look at future aircraft requirements said 
the military source said 
he added that the memo puts into writing what a lot of people 
have been thinking about in any case take a possible lessened 
threat and give me your judgment of our aircraft needs 
the source said that the memo does not suggest the possible 
cancellation of any programs but asks for a serious look at our 
defense structure in the outyears its clear well still need 
a longrange bomber fighters and transport planes but the 
questions are what exactly do you need and how many

a jury began deliberating wednesday in the 
federal court trial of 20 men accused of smuggling or conspiring to 
smuggle nearly 15 million pounds of marijuana into the united 
states 
with a quick verdict unlikely in the 2monthold trial us 
district judge john shaw ordered overnight accommodations for the 
jurors and said they would deliberate through the weekend if 
necessary 
one question they must weigh is whether the evidence pointed to 
a single conspiracy or multiple unrelated conspiracies 
prosecutors argued tuesday that all 20 defendants played a 
crucial role in a smuggling operation from 1982 to 1984 
defense attorneys portrayed a disjointed drug ring that smuggled 
varying amounts of marijuana in separate unconnected operations 
the indictment alleges 187 people contributed to an overall 
conspiracy that smuggled 48000 pounds of marijuana into north 
carolina in november 1982 and 280000 pounds into louisiana in june 
1983 
in addition the alleged conspiracy planned to smuggle in 
another 1 million pounds in 1984 but that operation was scrapped 
after the arrest of stephen michael kalish the admitted ringleader 
and the prosecutions chief witness 
what we have here is one single conspiracy consisting of four 
ventures one criminal enterprise by one criminal organization 
assistant us attorney howard cobb parker said each of these 
ventures were part of a big picture and when these defendants 
joined the organization they became a part of the big picture 
defense attorney don wolff reminded jurors that kalish testified 
that each operation had its own starting date and its own ending 
date and none overlapped 
another trial with about as many defendants is scheduled for 
feb 12 more than 30 of the original defendants pleaded guilty 
and cases of others were severed for separate trial

israel will cut the size of its army and reduce 
the number of days reservists must serve next year to cover the 
costs of handling the palestinian uprising a defense ministry 
official said wednesday 
also wednesday defense minister yitzhak rabin warned that 
israel may lose an opportunity for peace by failing to show 
flexibility in middle east negotiations 
in the occupied gaza strip israeli soldiers shot and wounded 
nine palestinians during stonethrowing protests arab reports 
said the army said it was checking the reports 
the defense ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity declined to say by how much israels standing army would 
be reduced but he said the goal was to trim 700000 days from 
total reserve duty 
the jaffee center for strategic studies estimates the size of 
israels army at 130000 regular soldiers and 310000 reservists 
the total force is 540000 when air force and navy personnel are 
included 
cutbacks also will affect the air force brig gen giora rom 
the air force deputy commander told israel radio he said the 
cutbacks could affect combat readiness because there was less money 
to fund practice flying hours 
the ministry official said the cutbacks were necessary because 
the defense ministry is not being fully compensated for the costs 
of dealing with the uprising 
thousands of soldiers and paramilitary troops have been posted 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip since december 1987 when 
the palestinian rebellion began 
according to government figures the israeli army will have 
spent about 470 million on the uprising by the time the fiscal 
year ends march 30 the army estimates the 199091 fiscal year 
costs will be 225 million 
no doubt there will be very significant cuts in nonuprising 
activities the ministry official said adding discussions were 
still under way on exactly where cutbacks would be made 
according to the 199091 budget approved by the israeli cabinet 
on dec 26 defense spending in the fiscal year beginning april 1 
will be 522 billion about the same as the current years total 
at a speech in jerusalem wednesday rabin warned that current 
israeli policy was leading to a stalemate 
whenever one or the two superpowers will realize that the gap 
between the positions of the parties to the conflict is too 
wide they tell the two parties go to hell rabin said 
he spoke shortly before a planned trip to the united states 
where he is to hold talks with secretary of state james a baker 
iii over us efforts to start an israelipalestinian dialogue 
israeli leaders failed to agree wednesday on a response to a 
letter from baker that tried to reassure israel it would not have 
to negotiate with the plo which israel views as a terrorist 
organization 
some government officials complained the assurances were not 
satisfactory and israels four top leaders decided wednesday to 
send a message to baker asking for further clarifications israel 
radio and tv said 
baker has been trying to get agreement from israel and egypt on 
israelipalestinian talks in advance of a meeting with the two 
countries foreign ministers 
israel signaled wednesday it may be ready to compromise by 
agreeing to talk to a palestinian delegation that includes two 
palestinians who were once deported by israel 
israel has been reluctant to accept deportees as negotiators for 
fear that would leave the door open for palestine liberation 
organization involvement 
but some officials said they believed prime minister yitzhak 
shamir head of the hardline likud bloc would bend on the 
question of palestinian negotiators in order to keep alive his plan 
for a peace settlement a plan on which he has staked much 
prestige 
shamirs plan ratified by the israeli cabinet may 14 envisages 
holding elections in the west bank and gaza strip as part of an 
interim peace settlement of selfrule for palestinians 
also wednesday police discovered the body of an arab man ayman 
abdul kammun in mughazi refugee camp in gaza arab reports said 
kammum was reportedly beaten and stabbed to death by fellow 
palestinians on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities 
his death raised to 168 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs on suspicion of assisting israel at least 646 arabs 
have been killed by israeli gunfire in the 25month uprising in the 
occupied territories and 43 israelis have died in the violence

east germanys coalition government was 
threatened with collapse wednesday after three of its noncommunist 
partners threatened to quit the cabinet over dissatisfaction with 
the communist leadership 
it was the most serious in a series of recent setbacks for 
communist premier hans modrow who reportedly was considering a 
nationwide referendum in hopes of boosting his standing before 
elections may 6 
communist party chief gregor gysi was quoted as saying he thinks 
a coalition breakup is possible before the voting in may 
with the current pace of changes in the german democratic 
republic east germany nothing can be excluded in this area 
the respected sueddeutsche zeitung of munich quoted gysi as saying 
tensions in the coalition and stalled talks with the opposition as 
made a breakup possible he said 
the interview was to appear in thursdays edition of the 
newspaper and was sent in advance to other news media 
sources close to wolfgang berghofer deputy chairman of the 
communist party said berghofer is dissatisfied with modrows 
leadership berghofer who is also mayor of dresden has called on 
modrow to drop his opposition to freemarket elements in east 
germany the sources told the associated press 
the no 2 official in east germanys economics ministry made a 
similar call during a meeting with west german politicians in the 
bavarian village of irsee 
klauschristian fischer the state secretary in the economics 
ministry said greater freemarket elements are the only way to 
stop the migration of east germans to the west 
modrow remains committed to maintaining east germany as a 
socialist alternative to capitalist west germany which continues 
to draw thousands of east germans figures released wednesday said 
nearly 1700 east germans emigrate to west germany each day 
east germany has undergone major changes including the opening 
of its borders since the ouster of hardline communist leader 
erich honecker on oct 18 but many of the new leaders promises 
have not been transformed into law 
leading the list is the proposed law that will actually 
authorize the may 6 elections planned as the countrys first free 
voting 
the christian democrats and the liberal democrats two of the 
current coalition partners said they will walk out if the new law 
fails to meet their demands that opposition parties are guaranteed 
equal opportunity in the campaign 
equal opportunity refers to equal access to news media and 
other means of reaching voters 
the ministers of the liberal democratic party are not hostages 
of the communistled government the party said in a statement 
together the christian democrats and liberal democrats have 
seven seats in the 28member cabinet the national democrats 
another noncommunist party with two seats on wednesday also 
threatened to desert modrow 
all three parties cited growing dissatisfaction with modrows 
leadership as reasons for the threatened pullout 
the christian democrats and national democrats also cited 
modrows insistence on reviving a secret police apparatus that was 
dissolved after the fall prodemocracy movement 
if the communists received a majority of public support in a 
referendum it would bolster their position going into the election 
in may 
modrow was due to give a speech thursday in parliament which 
would have to approve plans to hold a referendum 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl said he was making 
opposition approval of any election law a condition of further work 
with the current leadership of east germany 
that could be difficult as the communistdrafted election law 
will bar all forms of campaign aid from other countries a slap in 
the face to west germans hoping to help the opposition 
kohl told reporters further talks with modrow are needed in 
part to stop the flood of east germans into his country 
kohl also said he expects to meet soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev this year the two men last met in june in bonn 
new signs of east germanys economic problems emerged wednesday 
the official communist party daily neues deutschland said recent 
warning strikes by dissatisfied industrial workers were partly 
justified by a slow reaction of authorities to their grievances 
the stoppages were called to protest special severance payments 
to state security agents dismissed in the governments dissolution 
of the ministry they worked for 
neues deutschland said the state can continue to guarantee 
social security only if industrial workers keep the economy 
running by staying on the job

in burkina faso in 1987 diakpo said he was living in ivory coast 
when his brotherinlaw whom he did not identify urged diakpo to 
join him for business reasons in the capital where they were given 
bus tickets to burkina fasos capital 
from burkina faso diakpo said they were taken to a camp near 
tripoli libya where libyan authorities gave them sophisticated 
military training 
he said they also received training at a farm in ivory coast

president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet 
leaders on wednesday condemned and voided resolutions passed by 
legislatures in armenia and azerbaijan making conflicting claims 
over the nagornokarabakh territory 
the presidium of the supreme soviet legislature headed by 
gorbachev branded as unconstitutional resolutions adopted by the 
armenian legislature that called for reuniting the republic with 
nagornokarabakh tass reported 
most of nagornokarabakhs people are armenian but it has been 
under azerbaijans control since 1923 the row over who should 
control it led to strikes and violence in february 1988 more than 
200 people have been killed 
it has proved to be the most stubborn of all the ethnic 
conflicts that have surfaced under gorbachev and has even grown 
worse despite attempts at mediation by gorbachev himself and the 
national legislature 
according to tass the official news agency the presidium said 
armenia cannot take control of nagornokarabakh without 
azerbaijans consent it said the armenian legislatures 
resolution passed dec 1 had made the situation worse in 
nagornokarabakh 
bombings sniper fire and hostagetaking reportedly are 
continuing in the territory 
the soviet leadership said another armenian resolution adopted 
tuesday and incorporating an economic and social development plan 
for nagornokarabakh into that of the armenian republic infringes 
on azerbaijans sovereignty the presidium voided the resolution 
azerbaijanis have been holding mass rallies to protest the 
armenian legislatures action and have resumed a railroad blockade 
of armenia 
the presidium also voided an action by azerbaijans legislative 
leaders who adopted a decree dec 4 entitled on measures to 
normalize the situation in the nagornokarabakh autonomous region 
of the azerbaijani soviet socialist republic 
the presidium declared the measure unconstitutional no 
immediate word emerged on the contents of the measure and it was 
not clear what the presidium objected to 
the national legislature in moscow in november disbanded a 
commission that had imposed direct kremlin rule on the hilly region 
of about 160000 people it said the area is part of azerbaijan and 
would be controlled by local government bodies under supervision of 
a national commission 
irans islamic republic news agency meanwhile reported 
wednesday that six soviet moslems swam across the aras river to 
iran over the weekend despite subfreezing temperatures and later 
swam back to the soviet union 
recent protests in soviet azerbaijan have demanded freer travel 
between the soviet union and iran 
irna monitored in cyprus said the six used inflated rubber 
tubes on tuesday when they swam back to the northern soviet bank 
of the river which forms part of the border 
the staterun soviet newspaper izvestia said unrest which began 
dec 31 flared monday when soviet azerbaijanis gathered at the 
border and called through loudspeakers for their iranian neighbors 
to unify their regions 
the azerbaijanis are an ethnic group who like most iranians 
are largely shiite moslems 
in ankara azerbaijan and turkey agreed on wednesday to 
establish joint ventures in investment and marketing

levitsky said he will recommend that president bush certify 
panama as a nation committed to fighting drug traffic 
certification would enable panama to qualify for special 
consideration dealing with trade and assistance 
washington sent more than a dozen drug enforcement adminstration 
agents and a like number of fbi agents here shortly after the dec 
20 us invasion 
they are investigating the operations of ousted dictator manuel 
antonio noriega now imprisoned in miami awaiting trial on drug 
charges 
panamanian bankers insist drug money laundering was never a big 
problem here and that their controls kept it to a minimum 
panamas international banking center with more than 101 banks 
is patterned after that of switzerland and provides coded accounts 
and protects confidentiality 
anything we do to affect confidentiality of the system would 
destroy the banking center lasso said 
but levitsky said money laundering was an important aspect of 
drug trafficking through panama under noriega and indicated the 
united states wants panama to make changes in the system 
us experts have said drug traffickers began staying clear of 
panama when the us clampdown on noriega began and that in any 
case plenty of alternative places exist to launder money 
vice president guillermo ford said panama had its own controls 
to prevent money laundering 
panamanian bankers say claims of money laundering here were 
exaggerated and one banks license was lifted five years ago 
another bank agreed to pay a 5 million fine following us 
charges it took part in money laundering by accepting large 
transfers from a us bank 
nothing happened to the us bank one panamanian banker said 
adding that the case indicated us authorities were not very 
serious about the crime 
lasso said we are willing to cooperate with authorities we 
want to avoid being used by the drug dealers but we want to 
protect our clients too 
he said indications emerged that us officials want access to 
information on suspicion only if they show us some evidence we 
always cooperate 
panamanian banks limit to 50000 the amount of cash that an 
individual may deposit at one time 
even so each case is studied invididually lasso said we 
have other controls of the flow of cash to prevent money 
laundering

police set up roadblocks around lima on 
wednesday and detained 15000 people in a search for the killers of 
former defense minister enrique lopez the most prominent victim of 
perus 10yearold guerrilla war 
flags flew at halfstaff and the government declared a national 
day of mourning in honor of lopez who was buried wednesday at a 
lima cemetery 
lopez was shot tuesday as he was parking his car near a shopping 
center in a lima suburb doctors said he suffered at least 10 
bullet wounds and police blamed maoist guerrillas of the shining 
path rebel group 
early wednesday the guerrillas struck again killing nine 
people in tocota about 540 miles southeast of lima 
police in huancayo said shining path insurgents shot to death 
two high school students in that highlands market town 140 miles 
east of lima after dragging them from their homes wednesday 
president alan garcia on tuesday called it unpardonable no 
bodyguards were with lopez when he was shot and some political 
leaders suggested on wednesday that interior minister agustin 
mantilla and defense minister julio velasquez should resign 
a congressional commission issued a statement wednesday saying 
it asked mantilla and velasquez to explain why lopez did not have a 
security escort at the time he was killed 
sen armando villanueva who served as prime minister and 
interior minister under garcia commented id like to point out 
that when in a similar situation two congressmen were killed i 
resigned 
garcia and members of his cabinet attended the funeral as did 
former president fernando belaunde terry under whom lopez served 
as chief of palace security and presidential candidate and 
novelist mario vargas llosa 
police units assisted by six helicopters sealed off highways 
leading from the capital and stopped about 8000 cars in search of 
suspected rebels according to an interior ministry official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said about 15000 people were detained most for not having 
proper documents most will be released in a few days he said 
lopez was army commander under garcia until he was named perus 
first defense minister in october 1987 the year the army navy and 
air force were joined under one department 
lopez resigned in may during a cabinet shakeup brought about in 
part by the guerrilla war villanueva was forced to resign as prime 
minister after being criticized for the countrys economic collapse 
and his inability to stop the growth of guerrilla violence 
as is customary lopez and the rest of the cabinet offered their 
resignations and lopezs departure was friendly he was replaced 
by army gen julio velasquez 
lopez then worked as an executive in a chemical company that has 
its offices in the shopping complex where he was killed 
the assassination was the shining paths first of the year last 
year they were blamed for more than 3000 deaths 
political leaders urged the government to improve security 
measures for public figures 
garcia said tuesday that lopezs assassination means that 
despite the barbarous crimes being committed here the military 
institutions are not yet conscious of the fact that we are in a 
state of war 
on wednesday garcia told reporters the attack showed the 
shining path is losing its fight for popular support and turning to 
terror 
the terrorists already know they are being defeated they are 
having to look for a psychological opportunity to frighten the 
nation garcia said 
writing in the lima newspaper expreso columnist manuel 
dornellas said the shining paths objective is to provoke the 
military into staging a coup 
in this way the shining path would achieve its objective of 
putting itself in the vanguard of a popular rejection of a 
dictatorship 
vargas llosa running in the april 8 presidential elections 
urged the public not to be intimidated and demanded the government 
take necessary precautions to guarantee the safety and integrity of 
the election 
the shining path launched its insurgency in 1980 in the southern 
andean highlands it now operates throughout the highlands and in 
the cocaproducing jungles in the northeast as well as lima and 
other urban centers along the coast 
the government says more than 17500 people have died in the 
violence 
a report by the senate human rights commission said 1989 was the 
bloodiest year yet resulting in more than 3200 deaths most of 
them civilians 
police said shining path guerrillas wednesday killed nine 
people including the mayor and former mayor of tocota the capital 
of huanuhuanu district the victims were shot in the central plaza 
police said

imprisoned black nationalist 
nelson mandela is anxious to be released from prison but it could 
take months a lawyer who visited him wednesday said 
the comment by prominent attorney azhar cachalia after a 
fivehour meeting with mandela contradicted a statement made monday 
by mandelas wife winnie after a visit with her husband i 
dont think we are talking about months she said after noting 
that for the first time her husband had discussed arrangements for 
his release 
the comments also seemed at odds with the impression given by a 
governmentrun radio editorial wednesday that said mandelas 
release was only a matter of time 
mr mandela stressed it is his desire to be released as soon 
as possible he however has no idea when he will be released 
cachalia said it could take a few months 
walter sisulu a colleague from mandelas african national 
congress who was sentenced to life in prison along with him also 
appeared to disagree with mrs mandela 
the only difference now is the wife has an impression that it 
will soon happen sisulu said in an interview with cbstv 
wednesday i still regard it as a mere speculation 
it is illegal to quote mandela directly so his visitors 
paraphrase the remarks they consider significant conflicting 
statements from different sets of visitors have been issued in the 
past 
in recent weeks there has been almost daily speculation in the 
media on mandelas release and president fw de klerk is widely 
expected to make an announcement on mandelas status when he opens 
parliament feb 1 
imprisoned in 1962 mandela is serving a life term for plotting 
a sabotage campaign to undermine the white minority government he 
is regarded by many blacks as the man who should be their president 
sisulu said the government has problems about releasing mandela 
in a vacuum with the anc and other organizations still 
outlawed and a state of emergency in place 
the editorial by radio south africa was interpreted by some 
observers as the strongest signal yet that mandelas freedom is 
imminent 
it has been clear for some months that it is only a matter of 
time before mr mandelas release is announced the radio said 
moreover by identifying himself with the ideals of peaceful 
development he has redefined his position 
for most of mandelas 27 years in prison the government has 
portrayed him and his outlawed guerrilla movement as terrorists and 
communists although mandela said he took up arms only because the 
government refused to talk to blacks about change 
recently the government has described mandela in favorable 
terms in an apparent attempt to prepare the white community for 
his release 
he would be in a position to make an important contribution to 
the creation of the conditions in which blackwhite talks could 
get under way the radio said 
since last year mandela has been meeting with cabinet 
ministers as well as a wide range of antiapartheid activists and 
old friends at his house on the grounds of the victor verster 
prison farm in the winegrowing region north of cape town 
he met dec 13 with de klerk and last july with former 
president pw botha 
de klerk wants to open negotiations on a new constitution with 
black leaders but says the anc must commit itself to peaceful 
solutions before it can participate 
the anc in a statement monday marking its 78th anniversary 
said its guerrilla campaign remained an important part of its 
struggle for black political rights but it also said we are 
committed to seize any real opportunity that might emerge genuinely 
to seek a political agreement for the speedy end of the apartheid 
system 
sisulu said in his television interview which was also 
broadcast in south africa that he expects apartheid to end within 
the decade

the bush administration after repeatedly 
urging farmers to manage risks by buying federal crop insurance 
plans to propose eliminating the program senate minority leader 
bob dole said wednesday 
what this may do is to get congress to focus on it dole 
said during his appearance at the kansas state board of 
agricultures annual meeting 
there are a lot of members of congress who dont want to 
eliminate crop insurance im one i want to get more people to 
participate youve got to make certain you cover their losses 
dole said 
in a speech to the board and at a news conference later dole 
said the proposal appears to be the administrations way of ending 
duplicate payments to farmers from the crop insurance program and 
disaster relief legislation 
i think the administration has decided and i dont know all 
of their reasoning that were going to do one or another said 
the kansas republican senior member of the senate agriculture 
committee 
the 400 million a year federal subsidy for crop insurance 
premiums could be counted as a savings by the administration as it 
attempts to cut 1 billion from the us department of agriculture 
annual budget the senator said 
dole and rep pat roberts rkan acknowledge that even if the 
crop insurance program were finetuned there still would be 
disaster relief bills roberts advocates legislation to standardize 
congress response to crop disasters 
rep dan glickman dkan who serves with roberts on the house 
agriculture committee said talk of eliminating crop insurance is 
being used as a trial balloon to evaluate congressional and public 
reaction to the idea

a federal judge wednesday refused to reinstate 
a woman into a high school honors club that kicked her out in 1983 
after she became pregnant 
us district judge barron mccune ruled the case was moot 
because there is no longer a national honor society chapter at 
marion center area high school however he rejected arguments that 
the dismissal was discriminatory 
the students lawyer had argued that because a womans sexual 
activities are readily apparent when she becomes pregnant the 
dismissal was discriminatory 
mccune wrote the student was dismissed because of premarital 
sex not because she had a child out of wedlock 
in dismissing her from the club the schools faculty council 
said she failed to uphold requirments of character and leadership 
arlene kerner now 23 was thrown out of the club in november 
1983 during her senior year and two months after the birth of her 
child jessica 
i am dissappointed and we are going to appeal the decision 
mrs kerner said 
in early 1984 mrs kerner sued in federal court here seeking 
reinstatment in the honor society she named the marion center area 
school district which is about 50 miles east of pittsburgh and 15 
school officials and teachers

sen christopher dodd on 
wednesday said the united states will tolerate nothing less than 
full prosecution of the killers of six jesuit priests 
the connecticut democrat also strongly urged the administration 
of president alfredo cristiani and leftist rebels battling the 
government to negotiate an end to the 10yearold civil war 
cristiani a rightist on sunday announced that certain 
elements of the armed forces were responsible for the nov 16 
massacre of six jesuit priests and educators their housekeeper and 
her daughter he did not provide names ranks units or the number 
of people involved 
the army chief said two officers and 45 soldiers of an elite 
infantry battalion have been confined to base on suspicion of 
participation in the slayings 
we commend the government for having proceded as expeditiously 
as they have said dodd who was accompanied at a news conference 
by sen john warner rva 
but he addressed the concerns of those who note that no officer 
has been tried or convicted for any crime of human rights abuse 
since civil war broke out in late 1979 rightist death squads 
sponsored or tolerated by the military killed thousands of 
suspected leftists in the early 1980s 
it is very important to remember weve been there before 
weve seen investigations with a lot of notoriety and then those 
investigations sort of fade and disappear and prosecutions never 
occur he said 
that cannot happen in this case it wont do if you just 
arrest a couple soldiers 
dodd said the successful prosecution of the case could be a 
factor in the next vote on us aid to el salvador in the spring 
dodd is chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee of the 
senate foreign relations committee 
the largescale november offensive by the farabundo marti 
national liberation front demonstrated the rebels were militarily 
stronger than many people thought they were said dodd 
but he said the failure to topple cristiani also demonstrated 
the guerrillas lack of popular support 
that means an opportunity now exists for a negotiated 
settlement our hope is that this opportunity will not be lost 
that the cristiani government and the military will take advantage 
as we hope the fmln will as well to begin seriously to try to 
bring an end to this conflict he said 
the two senators are on a factfinding tour of central america 
warner is to return to the united states on thursday while dodd 
planned a stop in honduras

thousands of lithuanians defied the 
kremlin and cried freedom at a proindependence rally 
wednesday the eve of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
highstakes visit 
banners held by some of the 20000 people who massed on 
cathedral square ranged from one polite welcome to blunt calls for 
gorbachev to go home and take the red army with him 
we didnt join the soviet union you grabbed us read one 
banner referring to the soviet unions absorption of the baltic 
republic in 1940 
gorbachev is scheduled to arrive thursday and meet for three 
days with factory workers collective farmers members of ethnic 
minorities and communist party activists to press for reversal of 
the lithuanian communist partys decision last month to split from 
the national party and support independence for the baltic republic 
as never before in his nearly five years in power the kremlin 
chief will put his personal prestige on the line to cool one of his 
countrys hottest ethnic crises 
although he has granted lithuanians and their neighbors in 
estonia and latvia a large measure of economic and political power 
he has consistently and sharply criticized lithuanian communist 
leaders for pressing for complete independence and convened an 
emergency session of the national party central committee last 
month to discuss the issue 
the stakes for the visit are high if gorbachev fails to bring 
the lithuanians back to the fold communist parties in the 14 other 
republics could feel encouraged to break with moscow 
vytautas landsbergis the leader of sajudis lithuanias popular 
political movement said his countrymen are not trying to hurt 
gorbachevs reforms but are showing other republics how certain 
problems can be solved in a peaceful diplomatic manner 
its not destabilization its destalinization he told a 
news conference referring to attempts to abandon the rigid 
centrally controlled political and economic systems stalin devised 
in the past two years sajudisbacked candidates have defeated 
hardline communists in elections and helped the republic win some 
economic independence from moscow ministries 
landsbergis said the drive for change cannot be stopped 
we hope the soviet government is coming to see the 
inevitability of the changes in eastern europe and that lithuania 
is part of that process he said 
sajudis leaders hope to draw 1 million people to the capital 
vilnius on thursday to show gorbachev the wide support for 
independence 
he is treating the communist party split as a critical setback 
in his reform program the soviet leader sent a crew of toplevel 
national party officials headed by kremlin ideology chief vadim a 
medvedev to lobby party members in all walks of life in preparation 
for his visit 
in a thursdaydated dispatch from vilnius the soviet news 
agency tass said medvedev spoke in vilnius about democratization 
processes in the party and supported those who voiced concern over 
the threat to national accord in the republic and anxiety for the 
fate of the soviet communist party 
the dispatch ended these days are far from simple for the 
republic they are filled with anxiety meditations and concern for 
the future lithuanias population is looking forward to 
gorbachevs arrival and meetings with him 
although activists in lithuania which was absorbed by the 
soviet union along with the other baltic republics of latvia and 
estonia have been approaching the call for independence for 18 
months some say independence is years away even in their most 
favorable scenarios 
gorbachev last visited one of the baltic republics in february 
1987 when he traveled to riga the capital of latvia lithuanian 
activists say he hasnt been in their republic in a decade 
a spokesman for sajudis rimantas kanapienis said medvedev 
personally asked a leader of the group to call off wednesdays 
rally 
but it went ahead under red yellow and green flags of 
independent lithuania and was designed to tell gorbachev it is too 
late to change the course for independence 
lithuania has already decided said one sign 
speakers appealed to independence advocates to stay calm during 
gorbachevs visit we must make our demands peacefully said 
one the demonstrators also used lenins words to make their point 
referring to lenins recognition of lithuania as an independent 
nation in 1920 two decades before stalin forcibly annexed the 
baltics one sign read lenin recognized lithuania stalin took 
away its independence and gorbachev 
one ethnic russian born in vilnius said compromise is necessary 
lithuania must help gorbachev and his reforms in the soviet 
union said the man who identified himself as yura and said he 
has taken advantage of the soviet leaders reforms to build a small 
private business exporting mushrooms 
according to an official schedule obtained by sajudis gorbachev 
will arrive thursday and visit a vilnius electronics factory on 
friday he is to meet with the public in the city of panevyzus on 
saturday he will meet with communist party activists

twenty fingers twenty toes is 40 digits of 
desperation 
the new musical now on view at the wpa theater offbroadway is 
an unpleasant unfunny biography of the hilton sisters reallife 
siamese twins who made it big in vaudeville during the 1920s and 
later appeared in todd brownings classic horror movie freaks 
creators michael dansicker and bob nigro have opted for a campy 
cartoon backstage saga complete with an evil aunt the twins 
mother sold them at birth and a smarmy agent who conspire to 
steal the girls sizable earnings 
during the shows long two acts there is a lot of singing about 
the fact that the twins dont have a mother and that when the girls 
dance they have four left feet 
a frantic tastelessness pervades this show which tries to make 
the sisters into sympathetic characters only to knock them down a 
minute later with some dumb joke about their physical condition 
dansickers music is relentlessly perky monotonous hurdygurdy 
melodies his lyrics are equally cheery if undistinguished the 
book cowritten by dansicker and nigro parades the sisters 
through a series of stage routines on what seems to be the entire 
ohio vaudeville circuit 
every so often the mean aunt and the sneering agent threaten to 
send the girls to johns hopkins in baltimore to be separated if 
that happens one will die 
ann brown and maura hanlon sing sweetly as the sisters stitched 
together in costume designer gregg barnes double outfits but 
roxie lucas so wonderful in last seasons edition of forbidden 
broadway is completely over the top as the villainous aunt 
lucas doesnt just chew the scenery she devours it paul kandel 
as the girls agent keeps up with her bite for bite 
ken prymus gives new meaning to the term split personality 
in what is probably the seasons most impossible role he plays a 
hermaphrodite named bert and bertha who gives the twins the courage 
to ditch their aunt and set out for california and movie stardom 
twenty fingers twenty toes is the second musical dud in a 
row at the wpa the theater inflicted a slasher musical buzzsaw 
berkeley on its audiences earlier in the season both shows have 
been part of the wpas socalled silly series awful would 
be a more appropriate adjective

flaws in the design of an elementary school 
cafeteria wall that collapsed and killed nine children in november 
left it unable to withstand high winds state officials concluded 
wednesday 
students at the east coldenham elementary school near newburgh 
were unaware of severe weather warnings during the storms nov 16 
said a report by the state disaster preparedness commission 
the commission in the first official account of the causes of 
the disaster recommended improved review of new school 
construction plans and better weather warning systems 
nine children lunching in the east coldenham cafeteria were 
killed in a hail of brick concrete and glass when a storm with 
90to 100mph winds slammed into the school fifteen students were 
injured 
the 55by25foot wall built in 1959 was a masonry structure 
surrounded by a series of metalframed windows an engineer hired 
by the state concluded the wall was not designed to withstand winds 
of more than 45 mph although state building codes said it should 
have been designed to take winds of at least 75 mph 
if it wasnt for the windows surrounding the masonry wall the 
wall would likely have tumbled long ago said peter slocum a 
spokesman for both the state health department and the disaster 
commission 
the windows increased the walls capacity to withstand winds up 
to 80 mph 
there were enough standards at the time to provide guidance to 
the professionals for an adequate design of the wall said 
richard tomasetti an engineer hired by the state to investigate 
the collapse the wall unfortunately was not adequately 
designed 
the states office of professional discipline is investigating 
the schools architect john clark of hyde park said thomas sobol 
state education commissioner 
clark was not in his office wednesday afternoon and was not 
available for comment he has repeatedly refused to respond to 
reporters questions since the east coldenham disaster 
howard finkelstein a newburgh lawyer said hes filed a notice 
of claim that he intends to sue clark and the valley central school 
district on behalf of six of the dead children and 13 of the 
injured youngsters he said the report buttresses the families 
case 
this is not an act of god finkelstein said god did not 
build the wall there are human failings that took place for which 
someone is going to be responsible

puppet 
the complaint accusing solis palma of usurping public 
functions and committing crimes against political liberties was 
being investigated cruz said 
he said solis palma now a private citizen in panama asked for 
a guarantee he would not be arrested if he agreed to meet with 
authorities for questioning 
solis palma replaced president eric arturo delvalle after 
delvalle tried to fire noriega in february 1988 and was acting 
president until sept 1 1988 
new us ambassador deane r hinton presented his credentials to 
president guillermo endara on wednesday and said uspanamanian 
relations were perfect following noriegas ouster 
i see no problems now hinton said speaking to reporters in 
spanish after meeting endara we will support and work with the 
democratic government of panama 
john grant mcdonald the new british ambassador also presented 
his credentials but made no statement 
panamanians continued to pick over the remains of the building 
in downtown panama city where noriega had his military 
headquarters toting away everything from furniture to track 
lighting and pornography 
the building heavily damaged by fighting in the invasion will 
be demolished on thursday housing minister raul figueroa said 
foreign minister julio linares said panamanians linked to 
noriega have taken refuge in the embassies of bolivia ecuador 
peru cuba and the vatican all but the bolivian mission are 
surrounded by us troops 
cruz said two of the 12 panamanians who sought refuge in the 
peruvian embassy were suspects in the killing of maj moises 
giroldi who led an unsuccessful coup attempt against noriega on 
oct 3 
he did not identify the two but said the foreign ministry would 
tell peru they are not being persecuted politically and so 
could not be given asylum 
noriegas family is in the cuban embassy linares said panama is 
considering their request for safeconduct to the dominican 
republic but must first decide whether they can be charged with any 
offenses

patrick ryan an irishman sought for 
terroist offenses in britain has been dismissed from his religious 
order in the roman catholic priesthood a priest said 
the rev william hanly head of the irish province of the 
pallottine fathers said ryan was expelled for prolonged unlawful 
absence from the society and for persistent refusal to comply with 
the legitimate instructions of his superiors 
ryan 59 who lives in county tipperary did not surface to 
respond to the announcement in the past he has consistently denied 
any connection with the outlawed irish republican army or with 
guerrilla activities and has denied traveling the world to raise 
cash for the ira 
his cousin tom ryan claimed british diplomatic pressure at 
vatican level had prompted the pallottines decision 
it was more of a political move than a canonical one he 
said 
the catholic press office in dublin said the dismissal meant 
that ryan was effectively suspended from his priestly duties and 
could not say mass preach or administer the sacraments the ban 
can only be lifted if ryan finds a bishop willing to receive him 
into his diocese the office added 
the office said the decision was taken in rome on nov 25 and 
was communicated to ryan who had not replied 
church sources said however that technically ryan was still a 
priest and could continue to call himself father ryan a colloquial 
term but not the reverend 
ryan successfully evaded british efforts to extradite him from 
belgium and the irish republic on charges of conspiring to kill and 
bomb and possessing explosives in the mid1970s 
british authorities claimed ryan acted on behalf of the outlawed 
irish republcan army which fights british rule in northern ireland 
and which has carried its struggle to the british mainland 
after a threeweek hunger strike in belgium to resist 
extradition ryan in november 1988 was flown to dublin in a belgian 
military jet 
irish attorney general john murray turned down an extradition 
request on the grounds that ryan would not get a fair trial in 
britain because of pretrial publicity 
when britain pursued an irish suggestion that ryan could be 
tried in the republic for offenses allegedly committed in britain 
the option was ruled out in october by the irish director of public 
prosecutions eamon barnes on grounds of insufficient evidence 
ryan ran unsuccessfully for an irish seat in the june elections 
to the european parliament in strasbourg france

a 32yearold doctor suffering from aids told a 
jury wednesday how she contracted the fatal disease by pricking her 
finger on a hidden needle while cleaning up after another doctor at 
a hospital 
veronica prego testified in her 175 million negligence lawsuit 
against kings county hospital in brooklyn the other physician 
dr joyce fogel and others 
prego remained composed during most of her nearly two hours on 
the stand but sobbed as she described how her mother in argentina 
learned she was hospitalized and rushed to new york to be with her 
i realized there was a very good chance i was going to die 
and i asked a friend who spoke spanish to call my mother prego 
said 
prego said she became seriously ill in november 1987 several 
years after pricking her finger with the contaminated needle 
at the bronx hospital where she was admitted prego said she was 
diagnosed with a form of pneumonia that really meant aids she 
told the court that was the first time she learned she had 
developed the disease 
prego tested positive for the aids virus two years earlier but 
medical experts had been unable to tell her if she would come down 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
i was told that i was a carrier of the virus i was told that 
i was at risk on the other hand they couldnt tell me if i would 
ever get sick she testified saying that in the early 1980s 
little was known about the risks to healthcare workers 
prego said that on jan 12 1983 she had helped fogel an 
intern take a blood sample from an aids patient at kings county 
then cleaned up the soiled gauze and linen 
first i retrieved what i thought were all the needles then i 
came back to take the refuse that had been left behind she said 
when i picked up the refuse from the bed i was stuck by a needle 
hidden among the refuse 
prego said she first tried to squeeze blood out of her finger 
then looked for fogel who was supervising her 
i was upset and she told me that she understood because it had 
happened to her she told me she had been reassured there were 
no cases where a healthcare worker had gotten aids this way 
prego said 
prego maintains in her lawsuit that she was pricked by an 
aidsinfected needle because of improper procedures at the 
hospital she contends fogel drew blood from an aids patient near 
death then carelessly left the needle in a pile of linen and other 
waste 
at the time prego born and educated in argentina was working 
as an unpaid extern a medicalschool graduate under a licensed 
physician 
prego testified she had never heard of aids before coming to the 
united states in 1982 and was given no official information on 
avoiding the disease when she went to work at kings county 
hospital attorneys maintain prego got the disease through her 
own negligence they say she was later pricked by a second infected 
needle and that it was unclear which caused her illness 
prego admits the second accident but her attorneys have said 
they will show the initial needle puncture caused her illness 
in addition to fogel and the hospital the lawsuit names the 
city health and hospitals corp and dr sheldon landesman an aids 
specialist prego says improperly disclosed her illness 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

when a city dumps its sewage into an adjacent 
river pollution not only affects it but increasingly other cities 
down the river each adds to the blight it mounts continually as 
the river crawls toward cities ahead 
the people downstream are going to suffer more and more 
says chief oren lyons an american indian spiritual leader in 
sketching that image of the cumulative effects of despoiling nature 
were going to pay a penalty he added in an interview 
only when nations cease building on rivers to use them for sewers 
will there be some prospect for cleaner life in the future 
he said similar contaminationcompounding patterns impair other 
environmental processes dirtying currents of air leaching the 
soil distorting human ways and harming the stratosphere 
all these currents in the world the air the water the 
currents of life on land the wind even the earth we travel on 
are moving and they dont recognize any borders he said 
theyre a different jurisdiction it involves everybody 
lyons of onondaga ny one of a score of indigenous spiritual 
leaders from many lands participating in an international 
conference next week in moscow on protecting the environment added 
there are natural laws that govern the air that govern the 
land and govern the water and it behooves us to know what those 
laws are if were going to survive you cant argue with 
natural laws if we keep violating them we wont survive 
lyons 59 a clan chief of the onondaga branch of the iroquois 
and director of a native american studies program at the state 
university of new york at buffalo said indians are especially 
attuned to lifes basis in nature 
indians and other indigenous people have lived in nature 
close to the earth and understand its wisdom and laws he said 
that wellspring philosophy needs to be brought to the world 
efforts to do that are planned at a fiveday global forum on 
environment and development for survival in moscow jan 1519 
involving religious leaders legislators and scientists from around 
the world 
several us congress members and scientists are among the 
approximately 200 registered participants about 100 representing 
christianity judaism islam hinduism and buddhism 
approximately a fifth of the religious contingent are indigenous 
spiritual leaders of the americas africa australia and pacific 
islands their relatively large representation indicating their 
special kinship to the subject 
its the first time weve been able to get ourselves together 
for this broad a representation lyons said a member of the 
conference steering committee 
indigenous people have a longterm moral perspective on the 
earth and its life we have no complex answers but only the simple 
principle of respect for all life for the trees the rivers the 
fish the animals 
the world is very complex today but values still remain 
simple the principles of life remain simple if we break those 
rules of life and procreation we break the cycle of life and life 
will disappear 
the earth will not disappear but people will were not going 
to destroy the world the world has its own time cycle but we are 
still only a biological experiment 
at one time the earth had great dinosaurs but they are not 
here any more it could be that one time people will not be here 
anymore thats up to us and the directions we take 
the moscow conference opens with an address by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev addresses its closing session 
it is the second such conference for the new yorkbased global 
forum the first took place in 1988 at englands oxford 
university in rare partnership soviet churches and the first 
freely elected supreme soviet are cohosting the current affair 
of indigenous spiritual leaders taking part lyons said our 
own territories are small but their affinity to nature needs to 
be transferred to the public at large 
our ceremonies have kept that perspective alive he said 
theyre engrained as part of life we celebrate the sacredness of 
the earth in a yearround cycle of ceremonies expressing respect 
and gratitude for it 
human links with it derive from the creator lyons said 
if we go contrary to his rules for it were certainly going to 
suffer we dont own the land we borrow it from the future 
but we are accountable for the future 
time itself is involved in trees for example he said a chain 
saw can cut a 500yearold tree in 10 minutes he noted but 
machines cant make another like it grow faster than hundreds of 
years 
this is a taking technology without a giving side to it he 
said thats what has to be adjusted people have a voracious 
appetite but theyre not exempt from the natural law or its 
consequences

we as religious leaders have the insights to offer from our 
various faith traditions about both the sacredness of life and the 
importance of informed personal conscience that have come out of 
years of prayer study and debate they said 
although the signers hold differing views of abortion they said

grounded in the nurture of churches

life has never been more normal for the 
simpsons dad gives bronx cheers at the opera mom hides valuables 
in her colossal hairdo and the sluggish son attempts to win 
scrabble games with the word kwyjibo 
pushing all of the conventions of the domestic television sitcom 
through a paper shredder and then weaving the scraps into new and 
often peculiar tales the makers of foxs the simpsons are 
trying to establish the first primetime cartoon since the 
jetsons and the bullwinkle show in the early 1960s 
the simpsons seen regularly as short features on foxs 
the tracey ullman show debuts as a weekly halfhour series on 
fox on sunday at 830 pm replacing the sciencethemed news show 
beyond tomorrow 
but dont grab a stack of pop tarts and a glass of tang and 
expect saturdaymorning fluff with episodes focusing on themes 
like son barts stupidity and dad homers inability to provide for 
his family the simpsons bears much closer resemblance to foxs 
married with children than to the smurfs 
it might be colorful but its a little dark too 
in my comic strip im trying to entertain a certain segment of 
the audience and annoy another segment and im not trying to do 
that with the tv show said matt groening the shows creator and 
the author of the wry and insightful cartoon life in hell and 
the related books work is hell and love is hell 
i know i can annoy people said groening rhymes with 
raining sort of its more fun to try to take an audience and 
make them laugh in spite of themselves its a different kind of 
challenge this is a family entertainment show its not aimed 
at kids though 
groening said the simpsons is certainly harderedged than 
any tv cartoon in recent memory which isnt to say its not 
funny in a strange unpredictable way when homer taunts animals at 
the zoo you dont really expect a television show much less a 
cartoon to show dad pelted in the face with monkey muck 
the simpsons are on the slow side groening said but one 
of the good things about it is that we can resist the temptation to 
put clever lines in their mouths thats my problem with most tv 
sitcoms these lines that come out of these characters mouths are 
utterly unbelievable so our cleverness lies elsewhere 
at the same time i dont think that the show has any of that 
superior snottiness we like the characters they make dumb 
decisions and they act on whatever emotion occurs to them at the 
moment but thats part of the humor 
the show is ultimately a celebration its about having a 
good time 
the simpsons will have to survive in a television 
marketplace where cartoons are either toyoriented syndicated 
strips or huggable saturday morning specials where a real crisis 
occurs when a bear loses his sweater 
its a new working environment for groening who writes and 
draws his comics in his venice calif home and works on the 
simpsons on the busy fox lot 
i got very used to working by myself but it got lonely 
too groening said and its really fun to be around people 
having a blast doing what they are doing almost all of the 
animators are obsessed by the medium and theyre passionately 
enthusiastic about their work when theyre not exhausted 
the show was created by groening and developed by groening sam 
simon and oscarwinning filmmaker james l brooks broadcast 
news 
life in hell groenings weekly comic is admittedly not a 
work of high cartoon art the animators for the simpsons had 
to learn a more primitive way of drawing groening said 
it was really a struggle a get everybody lined up and facing 
the same direction because every one of the animators can draw 
better than i can theres a simplicity and clarity in the design 
of my characters that we wanted to bring to the tv show 
in my comic strip im limited because if i cant draw it i 
wont do it but with the simpsons i can think up ideas that i 
could never draw

the governments official jobless numbers are 
technically accurate but are deceptive suggesting little change in 
the job picture over the past year when the very opposite was true 
the apparent stability is reflected by the fact that the only 
time in 1989 when the civilian rate was more than onetenth of one 
percentage point above or below the 53 percent mark was in march 
when it dipped to 50 percent 
but the seeming stability was anything but that with the number 
of factory jobs dropping steadily since early last year the 
decline totaled more than 200000 by the end of the year offset 
in statistics by a rise of service workers 
the trend is is drawing much attention from recession watchers 
who maintain that the erosion of factory and construction jobs 
indicates that industrial america may be near or already in 
recession 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
indicated the extent of the erosion with a relentless series of 
statements in her latest report to congress including 
factory job losses continued during december mainly in the 
durable goods industries factory job losses now total 195000 
since march 
the electrical equipment industry was particularly hard hit in 
december with an employment reduction of nearly 15000 losses in 
this industry since late 1988 total 75000 
automotive employment which had been falling recently was 
unchanged in december but january plant shutdowns already have 
been announced depending on the length of shutdowns she said 
they may affect january figures 
at the same time the number of paryoll jobs in the socalled 
services producing sector wholesale trade and finance insurance 
real estate transportation and public utilities included rose by 
200000 in december 
another 85000 jobs were added in services industries 
themselves mainly in health categories but employment growth in 
retail trade during 1989 was the slowest of any year since the 
expansion began in late 1982 
by some reasoning service jobs are of equal importance to jobs 
in the goodsrelated sector but others point out that many service 
jobs are directly related to the pace of the industrial sector 
a downturn in manufacturing for example can cause layoffs in 
advertising real estate transportation and many other service 
categories and can have a quick and severe impact on retail sales 
and employment 
the weakening of goodsrelated activity reflected by the 
unemployment breakdown also can be observed in several other 
statistical reports 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp observes that 
consumer service spending made up 32 percent of gross national 
product in 1988 and 1989 but in much of 1989 it accounted for more 
than 45 percent of the change in gnp 
the decline of strength in the hard goods areas of the economy 
doesnt necessarily mean recession about 25 million jobs were 
added during 1989 and the proportion of people with jobs was at a 
very high 63 percent 
but continued slippage of jobs in the industrial goods sector of 
the economy conceivably could spread to services and then be 
reflected in what would appear to be a sudden worsening of the 
jobless rate

service project a required course in which each rice senior 
performs 65 hours of community service 
the 15yearold program has students moving from history class 
into homeless shelters and working with the handicapped as part of 
their homework 
it makes things very real for the kids the bum on the 
corner the drunk the junkie hes your brother says cooper 
the kids find out theyre really just broken people in need of 
healing they become people instead of faces 
more than character building is at work here much of the boys 
work is centered in harlem where most of them live and all of them 
go to school the aim is to improve their lives and the lives of 
their neighbors 
last year seniors ran errands for senior citizens after an 
elderly harlemite was stabbed to death this year handicapped kids 
at a nearby school are getting handson assistance from four rice 
seniors with home living skills using knives forks and 
spoons tying shoes and putting on clothes its a good feeling 
helping other people in society explained brock holloway 17 of 
the bronx whos committed himself to working with the physically 
impaired children at ps 138 in harlem 
parents think hey these kids are doing something positive 
instead of running on the street said holloway before returning 
to help the youngsters get into their winter gear at the end of a 
school day 
according to cooper a redbearded man with boundless energy who 
has handled the project for three years it accomplishes something 
else it gives the kids a sense of selfworth i can make a 
difference 
i like to throw this at them mother teresa was a teenager 
once martin luther king was a teenager once but they made 
choices which led them where they are said cooper 
rice which 40 years ago was filled with the sons of irish and 
italian immigrants has changed along with its surrounding 
neighborhood the student body now is 70 percent black and 30 
percent hispanic 
other changes are more obvious across from the school crack 
and codeine is hawked openly the brothers who live in the school 
building have learned to adjust the guy who runs numbers across 
the street watches the building joked brother myles amend 
one block north of this scene coopers boys arrive tuesday 
nights to run the show in the st josephs shelter at 405 w 125th 
st they serve dinner wash clothes for the homeless spend the 
night and serve breakfast 
other students take on less challenging tasks the majority of 
seniors return to their grammar schools to work as tutors 
but three seniors are helping out at a manhattan center for 
infants with aids john watson spent his first day at the 
incarnation childrens center playing with one aids baby and later 
taking the infant to the centers christmas tree lighting 
he did a great job it was beautiful to see said sister 
connie who runs the center 
such praise for the students is not unusual and the whole 
program appears to have a positive effect on them while the 
dropout rate for city high school students stands at 297 percent 
rice graduates virtually all of its students and 85 percent of 
those go on to college said amend 
the message is spreading throughout the city each of the 60 
high schools run by the archdiocese of new york now has some form 
of community service program said schools spokeswoman nora murphy 
while the good word is getting around brother kenneth stresses 
to his students that its just as important to keep listening to 
the lesson once the 65 hours are completed the world is full of 
angry unhappy bitter men we need more saints 
while none of them may be quite a saint the students are taking 
the message to heart 
these kids really need help said 16yearold elijah mustafa 
on a break from helping handicapped infants develop coordination 
skills and strength 
it gets to my heart he said i think about how blessed i 
am to be able to walk and talk

volvos are sensible they are known for safety and longevity 
and for 1990 theres a new model in the volvo 700 series 
the 1990 volvo 740 4door with no letters to distinguish it 
from its more upscale kin the740 gl 740 gle and 740 turbo is a 
pleasant automobile that retains many important volvo traits but 
leaves out such extras as the sunroof and cruise control the 740 
with manual transmission is base priced at 20685 at least 1015 
below the other 700 models and takes the leading price position in 
the swedish car companys 700 lineup 
the 740 test car which with automatic transmission had a base 
price of 21330 performed admirably on winding mountain roads 
its european heritage evident as it easily tackled tough climbs and 
took tight turns 
indeed i marveled at the 740s nimble handling since the 
volvos characteristic shoebox shape does not evoke sporty 
performance but this sensible car makes sense even in demanding 
driving conditions 
and the 740 does it all with a fuelinjected fourcylinder 
engine mated with the fourspeed automatic transmission 
the 740 interior was comfortable though not sumptuous but i 
fussed quite a bit with the height of the driver seat since i 
seemed to be sitting up rather high to begin with 
legroom in back was sufficient if the front seats were pushed 
forward somewhat but not exceptional with the seats all the way 
back rear seat belt buckles stuck up sturdily and were painful 
when i tried to slide across the seat 
objects destined for the trunk must be lifted up and over the 
tail of the car and the trunk floor had two cutout areas on 
either side of the spare tire so it wasnt flat 
the trunk did however offer an opening through to the back 
seat covered by a plastic panel to accommodate skis or other long 
cargo 
fit and finish on the test car was excellent and i appreciated 
the little lights that illuminated the seat belt connections at 
night 
no report on a volvo could be complete without mention of 
safety most people have seen commercials showing volvos taking a 
beating without damage to the passenger compartment 
in a recent study that ranked cars according to the number of 
occupants who died in accidents the 4door 740s had the lowest 
fatality rate for the 198688 period 
the report by the insurance institute for highway safety said 
the 740s had 06 deaths per 10000 registered vehicles compared 
with an average for all cars studied of 2 deaths per 10000 
for 1990 volvo says it is making its cars even safer with 
driverside airbags standard on all models including the 1990 740 
last years sales of the 740 price leaders which made their 
debut in the fall totaled 529 volvo said last year was 
particularly satisfying for volvo overall because its us sales of 
101847 were up 41 percent from 97848 in 1988 even as other 
european companies struggled to match 1988 sales in last years 
sluggish us market 
typical buyers of 740 series cars have been mostly married 89 
percent and aged 35 to 54 years 53 percent fiftyfour percent 
were men with a median age of 40 and median household income of 
74550 volvo said 
most were employed in managerialprofessionaltechnical jobs 
many buyers are what the company calls volvophiles people who 
drive their cars for an average 73 years when ranked by the 
length of time that owners keep their vehicles volvo follows only 
volkswagen 86 years and mercedesbenz 82 years 
consumer reports magazine notes that 198688 volvo 740s ranked 
average or much better than average in owner reports of trouble 
competitors of the 740 include saabs such as the 900 sedan that 
starts at more than 17000 and the 900s sedan that starts at more 
than 21000 as well as audis which start at around 19000

more than 300 children infected with the aids 
virus are not getting the antiaids drug azt because they are 
subjects in a government trial of another drug 
the trial of the other drug is continuing more than two months 
after health and human services secretary louis sullivan acted to 
make azt widely available to all children who need it we have 
enough preliminary evidence that the drug is effective and seems to 
be safe he said in october 
researchers are split over whether the children should now be 
receiving azt some have criticized the decision to continue the 
trial with the other drug called intravenous immunoglobulin or 
ivig 
the issue of immunoglobulin alone might have been timely three 
or four years ago said dr philip pizzo chief of the pediatrics 
branch at the national cancer institute in bethesda md but in 
1989 not having azt means that the potential benefit of the 
drug particularly to childrens nervous systems is being lost 
unlike azt which is specifically intended to prevent further 
spread of the aids virus in the body immunoglobulin is intended to 
reduce the frequency and severity of bacterial infections in 
children carrying the aids virus it has no direct effect on the 
virus itself 
in addition at least half of the aidsinfected children those 
who are serving as controls in the experiment are receiving only a 
placebo lacking any beneficial ingredients they are not getting 
any drugs 
such placebocontrolled trials have been stopped in adults 
because it was deemed unethical to deny adults azt said 
spokeswoman elaine baldwin at the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases in bethesda 
niaid which runs nearly all of the national trials of potential 
antiaids drugs has also stopped doing placebocontrolled trials 
in children baldwin said 
the bottom line from my point of view is that a 
placebocontrolled trial to be done in children with symptomatic 
infections would be an inappropriate thing to do said pizzo 
azt is a drug which has clearly defined benefits in the pediatric 
population 
his studies among the most thorough studies of azt in children 
indicate the drug can stop or even reverse damage to the central 
nervous system that damage produces physical and mental symptoms 
children who were once walking lose that ability or children 
who had sentences begin to lose that speech he said azt can 
improve that in varying degrees 
a number of specialists in the treatment of aids in children 
hold similar views as they explained in interviews 
we all feel that survival in children given no drug is very 
poor the fact that symptomatic children can now be treated with 
azt is certainly a significant advance said dr gwendolyn scott 
a pediatrician at the university of miami school of medicine 
azt has been demonstrated to have benefit in children and 
patients need to have access to azt said dr edward connor 
chairman of the pediatrics committee of the aids clinical trials 
group operated by niaid 
the question for children who fall into that category is not 
so much will azt be of benefit but what is the best dosage said 
dr stephen spector director of the aids clinical trials unit at 
the university of california san diego he added that azt is 
likely to be useful even in children who have not yet developed 
symptoms of aids 
in october hhs secretary sullivan and the food and drug 
administration released azt for use in children under what is 
called a treatment ind that allows wide distribution of a 
drug without charge before it has been formally approved for use 
the fda determined that the benefits of the toxic drug outweighed 
its side effects 
as of nov 30 1989 the latest date for which figures are 
available the centers for disease control had received reports of 
1947 cases of children with aids and 1059 deaths since the 
epidemic began 
the cdc has no estimate of the number of american children 
infected with the aids virus but doctors say the number may be two 
to 10 times the number of cases reported most contract the virus 
from their mothers before birth 
children in the immunoglobulin trial are not prevented from 
taking azt but few are receiving it the trials director dr 
anne willoughby of the national institute of child health and human 
development in bethesda said 347 children are in the trial 
of those 113 are seriously ill and 26 of them are getting azt 
among the remaining 234 patients five are getting azt the 
children are being treated at more than two dozen centers across 
the country willoughby said 
researchers are continuing to recruit less seriously ill 
children for the trial she said 
there is a legitimate difference of opinion about the status 
of this study willoughby said in a telephone interview she said 
she would like to see more data on the trials of azt in children 
before she was convinced of its effectiveness 
keith krasinski a pediatrician at new york university medical 
center and a participant in the immunoglobulin trial said it 
would be premature to say that azt is the standard of therapy 
information on its safety and the method of its action has 
increased in recent months but data on the efficacy of azt in 
children has accumulated more slowly he said 
willoughby emphasized that the studys data safety and 
monitoring board an independent group that could halt the trial if 
it were considered unethical has repeatedly approved its 
continuation 
the most recent such approval by that group was about three 
weeks ago willoughby said we have subjected it to ruthless 
scrutiny by outside groups she said the studys own executive 
committee also reviewed the trial jan 8 and made no substantial 
changes she said 
furthermore she said the children in the trial can be given 
azt if their physicians think its appropriate she acknowledged 
this might complicate evaluation of the study 
willoughby said she is less certain than pizzo of the value of 
azt in children its not as clear to many other people as it is 
to phil she said 
niaid has begun a separate trial in which all the children 
receive either immunoglobulin with azt or azt alone that study 
should be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of intravenous 
immunoglobulin while at the same time providing azt to all 
participants authorities say 
the study will however require more children to demonstrate 
whether immunoglobulin is effective said dr arthur amman 
chairman of the scientific advisory committee of the american 
foundation for aids research that makes the studies much more 
difficult he said 
the reason amman explained is that the control subjects will 
improve with doses of azt and that will narrow the noticeable 
differences between them and the group getting azt and 
immunoglobulin 
researchers are unsure of the value of immunoglobulin said 
spector of the university of california san diego 
there really is no good data he said there is subjective 
data that it may be of benefit but wellcontrolled systematic 
studies havent been done 
one of its earliest proponents was dr arye rubinstein of the 
albert einstein college of medicine in new york city who is 
participating in the immunoglobulin trial directed by willoughby 
there is no question it reduces infection rubinstein said 
it doesnt cure the disease but it improves the outcome

control of the political map of the 1990s is 
riding on the outcome of governors races this year and republicans 
are running scared in the states where the stakes are highest 
democrats and republicans anticipating that the 1990 census 
will confirm the shift of americans to the south and west are 
concentrating much of their attention and resources on three big 
sunbelt states where governors will play a crucial role in drawing 
lines for a bonanza of new house seats 
democrats now hold 29 of the 50 governors offices including 20 
of the 36 up this year but in the three biggest sunbelt states 
california texas and florida sure to be the big winners when 
us house seats are shifted to reflect the 1990 census the 
governors are republicans and the gop is marshaling its resources 
for an allout effort to maintain its control 
that task is complicated by the fact that govs george 
deukmejian of california and william clements of texas are not 
seeking reelection and gov bob martinez of florida has had a 
rocky first term 
the real battleground is reapportionment said michele 
davis executive director of the republican governors association 
thats where we hope to put the majority of our resources to help 
break the hold the democrats have on the us congress 
state legislatures will draw new congressional and legislative 
district lines subject to the governors vetos that will define 
politics for the next decade 
current projections are that 18 house seats will shift to 
sunbelt states with california gaining seven florida four and 
texas three democrats control the legislatures in all three which 
makes the governorships crucial to republican chances to influence 
the drawing of lines in those states 
the biggest loser in the reapportionment sweepstakes looks like 
new york with a projected loss of three house seats democratic 
gov mario cuomo is expected to seek a third term but republicans 
control the state senate which will give them a voice when the 
lines are redrawn 
gov jim thompson of illinois is another republican who is 
retiring his state stands to lose two house seats and the 
democrats currently control both branches of the legislature 
republican analysts acknowledge they may suffer some net losses 
in the governors races and they would be satisifed to keep the 
states they have 
davis said she expects president bush to make 10 or more 
campaign appearances for gop candidates for governor noting that 
reagan campaigned for only three gubernatorial candidates four 
years ago 
bush plans to attend a fundraising dinner friday in miami for 
martinez 
besides martinez republicans view gov kay orr of nebraska as 
their most endangered incumbent among democrats william oneill 
in connecticut and neil goldschmidt in oregon are regarded as 
facing tough reelection challenges 
democrat michael dukakis retirement in massachusetts has left a 
confusing freeforall in both parties the 1988 presidential 
candidates popularity has plummeted along with the states 
economy and republicans are voicing rare optimism about their 
prospects in a normally democratic stronghold 
rough democratic primaries are expected in georgia where gov 
joe frank harris is retiring and ohio where gov richard celeste 
cannot seek a third term ohio stands to lose two seats while 
georgia gains one 
in california republicans grabbed an early advantage when sen 
pete wilson decided to run for governor he has a clear path to the 
nomination while democrats face a potentially bitter and expensive 
primary between state attorney general john van de kamp and former 
san francisco mayor dianne feinstein 
republicans say that if van de kamp is the democratic nominee 
theyll make an issue of his reluctance as a local prosecutor to 
bring a case against a suspect in the hillside strangler case 
reasoning there wasnt enough evidence the state later stepped in 
and won a conviction 
theyve got a silver bullet issue said charles cook 
analyst and editor of a washington political newsletter 
adding a new dimension to many of the governors races is the 
battle over abortion the supreme courts 1989 decision giving 
states more leeway to regulate abortion has given the issue a new 
relevancy in many states 
in the aftermath of 1989 victories by abortionrights 
candidates several 1990 candidates have moved away from 
antiabortion positions such as democratic hopefuls anthony 
celebrezze in ohio and neil hartigan in illinois and republicans 
jack rains and tom luce in texas 
early television advertising has boosted the candidacies of 
rains and luce in texas and put the early republican frontrunner 
abortion opponent kent hance on the defensive among democrats 
state treasurer ann richards faces a field including former 
governor mark white and attorney general jim mattox 
some of martinez problems in florida stem from his failed 
attempt to win restrictions on abortion from his state legislature 
in a special session last fall democratic rep bill nelson has 
become the leading democratic candidate running as an advocate of 
abortion rights 
in pennyslvania democratic incumbent bob casey is an abortion 
foe while the frontrunner for the republican nomination to 
challenge him barbara hafer supports abortion rights 
with most governors elected for fouryear terms this class of 
governors was last up in 1986 that was the year republicans scored 
a major eightseat gain in governorships at a time when they were 
losing control of the us senate 
the republicans have lost ground in governors races since then 
but the 1986 results demonstrated that governors elections can run 
counter to national trends 
both parties have national efforts aimed at assisting their 
gubernatorial candidates republicans hope to raise and spend 15 
million to 2 million nationally this year assisting governor 
candidates democrats last month announced a 3 million goal for 
their project 500 campaign to help candidates for state 
legislatures and governorships in addition to a half million 
dollars or more their democratic governors association will spend

an exxon refinery operator twice restarted 
the flow of oil through a leaking pipeline after automatic safety 
systems stopped the flow the company said in its first public 
report on a 567000gallon spill 
and in a private briefing for new york and new jersey 
environmental officials exxon officials disclosed that a system to 
detect leaks in the pipeline had been faltering at least once or 
twice a week for a year a new york official said tuesday 
it seems thats the reason why the operator overrode the 
system said carol ash a regional director of the new york 
department of environmental conservation she would not elaborate 
exxon now says the jan 2 leak spilled 567000 gallons of home 
heating oil into the arthur kill shipping channel between the new 
york city borough of staten island and new jersey exxon said in a 
summary of an internal report 
exxon initially said it had lost only 5000 gallons 
the report did not say how much more oil leaked because the 
operator restarted the pipeline but joe mcmillan a company vice 
president defended the workers actions 
the company summary did not mention the faulty leakdetection 
system mcmillan said only that the operator whom he would not 
identify had noticed erratic signals from one system that 
detected the leak after a malfunction in an automatic valve and 
meter disabled another shutdown system 
were still trying to chase down the erratic signals he 
said 
mcmillan said the operator restarted the pipeline because the 
system appeared to be normal on pipeline monitors typically he 
said a plant operator restarts the flow of oil after a shutdown to 
confirm there is a problem 
mcmillan said the plant operator did not get a confirmation of 
the problem each of the three times that he restarted the system 
the third time however he decided against resuming the flow of 
oil 
the oil oozed through a gash in an underwater pipeline for six 
hours before the pipeline was finally shut down the summary said 
the cause of the crack hasnt been determined and exxon plans to 
remove the pipeline next week for metallurgical testing 
ash complained that exxons safety procedures dont even begin 
to meet the basic housekeeping needs of a major organization thats 
passing this much oil from one facility to another under a 
metropolitan water body 
the pipeline runs beneath the arthur kill between exxons bayway 
refinery in linden and a company distribution terminal in bayonne 
mcmillan said the internal report released to state and federal 
investigators is preliminary 
the summary released a week after the spill ended corporate 
silence that public officials had criticized as stonewalling 
a new jersey grand jury is investigating exxon for possible 
violations of the state oceanpollution law in the spill which 
fouled ecologically sensitive marshland killed at least 150 birds 
and partially closed the shipping channel 
exxon also was involved in the nations largest oil spill the 
grounding last march of the tanker exxon valdez in alaska in which 
more than 10 million gallons of crude spilled

robert t morris spent weeks trying to 
perfect the program that crippled a national computer network and 
used code to hide his work a cornell university computer security 
official testified 
morris is on trial in federal court where his attorney 
contended in opening arguments tuesday that the suspended cornell 
graduate student simply made a mistake while experimenting with 
a program to test computer security 
testimony was not scheduled to resume until thursday because the 
courtroom was reserved for an unrelated hearing today 
dean krafft director of computer facilities for cornells 
computer science department testified tuesday that he found forms 
of the worm or virus program existed in morris cornell 
computer account as early as oct 15 1988 
krafft said those files were hidden so they would remain 
undiscovered in a normal search of computer files he said he 
uncovered them during an exhaustive search of all computer science 
department files during an investigation after the nov 2 1988 
network disruption 
they were encrypted and in compressed form to keep somebody 
else from reading them said krafft who said such storage of a 
file was unusual 
included in those secretive files were the decrypted passwords 
of 73 other computer users at cornell he said he said he also 
found password files from the university of californiaberkeley 
massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university in 
morris cornell account 
the final worm program stored in morris account on nov 2 took 
two days to decode and an additional week to translate krafft 
testified 
morris 25 of arnold md is the first person brought to trial 
under the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act if convicted he faces 
up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine 
prosecutors allege morris designed and unleashed a program that 
replicated wildly immobilizing an estimated 6000 computers linked 
to the internet research network including computers of nasa the 
air force and several universities 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni did not argue that morris 
wasnt responsible for the worm program he made a critical 
mistake and it caused the virus to spread much faster than he 
anticipated guidoboni said 
this worm caused no permanent damage and it was not designed 
to cause permanent damage he told the jury 
us justice department attorney mark rasch argued that the 
program was intended as a fullscale assault on computers 
throughout the united states launched by morris 
morris devoted a lot of time energy and research to planning 
this assault from his computer at cornell in ithaca ny rasch 
said 
rasch said the worm was designed to break into as many computers 
as possible and was programmed with many different ways to 
accomplish its goal

the md11 a new widebody jetliner from 
mcdonnell douglas is ready to fly for the first time carrying the 
aerospace companys hopes of regaining preeminence in commercial 
aircraft production into the next century 
the first new trijet introduced since the douglas dc10 and 
lockheed l1011 two decades ago the md11 was poised for its 
initial flight today if the weather was good at long beach airport 
the 350passenger md11 is just one of several aircraft programs 
on which the st louisbased aerospace and defense company has run 
behind schedule including the 150passenger md80 jetliner and the 
c17 military cargo plane 
many of mcdonnell douglas problems stem from the worldwide boom 
in aircraft orders which also has overtaxed production at boeing 
this countrys no 1 commercial aircraft producer 
the md11 is quite important to mcdonnell douglas said 
lawrence harris an aerospace analyst with bateman eichler hill 
richards brokerage in los angeles 
the successful certification of the md11 will generate a 
significant portion of douglas revenues over the next several 
years harris said 
the company has 118 orders and 194 options for md11s which 
harris said will cost about 90 million apiece under the most 
optimistic schedule the company could have the plane tested 
approved and 10 jets delivered by the end of the year he said 
the maximum nonstop range for the standard md11 is up to 8039 
land miles with 323 passengers and luggage 
the planes are powered by the quieter more energy efficient 
highbypass engines made by general electric rolls royce and pratt 
amp whitney customers will be able to choose the maker 
the md11 is about as long as twothirds of a football field 
and several companies have expressed interest in a stretch version 
that would be 35 feet longer about the size of a boeing 747 no 
decision has been made on whether to produce the longer version 
said douglas spokesman keith takahashi 
the md11 looks much the same from the outside as the dc10 
although minor streamlining changes have been made in the tail the 
end of the wings and the stabilizers the avionics or electronic 
equipment cockpit and interior are new 
it will compete against the a330 and a340 jetliners being 
manufactured by the european consortium airbus industrie which 
also carry about 350 passengers and cost about the same boeings 
777 to be introduced in the mid1990s will also compete with the 
md11s 
mcdonnell douglas is counting on the douglas unit to generate 
profit growth in the years ahead because of the likelihood of a 
flattening defense budget and the significant commercial backlog 
that exists for both the md80 and the md11 said harris 
he said 1990 would be a transitional year for mcdonnell douglas 
whose earnings fell during the first nine months of fiscal 1989 
its still an open question as to how many md11s can be 
delivered and the bottom line will be affected by development 
expense which could rise if test flights reveal serious 
problems harris said 
the program for the smaller md80 appears to have turned the 
corner into profitability he said 
meanwhile the c17 program is still in development amid close 
scrutiny the air force recently moved the first flight of the c17 
fron the end of this year to mid1991 
by 1991 of course the md11 would be working its way to a 
higher production rate the md80 would be contributing profit and 
well have a clearer picture of how the c17 is doing harris 
said

recent headlines about declining interest rates 
have posed a question in the minds of many american homeowners is 
it time to refinance the mortgage 
the reduction early this week in the bank prime lending rate 
from 105 percent to 10 percent stirred new interest in the 
subject even if only in a symbolic way 
moves in the prime usually come as an afterthefact response to 
changes in other shortterm interest rates and may have very 
little bearing on what lenders charge for longterm loans such as 
fixed mortgages 
still fixed 30year mortgages are being offered in some places 
these days with interest rates a bit under 10 percent down about a 
percentage point of where they stood a year ago 
and many analysts in the chancy business of making financial 
forecasts hold out hope that interest rates in general may keep 
coming down in the months ahead 
thats more than enough to pique the curiosity of anyone who 
would like to lighten the burden of the monthly mortgage bill or 
to refinance for any one of a dozen or more worthy reasons 
for most families the mortgage on their home is their largest 
single debt points out the united amp babson investment report a 
bostonbased financial advisory service 
the most prominent obstacle to refinancing is the cost of 
replacing one loan with another which can run to several thousand 
dollars by the time such charges as legal and application fees 
appraisals and points on a new mortgage are added up 
before the merits of any refinancing deal can be evaluated a 
complete list of these costs must be compiled 
the total can then be divided by the amount you would save 
monthly on mortgage payments to determine the payback period 
the amount of time it would take you to recover your refinancing 
costs 
for example united amp babson says a refinancing that incurs 
6000 in costs and saves you 50 a month in mortgage payments will 
take 120 months or 10 years to reach the breakeven point not 
much of a bargain 
by contrast a switch that costs 2000 and saves you 175 a 
month requires just 12 months to start paying off 
experts warn however that even the latter example may not be 
quite as attractive as it sounds they point out that the 
government subsidizes mortgage payments through interest deductions 
that can amount to well over 30 percent of the total when both 
federal and state income taxes are considered 
refinancing costs by contrast arent usually deductible as 
current expenses on a typical new loan for example any upfront 
points you pay must be spread out for tax purposes over the life of 
the mortgage unless the proceeds of the loan go directly for 
capital improvements to your property 
refinancing appeals to large numbers of homeowners for reasons 
apart from reducing monthly payments it may be used for example 
to substitute a 15year mortgage for one with 20 or 25 years still 
to run 
that allows for faster buildup of equity in the property and 
cuts the total interest cost by thousands of dollars over the life 
of the loan 
also noted niel moser an official at a mortgage affiliate of 
the credit union national association even in cases where the 
monthly savings arent much some people are switching from 
adjustablerate mortgages to fixedrate mortgages to get the 
security of a known payment schedule

soviet and east european officials split 
over the pace of economic reform today reached broad agreement to 
move their comecon trading bloc toward world markets after four 
decades of isolation 
a 40year period is coming to an end said bulgarian premier 
georgi atanassov wrapping up the twoday summit this meeting 
marks a real new beginning 
officials indicated that the agreement would reduce soviet 
dominance in trading with eastern european countries as the former 
soviet satellites abandon the centralized fiveyear plans that 
were the bulwark of stalinist economic management 
under the agreement trade between the nations will gradually 
shift to a hard currency basis at prices set by the world market 
few details emerged of the agreement and it was not clear how 
many years it will take for the shift to be completed 
a bulgarian official said he believed that it will take three to 
five years to move from current trading practices based on barter 
and artificial currency exchange rates to a new system based on 
world prices 
we have reached a substantial agreement said vladimir 
dlouhy the chairman of czechoslovakias state planning commission 
the soviet union on tuesday proposed that the new system start 
operating from 1991 with trading pegged to a hard currency rate 
and to world market prices but east europeans dependent for 
decades on soviet fuel and energy supplies suggested that such a 
quick transition would be a disaster 
the next comecon meeting will be in budapest officials said 
but no date was set and czechoslovak officials said their call for 
a summit as soon as june to speed reform was rebuffed 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland had led forces demanding a 
radical restructuring of the sovietdominated alliance 
they claim decades of adherence to sovietstyle central planning 
has crippled their economies making them more difficult to shift 
to a market economy and they demanded compensation by the soviets 
the comecon alliance has used the soviet ruble as the basis for 
transactions for all its 40 years the ruble is a soft 
nonconvertible currency meaning it is not exchanged on western 
markets and it is governed by strict rules and controlled by the 
soviet government 
hard currencies such as the dollar and the japanese yen have 
their value determined on markets 
in comecons early years the arrangement allowed the soviet 
union to force its eastern european satellites into trade relations 
highly favorable to moscow the alliance also cut those countries 
off from western markets and technology a situation that has left 
their debtridden economies lagging far behind the west and their 
products far inferior in quality 
it was comecons first gathering since authoritarian oneparty 
communist rule lost its grip in eastern europe beginning with 
poland last summer and most recently with the bloody december 
revolution that toppled romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu 
delegations from all the warsaw pact countries were led by 
premiers including nikolai ryzhkov of the soviet union like petre 
roman of romania some have been in office for just a matter of 
weeks 
dlouhy told the gathering tuesday that his country the worlds 
10th largest economic power before world war ii had regressed 
because of its membership in an alliance created by josef stalin as 
a means to exploit and maintain control over client states in 
eastern europe 
he like his polish and hungarian colleagues contended it was 
the soviet unions moral responsibility to share the costs of the 
painful transition to trade relations based on western hard 
currencies 
vaclav klaus czechoslovakias finance minister said tuesday 
that prague was considering resigning from some restrictive 
comecon commissions like one that fixes currency exchange rates 
among its members who also include bulgaria east germany 
vietnam mongolia and cuba 
czechoslovakia maintained at the opening meeting that a 
transition period of two to four years was needed to introduce free 
market prices in the bloc

in a move to block additional noise 
restrictions at minneapolisst paul international airport 
northwest airlines has warned employees that jobs will be lost if 
the airline cant use older noisier planes until it gets new 
quieter models 
in a threepage letter dated jan 3 northwest urges employees 
to contact minneapolis city council member steve cramer whom it 
calls particularly vocal on the current noise issue 
the letter asks the employees to tell cramer in their own words 
you are a northwest employee you live in minneapolis 
aircraft noise is a price we pay to live near an airport 
unreasonable noise restrictions limiting the use of certain 
aircraft like the dc940 will hurt northwest its employees and the 
local economy lets work together to address noise concerns 
the letter also urges northwest employees to contact cramer 
before a jan 23 meeting of the metropolitan aircraft sound 
abatement council at which northwest is expected to ask the 
council to approve the use of about 14 older and nosier airplanes 
until northwest can take delivery on new and quieter planes over 
the next 10 years 
the letter noted that some of cramers constituents live under 
flight paths and have complained about noise 
but hundreds of mr cramers constituents are northwest 
employees like you the letter says these employees 
livelihoods could be adversely affected by restrictions on 
northwests fleet operations mr cramer needs to be reminded that 
northwest employees are also his constituents your job could 
be threatened by the actions of mr cramer and other masac sound 
abatement council members 
the letter is signed by tim thornton northwests executive vice 
president and general counsel greg averill and ht dodge vice 
chairmen of the local unit of the air line pilots association guy 
cook president of district lodge 143 of the international 
association of machinists and bruce retrum secretarytreasurer of 
teamsters local 2747 
cramer a minneapolis representative on the sound abatement 
council said northwests letter underscores an apparent new 
confrontational approach that they are taking which i dont think 
in the end will be productive 
he also said that if northwest asks the council to endorse the 
use of the older planes he will vote against it 
thats like asking people to endorse being hit over the head 
with a baseball bat cramer said 
being formed is a committee that would propose policies to 
increase the use of newer quieter planes at the airport the 
committee is expected to study ordinances that would require 
airlines to use a certain percentage of quieter planes

us and taiwan officials ended three days 
of trade talks wednesday without reaching agreement on us 
requests for taiwan to further open its markets 
sandy kristoff assistant us trade representative said the 
american delegation was disappointed at taiwans refusal to end 
import bans on highvalue us agricultural products and alcoholic 
beverages and its restrictions on us insurance firms 
kristoff head of the american delegation said in a statement 
that her delegation also was concerned about the slow progress 
taiwan has made in the protection of intellectual property rights 
although taiwan signed an agreement last year to regulate the 
showing of pirated us films in popular video parlors she said 
implementation and enforcement efforts have not been as rigorous 
as expected 
but sheu kesheng director general of taiwans board of foreign 
trade told reporters taiwan must avoid opening its market too 
rapidly to avoid causing harm to local companies 
kristoff said taiwan had made overall progress on the 
implementation of a fouryear action plan to reduce its trade 
surplus with the united states 
under the plan taiwan proposed to reduce its trade surplus by 
at least 10 percent each year and cut import tariffs to an average 
7 percent in 1992 
taiwan cut import tariffs on more than 4500 items last year 
under us pressure and the rates average about 965 percent now

take west germany to court for failing to comply with european 
community water standards 
carlo ripa di meana the ec commissioner for the environment 
said that bonn had failed to fully and properly take account of 
european community rules on drinking water 
the commission said in a statement it had filed a case against 
the west german government at the european court of justice the 
luxembourgbased court is empowered to levy heavy fines against ec 
nations which fail to respect ec legislation its rulings are 
binding 
the commission had been considering what to do about west 
germanys continuing failure to clean up its drinking water eight 
years after it should have complied with ec legislation 
most of the 12 ec member states should have cleaned up their 
drinking water to meet ec standards by 1982 with some being given 
a 1985 deadline 
west germany only began to modify its national water legislation 
to comply with the ec rules in 1986 and gave itself until october 
1989 to comply with the ceiling on pesticide levels in drinking 
water 
west germany is the fourth ec nation to be taken to court over 
failure to meet ec drinking water standards the case against 
britain was brought on sept 20 1989 and cases against belgium and 
france were filed previously 
the commission should soon decide whether to take similar action 
against luxembourg and proceedings are pending against italy and

more than 9 million in damages has been awarded 
to a texas woman by a federal court jury who found that xerox corp 
discriminated against her because of her age 
the jury on tuesday awarded elizabeth layman 284000 in actual 
damages and 875 million in punitive damages concluding that 
xerox has fraudulently induced ms layman to relocate to california 
and then refused to provide her a job 
xerox said it will ask us district judge sidney fitzwater to 
overturn the verdict if he refuses it will appeal 
we do not believe the evidence supports the jurys verdict 
and the size of the damages are grossly disproportionate to the 
claimed wrong said tom abbott manager of public relations at 
the companys headquarters in stamford conn 
according to her lawsuit ms layman now 46 was a software 
marketing manager at a xerox office in dallas for about six years 
until her job was eliminated in a general reorganization shortly 
after she turned 40 in 1983 
she was demoted to a lowergrade job but within a year her 
suit claims a younger woman was named to fill her former position 
in 1986 the suit said her entire unit was disbanded and she 
was told she could transfer to a xerox office in california 
although the company bought her house the suit said the job offer 
did not come through until after she had filed suit and then was 
for an entrylevel position 
when she refused the transfer she was fired 
attorney grady swindle said the verdict shows youre entitled 
to be treated fairly even after age 40 
swindle said the large jury award means that employers should 
not take the prime use of employees and then dump them out of a 
company 
the jury award also includes 145000 in back pay and lost 
benefits and 139716 in compensation for the trouble ms layman 
had after the sale of her house

farmers including those who grow florida 
citrus must learn to live without subsidies and import tariffs in 
the coming years us trade representative carla a hills told a 
national convention 
hills speaking to american farm bureau federation national 
convention delegates said the administrations goal in world trade 
talks is to sharply limit the role of governments in agriculture 
the ambassador hinted tuesday that a 35centagallon us duty 
on imported orange juice strongly supported by florida citrus 
growers is still among the many bargaining chips on the table 
gov bob martinez went to washington last week and urged hills 
to retain the tariff to help protect florida against cheaper 
brazilian juice 
florida citrus growers are competitive hills said when 
asked what advice she would give the states growers to compete 
against brazil if all tariffs are phased out within 10 years as the 
united states has proposed 
greater access to world markets is what florida citrus growers 
need through the elimination of foreign quotas and tariffs hills 
said 
dan gunter executive director of the florida department of 
citrus said after hills speech that he remains very concerned 
about the possible phasing out of the tariff 
all you would be doing is shipping our citrus industry to 
brazil thats what would happen if you reduced those tariffs he 
said 
brazil is the worlds largest citrus growing region producing 
almost 300 million 90pound boxes of oranges a year florida 
second to brazil was expecting to harvest 130 million boxes of 
oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit before the recent 
christmas freeze severely damaged crops a new citrus harvest 
forecast will be released thursday 
while gunter said he agreed with hills that florida growers are 
competitive in many respects he said cheaper land labor costs and 
subsidies in brazil leave it in a position to undercut florida 
prices 
bobby mckown executive vice president of the 12000member 
florida citrus mutual in lakeland said he believes the juice 
tariff is safe for the moment because other countries have not 
indicated they are willing to drop similar trade restrictions 
the availability of farm labor was another topic addressed 
during the second day of the fiveday convention attended by 8000 
farm bureau members 
monte v lake a washington lawyer specializing in farm labor 
matters said farmers must prepare to compete for a shrinking pool 
of unskilled laborers in the next decade and carefully document 
shortages 
federal immigration reform coupled with an aging population may 
result in fewer farm workers and higher labor costs lake said 
a special federal program has been created to help ease such a 
labor crunch but apparently will not be called upon in 1990 lake 
said because the labor and agriculture departments last week 
announced that no such shortage appeared to be a threat in the 
coming year 
petitions to recruit more harvesters from countries such as 
mexico will be closely scrutinized by federal agencies as well as 
unions looking to limit labor availability and keep pressure on 
wages lake said 
the government is going to be reluctant to admit more 
workers lake said

chicago businessman william farley may be having 
trouble financing his 156 billion acquisition of west 
pointpepperell inc according to published reports 
west pointpepperells stock closed at 3750 a share tuesday a 
52week low and 2025 below the 58ashare price farley agreed to 
pay for the companys outstanding stock nine months ago 
the stock price is eroding because there is uncertainty that 
the deal can be completed richard byrne an analyst with merill 
lynch researchusa told the chicago suntimes 
on tuesday the new york times cited a securities and exchange 
commission filing saying that banks that made a 103 billion 
bridge loan to west pointpepperell had agreed to extend the loan 
through march and perhaps through june in return for additional 
fees and higher interest rates 
west point gabased west pointpepperell will now pay lead 
banks wells fargo and bankers trust co and other lenders 25 
percentage points over the prime instead of 15 percentage points 
the banks in turn granted west pointpepperell permission to 
advance money to west point acquisition corp a company owned by 
farley that owns 95 percent of west pointpepperell 
without such cash infusions west point acquisition might run 
out of cash and default on the interest payments it owes on more 
than 14 billion in debt it took on to buy west pointpepperell 
stock the times said 
farley vice president jack albertine did not immediately return 
phone calls to the associated press seeking comment 
the acquisition of pepperell by farley last spring was said to 
create the worlds largest textile and apparel group with more 
than 4 billion in sales and about 70000 employees 
among farleys best known holdings are fruit of the loom 
underwear and acme boots before the takeover pepperell became the

be promoted as top executives 
over the past two years we have brought in some very good 
people as well as developed a lot of good people internally

american telephone amp telegraph co filed suit 
today against mci communications corp and its telemarketing agent 
claiming they stole some of atampts longdistance customers through 
deceptive practices or by switching services without their consent 
atampt also said it had asked the federal communications 
commission to amend its rules so that telephone customers would 
have to provide written permission before switching longdistance 
carriers 
under current rules customers can authorize a change verbally 
we believe our proposal to the fcc will curtail the numerous 
instances of unauthorized switching or slamming as its known 
in the industry that consumers have endured merrill tutton an 
atampt vice president told a news conference in new york 
washingtonbased mci denied any wrongdoing saying atampt was 
merely frustrated by mcis success in winning over new customers 
this allegation is just another example of atampt preaching 
competition on one hand and whining when competition takes hold in 
the marketplace the company said in a statement mci has been 
winning customers in the marketplace at a rate of over 100000 a 
week based on value and superlative customer service 
we view atampts action indicative of their frustration and 
simply another misdirected attempt to impede the competitive 
marketplace 
in a lawsuit filed in us district court in newark nj atampt 
alleges mci and mcis telemarketing representative pioneer 
teletechnologies of sergeant bluff iowa used misleading or false 
information to persuade atampt customers to switch their 
longdistance service it also claims mci switched atampt customers 
without their knowledge and consent 
for example atampt claims customers had told it that mci had told 
them it was merging with atampt or that atampt was going out of 
business 
the suit asks for an unspecified amount of damages 
tutton said the company could not provide a specific amount of 
losses it suffered through the allged scheme but he said 
preliminary studies showed that from february to november of last 
year between 10 percent and 15 percent of the atampt customers 
switching to other longdistance carriers had been unaware of the 
change 
atampt claimed it that the many thousands of complaints from 
consumers had prompted it to seek legal against agains mci

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade in the wake increased 
marketing of crops by farmers 
a lack of export business dragged down wheat prices as traders 
showed disappointment over the soviet unions failure to make 
additional purchases the soviets bought 480000 metric tons of 
us wheat on tuesday 
forecasts of rain for the central plains which would aid the 
growth of the winter wheat crop also hampered futures prices 
corn prices were pressured by increased marketing by farmers 
said analyst joel karlin of research department inc in chicago 
karlin said farmers were holding on to their corn hoping for a 
market rally but they are trying to take advantage of current 
prices fearing they could go lower he said 
soybeans were pushed down by reports of rain in south america 
which should help the growth of soybean crops increased selling 
and the failure of new business to materialize in the soy oil 
market 
oats prices plunged as commission house sell stops were reached 
amid reports canadian farmers are increasing their oat exports to 
the united states karlin said 
at the close wheat was a cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 405 a bushel corn was cent 
to 1 cents lower with march at 238 a bushel oats were 3 cents 
to 4 cents lower with march at 145 cents a bushel soybeans were 
2 cents to 4 cents lower with january at 567 a bushel

the supreme court on wednesday limited the 
ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in 
federal court in a case involving two foreignbased companies that 
challenged california law 
the justices ruled that a law generally barring federal courts 
from handling lawsuits that attack a state tax applies to 
foreignbased multinational businesses 
a federal appeals court had ruled that the law did not apply 
drawing a distinction between multinational businesses based in 
this country and those based in foreign countries 
the supreme courts unanimous decision means that two 
foreignbased corporations will have to turn to california courts 
to challenge that states business tax 
the justices in 1984 gave states a major victory when ruling 
that california could tax multinational corporations doing business 
in the state based on the businesses worldwide dealings 
the california tax employs what is known as the unitary system 
and bases individual tax bills on a share of the worldwide 
earnings payroll and property value of a multinational corporation 
and its subsidiaries 
the 1984 ruling dealt only with multinationals with parent 
companies based in the united states the california tax 
subsequently was challenged by alcan aluminium limited a canadian 
corporation and imperial chemical industries plc a brittish 
corporation both have us subsidiaries doing business in 
california 
the suits were filed in federal court in chicago where the 
california franchise tax board maintains an office 
a federal judge threw out the suits ruling that they must be 
filed in california court but the chicagobased 7th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated the suits 
the supreme court said the trial judge was right 
writing for the court justice byron r white said to the 
extent they are available californias refund procedures 
constitute a plain speedy and efficient remedy 
white noted that only the two corporations american 
subsidiaries and not the foreignbased parent firms have the 
legal standing to sue in california courts 
but that makes no difference he said and the federal tax 
injunction act still applies the law bars federal courts from 
handling such suits if state courts offer a plain speedy and 
efficient remedy 
as sole shareholders the foreign corporations have total 
control over the subsidiaries they can direct in all respects 
their subsidiaries pursuit of state court relief from the unitary 
tax white said 
he said the parent firms inability to sue in their own names 
is not determinative 
to rule otherwise would be to elevate form over substance 
white said 
the case is franchise tax board vs alcan aluminium 881400

vice president dan quayle told japans top 
trade official wednesday that easing repression in china depends on 
close coordination among the united states japan and other 
countries officials said 
quayle and hikaru matsunaga japanese minister of international 
trade and industry welcomed chinas announcement that it is easing 
martial law 
but quayle cautioned against goitalone policies declaring 
that the situation has not yet returned to normalcy after last 
summers bloody beijing crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrations 
said japanese embassy spokesman noriyuki shikata 
further improvement depends on action by the chinese side and 
what is important is that other countries coordinate quayle was 
quoted as saying matsunaga said japan wants to cooperate with the 
united states on china while opposing isolation of beijing shikata 
said 
a us official requesting anonymity said quayle told matsunaga 
that american policy toward china was bringing some improvement and 
japan while eager to normalize relations should closely 
coordinate with washington 
during the 30minute meeting matsunaga also reaffirmed japans 
intention to become an import superpower and described to the 
vice president its program to stimulate imports of foreign products 
with tax breaks tariff reductions and overseas missions officials 
said 
matsunaga predicted victory for prime minister toshiki kaifus 
liberal democratic party in next months parliamentary election 
after which he said the usjapan talks will resume on causes of 
trade imbalance that stem from the two countries different 
commercial traditions and lifestyles 
stressing partnership with the united states rather than 
economic rivalry matsunaga arrived tuesday night for two days of 
meetings he also was scheduled to see michael boskin chairman of 
president bushs council of economic advisers secretary of state 
james baker iii commerce secretary robert mosbacher us trade 
representative carla hills national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and environmental protection administrator william reilly 
the united states revitalizing its competitiveness will remain 
the worlds leading economic power and enjoy strong japanese 
political support during the 1990s matsunaga said in a speech 
tuesday 
the united states backed by its great technological prowess 
and its massive supplies of capital and resources will continue to 
have the most important economy for supporting the international 
economic system in the 1990s he told an audience of 
industrialists and civic leaders in dallas before flying to 
washington 
such statements addressed anxieties reflected in occasional us 
opinion polls showing japan with its powerful economy overshadowing 
the soviet union as a threat to the united states future the 
polls reportedly have caused concern among leaders of kaifus 
government 
the minister took pains to defend japan against us accusations 
that it is a closed society and a closed market 
he noted that japan in 1988 boosted imports of manufactured 
goods 39 percent worldwide and 34 percent from the united states 
matsunaga also stressed opportunities for usjapanese 
cooperation both in the asiapacific region and in helping the 
newly democratic countries of east europe move toward market 
economies

a new technique unveiled wednesday that produces 
threedimensional sound seeming to come from many points in a 
room will debut on nationwide television in an advertisement during 
the super bowl 
the creators of qsound believe the technique which gives the 
impression of individual noises or musical notes emanating from 
more than just a pair of speakers could change the sound of music 
television and video games 
it is designed to be heard through a conventional stereo or 
stereo television and will be introduced to the public in a 
cocacola ad during the super bowl broadcast on sunday jan 28 
the ad was shown at a news conference wednesday by archer 
communications inc 
qsound is an innovation that could within the next few years 
fundamentally change the way people hear music play videos 
experience movies and watch tv said lawrence g ryckman 
president of archer communications 
whats unique about qsound archer communications officials 
said is that it doesnt require any special equipment to get the 
threedimensional effect the work is done in the recording studio 
specially developed multipletrack taping machines and computer 
software allows sound engineers to isolate individual instruments 
singers or sounds and make them seem to emanate from specific 
locations in a room 
the technology will enable artists to make recordings that let 
the listener feel that he or she is sitting in front of a live band 
instead of a stereo 
the technique fools the ear says dan lowe the audio 
engineer who helped invent qsound 
the coke ad is an updated version of the 1971 hilltop 
commercial which featured scores of young people singing id 
like to teach the world to sing on a hill in italy 
at the opening of the new 60second ad a viewer can hear a bird 
chirping off to the side and the sound of a breeze from behind the 
main music tracks and featured singers come from the television 
speakers while the voices of the chorus seem to come from 
throughout the room 
cbs will broadcast the super bowl ad in stereo and nearly half 
the networks affiliates are capable of transmitting a stereo 
broadcast according to michael a biendorff vice president of 
marketing planning for cocacola usa the company estimates up to 
20 percent of us television households have stereo tvs 
lowe said archer communications signed an agreement last month 
with nintendo to incorporate qsound in the companys video games 
new games and equipment should be available later this year he 
said 
archer communications with offices in los angeles and calgary 
alberta also hopes to sign deals to record music casettes compact 
discs and movie videocasettes in qsound lowe said 
the companys chairman is george folsey jr a producer of 
movies such as coming to america and trading places who is 
working to market the system in hollywood

texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo expressed regret wednesday about the eastern airlines 
strike but he insisted he was optimistic about the rebuilding 
carrier 
while the airline thats out there today is not as big as the 
airline it was before i believe very strongly and i believe you 
will too when you see it that a lot of quality has been 
substituted for quantity lorenzo told an overflow downtown 
rotary club luncheon crowd of 250 people 
we face the 90s with great optimism he said 
lorenzo walked through a gauntlet of chanting protesting 
machinists whose strike is in its 11th month police officers 
stood guard for the speech the first in south florida in months by 
lorenzo and one of a handful of public appearances hes made in the 
area since texas air bought eastern nearly four years ago 
the last year has been a very difficult one lorenzo told 
his audience there have been mistakes and there have been a lot 
of things i know all parties would like to change 
he added if you look at the last nine months as a battle it 
is a battle no one has won with the possible tiny exception of 
consumers 
he said eastern had lost 1 billion in the eight years before he 
took over and major changes were needed he said union leaders 
were reluctant to face the needed changes but he understood the 
difficulty of their position 
lorenzo said thousands of dedicated eastern employees are out of 
their jobs because they got caught in a system that was no fault 
of their own he said cutting wages and employees was hard from 
a human point of view but there was no choice 
despite his reputation as a union buster he said he doubted any 
other management could have done much differently 
lorenzo said miamibased eastern has had a strong response to 
new discount fares starting at 69 one way and was getting good 
consumer response to its service overall 
he said by midyear the percentage of easterns operating costs 
that are related to labor will be down to 25 percent compared with 
the upper 30s before the strike that began last march 4 
in brief exchanges with reporters as he left lorenzo said 
eastern is very committed to south florida despite sharp 
reductions in its miami flight operations ahead of the planned sale 
of its latin american routes to american airlines he said there 
were no plans to liquidate eastern 
frank ortis the machinists union local 702 president wasnt 
allowed to attend the speech he said afterward that lorenzo is 
in big trouble as he tries to bring eastern out of chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization 
eastern filed for protection from creditors five days after the 
strike began and proceeded to rebuild by hiring nonunion 
replacement workers 
eastern is plagued by cancellations and their load factors 
have been disastrous ortis said its time for frank lorenzo 
to come to his senses and sell the airline so we can save it 
although union pilots and flight attendants ended their sympathy 
walkouts in late november ortis said 96 percent of the machinists 
remain on strike 
more than 100 protesters greeted lorenzo with chants of choke 
frank choke and warned rotarians to secure your wallets 
they wanted to let lorenzo know were not going to go away 
ortis said

while boeing cos defense people are competing 
for weapons contracts colleagues in another part of the aerospace 
giant a few miles away are talking about peddling jumbo jetliners 
to the soviets 
its an apparent contradiction that reflects problems facing 
many defense contractors struggling to adapt to the soviet blocs 
transformation that has lessened the threat of war 
but the disparity seems especially acute at boeing a leading 
civilian manufacturer as well as a pentagon supplier of weapons 
gear ranging from stealth bomber parts to lance missiles 
the other day we were talking about a new system thats a 
followon to lance said b dan pinick president of the new 
boeing defense amp space group i said well gee who are we 
going to shoot em at you know those are our customers now 
the big thaw as the eastwest relaxation sometimes is called 
has come at an awkward time for boeing which has been losing money 
on the military side anyway and wanted to improve its chance to 
land more defense work 
that prospect may be more remote because defense secretary dick 
cheney has ordered the armed services to plan on cutting 180 
billion in spending from fiscal 1992 to 1994 
boeing already has felt the spending pinch with the halt of 
production spending on the v22 vertical takeoff plane its 
building with bell helicopter textron and likely delays in 
production of the radarfooling stealth bomber for which boeing is 
a major subcontractor 
on jan 1 boeing formally consolidated its military and 
aerospace divisions into boeing defense amp aerospace group as part 
of an effort to make the business profitable 
boeing aerospace amp electronics already combined in 1989 was 
melded with boeing advanced systems boeing helicopters military 
programs of boeing military airplanes and argosystems its military 
electronics company 
on the civilian side meanwhile orders for jetliners are at an 
alltime high and foreign customers include a number of communist 
countries once considered potential us enemies 
moreover over the past few months boeing aides have been 
talking about possible sales to the soviets who have expressed 
interest in 747s and other big planes far more advanced and 
quieter than their own ilyushin models a couple of kremlin 
aviation emissaries recently visited boeings seattle complex to 
talk about a potential order 
nonetheless pinick said he isnt ready to concede an end to the 
cold war which once helped carry boeing through hard times in the 
1970s when jetliner sales foundered defense work softened the 
impact 
now while its commercial business powers boeing to record 
profits the company has said the military and aerospace segments 
will show a loss when the books are closed on 1989 
in 1988 those segments made just 29 million before taxes on 
revenues of 5125 billion in 1986 they had operating profits of 
422 million on revenues of 6 billion 
were in a valley now but over time i think well demonstrate 
our historic ability to provide an attractive return pinick 
said or we get out of the business i mean its simple we 
arent going to do this for any other reason 
boeings military profits were hurt in the late 1980s by a 
number of lucrative contracts ending at the same time the company 
was competing for new work said aerospace analyst paul nisbet of 
prudentialbache securities in new york it also was a time when 
the pentagon was demanding contractors assume more financial risk

no sooner had conrail made james a hagen 
its fourth chairman in five months when a new problem emerged for 
the freighthauling giant a former governmentrun hodgepodge of 
bankrupt railroads 
we could see early on in the summer that the economy was 
starting to slip a little the autos the steel the housing 
hagen said the pieces of business that really make a difference 
to conrail were really starting to slide 
it was baptism by fire for hagen who was immediately forced to 
trim one of the nations biggest freight companies 
this was especially difficult because conrail already had been 
pared and restructured from its financially ailing roots the 
jumble of a half dozen northeast railroads taken over by the 
government in 1976 and resold to the public more than a decade 
later 
hagen cut costs combined trains curbed maintenance and 
eliminated hundreds of jobs the effort seemed to work conrails 
thirdquarter profit rose 48 percent despite a 59 percent drop in 
freight 
whether we can continue to do that or not well just have to 
see hagen said 
a lot of conrails future requires a waitandsee attitude this 
spring conrail loses its government protection against takeovers 
moreover the uncertain economy can play havoc with demand for 
freight conrails lifeline it provides a challenge to make it 
come out right when the traffic starts sliding like it is now 
hagen said in a recent interview at conrails philadelphia office 
but on the other hand thats the job youre supposed to figure 
it out and how to make the equation come out as best you can 
hagen has said conrail the nations fifthlargest railroad in 
freight revenue expects to show another traffic decline when 
fourthquarter figures are calculated higherrevenue freight 
including autos auto parts and chemicals is down while 
lowerrevenue freight such as coal is up 
that means the trimming hagen began to keep conrail profitable 
isnt over conrail recently said it would cut 450 nonunion jobs 
reduce the fleet of 68500 freight cars and 1946 locomotives and 
make them haul more frequently 
hagen 57 became chairman president and chief executive 
officer may 18 three months after the sudden death of richard d 
sanborn 
sanborn had held the same titles just six weeks his death was 
an unexpected jolt in an otherwise smooth transition from l 
stanley crane the former southern railway executive who guided 
conrail into the private sector after 11 years of direct government 
involvement 
stanley eg hillman was acting chairman during the search for 
sanborns replacement 
hagen a 31year railroad veteran known for innovations in 
marketing was plucked from csx transportation inc the railroad 
subsidiary of richmond vabased csx corp 
he had been conrails senior vice president for marketing and 
sales from 1977 to 1985 and earlier played a role in conrails 
formation at the us railway association the agency created to 
cope with the threat of losing rail service in the northeast 
the background helped as hagen took the 450000ayear job at 
conrail which operates in 14 northeastern and midwestern states 
and quebec 
i knew a lot of the people i knew the environment i knew the 
system knew the railroad hagen said but one of the things 
thats changed is that were out in the marketplace and were a 
publicly held company 
in that marketplace conrails stock price ended 1989 at 
47875 up 419 percent from 3375 at the first of the year part 
of the reason was speculation that an eventual takeover offer would 
emerge 
one reason conrail might be attractive is the railroads small 
longterm debt a lower price than its 60 book value and cash 
reserves of about 600 million that means the stock is potentially 
worth more if the company is sold and broken up again 
but the rumors about a takeover have been offset by an 
expectation that conrail will move to protect itself before 
government restrictions end april 2 on how much of conrail any 
single investor can own 
president bush recently signed legislation that would enable the 
company to buy back significant amounts of its own stock one 
possible antitakeover defense 
i think they conrail executives have the ability and the 
means and probably the desire to move the stock up so they dont 
show up on any computer screen of undervalued companies said 
anthony hatch a railroad analyst in new york for painewebber inc 
the railroad is reviewing its corporate financial structure and 
expects to report the results early this year hagen said the 
review would focus on how the company can best allocate money for 
the future 
he said he expects conrail to remain independent and continue 
relationships with railroads west of the mississippi river rather 
than merging with another major carrier to form a transcontinental 
railroad 
the review is separate from what hagen described as a 
daybyday evaluation of whether it should cut its labor force 
below the 1988 average of 32595 employees down from 82877 in 
1978 for the third quarter the average number of employees was 
32285 down from 34088 a year earlier 
hatch said it is too early to size hagen up because hes been 
in the job a short time and followed strong leaders in crane and 
sanborn nonetheless hatch said i think he looks like the man 
for the job i think conrail is a company that is very well run and 
its doing some very smart things now

shamrock broadcasting inc said wednesday 
it would sell two tv stations and three radio stations to cut debt 
that it incurred during an aggressive fiveyear expansion 
shamrock which is privately owned by the roy e disney family 
said it would sell kmgcfm in dallas to cook inlet radio partners 
lp for 22 million 
the other stations to be sold are kudlfm and whbam in kansas 
city mo kxxvtv in waco texas and ktabtv in abilene texas 
shamrock did not identify the investors seeking to buy those four 
stations which are expected to fetch about 30 million 
were talking with some folks about the texas properties 
shamrock president bill clark said in a telephone interview 
were just putting kansas city on the market 
in a statement clark said the increasing maturity of our 
stations operating in a more intense competitive environment 
together with some uncertainty on the economic front influenced our 
decision 
during a fiveyear period that ended in october shamrock bought 
a number of failed or startup stations for stick value the 
rockbottom price for an antenna and license it grew from five 
stations in four markets to 15 stations in 10 markets during that 
time 
so we had some pretty severe cash flow drains during the 
startup process clark said were not a negative cash flow 
company by any means but now we want to maximize cash flow 
from our remaining stations 
the sale of the stations will leave shamrock with just one 
television station wtvq in lexington ky 
clark described shamrocks recent business as excellent with 
growth in advertising revenue of 24 percent last year compared with 
7 percent for the broadcast industry as a whole 
with the sales shamrock will be focusing on larger markets 
where it already has radio stations such as san francisco 
seattle detroit houston atlanta pittsburgh denver and phoenix 
kmgc was part of starr broadcasting which was purchased for 36 
million by roy disney walt disneys nephew and vice chairman of 
the walt disney co when he started shamrock 10 years ago 
shamrock also will defer taxes on the sale of kmgc under a 
federal law encouraging sales of stations to minorityowned 
companies the cook inlet partnership involves aleuts eskimos and 
american indians

precious metal futures prices surged wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange on the heels of an energy rally the sliding 
stock market and concern over the political climate in the soviet 
union 
on other markets energy futures were sharply higher grain and 
soybeans were lower livestock and pork were mixed and copper 
declined 
gold settled 8 to 840 higher with the contract for delivery 
in february at 41420 a troy ounce silver was 7 cents to 72 
cents higher with march at 5368 a troy ounce 
the surge in gold prices began overnight with rumors that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev had resigned said analyst bette 
raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc the rumors proved 
false but they stepped up demand for gold among japanese and 
european buyers 
the sharp drop of the tokyo stock exchange in recent days also 
spurred gold buying as did a 15point drop wednesday in the dow 
jones industrial average 
a violent railroad strike in south africa a leading gold 
producer also caused concern in the gold market 
a secondary factor was a surge in energy prices on new yorks 
mercantile exchange analysts say some investors view increased 
crude prices as an inflation barometer and the gold market as an 
inflation hedge 
the rise came amid continued concern over supplies following 
american petroleum institute inventory data said jerry samuels an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the api figures released tuesday showed a drawdown of 64 
million barrels in gasoline stocks last week more than was 
expected there also was a decrease in stocks of distillates which 
include heating oil but a slight increase in crude oil stocks 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 45 cents to 83 cents 
higher with february at 2290 a barrel heating oil was 140 cents 
to 2 cents higher with february at 6688 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 120 cents to 345 cents higher with february at 6433 
cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the chicago 
board of trade 
a lack of export business dragged down wheat prices as traders 
showed disappointment over the soviet unions failure to make 
additional purchases after 480000 metric ton buy of us wheat 
tuesday 
forecasts of rain for the central plains which would aid the 
growth of the winter wheat crop also hampered futures prices corn 
prices were pressured by increased marketing by farmers said 
analyst joel karlin of research department inc in chicago 
soybeans were pushed down by reports of rain in south america 
which should help the growth of soybean crops by increased selling 
and by the failure of new business to materialize in the soy oil 
market 
wheat was a cent to 1 cents lower with march at 405 a 
bushel corn was cent to 1 cents lower with march at 238 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 145 
cents a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
january at 567 a bushel 
copper prices slipped lower on the comex with the sliding stock 
market being cited by analysts for the metals poor performance 
copper was 115 cents to 210 cents lower with january at 1087 
a pound 
livestock and pork futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
live cattle were 08 cent lower to 65 cent higher with february

ames department stores inc on wednesday 
slashed 85 jobs in its corporate offices and announced plans to 
eliminate the zayre name by renaming the last surviving zayre 
stores as ames outlets 
the discount retailer acknowledging that it had overestimated 
customer loyalty to the 392 zayre stores it bought in 1988 also 
announced wednesday that a sluggish fourth quarter will prevent the 
company from showing a profit this year 
ames still adjusting to the acquisition of the zayre chain 
announced last month that it was closing 18 stores mostly in the 
northeast ames bought zayre corps discount store division for 
778 million in october 1988 
by renaming the last 61 zayre stores ames will eliminate the 
expense of separate advertising campaigns and will streamline 
delivery systems the company said 
ames president peter b hollis blamed the disappointing fourth 
quarter on the stagnant northeast economy soft sales at zayre 
stores and an unusually competitive holiday selling season 
the retailer lost 226 million in the first nine months of 
1989 but had been predicting a profit for the year 
the company offered no estimate of its fourth quarter earnings 
l wayne hood a retail analyst for prudential bache securities 
estimated that ames would earn 195 million in the fourth quarter 
to close out the year with a net loss of about 31 million 
our profit shortfall is due entirely to a sales shortfall at 
the acquired stores despite a significant reduction in the zayre 
historic expense level hollis said in a statement issued from 
the companys rocky hill conn headquarters the ames stores 
continue to perform well 
citing the uncertain economy hollis said the company is taking 
the following steps 
elminating 325 positions from its planned total of 2100 jobs 
at corporate offices in rocky hill and west hartford conn about 
240 of those jobs were never filled so 85 people will lose their 
jobs immediately ames spokesman bill roberts said 
reducing the companys capital investment budget for the year 
ending jan 26 1991 
renaming the remaining 61 zayre stores as ames stores ames 
closed 74 zayre stores shortly after buying the chain renamed 254 
and left 61 as zayre stores mostly in chicago miami and the 
baltimorewashington areas the company thought at the time that 
the zayre name was popular with innercity consumers especially 
minorities 
we thought that there was customer loyalty roberts said 
our original idea was to use that loyalty as a base to build on 
quite frankly the name didnt seem to matter at all we think that 
using the ames name instead will eliminate all confusion 
ames with 690 discount stores in 20 states is the nations 
fourth largest discount retailer 
hood the prudential bache analyst said ames must remodel many 
of its stores especially former zayre stores to stay competitive 
in the 1990s the company plans to remodel 65 stores this year 
replacing long monotonous racks of clothing with smaller xshaped 
display racks wider aisles and brighter more colorful displays 
in order for them to make this thing work they need to get a 
major portion of the remodeling done hood said i dont really 
see them turning the corner until 1991 or 1992 
ames stock lost 87 cents in consolidated new york stock

the tokyo stock exchange which soared to a series 
of record highs at the close of 1989 has marked the new year with 
a lengthy dive pushed along by rumors speculation and general 
financial market pessimism 
between the opening of 1990 trading on jan 4 and the markets 
close on wednesday the key 225share nikkei stock average fell 
1219 points or 31 percent from its record close of 3891587 at 
the end of 1989 
the drop included a more than 438point tumble on jan 5 the 
markets biggest daily decline in nearly 3 months 
analysts say rumors and speculation not fundamental economic 
worries have sent the market sliding 
the jan 5 selloff was sparked by reports that soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev had cancelled all appointments with foreign 
leaders in january raising concerns about the possible fallout 
from ethnic unrest in the soviet union and the rapid pace of change 
in eastern europe 
other marketdepressing rumors have included talk that a 
prominent japanese politician faced arrest in an insider stock 
trading case 
whenever market players become pessimistic and markets become 
weak they overwhelmingly react to rumors and they sell more 
said yamaichi securities analyst kenji maeshiro 
the selloff in stocks also has depressed bond prices and 
weakened the yen against the us dollar a triple low 
the dollar has gained 190 yen since last years close of 14340 
yen despite active dollarselling by the bank of japan to support 
the yen 
the futures price for 10year government bonds has dropped some 
4 yen and fell below the 100yen level for the first time since 
september 1988 that drop stemmed from fears that the yens decline 
would mean higher inflation a weaker yen raises costs of imported 
fuel and raw materials and higher interest rates said seiki 
inami a bond analyst with sanwa bank 
a little selling by some investors earlier this year 
accelerated selling by others who had kept bonds for too long 
waiting for a chance to sell inami said 
after wednesdays session the stock exchange announced it was 
easing regulations on margin trading to encourage buying and 
rejuvenate the market beginning thursday traders could count 
securities used as collateral in margin trading at 60 percent of 
their real value up from the previous 50 percent 
yamaichis maeshiro speculated the stock market could recover 
soon because it has fallen back to the level it held before its 
yearending spurt 
but there is little hope for the recovery unless the foreign 
exchange and the bond markets are restabilized he said 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news conference 
wednesday that exchange rates cannot long stay out of line with 
economic fundamentals and that the best response is coordinated 
intervention by the group of seven countries the united states 
japan west germany britain france canada and italy 
mieno said he was not worried about the stock market plunge 
because the index merely had fallen back to its level of early 
december 
yoshio shimoyama a nikko securities dealer also saw the 
downturn as a temporary price adjustment 
the market needed some speed and price adjustments after the 
surge so that it can rise again shimoyama said 
still analysts expect some nervousness to remain in the market 
at least until national elections for the lower house of 
parliament expected in february 
the probusiness liberal democratic party lost its majority in 
the less powerful upper house last july as voters showed their 
dissatisfaction over a new 3 percent sales tax and a series of 
money and sex scandals 
the governing party has rebounded in public opinion polls since 
then and the popularity of the opposition socialists has declined 
but questions remain over whether the ldp can keep its majority in 
the lower house which has the decisive voice in adopting the 
budget and naming the prime minister

the company through which a young 
entrepreneur hopes to gain control of bond corp holdings inc lost 
its corporate license in 1987 after failing to file its annual list 
of officers according to nevada state records 
weatherby investments inc has never been reinstated as a 
corporation according to documents provided wednesday to the 
associated press by the office of the nevada secretary of state 
jeff reynolds a 28yearold texan who identifies himself as the 
chairman of weatherby has said he can inject as much as 197 
million in new capital in return for control of bond 
the huge australian brewing and media conglomerate is near 
collapse under the weight of 6 billion in debt reynolds insisted 
wednesday that he had lined up the money and said he was trying to 
negotiate additional financing to service that huge debt load 
but he refused to reveal even in general terms the sources of 
his financing and he described the lapsed corporate license as a 
screw up by his staff or attorneys 
i dont know about it its not the kind of thing i deal with 
its something you should talk to the legals about he said 
its something thats embarrassing to me and theres going to be 
some heads roll 
asked if one of his attorneys could be made available to discuss 
the lapsed license he said personally i dont think its worth 
it 
reynolds a virtual unknown on the investment scene made the 
offer last week through weatherby and what he claims is its parent 
singaporebased california pacific international pte ltd which he 
also said he controls he spoke in a telephone interview from his 
mothers house in houston 
reynolds earlier claimed that shares in weatherby were publicly 
traded but securities officials said they had no record of that 
in addition the address he gave for the company in los angeles 
turned out to be a mail drop 
utah records show weatherby was incorporated in that state in 
1984 and as of january 1986 had the stated purpose of investing 
and engaging in any and all other businesses 
in march 1986 it was reincorporated in nevada under the same 
name with reynolds father l george reynolds of dallas as 
president 
the corporation missed its annual refiling in january 1987 and 
was listed as delinquent until september 1987 when its standing 
was revoked according to the nevada secretary of state 
jeff reynolds said that when his father ran the company its 
assets were oklahoma oil and gas properties 
he said he took control in summer 1988 his father stepped down 
as a director in december 1988 the company became a shell 
company for a time and it now has his holdings rather than his 
fathers 
the companys holdings now include canadian and us oil gas 
and mining operations some texas real estate and some businesses 
in thailand that are not held by the parent california pacific 
international he said 
the last figures released publicly on march 31 showed 
weatherby with 93 million in shareholders equity about 100 
million in assets and little debt reynolds said 
he said that since then both debt and equity have risen sharply 
as he transferred assets into weatherby were a 300 million 
organization now he contended

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange fell 
thursday while the us dollar moved marginally lower against the 
japanese yen 
the dollar was changing hands at 14520 yen at late morning it 
started trading at 14523 yen down 007 yen from wednesdays 
14530yen close here and moved from 14520 to 14550 yen it 
ended at 14555 yen in new york overnight 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 8786 points or 023 
percent ending the morning session at 3760865 it shed 25495 
points wednesday 
the nikkei index headed higher on broad smalllot buying 
earlier due to relaxed regulations on margin trading dealers said 
the stock exchange thursday began assessing securities used as 
collateral in margin trading at 60 percent of their real value 
rather than the previous 50 percent in a step to encourage buying 
and to rejuvenate the market 
but the index fell back as institutional investors stepped to 
the sidelines said kazumasa iijima a dealer with nippon kangyo 
kakumaru securities co 
market players just are not in a buying mood mainly because 
of uncertainties over the election he said 
a national election for the lower house of parliament is 
expected in february and the market is largely concerned with 
whether the governing liberal democratic party can retain its 
majority in the house 
the ldp lost its majority in the less powerful upper house last 
year as a result of money and sex scandals involving the partys 
cabinet members and an unpopular consumption tax 
in currency trading the dollaryen rate was moving narrowly 
after a surge in the dollar earlier this week sentiment for the 
dollar remained bullish but market players were reluctant to push 
the us currency higher for fear of another central bank 
intervention said toaru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new 
japan securities co 
the bank of japan has actively sold the dollar in the past two 
days to support the yen 
market rumors that the us federal reserve board sold the 
dollar for yen wednesday and news about the resignation of the 
executive vice president and chief financial officer of campeau 
corp also accelerated the markets waitandsee mood kanai said 
campeau a canadian real estate company that owns us 
department store chains including bloomingdales has been in 
financial trouble and there is speculation its department store 
units would file for bankruptcy protection 
but the dollar is basically strong as buying of the west 
german mark has slowed while the yen isnt attracting anybody

a federal judge tuesday dismissed a 
multimilliondollar lawsuit alleging that ford motor co did not 
warn of seatbelt dangers to minors the lawsuit was settled out of 
court 
the lawsuit was filed in us district court in may 1987 by 
katherine m ward of eaton whose 10yearold daughter was 
paralyzed after an accident involving a 1979 ford bronco 
the suit originally asked for 245 million but according to 
court documents portions of the suit were settled earlier 
apparently leaving ms ward asking ford for 15 million 
terms of the settlement were kept secret ms wards attorney 
dwight brannon declined to comment 
we believe there was nothing about the ward vehicle that 
caused or contributed to the injuries of its occupants ford 
spokesman mark miller said 
the suit alleged that ford was negligent in failing to warn 
users that shoulder harnesses can cause neck injuries to minors 
when they are fastened crossing the upper torso near the neck 
according to the suit ms wards daughter jessica wilkin was 
a frontseat passenger in a bronco owned by her stepfather herbert 
ward when the accident occurred on aug 22 1983 
the suit alleges that her neck became entangled in the safety 
harness after ward lost control of the vehicle and it left the 
road rolling over several times the girl suffered neck and spinal 
cord injuries and is now a quadriplegic the suit said 
the suit also alleges that the bronco was defective because it 
had an improperly high center of gravity that made it unstable and 
unsafe for turning corners 
the suit originally asked for damages for ward and two other 
ward children who were injured in the accident 
in court documents ford has denied any liability saying its 
product was properly designed and manufactured and contained no 
defects the company also denied that it had any duty to issue a 
warning or that any alleged lack of warning caused any injury

hospitals are not entitled to sue states in 
federal court seeking higher reimbursements for serving medicaid 
patients the state of virginia argued tuesday in the supreme court 
such lawsuits belong in state courts virginia said 
the virginia hospital association suing the state says 95 
acute care hospitals in virginia will lose 1 million a week by 
providing care to medicaid patients at stateset rates that fail to 
cover costs 
thirtyfive states have filed briefs in support of virginia 
a provision approved by congress in 1981 says a state must pay 
for hospital services under rates which the state finds and 
makes assurances satisfactory to the federal government are 
reasonable and adequate the rates must meet the costs of 
efficiently and economically operated hospitals it adds 
r claire guthrie deputy attorney general for virginia said 
the labyrinthian language of the amendment provides states with 
wide latitude in medicaid ratemaking 
under questioning by justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
guthrie said medical providers in virginia may sue in state court 
if they want higher reimbursements 
the amendment interjects private enterprise into the 
medicaid reimbursement process by promoting efficiency and the law 
grants no substantive set of rights to health care providers 
said guthrie 
the us solicitor generals office supported the state of 
virginia saying in a court brief that congress deliberately 
sought to avoid saddling state reimbursement decisions with 
cumbersome federal oversight the solicitor general said it isnt 
plausible to suggest that congress expected hospitals to enforce 
their own views of medicaid ratesetting with lawsuits in federal 
court 
walter dellinger representing the hospital association said 
there is not one word in the legislation saying that we are 
extinguishing the right to sue 
that is in this case the dog that did not bark said 
dellinger referring to a famous case of the fictional detective 
sherlock holmes in which the failure of a watchdog to bark provided 
the essential clue 
in colorado dellinger said officials set up a medicaid 
reimbursement rate structure and then simply cut it in half by 
multiplying everything by 054 
its like they multiplied by last tuesdays trifecta number 
dellinger told court 
colorado officials argued that only a medicaid recipient could 
sue the us circuit court of appeals in denver rejected their 
claim in september 
the appeals court argued that colorados medicaid system 
violates federal law because it reimburses hospitals for less than 
the costs of serving medicaid patients 
if virginias medicaid reimbursement system cannot be 
challenged hospitals will be forced to raise their charges to 
other patients in order to cover costs argued the state hospital 
association 
at stake is the viability of mainstream health care for 
americas poor laurens sartoris the virginia associations 
president told reporters monday 
in a brief filed at the supreme court the state of virginia 
said the original and sole continuing purpose of the medicaid act 
is to create a program which is designed to pay for medical care 
for the eligible poor 
nothing in the legislative history of the act contains even a 
suggestion that congress intended providers to be its beneficiaries 
or to have privately enforceable rights 
the virginia case is scheduled to go to trial feb 26 in us 
district court in richmond the supreme court rejected a request by 
the state to delay the trial pending a decision by the justices

the securities and exchange commission is 
proceeding with plans to allow the multipleexchange listing of new 
options later this month commission chairman richard c breeden 
said tuesday 
but breeden also asked the nations options exchanges to delay 
voluntarily their phasein of multiple listing of existing options 
until june 30 to allow extra time to come up with a system for 
linking the various options trading marketplaces 
the letter was disclosed well after office hours tuesday and 
spokesmen for most of the five exchanges contacted by breeden were 
unreachable for comment 
but in new york american stock exchange chairman james r jones 
issued a statement saying he would cooperate fully with chairman 
breeden and the sec 
an option contract is the right to buy or sell a certain 
security at a specified price for a set period of time options are 
traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded overthecounter via 
computer 
most options on the stocks listed on an exchange now can be 
traded only in one marketplace at a time the privilege for trading 
a specific option assigned by lottery is not permitted on any 
other exchange 
but a controversial rule passed by the sec last may would 
abolish the limitations on multiple trading of options 
all new options listed for trading after jan 22 1990 could be 
traded on any options exchange 
the new rule known as 19c5 also calls for the phasing in of 
options previously traded only on one exchange by jan 22 each 
options exchange would be allowed to list up to 10 options already 
listed on other exchanges 
as of january 1991 the rule would allow the multiple trading of 
all options including those now in existence 
but in a letter to the heads of the american stock exchange the 
chicago board options exchange the new york stock exchange the 
pacific stock exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange breeden 
asked them voluntarily not to seek to listing the 10 existing 
options they would be allowed on or before june 30 1990 
breeden in his fourpage letter to the exchanges said the 
commission had the authority to require development of a specific 
options exchange linkage facility 
but he said it would be preferrable for such a system to be 
designed by the options markets themselves on a joint basis rather 
than being directed by the commission 
breeden left for paris shortly after the letters release to 
attend a conference of international securities regulators 
while asking the exchanges to voluntarily refrain from phasing 
in the old options breeden said if one or more of the exchanges 
indicate an intention to preclude delay or frustrate development 
of a linkage system the commission will consider appropriate 
action

the two companies stood out in a ranking of 305 companies based 
on a survey of more than 8000 directors the magazine said 
tuesday the companies were rated in eight separate categories 
the biggest casualty on this years list was exxon corp which 
plummeted to no 110 it was ranked sixth last year before the 
alaskan oil spill 
merck came out on top overall after being voted the best in 
terms of its innovativeness ability to attract and keep talented 
people financial soundness and the quality of its products and 
services 
philip morris finished a close second and was cited as the best 
company in terms of its quality of management and its value as a 
longterm investment the companys shares gave investors an 
average total return of 301 percent a year from 1979 to 1989 the 
magazine said

two major newspapers are fighting a request for 
a gag order by eastern airlines creditors who seek to stop press 
leaks in the beleaguered airlines 10monthold bankruptcy 
proceeding 
the latest tangle in the eastern saga pits the creditors 
committee against the new york times and dow jones amp co publisher 
of the wall street journal and centers on unauthorized disclosure 
of creditor opinions 
if us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland grants the creditor 
committee request violators could be held in contempt of court 
the times and dow jones say a gag order would violate first 
amendment guarantees and prevent reporting on a story in which much 
of the information has been derived from tips and leaks 
attorneys for the times and dow jones have sent letters to 
lifland who is scheduled to hear the case jan 30 the times has 
filed legal briefs dow jones expects to do so by the jan 15 
deadline spokesman roger may said tuesday 
eastern workers struck last march in an emotional walkout that 
almost immediately sent the moneylosing airline into bankruptcy 
court pilots and flight attendants quit the strike in november but 
machinists union members remain out 
the pilots machinists and flight attendants unions who are 
represented on the creditors committee plan to support the 
panels position union attorneys said eastern also will support 
the creditors request to the court eastern spokesman robin matell 
said from the airlines headquarters in miami 
all creditors committee members agreed last spring to keep 
information discussed by the panel confidential 
in their documents the times and dow jones said courts must 
follow specific guidelines before restraining media access in a 
case their attorneys argue that the creditors request doesnt 
meet those guidelines 
the proposed order would without any showing of need 
judicially silence hundreds of potential speakers and would 
undoubtedly deprive the public of informed views perhaps at odds 
with the party line of the creditors committee itself the 
times says in its brief it crosses all of the established 
barriers to prior restraint 
the times also argues that the creditors request would be 
ineffective and unenforceable and suggests the news leaks havent 
come from the creditors committee 
in addition to the air line pilots association the machinists 
and the transport workers union other members of the creditors 
committee include airbus industrie the european aircraft 
consortium general electric co boeing co united technologies

campeau corp facing a deadline today to pay for merchandise 
shipped to its department stores for the christmas season 
continued to study options to cope with its financial crisis 
the embattled canadian company has looked into the possibility 
of postponing the deadline by informally asking certain suppliers 
if they would be willing to wait for their payments 
there has been widespread speculation among apparel makers 
cosmetics companies and other suppliers that campeau would not be 
able to pay its bills for goods sent to its us stores between 
thanksgiving and christmas 
it is seen as a strong possibility that campeau will put its 
us retail divisions under bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors 
we have been unofficially approached to find out if key 
vendors would agree to step aside or wait 90 days as a means of 
staving off bankruptcy while they wait to restructure a 
spokeswoman for the cosmetics company estee lauder inc who asked 
not to be identified said tuesday 
carol sanger a spokeswoman at campeaus corporate 
communications office in cincinnati confirmed that conversations 
have taken place between the company and certain suppliers 
but she said the possibility of extending the deadline on its 
merchandise bills was among numerous things the company was 
considering but that no decisions had been made 
sanger said campeaus board of directors met again tuesday at 
the companys headquarters in toronto the board also met monday 
the sole announcement to emerge from the toronto office by late 
tuesday was word that two new members had been elected to campeaus 
board both were nominees of the national bank of canada which 
acquired a 29 percent stake in campeau last week after chairman 
robert campeau defaulted on a bank loan to two of his private 
investment companies 
the addition of the two members increased the size of campeaus 
board to 12 the new members are claude ducharme a partner in the 
montreal law firm of desjardins ducharme and roger smock senior 
vice president for real estate and corporate bankingus at the 
national bank of canada 
several executives at clothing companies said they had not had 
any contact with officials from campeau or its two us retail 
divisions allied stores corp and federated department stores 
inc both based in cincinnati 
but they indicated they would not agree to a delay in getting 
paid 
we would have a very strong negative on that we expect to get 
paid at the proper time and have no reason to extend ourselves any 
further than we have said one executive at an apparel 
manufacturing company who spoke on condition of anonymity 
clothing manufacturers for the most part have suspended

the government has begun an inquiry into 
whether basic telephone service in the future should include 
technical innovations such as callforwarding and access to data 
and video networks 
sure to fuel an intense turf battle among the phone cable 
broadcast satellite and newspaper industries going into the next 
century the bush administration said tuesday it wants to have a 
policy in place a year from now 
assistant commerce secretary janice obuchowski said the key 
issues are how how fast and which various elements of the industry 
can best improve us competitiveness and the quality of life in a 
growingly informationbased world economy 
the one thing americans dont have enough of is time she 
said the one thing they seem to be looking for is a simpler way 
of life without simply turning back the clock 
in a 99page notice published tuesday the policyadvising 
national telecommunications and information administration that ms 
obuchowski heads said it wants fresh comments within the next 90 
days from the industry 
among the key questions she said is whether an emerging 
infrastruture of fiber optics satellites cellular phone systems 
fax machines and other technologies is advancing fast enough on its 
own or requires in effect a governmentsponsored 
telecommunications industrial policy 
in the united states we have relied on customer pull or demand 
to set the pace for technology deployment she said some of 
our strategic competitors worldwide have rather more strongly 
relied on government push in setting the pace 
japan for example has set a goal of having a fully fiberoptic 
nationwide voice and data transmission system in operation within 
the next decade 
and the french telephone system already has electronic directory 
services that for example allow callers to ring up various 
merchants with a home computer and compare prices for a particular 
item they want to buy 
the study will tackle headon issues that have widely divided 
the telecommunications industry since the governmentordered 
breakup of the bell system in 1984 
among them are whether the seven regional baby bell 
companies that were spun off atampt into separate enterprises should 
be allowed to transmit video signals across their lines a move 
that could put them into direct competition with the tv cable 
industry 
another is a current prohibition that allows regional phone 
companies to act as a carrier of data services but not as an 
originator the phone companies are challenging those restrictions 
in the us court of appeals and legislation is pending in congress 
that would remove them 
the prohibitions however are supported by the newspaper 
industry which has expressed fears that the phone companies would 
take advantage of their monopoly position to undercut their 
advertising market 
for example a person or store wanting to sell a refrigerator 
could simply punch that information on a computer in his home or 
office for a fee and a potential buyer wanting to compare prices 
and features could dial up the data base and do so 
a lot of the issues tend to be polarizing ms obuchowski 
acknowledged were trying to see the forest for the trees the 
people who have to resolve these ultimtely the congress the 
courts the federal communications commission really ought to be 
focusing on whats good for the economy thats what were trying 
to do here

oil production by opec nations surged 
to an average of 237 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 
1989 the highest level since early 1981 according to estimates 
the international energy agency said tuesday in its monthly oil 
market report that the 13 nations of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries increased output by about 100000 barrels a day 
in december to 239 million barrels a day the highest all year 
the surge in opec output led by saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates topped the cartels selfimposed production 
ceiling of 205 million barrels a day in the octoberdecember 
period 
it also was above the new limit of 22 million barrels a day 
which opec oil ministers recently set for the first half of this 
year opec officials will meet again in march to review market 
conditions 
opecs supply to the market in the last three months of 1989 was 
the highest since it produced 248 million barrels a day in the 
first quarter of 1981 
the producing nations have been able to widen their taps without 
sending prices tumbling because of strongerthanexpected demand 
among consuming nations refinery delays in nonopec producing 
regions also have reduced world supplies 
in september for example amerada hess corps huge refinery in 
st croix virgin islands was heavily damaged by hurricane hugo and 
forced to shut down for several weeks last month an explosion 
temporarily stalled operations at exxon corps baton rouge la 
refinery 
indeed prices have soared in recent weeks above the cartels 
target of 18 a barrel the average price for a basket of seven 
crudes monitored by opec reached 2046 a barrel last week 
the futures price of west texas intermediate the benchmark 
american crude has been in the range of 21 to 23 a barrel 
nick antill an analyst at county natwest in london predicted 
prices would fall because of warmer weather in the united states 
and excess supplies of opec oil 
the energy agency report estimated demand for the cartels oil 
would run slightly more than 21 million barrels a day in the first 
half of this year 
private analysts expect the cartel to reduce production in 
january but not enough to bring it in line with the new supply cap 
of 22 million barrels a day 
antill predicted output would be just slightly under 23 million 
barrels a day this month lucy mullins an analyst at the 
londonbased barclays de zoete wedd also expects production to run 
about that level 
antill said the cartels supply would likely stay strong because 
of the attractiveness of higher prices to the producing nations 
moreover he said it appeared saudi arabia the cartels 
biggest producer was determined to maintain its onequarter 
percent share of opecs total production to do that the kingdom 
would have to increase its output if other countries did 
the energy agency report estimated that saudi arabia produced 
56 million barrels a day in december its output quota was about 5 
million barrels a day in the last quarter of the year 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer was quoted recently 
by the cartels opecna news agency as saying the country was 
producing 54 million barrels a day right at its limit for the 
first half of the year 
the report estimated kuwait and the united arab emirates 
considered opecs troublesome quotacheaters produced at about 
double their quotas in december 
the production agreement arranged for the januaryjune period 
set kuwaits quota at 15 million barrels a day sharply up from 
11 million barrels late last year kuwait got a bigger share of 
opecs production pie in an effort to curb its overproduction 
the united arab emirates quota remained the same 
the energy agency reported december production by iran and iraq 
at about their caps of 29 million barrels a day for the last 
quarter of 1989 
indonesia produced about 13 million barrels a day nigeria 18 
million barrels algeria 800000 barrels and venezuela 18 
million barrels the report said 
others were ecuador 300000 barrels a day gabon 200000 
barrels libya 12 million barrels and qatar 400000 barrels 
the energy agency is an arm of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development formed by twodozen industrial nations

the ec commission said tuesday it had 
closed an anticompetition case against the us soft drink 
manufacturer cocacola co satisfied that the company had ended 
anticompetitive practices throughout the european community 
the commission said the undertakings by the us company to end 
anticompetitive practices would ensure that competition in the 
softdrinks market of the ec will be strengthened to the 
advantage of both cocacola cos competitors and consumers 
it added that consumers would have the choice between a larger 
range of drinks 
the commission opened the case in 1987 after receiving 
complaints from an italian softdrinks manufacturer that cocacola 
which already held a dominant position in the italian beverages 
market was abusing this position by granting fidelity rebates 
to large distribution chains as a reward for selling only cocacola 
the plaintiff said these rebates obstructed market access for 
competitors 
cocacola agreed to modify its contracts with distributors of 
its beverages to no longer provide for any kind of rebate although 
this undertaking was accepted by the commission it did not close 
the case when the modified agreements took effect jan 1 1988 
because it wanted to check that the company did not have 
anticompetitive contracts in other ec countries 
the commission said in a statement tuesday it was satisfied the 
company would no longer include any of the following provisions in 
contracts with distributors of its beverages in the 12nation trade 
bloc 
grant distributors rebates or other advantages on condition 
that they do not purchase other cola flavored beverages 
grant distributors rebates for buying a target quantity of 
cocacola within three consecutive months 
grant distributors rebates for buying a target quantity of both 
cocacola and other beverages produced by cocacola co 
grant rebates if the distributor buys one or more other 
beverages produced by cocacola co along with cocacola

social activists have updated their battle plan 
for a wouldbe shoppers revolt issuing a halfinchthick pocket 
guide to the environmental and political records of more than 150 
us companies 
the aim is to encourage manufacturers to pursue progressive 
policies authors of the new edition of shopping for a better 
world said tuesday the payoff they offer loyalty from concerned 
shoppers 
many consumers want to buy from socially responsible 
companies said alice tepper marlin head of the council on 
economic priorities the books publisher what does it take for 
that to happen it takes information 
her groups work released at a manhattan news conference 
offers data galore it lists 1800 consumer products by brand 
rating their makers in 11 policy categories supermarket chains and 
oil companies also are scored 
which toothpaste maker gives the most to charity which 
shavingcream company does business in south africa which pasta 
purveyor also produces cigarettes which companies have women and 
minorities in top management which recycle or offer day care the 
guide advises 
the purpose is to provide an incentive for companies to 
improve their social performance marlin said its also to 
provide a way for people to be more comfortable with their 
purchases to integrate their lifestyles so their market behavior 
reflects their value system 
a growing group of activists is pushing the notion of spending 
with a political purpose from environmentally aware mailorder 
houses to socially sensitive investment funds but experts on 
consumer behavior are split on the key issue whether enough 
consumers care to make a real impact 
if all else is equal people would prefer to make purchases 
based on these secondary objectives said richard curtin 
consumer survey director for the institute for social research at 
the university of michigan but in most cases all else isnt 
equal 
instead curtins research indicates that most consumers rarely 
get past their chief criteria price and quality 
others differ buying products by the companys ethical 
position is going to be the absolute direction in the 1990s said 
faith popcorn chairwoman of brainreserve inc which forecasts 
consumer trends by studying popular culture people are looking 
for the soul behind the logo 
one gauge may be the shopping guides success so far the first 
edition sold 350000 copies last year many in bulk sales to groups 
that offered it as a membership enticement the utne reader 
magazine bought more than 100000 copies for its subscribers and 
ballantine books confident of an even wider market is 
copublishing the new edition 
with those sales its clear that a lot of people are thinking 
this way said roland rust a marketing professor at vanderbilt 
university in nashville you see socially aware mutual funds you 
see people boycotting companies that create ecological disasters 
its quite clear theres something going on 
there is other evidence of a growth in concerned shopping coop 
america a catalog company for goods it regards as socially 
responsible added 15000 members for a total of 45000 last 
year seventh generation whose catalog offers environmentally 
sound products says its filling 1000 orders per week 
still there is at least one pitfall to socially conscious 
shopping debate over which policies are appropriate for a company 
and who decides 
for example shopping for a better world negatively rates 
firms that sell supplies to south african companies but the us 
firms maintain that theyre doing good by preserving jobs for 
blacks there 
and there is the case of eden foods a small natural foods 
company in clinton mich that is rated negatively for among 
other things having no minorities in top management 
the area we live in is very wasp said martha johnson 
marketing director for the company were in a tiny little town 
in the country and theres not much we can do about that

mgmua communications co plans to 
reemphasize film production after its failed efforts to sell 
itself to ted turner rupert murdoch australias qintex group and 
others 
the chief interest of most wouldbe buyers has been the rich 
united artists film library and mgms lion logo many in the 
entertainment business had feared the company would be carved up 
and movie production end at a studio with two of hollywoods most 
famous names 
we decided it was time to get moving with this company 
mgmua chairman jeffrey c barbakow told a shareholders meeting 
here tuesday 
barbakow reported that losses in the companys first fiscal 
quarter which ended nov 30 narrowed to just more than 2 
million he said the communications giant is now 100 percent 
focused on building our operating entities 
barbakow did not rule out the future sale of all or part of 
mgmua to turner or anyone else but he said at this time we 
believe it is not in the shareholders interest 
mgmua blamed its firstquarter loss and a 75 million loss for 
fiscal 1989 mainly on fewer films in production and release 
feature film production nearly halted at mgmua during the past two 
years while billionaire kirk kerkorian the controlling 
shareholder tried to find a buyer 
the company said it will release at least 15 films this year 
beginning in mid1990 including those produced elsewhere that it 
distributes 
mgmua film group president richard berger said a production 
fund of 170 million to 185 million had been authorized for 1990 
plus a large movie development fund 
eight movies with budgets in the 15 million25 million range 
will be developed and higherbudget production will begin in the 
rocky and james bond series he said 
mgmua recorded significant gains in operating revenue and 
operating income in its first quarter barbakow said but the lack 
of new feature films resulted in a net loss for the period 
the company reported a loss of 202 million or 4 cents a 
share on operating revenue of 2115 million for the same period 
last year mgmua reported a 395 million loss or 78 cents a 
share against revenue of 1704 million 
turner had been widely reported to be in negotiations for 
mgmua and as recently as december the two sides were reported to 
be considering a stock swap turner was seeking to acquire the 
united artists film library for his cable television empire after 
having acquired the mgm film library in recent years 
barbakow said the company is just emerging from a transition 
period following the october termination of our merger agreement 
with qintex the australian company whose 15 billion buyout 
offer failed for lack of financing qintex had outbid murdochs 
20th century fox studio by 100 million 
mgmuas last big releases were rain man and licence to 
kill 
the company said the coming releases included stanley and 
iris starring robert deniro and jane fonda blue steel a 
thriller with ron silver and jamie lee curtis and desperate 
hours a suspense story with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins 
in addition mgmua said several films are in various stages of 
preproduction or development including sylvester stallones 
rocky v a comedy starring john candy called delirious and 
a film version of pat conroys novel prince of tides starring 
and directed by barbra streisand

accounting firms that handle the books of most 
publicly traded us companies will be subject to tougher industry 
review of their auditing practices under a rule adopted by a major 
professional group 
the rule approved tuesday by members of the american institute 
of certified public accountants marked the culmination of the 
groups fouryear effort to mandate quality control in the 
profession 
the measure requires firms that have even one publicly traded 
company as a client to submit to a review of their methods by other 
firms a socalled peer review every three years 
the rule also requires that a report on the reviews be kept in a 
public file the report and the peer review are subject to 
oversight from an independent private board said charles kaiser 
jr this years chairman of the board of aicpa and chairman of the 
accounting firm pannell kerr forster 
companies that make public offerings of stock or other 
securities must register with the securities and exchange 
commission and provide accurate and adequate disclosure of certain 
facts including the makeup of the companys management and its 
financial condition a fact that must be certified by independent 
public accountants 
kaiser said the public oversight board which consists of 
nonaccountants is headed by former sec commissioner aa somer 
the accountants vote was disclosed at aicpas 17th annual 
conference on securities and exchange commission developments in 
washington the proposal was approved by twothirds of the 150000 
members of the aicpa who voted during a 90day voting period that 
ended monday 
officials of the association which has total membership of some 
290000 say their membership audits 85 percent to 90 percent of 
the nations public companies 
a similar peer review proposal was submitted to the membership 
in 1986 while approved by a simple majority of all those voting 
it did not receive a twothirds majority as required by the 
institutes rules 
its part of a long effort to improve the selfregulatory 
function within the profession said kaiser 
the aicpa governs auditing procedures and ethical standards in 
the accounting profession the institute also prepares and grades 
the uniform cpa examination 
the rule change requires public accounting firms with aicpa 
members to join previously it was voluntary the institutes sec 
practice section if the firm has even one secregistered client 
individual accountants not firms make up the aicpa membership 
but kaiser said individual accountants could lose their membership 
if their firm had a publicly traded client but did not join the sec 
practice section 
one of the requirements for membership in the sec practice 
session is submission to review of the firms accounting methods 
every three years

the justice department plans to file suit to 
try to block the gillette cos attempt to acquire most of 
wilkinson swords worldwide razorblade business 
the justice department on tuesday said the plans by the nations 
largest manufacturer of razor blades for shaving may 
substantially lessen competition in violation of the clayton act 
and would pose a significant risk of higher prices to us 
consumers 
gillettes acquisition of the noneuropean operations of 
wilkinson sword would pose a significant threat to competition in 
the wet shaving razor blade market in the united states alison 
l smith acting head of the justice departments antitrust 
division said in a statement 
the announcement said the department planned to file its case in 
us district court in washington 
this acquisition would eliminate one of the only four other 
suppliers of blades and would further increase gillettes dominant 
share ms smith said the antitrust laws do not tolerate such 
a loss of competition 
in boston gillette senior vice president and general counsel 
joseph e mullaney said the company was very surprised and 
disappointed that they are bringing what we consider a precipitous 
action 
he said competition would not be harmed because other razor 
makers such as shick and bic would remain in the field 
were going to tell the court we think this is unnecessary 
mullaney said 
gillette sold about 65 percent of the nations blades in 1988 
wilkinson sold about 3 percent 
wilkinson sword until recently owned by stora of sweden was 
sold to a dutch corporation in a leveraged buyout partially 
financed by gillette which is based in boston 
the dutch company in turn has agreed to sell wilkinson swords 
business outside the european common market to gillette the 
department said 
in addition gillette will end up with a 229 percent nonvoting 
interest in the newly created dutch company swedish match bv 
which retained the european business of wilkinson as well as a 
match and lighter business also acquired from stora 
the transactions announced late last month involved a gillette 
investment of about 155 million the company said which includes 
72 million for wilkinsons noneuropean business 14 million for 
the stake in swedish match and 69 million to help finance the debt 
for the transaction 
the justice department announcement came just hours after the 
department filed suit in philadelphia to block the merger of two 
industrial razorblade companies 
the justice department charged in the civil antitrust suit that 
american safety razor cos acquisition of ardell industries inc 
might lessen competition in industrial blades 
american safety razor of verona va and ardell based in 
union nj were the nations largest and secondlargest sellers 
of industrial singleedge blades for cutting trimming and scraping 
asr bought the outstanding shares of ardell in april for 127 
million

united airlines plans to expand its routes and 
buy new aircraft could be jeopardized if ual corp decides to 
recapitalize saddling the parent company with a much larger debt 
load an analyst says 
the new york times meanwhile citing unidentified sources 
reported in todays editions that uals management and unions will 
again attempt to assemble a buyout proposal 
the ual board of directors announced monday it had instructed 
its financial adviser first boston corp to explore the merits of 
recapitalizing the company 
such a recapitalization essentially changing the companys 
levels of debt and equity might be used to raise cash for a 
special payment to shareholders 
ual plans to present a proposal at its next board meeting jan 
25 
the new york investor group coniston partners which owns 118 
percent of uals stock has threatened an attempt to oust the 
companys board of directors if ual does not undertake a buyout 
recapitalization or other move to boost its stock value 
i think it recapitalization would limit their flexibilty to 
finance future expansion and new purchases of airliners said 
analyst robert decker of the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps 
inc 
united has about 500 aircraft on order or under option it 
recently announced plans to expand its service to europe and the 
pacific rim 
a recapitalization also could add to managementemployee 
problems uniteds pilots have been working without a contract 
since 1988 and its contract with flight attendants expired in 1987 
the new york times meantime said ual chairman stephen m wolf 
was scheduled to begin a series of meetings with employees today to 
assemble a buyout proposal which would offer the unions a large 
stake in the company 
but ual spokesman rob doughty said late tuesday he was not aware 
of any new employee buyout plan in the works 
meetings of nonunion employees were set for today and thursday 
but these were scheduled earlier as a sounding board for workers to 
tell management what they would like to see in an employee stock 
ownership plan if one is developed 
wolf was not expected to attend the meetings today doughty said 
unions representing united airline workers said tuesday they 
continue to favor an employee buyout of the airline and oppose 
uals decision to explore a recapitalization 
diane robertson president of the united chapter of the 
association of flight attendants said the union does not believe a 
recapitalization is in the longrun interests of ual corp its 
stockholders or its employees 
added fc dubinsky chairman of the united chapter of the air 
line pilots association we are strongly opposed to any 
restructuring which results in the incurrence of substantial 
indebtedness and little or no employee ownership 
officials of the machinists union did not return telephone calls 
to their washington dc headquarters the union has said in the 
past it opposes any action that would saddle ual with substantial 
debt 
ms robertson said she expects the flight attendants advisers 
will meet shortly with advisers to the pilots union and the ual 
board to pursue employee ownership 
coniston issued a brief statement tuesday saying its 
representatives would closely review the steps taken by uals 
advisers over the next two weeks to develop a recapitalization plan 
uals board said monday that among the proposals it wants 
studied is a plan that would involve an exchange offer of ual 
debt securities for a significant portion of uals outstanding
