a teenager accused of killing his 
parents and younger brother and sister with an ax was found guilty 
on tuesday his 18th birthday of four counts of firstdegree 
murder 
david brom tried as an adult had pleaded innocent by reason of 
mental illness the olmsted county district court jury deliberated 
about four hours and 45 minutes before returning the guilty 
verdicts 
brom showed no emotion as the verdict was read shortly after 9 
pm 
he was charged with four counts each of first and seconddegree 
murder in the february 1988 slayings the firstdegree murder 
convictions mean that jurors believe the slayings were premeditated 
the trial will move to a second phase thursday to determine 
whether brom was mentally ill at the time and therefore not 
responsible for his actions 
obviously coming in we knew that phase one was not the strong 
part of the case for us 
defense attorney terrence walters had agreed that brom committed 
the murders but argued that they were not premeditated said the 
defense would show that brom is and was mentally ill 
if brom is found to have been sane when the murders occurred he 
faces a life imprisonment sentence with no chance of parole for 17 
years on each of the four counts 
bernard brom 41 suffered 22 ax wounds in the slayings at the 
broms rural rochester home paulette 41 suffered 18 wounds 
13yearold diane had eight wounds and 11yearold ricky had nine 
dr kathryn berg testified tuesday 
olmsted county attorney ray schmitz in his closing argument said 
the number of times each victim was struck by the ax could in 
itself be enough to prove premeditation 
the prosecutor also reminded jurors that brom had many 
conversations with friends in the months before the murders in 
which he discussed killing his family brom did not testify 
walters argued that broms discussions with friends were fantasy 
the plan consisted of a series of disjointed illogical 
fantasylike thoughts flitting in and out of the mind of dave brom 
intermixed with thoughts of suicide walters said

president bush declared tuesday that the 
attempted coup against panamas gen manuel antonio noriega was not 
some american operation and he wants to see democracy in 
panama succeed 
bushs spokesman said the government would continue seeking 
noriegas ouster 
nothings changed everything remains the same well continue 
to press for noriegas removal and his arrest to stand trial in 
the united states on drug charges said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
late tuesday after a day of sorting out conflicting reports on 
the coup attempt fitzwater said us officials had determined it 
had failed soon after noriegas officials claimed victory in 
panama city 
though the overthrow attempt by members of the panamanian 
defense forces failed after a morning gun battle at the forces 
headquarters fitzwater said the attempt shows the opposition to 
noriega within panama it shows there is a strong faction at least 
within the pdf panamanian defense forces that felt he should be 
removed 
we did not take any action that would have constituted direct 
involvement said fitzwater we had helicopters that were in 
the air observing and we had some troops around one of the 
causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth 
bush himself told reporters emphatically there were rumors 
around that this was some american operation and i can tell you 
that is not true 
greeting mexican president carlos salinas de gortari for a state 
dinner at the white house bush was asked if he were disappointed 
that the coup failed bush stated emphatically i want to see 
democracy in panama succeed 
tuesday night sen jesse helms rnc introduced legislation 
authorizing the president to use the armed forces to remove noriega 
from power and bring him to the united states 
the president meanwhile refused to speculate on whether he 
should have used the military to intervene 
i know the facts and some of the critics dont bush said in 
response to questions at the white house dinner 
the chairman of the senate intelligence committee for not making 
it a us operation for not sending us troops to help the 
insurgents 
here you have brave people in panama trying to rid 
themselves of a drug dealer and a thug whos taken over their 
country said the chairman sen david boren dokla after an 
hourlong classified briefing from cia officials 
and for the united states with all of our strength and force 
and all of our belief in democracy to stand by two miles away as 
the crow flies and do nothing and allow these people to fail 
personally i think is wrong 
but according to an article in wednesday editions of the star 
tribune of minneapolis it was opposition from boren a year ago 
that defeated a plan approved by president reagan to finance train 
and supported disaffected panamanian officers in an attempt to 
overthrow noriega 
boren objected that the effort was too close to the election 
might amount to authorizing assassination and might result in the 
deaths of many americans according to the star tribunes account 
quoting unidentified wellplaced sources 
fitzwater said a state department official bernard aronson 
informed bush after the president met with the visiting soviet 
defense minister that noriegas forces appeared to be prevailing 
he just said ok and went into another meeting said 
fitzwater 
the spokesman said visiting mexico president carlos salinas de 
gortari in a meeting earlier tuesday with bush had emphasized 
the integrity of the various countries in central america and we 
have respected that integrity and have not intervened 
the bush administration like the reagan administration before 
it has called repeatedly for noriegas ouster 
bush speaking to reporters before the outcome in panama city 
was clear appeared intent on influencing the situation in panama 
in favor of the insurrectionists 
asserting that he hoped his words would be conveyed 
instantly to panama bush said we have no argument with the 
panamanian defense forces weve had good relations with the 
panamanian defense forces 
our argument has been as have many other countries with mr 
noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of panama 
and thats where our argument was and thats where our argument 
is 
last may bush had told reporters i would love to see them 
get him out 
asked then if he were calling for the panamanian defense forces 
to overthrow noriega bush replied wed like to see him out of 
there not just the pdf the will of the people of panama i 
would add no words of caution the will of the people should be 
implemented 
fitzwater acknowledged that the united states had some advance 
word that a coup attempt might be afoot but said he was unaware of 
noriegas fate or even his whereabouts 
we had some indications this sort of thing was in the works 
but until it happens you never know fitzwater said he 
characterized the prior information as rumblings 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
would move quickly toward normalizing relations with panama if 
noriega is deposed but added that any such step would be impossible 
so long as noriega remains in power 
after noriega was indicted by two florida grand juries on drug 
smuggling charges in february 1988 the reagan administration 
imposed a series of economic sanctions in a bid to oust the 
general who is commander of panamas military forces 
among other actions the administration froze all panamanian 
assets in the united states for the past 19 months the united 
states has not recognized the noriegaled government as the legal 
authority in panama 
fitzwater said bush was first alerted about the gunfire by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft shortly before the 
president met with mexican president salinas 
then scowcroft gave a briefing to both bush and salinas 
jointly although details in late morning remained sketchy 
fitzwater said 
about 50000 americans live in panama including more than 
12000 us military personnel attached to the us southern 
command 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
american citizens living in panama were being asked to stay at home 
the us southern command put its troops and civilians on the 
isthmus on delta alert its highest level of readiness american 
troops in combat gear took up positions 600 yards from the barracks 
in downtown panama city 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said us troops in panama were 
not involved in any way in the disturbance he added our 
facilities down there are locked up they are secure 
the american military personnel in panama have been ordered to 
stay put and not to travel on roads outside the usowned 
facilities williams said 
the headquarters of the defense forces command is about onehalf 
mile from the scene of the shooting and mortar fire officials said

soviet defense minister dmitri yazov conferred 
with president bush on tuesday on the prospects for reducing 
nuclear and conventional arms and assured the american people they 
need not fear the soviet union 
the soviet defense minister was kept waiting a half hour as bush 
got a briefing from national security adviser brent scowcroft on 
the attempted coup in panama 
the president was informed after the oval office session with 
yazov that the attempt to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
apparently had failed 
bush broke his usual practice of refusing to answer questions 
during photo opportunities by telling reporters the fighting in 
panama was not some american operation 
the president asked yazov to pay my respects to president 
gorbachev and said the recent talks with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze were very fruitful 
we are satisfied weve got some problems still bush said 
but things are moving in the direction we wanted 
yazov emerging 30 minutes later offered his own rosy 
assessment of the outlook for arms control 
the burly beribboned general told reporters 
the main point of my discussions with the us president was 
the question of arms control the question of reducing conventional 
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a 
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations 
speaking in russian yazov said the soviet people are 
cherishing the best sentiments and feeling towards the americans 
we were comrades at arms during the second world war and we 
succeeded in winning a great victory and now we have no grounds 
no reason whatsoever to go into confrontation against each 
other 
asked if this meeting had furthered the prospects for an arms 
pact yazov smiled and said well i dont think i could really 
assure success at the negotiations within half an hour 
but he added our negotiating teams are working in geneva i 
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion 
of agreements on the questions anyhow we are counting on 
progress 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said afterward bush 
had reiterated his support for perestroika the soviet process 
of reorganization into a more open society and expressed his 
desire to conclude agreements on conventional forces in europe and 
on chemical weapons as soon as possible and his hopes for progress 
in start the strategic arms reduction talks 
if yazov was perturbed at being kept waiting and having events 
in panama intrude on the oval office meeting he did not show it 
asked if the soviet union favored the removal of noriega from 
power yazov said i am not prepared to talk on the issue because 
i am not aware of what happened in panama we have not talked 
about it at all i cant tell you anything more 
yazov said he and cheney were hoping to reach agreements on 
several steps to improve the rapidly warming relations between the 
leadership of the soviet and american armed forces 
we are thinking of expanding our exchanges in the military 
field next year and we are going to draft a whole program which 
will be designed to promote better understanding between our two 
militaries and between our peoples he said 
earlier cheney took yazov to gettysburg pa about 62 miles 
north of washington to see the battlefield where union troops 
repulsed gen robert e lees confederate soldiers in a bloody 
threeday battle in july 1863 that marked one of the turning points 
in the american civil war yazov is a civil war buff 
after a twohour tour of the battlefield and viewing its famous 
landmarks like devils den and the wheat field yazov said i 
wish we would not have any battlefields like this one in the 
future the gettysburg times reported 
yazovs busy schedule called for speeches tuesday at the 
national defense university at fort myer va near the pentagon 
and before the council on foreign relations in new york a private 
group 
yazov will visit camp pendleton a marine training base in 
southern california on wednesday and luke air force base in 
arizona on thursday on friday he will tour fort bragg nc then 
return to washington for a news conference with cheney

barring unforeseen problems nasa 
was ready today to set the launch date for space shuttle atlantis 
and its nuclearpowered planetary payload 
shuttle managers were assessing the readiness of the orbiter 
the payload the worldwide tracking network and other elements 
during a twoday meeting that began monday no difficulties 
surfaced during the first day officials reported 
oct 12 is the opening day of a launch opportunity when earth 
and jupiter are aligned properly for sending the galileo spacecraft 
to that distant planet the launch opportunity closes nov 21 
atlantis crew of five astronauts is to dispatch galileo on a 
sixyear journey to jupiter when the spacecraft reaches there in 
1995 it will fire a scientific probe into the jovian atmosphere 
and then orbit the planet for two years of scrutiny 
because galileo will be powered by two generators fueled by 
plutonium238 three citizens groups last week sued in us 
district court in washington dc to prevent the launch 
the groups contend that a launch accident could spread poisonous 
plutonium over a heavilypopulated area of florida 
nasa has said the highest probability of launch area release 
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2500 and 
such a release would have no appreciable adverse health effects on 
the population 
the agency notes similar generators have flown on 22 us space 
vehicles including five manned apollo moon missions and that in 
three instances the wellprotected devices survived severe 
inflight accidents 
judge oliver gasch has asked the citizens groups and the 
national aeronautics and space administration to file briefs in the 
case on wednesday and friday respectively he set a hearing for 
oct 10 the day the countdown would begin for an oct 12 launch 
bruce gagnon coordinator of the florida coalition for peace and 
justice one of the three opposing groups said last week that if 
the lawsuit is not successful his organization plans to put 
people into the launch area to sit on top of the launch pad in an 
effort to stop the launch

former atlanta mayor maynard jackson was a strong favorite to 
reclaim his old job today while mississippi republicans tried to 
retain a congressional seat that was left vacant when rep larkin 
smith died in a plane crash 
in cleveland five candidates battled in a primary election to 
succeed mayor george voinovich who is quitting after a decade in 
office incumbent mayors were running in phoenix and albuquerque 
nm 
jackson atlantas first black mayor said he was poised for a 
huge victory in his bid to reclaim the seat he held from 
197482 few observers expected him to be disappointed 
jackson would succeed andrew young who followed him in office 
and who now is exploring a bid for governor young like jackson 
before him is prohibited from seeking a third consecutive term

city councilman hosea williams who entered the race late after 
fulton county commission chairman michael lomax dropped out 
further south two democrats and a republican were running in 
the mississippi special election to fill the seat left vacant by 
smiths death in august the freshman republican had served less 
than eight months 
state attorney general mike moore one of two democrats running

anderson who has been an aide to sen trent lott rmiss and 
state sen gene taylor 
if no candidate wins a majority a runoff will be held oct 17 
the winner will represent an 11county district in southeastern

cancer patients who cannot be treated for lethal 
infections with a standard drug may become treatable if the drug is 
enclosed in microscopic bubbles of fat a study suggests 
the bubbles carry the drug to the sites of infection with less 
problem from the side effects that now limit its use said 
researcher gabriel lopezberestein 
he reported a study of treating patients with the help of the 
fat bubbles called liposomes at an american medical association 
science reporters conference monday 
while there are several types of liposomes the most widely 
tested consists of multiple layers of fat arranged like the 
structure of an onion 
liposomes can be used for targeting antifungal drugs because 
they are consumed by white blood cells called macrophages which 
infiltrate sites of infection said lopezberestein of the md 
anderson cancer center in houston 
his study involved a powerful antifungal drug called 
amphotericinb its use is limited by its side effects which 
include severe chills and fever 
those side effects were less frequent and less severe when the 
drug was enclosed in liposomes and given to 46 people with 
infections most had become infected as a complication of leukemia 
but some were heart transplant patients 
transplant patients are vulnerable to fungal infections because 
of therapy to suppress their diseasefighting immune systems which 
is aimed at keeping them from rejecting their hearts 
lopezberestein said 
forty of the studys patients had previously failed to respond 
to amphotericinb and other antifungal drugs given conventionally 
because of allergy or side effects he said 
in the study 24 patients showed a complete reponse to the 
liposomeencapsulated drug remaining free of the infection for six 
months or more he said the 22 other patients failed to respond 
the work will be published in a medical journal he said 
william higuchi of the university of utah an authority on 
methods for delivering drugs called the results interesting it 
seems to me there are real possibilities there he said in a 
telephone interview 
treating fungal infections is particularly important in leukemia 
patients because anticancer therapy must be stopped during such 
infections lopezberestein said the cancer treatment inhibits the 
immune system encouraging more infections he said 
liposomes also have been shown to improve effectiveness and 
reduce side effects of a standard cancer drug in animals 
lopezberestein said 
they also may prove useful for attacking the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome after it has infected 
macrophages he said

president nicolae ceausescu of romania 
proposed that forces of the warsaw pact military alliance intervene 
to stop poland from forming a government headed by noncommunists 
a hungarian official says 
the prosolidarity polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza said friday 
that hungarys communist party had received such a proposal from 
romanias communist leaders who staunchly oppose the wave of 
reform sweeping the east bloc 
geza kotai secretary in charge of international affairs of the

it said ceausescu decided to turn to the leaders of the warsaw 
pact to jointly act in favor of preventing a serious situation in 
poland in favor of defending socialism and the polish nation 
the article did not say if ceausescu had appealed to other 
members of the sevennation alliance led by the soviet union 
kotai said however the hungarian communist party received a 
call for intervention and we gave a definite rejection 
solidarity journalist tadeusz mazowiecki became leader of the 
polish government last month the first noncommunist prime

the thing that went bump in the night at 
roy carrolls house turned out to be a 7foot boa constrictor 
i dont want to wake up like that again carroll said im 
still scared it was something to see 
the snake apparently was resting on a piece of plywood in the 
rafters of carrolls basement as it crawled away the plywood fell 
and hit the basement floor 
carroll went down to investigate about 630 am monday and 
found himself face to face with the snake 
my first thought was to kill it but i said no i couldnt 
do that cause if i had swung a shovel and missed no telling 
where it might have gone 
carrolls wife peggy called police but when officer sherry 
lingerfelt arrived she didnt feel real comfortable about handling 
the creature 
so ms lingerfelt called her sergeant larry stroud the snake 
didnt scare stroud 
stroud got hold of the snakes head and he and ms lingerfelt 
put it into two large plastic garbage bags and brought it to the 
police station 
police said they would auction the the snake if its owner 
doesnt show up

when lloyd perkins boasted about his 
experience as a killer to two fellow jail inmates who said they 
wanted to help him escape he didnt suspect he was incriminating 
himself in a 2yearold unsolved murder 
perkins statements are the focus of a potentially important 
supreme court case that could roll back the rights of criminal 
suspects to be given socalled miranda warnings 
the high court beginning what promises to be another 
controversyladen term monday agreed to use the perkins case from 
illinois to decide whether undercover agents may elicit confessions 
from jailed criminal suspects 
the justices said they will hear arguments by illinois officials 
seeking to use perkins statements to prosecute him for murder 
in its normally busy opening session the court issued orders in 
more than 1000 cases denying review to most and agreeing to 
study 22 that will be among more than 150 disputes to be decided by 
the end of the term in july 
the court heard arguments in a yonkers ny desegregation case 
in which four city councilmen were held in contempt for opposing a 
plan for attracting subsidized housing to the citys white 
neighborhoods 
the justices also are looking ahead to a term in which they have 
agreed to decide thorny rightofprivacy arguments in three 
abortion disputes and the high courts first right to die 
controversy 
in other action on the first day of its term the court 
agreed to decide whether police nationwide may use sobriety 
checkpoints in trying to curb drunken drivers the court will 
review rulings by michigan courts striking down that states 
sobriety checkpoint program as an unconstitutional invasion of 
privacy courts in other states have upheld virtually identical 
police tactics 
agreed to use a multimillion dollar dispute over the alfred 
hitchcock classic rear window to resolve key copyright issues 
said they will decide in an illinois case whether public 
employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring 
promoting and transferring employees 
left intact marylands revocation of a 300000ayear tax 
break for a menonly golf club that has counted presidents and 
members of congress among its members 
refused to spare an evangelical christian group in lenox 
mass from having to return 55 million donated by a wealthy 
exmember 
allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of 
neglecting the health and safety of their employees the justices 
without comment let stand a ruling in an illinois case that 
federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions 
in the perkins case the court could weaken its famous 1966 
miranda ruling that requires police to warn suspects of their right 
to an attorney and to remain silent 
an illinois appeals court ruled in november that police violated 
perkins rights when they planted an undercover agent in jail to 
question him about a murder 
perkins was charged with fatally shooting richard stephenson on 
nov 8 1984 in fairview heights 
police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when donald 
charlton an inmate at graham correctional facility in hillsboro 
told authorities he had information about the homicide 
police then placed charlton and undercover narcotics officer 
john parisi in the montgomery county jail on march 31 1986 
perkins was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of 
aggravated battery unrelated to the homicide 
parisi using the alias vito bianco wore motorcycle garb and 
told perkins he was interested in planning an escape 
then parisi asked perkins whether he had ever done someone 
a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit information 
about any killings in which perkins took part 
the appeals court said perkins recounted in detail the killing 
of stephenson 
a state judge ruled in 1987 that perkins jailhouse statements 
to charlton and parisi about the stephenson killing could not be 
admitted as evidence 
but state officials said the miranda ruling only should protect 
suspects against police coercion and that there was no coercion in 
perkins case 
but the illinois appeals court said the miranda ruling applies 
whenever a suspect is in custody even when the purpose of the 
custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation 
the supreme court ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials 
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in 
custody to make incriminating statements 
the justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision 
handed down two years before miranda that barred government 
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants 
entitled to a lawyers help during interrogation

clean air legislation is gaining momentum in 
the house following a breakthrough agreement that would apply 
californias tough auto tailpipe standards to the whole country 
starting with 1994 models 
the 220 vote monday in the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee came after two powerful lawmakers reps 
henry a waxman dcalif and john d dingell dmich shook 
hands and ended a bitter dispute over the auto standards 
waxman the champion of environmental groups and dingell the 
auto industrys best friend in congress said monday they would 
oppose any attempts to change the agreement their pact virtually 
ensures new tough auto pollution controls because the senates 
clean air legislation is even stricter than the compromise 
the auto industry was quick to express its displeasure with the 
proposed exhaust standards harold a poling chief operating 
officer for ford motor co said the standards are not feasible 
and would improve air quality by less than 1 percent compared 
with the presidents proposal 
richard ayres chairman of the national clean air coalition 
called the vote a genuine step forward and a signal to the 
industrial community and others that achieving clean air will take 
a commitment from all interests to do their part the coalition 
includes environmental groups and their allies 
the california requirements tougher than the rest of the 
countrys would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be 
complete in the other 49 states by 1996 at an average cost to 
consumers of nearly 100 per car according to environmental 
protection agency estimates 
the emissions disputes have helped keep clean air bills in a 
legislative bottleneck in past years and threatened to torpedo 
president bushs clean air bill which the subcommittee vote 
amended 
the compromise followed extensive private negotiations over the 
past week that involved dingell waxman and a number of house 
colleagues who said they were tired of a clean air stalemate that 
has lasted a decade the last major clean air law changes were 
passed in 1977 
the bush administration accepted the compromise reluctantly and 
expressed hope for quick progress on other portions of the bill in 
waxmans subcommittee 
this opens the gates to the passage of clean air legislation 
if not this year then next year said rep thomas tauke riowa 
who added that the tailpipe compromise would help lawmakers reach 
agreement on other parts of the legislation added rep bill 
richardson dnm we still have an enormous amount of work to 
do 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said the 
dingellwaxman provisions though tighter than what the president 
proposed are really not too far away from ours he said the 
white house would have to see what comes out of the committee 
before commenting further 
general motors said todays action goes to an extreme which 
will bring virtually no significant benefits over what the 
bipartisan bill provides but will mean huge costs to the consumer 
and high risks for the industry 
following the agreement lawmakers differing over the makeup of 
bushs proposed clean fuels program for autos intensified efforts 
to reach a compromise 
also remaining are differences over sharing the cost of acid 
rain reduction a cap on acid rain growth that could slow power 
plant expansion and the extent of controls on virtually 
unregulated airborne toxic chemicals 
the dingellwaxman agreement is mainly designed to reduce ozone 
pollution motor vehicles account for nearly half of the nations 
pollution from ozone a highly reactive gas that is the prime 
ingredient of smog and which can cause breathing difficulties 
ozone is produced by the reaction of hydrocarbons from unburned 
fuel with nitrogen oxides another vehicle pollutant in the 
presence of sunlight warm weather speeds the reaction 
the key provisions of the compromise 
beginning with 1994 models cars and light duty trucks could 
emit 025 grams per mile of nonmethane hydrocarbons for five years 
or 50000 miles whichever comes first and 031 grams per mile 
after that up to 10 years or 100000 miles the current federal 
limit on these emissions is 041 grams 
for carbon monoxide the limit would be 34 grams per mile in 
the fiveyear 50000mile period the same as current law and 42 
grams after that up to 10 years or 100000 mile period 
beginning with 1994 cars and 1995 lightduty trucks emissions 
of nitrogen oxides would be held to 04 grams per mile the current 
california limit the standard would be phased in over two years 
40 percent the first year and 100 percent the second the current 
federal limit is 1 gram per mile 
the epa would have to decide by dec 31 1999 whether to 
tighten the requirements further if the administrator did nothing 
tough standards originally proposed by waxman would take effect 
automatically jan 1 2003

interest rates are likely to show little 
change for the rest of this year despite bush administration 
pressure on the federal reserve for lower rates aimed at boosting 
economic growth many economists believe 
these analysts look for interest rates including mortgage 
rates to move up and down in a narrow range in coming months as 
the fed tries to steer the 5 trillion us economy along a path of 
moderating growth and moderating inflation 
policymakers at the fed gathered for a closeddoor strategy 
session today of the federal open market committee composed of 
members of the fed board in washington and five of the 12 fed 
regional bank presidents 
while the results of their deliberations will not be publicly 
disclosed for six weeks many economists were predicting that the 
central bank will decide to make no changes to its current credit 
stance 
these analysts believe that the fed is on the verge of achieving 
its hopedfor soft landing whereby growth slows just enough in the 
second half of the year to keep inflation in check but not enough 
to topple the country into a recession 
the country is on a moderate but sustainable growth course it 
is exactly the kind of lowaltitude flying that the fed has been 
seeking said david jones chief economist of aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer 
because of the belief that the fed will not fiddle with its 
monetary controls analysts were looking for little change in 
interest rates in coming months 
banks prime lending rate which serves as a benchmark for many 
business and consumer loans was expected to hold at 105 percent 
longterm rates reflected by treasurys benchmark 30year 
bonds were expected to trade in a narrow range between 8 percent 
and 85 percent 
mortgage rates which have been on a roller coaster this year 
were expected to stabilize as well right around the current level 
of 1016 percent 
fixedterm mortgages hit a high this year of 1122 percent in 
april and fell as low as 968 percent in early august before rising 
slightly in recent weeks 
the administration however is convinced that further rate 
declines are needed to improve the economic outlook next year 
both richard darman director of the office of management and 
budget and michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser 
have made comments recently about the need for the fed to lower 
interest rates 
in remarks that were endorsed by president bush darman 
complained that the central bank was keeping interest rates too 
high and would have to bear the blame if the country topples into a 
recession next year 
the administration apparently is also unhappy because it 
believes the central bank should be doing more to support last 
weeks agreement by the united states and six other economic powers 
to drive the dollar lower as a way of improving americas huge 
trade deficit 
lower interest rates in the united states would push the dollar 
down because dollardenominated assets would be less attractive to 
foreign investors a lower dollar makes us exports more 
competitive on overseas markets 
there is a good deal of domestic political and international 
heat on the fed to ease policy further in order to push the dollar 
lower to keep exports strong and the economy strong over the 
remainder of this year and next year jones said 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co agreed saying 
this administration wants very much to avoid any slowdown in an 
election year next year when 435 house districts and onethird of 
the senate seats are at stake 
after a yearlong credittightening effort the central bank 
eased credit slightly in june and july in the face of mounting 
signs that the record sevenyear economic expansion was in danger 
of faltering 
since that time however much of the data on which the fed 
based its decision has been revised to show the economy was not 
that weak in the spring and summer 
many economists believe the fed would actually be tightening 
credit now if it had not been for various reports showing that 
inflation which spurted ahead early in the year because of higher 
energy and food costs was moderating as well 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill said she was 
not looking for the fed to ease further unless economic growth in 
the final three months of the year falters much more than is 
currently expected

americans are adopting nearly 50 percent more 
foreign babies than they did a decade ago a private adoption group 
says 
william l pierce president of the national committee for 
adoption said monday the increase was not surprising with as many 
as a million american couples unable to have children of their own 
and only about 50000 children available for unrelated domestic 
adoptions 
but these adoption also show the underlying altruism of 
americans pierce said noting that many foreign children were 
adopted even when more american babies were available 
the rise in foreign adoptions accounted for a large percentage 
of the overall adoption increase in recent years he said 
americans adopted 10019 foreign babies in 1987 the most recent 
year for which immigration and naturalization service statistics 
were available that was a 46 percent increase over 1977 when there 
were 6854 foreign adoptions pierce said 
however pierce complained that there are children within the 
united states who arent adopted because of a new racism by 
adoption agencies 
these agencies often try to find parents who match the child 
both of the same race or the same mix as the babys natural 
parents that can result in willing parents being denied a child 
because they are of a different race he said 
pierces comments came as his committee released its adoption 
factbook the second such book it has produced compiling 
national facts and figures on adoptions adoption laws and 
regulations and listing sources of information and help 
other than the ins the federal government no longer collects 
adoption statistics said pierce so his group is seeking to fill 
that gap the committee describes itself as a private organization 
that encourages adoption but takes no stand on abortion 
the first book covered adoptions through 1982 and the new 
edition brings the figures up to 1986 except for the foreign 
babies which include 1987 
pierce said that 7614 of the 1987 foreign adoptions were from 
asia while only 122 were from europe females were slightly in the 
majority at 56 percent 
the most common country of origin was south korea he said and 
the state where the largest share found new homes was new york

robert culp says he made bill cosby an actor 
putting his own career in jeopardy to save their mid1960s i 
spy show and cosbys future with it 
bill was not much of an actor when i first met him and he 
struck me as the angriest man alive culp said in this weeks tv 
guide magazine he had this tremendous chip on his shoulder as 
if the world owed him a living 
culp said cosbys performance in the first episode of the 
television show didnt impress grant tinker then nbcs west coast 
programming chief and he canceled the show 
culp said he defended cosby and pressured nbc to give the series 
another chance 
i was convinced bill was going to be right for the part 
culp said people only had to be patient i knew it was risky to 
go out on such a limb but i was sure i could make bill an actor 
overnight by rewriting the scripts for him so i told leonard if 
nbc gets rid of bill theyll have to get rid of me too 
cosby wont talk about the matter and tinker has trouble 
recalling the events tv guide said but the shows executive 
producer sheldon leonard disagreed with culps comments on the 
early cancellation order saying nbc had a years commitment 
the show couldnt be canceled leonard said but he added 
there were some doubts about cosbys acting he had only been a

its time to move from the lab to the 
marketplace with products such as ink made from soybeans and 
biodegradable plastics made from corn starch say two senators 
whose legislation would speed the process 
we can make literally thousands of environmentally safe 
innovative new products from the renewable resources grown on 
american farms said sen kent conrad dnd who has teamed 
with sen tom harkin diowa on the alternative agricultural 
research and commercialization act 
the measure combines legislation they had introduced separately 
in moving his bill through the last congress harkin said he 
found the agriculture department minimally oriented toward 
finding new commercial products for crops 
current research being conducted at usda is too often directed 
at improving yields of existing crops he said monday noting 
problems with overproduction this bill will change that research 
emphasis and aid in the development of markets for the new products 
being created 
we can make ink for soybeans instead of petroleum conrad 
said we can make red dye that wont cause cancer out of 
sunflower hulls we can make degradable plastics out of corn starch 
instead of crude oil we can make insulation from milkweed instead 
of fiberglass 
coincidentally the association of industrial crops is holding a 
convention this week to exchange ideas on new uses for farm 
products in peoria ill the home of the agriculture departments 
research center doing work in this area 
the problem with usdas program is unreliable funding sometimes 
theres money and sometimes there isnt 
the conradharkin bill would provide 10 million in 1990 20 
million in 1991 30 million in 1992 50 million in 1993 and 75 
million for the next six years 
once research and development are completed the bill provides 
for technical and financial assistance to businesses to help 
commercialize the products through regional centers around the 
country 
conrads original bill was sponsored by rep timothy penny 
dminn in the house it passed in the house but didnt get to 
the senate floor last year harkins bill passed the senate three 
times but didnt get through the house 
the new legislation is widely supported and awaiting hearings in 
the senate agriculture committee congressional aides say the plan 
is to pass it as separate legislation but keep open the option of 
attaching it to the 1990 farm bill

soviet efforts to curb psychiatric abuse 
including an independent monitoring commission are not enough to 
warrant readmitting moscow to the world psychiatric association 
us experts say 
the soviets recently acknowledged that political and religious 
dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric institutions a 
western charge they long denied and in an unusual move sent a 
diplomat to congress on monday to testify about their reforms 
the soviet allunion scientific society of psychiatrists 
is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the 
needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric 
health said georgi markosov a counselor at the soviet embassy 
to prevent the use of psychiatry for nonmedical purposes as 
well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of 
psychiatry an independent commission has been established which 
is composed of eight persons markosov told the house committee 
on energy and commerce subcommittee on health and the environment 
the commission is independent from the health ministry or any 
communist party or state organs he said reading a statement 
from the soviet psychiatric society 
before this year it was rare for soviet officials to testify 
before congress but since january about a halfdozen have done so 
despite the soviets effort to present their best case for 
readmission to the world psychiatric association subcommittee 
chairman rep henry waxman dcalif and other us experts said 
the kremlin has not gone far enough 
the us delegation to assess soviet psychiatry which visited 
the soviet union this year reported to congress that while some 
victims have been released forced incarceration under the guise of 
treatment for insanity remains an institutional problem waxman 
said 
perhaps even worse the perpetrators of these abuses remain in 
key leadership positions in soviet psychiatry waxman said 
besides formation of the independent commission markosov 
detailed reforms including 
new regulations that led to dropping 736000 people from 
socalled psychiatric registration lists us experts said the 
lists contained 102 million names and were used for job screening 
new rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric 
institution without the consent of patients or their relatives 
unless the patient poses a physical danger psychiatrists who 
wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a 
twoyear prison term he said 
abolition in the russian federation the largest of the 15 
soviet republics of two laws often used against dissidents 
a ban on the use of sulphazine a drug made of pulverized 
sulfur that has been injected into political dissidents causing 
extreme pain fever and disorientation western experts say it has 
no medical value 
most of the steps had been publicized previously but the 
existence of the commission was not known in the west said another 
witness peter reddaway a george washington university professor 
who was a member of the us delegation that visited the soviet 
union this year 
it remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and 
independent said reddaway 
the american psychiatric association which supported the work 
of the us delegation has voted to oppose readmission of the 
soviet group to the world body which is scheduled to meet in 
athens greece on oct 1116 the world body condemned soviet 
practices in 1977 and the soviets withdrew in 1983 facing almost 
certain expulsion 
it is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the american 
psychiatric association that there will be a time in the near 
future when we can wholeheartedly welcome the allunion society of 
psychiatrists and narcologists of the ussr into the world 
psychiatric association testified ellen mercer head of 
international programs for the us organization 
it is also our concern that unfortunately this time has not 
yet arrived mercer said 
soviet health officials who in the past sent dissidents to 
psychiatric institutions remain in senior government posts said 
reddaway and they could resume their abuses if there is a 
conservative reaction along the lines of the crackdown in china 
this summer 
the officials he mentioned were yevgeny chazov the health 
minister nikolai zharikov last year appointed the head of the 
soviet society of psychiatrists and narcologists georgy morozov 
who for decades has headed the serbsky institute where many 
political dissidents have been held in psychiatric care and 
alexander churkin chief psychiatrist of the ministry of health

vice president dan quayle says soviet 
officials are misreading the tea leaves if they think the bush 
administration is lessening its commitment to the strategic defense 
initiative 
they better go back and read what we said and what the sdi 
program is all about now quayle said monday 
the vice president created a stir last month when he said the 
reagan administration had indulged in political jargon when it 
originally portrayed the sdi program also known as star wars as 
a leakproof impenetrable antimissile shield 
the soviets in their latest strategic arms initiative 
conditionally dropped their insistence that americans abandon plans 
to deploy a spacebased antimissile system but they reserved the 
right to abrogate a strategic arms agreement on short notice if the 
united states ever actually deployed such a system 
quayle in an interview with the associated press and other news 
organizations said the concept of sdi had been scaled back in the 
last 12 months of the reagan administration 
what were talking about is a realistic sdi system said 
quayle if the soviets view a phased deployment and a 
redefinition of sdi as lessening of the commitment theyre 
misreading the tea leaves 
its showing you can do it from a political point of view 
from a technological point of view and that president bush is 
serious about an sdi system said quayle a stalwart sdi 
supporter 
quayle who returned friday from a fournation tour of asia 
said the bush administration may ask congress to loosen 
restrictions on foreign aid to allow the philippines to beef up 
internal security against communist insurgents 
quayle was instrumental in securing a similar waiver for el 
salvador after a visit to that strifetorn nation earlier this year 
quayle said a waiver of the restriction would help protect 
american lives as we have become increasing targets in the 
philippines two americans working at a us military base were 
ambushed and killed by filipino terrorists shortly before quayles 
arrival last tuesday 
the philippines will receive almost 650 million in us aid 
next year quayle did not say how much he felt should be shifted to 
internal security but aides said the country needs basic equipment 
including twoway radios for police cars in manila 
philippines president corazon aquino agreed during quayles 
visit to open negotiations in december on the lease agreements for 
clark air base subic bay naval station and four other us 
military facilities those agreements expire in september 1991 
quayle said the united states hopes for a longterm indefinite 
extension of the leases setting a date for closing the bases would 
send the wrong signal to investors looking for signs of stability 
in the philippines he said 
there is a very vocal antiamerican community in the 
philippines quayle said i dont put everyone thats 
antiamerican in the terrorist camp its a combination of 
antiamericanism plus prophilippine and selfrespect and 
selfdignity 
but just traveling the streets of manila and seeing its 
poverty underscores the need for economic development he said 
i think we are a stabilizing force in the philippines and 
stability is what investors and people look to said quayle who 
also visited japan south korea and malaysia on his fourth foreign 
trip of the year 
on other issues quayle 
shrugged off a question about his low standing in public 
opinion polls im gratified for the presidents good standing in 
polls thats my concern right now i got plenty of time to worry 
about my own said the 44yearold vice president 
declared the united states main goal in cambodia is to bolster 
the noncommunist resistance and prevent the mass murderers of 
the khmer rouge from regaining power 
said the government of china must change its attitude about the 
massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square last 
june the problem is china continues to perceive that nothing 
happened or whatever happened is nobodys business and therefore 
its for us to change not them quayle said

the extension of steel import restraints once 
a contentious issue in congress is all but assured after an 
overwhelming house vote to extend restrictions until 1992 
mondays 35410 vote approved president bushs compromise to 
extend the restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until april 
1992 the no votes were all republicans 
sen bob packwood rore has introduced a companion measure in 
the senate where bipartisan approval is expected soon 
bushs plan announced july 25 called for immediate 
negotiations with japan south korea and other leading 
steelexporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume 
of steel allowed into the united states 
the original pacts which expired saturday were negotiated by 
the reagan administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers 
breathing space from subsidized foreign competition 
many steeldistrict lawmakers pushed the administration to 
extend the curbs for another five years but bush opted for a 
smallerscale 2year program in deference to steelusing 
manufacturers the manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven 
up prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products 
the manufacturers had enlisted dozens of lawmakers prepared to 
argue against a fiveyear continuation but the compromise all but 
eliminated the debate house opposition came largely from 
freetraders who felt the steel industry has had enough protection 
its not my first choice said rep bill frenzel rminn 
who had opposed a longer extension nevertheless i have to admit 
its about as good a compromise as could be achieved 
rep joseph gaydos dpa who represents a western pennsylvania 
steel district said the program is not a cureall but has been 
the most effective method of dealing with dumped imports 
this legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the 
steel industry in this country a little more time to become 
competitive and theyre well under way gaydos said 
with the old program due to expire sept 30 the administration 
could not afford to wait until congress acted to begin the 
painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings 
trade representatives from japan south korea the european 
community mexico venezuela and romania were in town last week for 
meetings on renewing their pacts 
many of the negotiations are already complete said us trade 
representative carla hills even though congress hasnt finished 
work on the bill she said steel imports would continue to be 
monitored by the department of commerce and the us customs 
service 
no details on individual pacts have been announced 
in a prepared statement monday the american iron and steel 
institute applauded us negotiators for their work but stressed 
that the bush program should not preclude american steelmakers from 
filing unfair trade complaints if necessary against foreign 
governments 
voting against the bill were republicans steve bartlett and 
richard armey of texas tom campbell christopher cox and dana 
rohrbacher of california philip crane of illinois jim kolbe and 
bob stump of arizona and tom petri and james sensenbrenner of 
wisconsin

a ruling that the funding of texas schools 
is unconstitutional will mean a chance at equality for poorer 
districts in the nations secondlargest school system a lawyer in 
the case says 
the states education commissioner who had defended the 
financing system called for a tax increase so poorer districts can 
equalize upward but gov bill clements said more money wont 
necessarily solve the problem 
mondays unanimous 90 decision by the texas supreme court found 
glaring disparities between rich and poor school districts 
violating a requirement in the state constitution for an 
efficient system of public schools 
the court said financing for texas 33 million students must be 
overhauled by may 
a remedy is long overdue justice oscar mauzys opinion 
said the legislature must take immediate action 
clements said he will call a special 30day session of the 
legislature in the spring to grapple with the problem after a task 
force still to be named makes its recommendations 
the court said it would not tell the legislature how to correct 
the inequities or order it to increase taxes but warned a 
bandaid will not suffice the system itself must be changed 
the state whose school system follows california as the 
nations largest will make nearly 10 billion available for public 
schools in 199091 and almost 12 billion is expected from local 
districts 
but because of disparities in property wealth annual spending 
per student among districts ranges from 2112 to 19333 the 
court said schools are funded with local property taxes and state 
aid 
in 1988 comptroller bob bullock found 730 of the 1100 
districts spend less than the statewide average of 3290 per 
student per year the average in those districts was 2976 
an austin state district judge had declared the system 
unconstitutional in a 1984 case brought by poor districts against 
state education commissioner wn kirby and others that ruling was 
overturned last december by a 21 vote of the austinbased 3rd 
court of appeals 
but the high court found the states school financing system 
is neither financially efficient nor efficient in the sense of 
providing for a general diffusion of knowledge statewide 
the ruling prompted celebrations in edgewood independent school 
district in san antonio the lead plaintiff 
we took on the state of texas and we beat em said 
superintendent james vasquez 
about 1800 students and teachers rallied at the edgewood 
stadium holding banners reading victory and edgewood all the 
way as a band played a marquee at the entrance read texas 
children 9 kirby 0 
the ruling is going to mean a chance at equality said 
attorney al kauffman with the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund who represented edgewood and several other 
districts 
demetrio rodriguez who launched a fight for equal school 
funding in 1968 that reached the us supreme court before it was 
rejected said he cried when he heard of the ruling it really is 
something that has been in my heart 
kirby said that although his position as education commissioner 
required him to defend the financing system in court he had always 
maintained it was inadequate 
we simply must have bold leadership to make the tough decision 
of increasing revenue so that we equalize upward to the level 
of a quality education for all children kirby said 
the governor was more cautious though 
it could be that we maybe need more money but money in itself 
is not the answer to public education clements said quality 
education is the issue here 
attorney earl luna who represented several affluent districts 
that intervened in support of the state expressed disappointment 
we were hoping the court would consider it as a legislative 
problem and hold that while the legislative solution was not 
perfect it was constitutional luna said 
in its ruling the court rejected arguments that reform in 
school finance will reduce local control of education 
an efficient system will actually allow for more local 
control not less the court said it will provide 
propertypoor districts with economic alternatives that are not now 
available to them 
the opinion noted that similar rulings have been made in nine 
other states texas is one of 11 states where school financing 
systems have been challenged 
other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning 
school finance are alaska connecticut indiana kentucky 
minnesota montana new jersey north dakota oregon and tennessee

former fbi agent richard w miller was in 
prison on the fifth anniversary of his arrest even though his 
conviction and life sentence for conspiring to commit espionage for 
the soviet union has been dismissed 
i think theres something very wrong with a system that allows 
a man to be held five years without a fair trial millers 
attorney stanley greenberg said 
a 20year fbi veteran miller was arrested five years ago 
monday he was subsequently convicted after two trials on 
charges of delivering secret us documents to his lover svetlana 
ogorodnikov his first trial ended in a hung jury 
us district judge david kenyon sentenced miller to two life 
terms plus 50 years 
but in april the 9th us circuit court of appeals reversed the 
conviction ruling that kenyon had erred in allowing lie detector 
evidence during the 198586 trial the panel ordered a new trial 
for miller 
in july kenyon refused a defense motion to release miller on 
bail pending the outcome of a government appeal kenyon ruled that 
miller was a flight risk 
in august the appeals court refused to reconsider its decision 
us attorneys had the choice of appealing to the us supreme 
court or prosecuting again in district court 
assistant us attorney russell haymen who helped prosecute 
miller did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment 
monday 
miller the only fbi agent ever convicted of espionage spends 
his time in prison taking computer classes and waiting to see 
whether the government will try him again 
he seems to be holding up better than you or i would 
greenberg said he is a very stoic kind of fellow who takes what 
comes his way or goes with the flow to use one of his 
expressions 
at his trials prosecutors depicted miller as a bitter and 
vengeful man who was repeatedly reprimanded for ineptitude on the 
job they said miller was easily recruited the summer of 1984 by 
svetlana and her husband nikolay ogorodnikov soviet emigres 
living in los angeles 
on sept 27 1984 miller walked into an fbi office and 
confessed to having a relationship with mrs ogorodnikov he 
contended that he was trying to redeem his career by infiltrating 
the soviet kgb 
for the next four days testimony revealed miller underwent 
grilling by fbi agents while mrs ogorodnikov made frantic calls to 
his lynwood home and fbi offices in los angeles and santa ana 
trying to find him 
the two had planned a trip to vienna to meet with soviet 
intelligence agents prosecutors charged 
he was placed under arrest oct 2 1984 
the ogorodnikovs as codefendants pleaded guilty and are 
serving time in federal prison 
greenberg said he was confident miller would get a new trial or 
reach a realistic solution with the government 
i think the government has always blown this case far out of 
proportion to what it really is greenberg said were hopeful 
as we start down the road again that there will be a more realistic 
solution 
from prison miller writes frequently to his children most of 
whom have struck out on their own since his arrest greenberg said 
greenberg said he also receives nice phone calls and christmas 
cards from the ogorodnikovs 
nikolays very excited he thinks hes going to get a new 
trial if miller gets his again but he pleaded guilty greenberg 
said his biggest crime was being married to svetlana

liberia and taiwan have normalized 
relations 12 years after the african nation switched recognition 
from taipei to the rival communist government in china officials 
say 
the late monday night announcement by foreign minister lien chan 
represents a breakthrough for the nationalist governments new 
flexible policy of seeking diplomatic ties with countries that 
already have relations with beijing 
lien attributed taiwans diplomatic victory to its making more 
progress politically economically and socially than communist 
china 
the official broadcasting corp of china quoting unnamed 
sources said taiwan had agreed to offer liberia a 200 million 
loan foreign ministry officials declined comment 
the reestablishment of ties between taiwan and liberia comes 
three months after taiwan established ties with grenada china 
subsequently suspended diplomatic relations with the tiny caribbean 
island 
there was no immediate reaction from beijing to liberias 
decision 
taiwans latest moves come after decades of diplomatic reversals 
in which the overwhelming majority of nations chose to recognize 
the communists in beijing instead of the nationalists in taipei 
both governments have claimed to be the legitimate ruler of all 
china since the communists defeated the nationalists in a civil war 
that ended in 1949 
the number of countries with formal ties to the nationalist 
government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 24 not 
including liberia which is among the 134 countries that recognize 
china 
chan told a news conference monday night that taiwan and liberia 
would sign a formal communique on setting up diplomatic ties in a 
few days the two countries agreed to pursue normalization in 
january he said 
communist chinese leaders have criticized taiwans flexible 
diplomacy as a plan to promote two separate chinas a claim the 
nationalist officials deny 
liberia with a population of 25 million is an agricultural 
country that relies on the exports of coffee lumber and rubber 
liberia imported 24 million of industrial products from taiwan 
in 1988 its exports to taiwan totaled 270000

after 110 years so its resources can be used to improve its sister 
paper the news amp observer said the publisher who mourned the 
times as a daggone good newspaper 
it was a pretty wrenching decision said publisher frank 
daniels jr who is also president of the news amp observer 
publishing co 
the reader has voted and what they have said is they want 
the nampo a morning paper instead of the raleigh times an 
afternoon paper 
the times will cease publication nov 30 daniels said monday 
an internal task force that reviewed the performance of both 
papers reader preferences and other factors recommended closing 
the times as part of a plan to expand and improve the news amp 
observer daniels said 
afternoon dailies across the country have been in decline in 
recent years as publishers have found it increasingly difficult to 
make timely delivery to the suburbs and readers have opted for 
television news in the evening 
the news amp observer has a daily circulation of 145000 compared 
with the times 21500 
just not enough people wanted to read it daniels said i 
thought it was a daggone good newspaper 
for several years we have watched as afternoon dailies in 
metropolitan areas closed the publisher said we cannot make 
the improvements the news amp observer needs and still publish a 
quality afternoon newspaper 
the additional staff will be used to improve the news amp 
observers coverage of surrounding wake county and nearby durham 
daniels said that and other improvements could not be made as long 
as the times was being published he said

merging with two competitors it was renamed the raleigh times in

the senate finance committee is recommending a 
major improvement in benefits for the most affluent 10 percent of 
social security recipients who continue to work after retirement 
the panel which is writing a bill designed chiefly to reduce 
the budget deficit has agreed informally to raise by about 5600 
the maximum amount a person between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn 
without having to give up a portion of social security benefits 
that would boost the earnings limitation to about 14500 a 
year committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told reporters 
monday 
bentsen said the committee which was scheduled to begin work 
this afternoon had not resolved the two thorniest issues whether 
to reduce the tax on capital gains and whether medicare 
catastrophic insurance protection for retirees should be repealed 
or only cut back 
the capitalgains measure as passed by the house and 
supported by the administration will not in my opinion pass the 
senate or the committee bentsen said 
several members of the committee have suggested alternative 
capitalgains taxes bentsen said he was making no assumptions 
as to whether any of those will be approved 
the committee bentsen said is firmly behind allowing people 
between the ages of 65 and 69 to earn more without losing a part of 
their social security check 
according to congressional aides the earnings limitation 
affects only about 10 percent of social security recipients in 
1986 only 600000 beneficiaries had their social security checks 
reduced because of earnings the remaining 90 percent either did 
not work or had wages below the exempt amount 
present law permits a person between 65 and 69 to earn up to 
8880 in 1989 without losing benefits the pensioner loses 1 in 
benefits for each 2 earned above that level 
the earnings limitation rises each year with inflation and 
starting in 1990 recipients will lose 1 for each 3 earned above 
the limitation 
under the committees tentative action the earnings limitation 
would be increased by about 2800 in 1990 and 2800 in 1991 in 
place of the much smaller inflation adjustment 
according to bentsen that would raise the maximum earnings 
limit to about 14500 in 1991 for the next 5000 of wages the 
pensioner would lose 1 for each 4 of additional earnings 
a person 70 and older loses no social security benefit no matter 
how much is earned beneficiaries under 65 may earn up to 6480 
without giving up any part of the social security check 
the house ways and means committee has voted to raise the 
earnings limit for ages 65 through 69 to 9720 in 1990 and 10440 
in 1991

the commander of the atlantic fleets naval 
surface force is conducting a disciplinary inquiry aboard the uss 
iowa the battleship on which 47 sailors were killed in an april 
explosion pentagon sources say 
vice adm joseph s donnell iii is conducting the nonjudicial 
inquiry to determine whether the captain and several other officers 
should be punished the sources told the associated press monday 
the navy said after a lengthy study that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig most likely caused the explosion in the battleships 
no 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags 
but the investigation led by rear adm richard milligan also 
alleged numerous lax procedures aboard the ship including 
unauthorized experimentation with extrastrength gunpowder and 
projectile loads 
milligan said the officers had failed to qualify enough sailors 
for their specific duties in the gun turret and that many safety 
procedures had been circumvented 
he recommended that capt fred moosally and four other 
highranking men be relieved and disciplined however his 
superiors decided the men should receive nonjudicial punishment 
through the mast procedure 
donnell who was one of the endorsing officers of the final iowa 
report countered milligans recommendation that the five men be 
removed arguing that the infractions amounted to a failure of 
leadership on the captains part but were a marked departure 
from otherwise outstanding performance 
donnell is expected to conduct his inquiries separately for each 
of the men and the procedures are expected to last several days a 
pentagon source said the uss iowa is in the mediterranean 
besides moosally the men include the ships executive officer 
the weapons officer and a master chief petty officer who was found 
to have experimented with the gun firings 
the gunnery officer requested and received a transfer a 
separate procedure is expected to be conducted for him later the

the bush administration says it hopes the 
soviet union will help restart the stalled peace process in 
cambodia and ease the threat of revived civil war there 
david f lambertson deputy assistant secretary of state for 
east asian and pacific affairs spoke of a more constructive 
soviet role in indochina after recent useful discussions about 
cambodia with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
testifying before a senate foreign relations subcommittee 
monday lambertson defended the us policy of seeking a settlement 
in cambodia by backing prince norodom sihanouk and continued 
political and diplomatic isolation of vietnam 
he said the united states wants moscow to press its allies 
vietnam and the vietnambacked cambodian government to compromise 
with sihanouk and reverse the trend toward a military option in 
cambodia 
lambertson blamed the breakdown of the paris peace conference on 
cambodia in august on what he called vietnamese intransigence 
we plan to steadfastly maintain our support for the diplomatic 
and economic isolation of vietnam he said 
but east asian and pacific affairs subcommittee chairman alan 
cranston dcalif accused the administration of pursuing a 
morally bankrupt policy of backing sihanouks demand to include 
in an interim cambodian government the communist khmer rouge 
blamed for the loss of more than a million cambodian lives when 
they ruled from 197578 
mondays hearing was part of a search for new policy approaches 
cranston said 
khmer rouge rule dubbed cambodias era of the killing 
fields was followed by an 11year vietnamese occupation of 
cambodia that ended last month 
dith pran the cambodianborn new york times photographer whose 
escape from his homeland was portrayed in the movie the killing 
fields testified that collapse of the paris conference means 
cambodians are being forced by their leaders to go to the killing 
fields again 
sihanouk the other noncommunist cambodians and the association 
of southeast asian nations all maintain that leaving the khmer 
rouge completely out of the interim regime is certain to result 
in a bloody civil war lambertson said 
but dith pran said including the khmer rouge in cambodias 
future government would be like allowing highranking nazis in a 
postworld war ii german government

the national cancer institute says a drug 
used to fight worms in farm animals may be an important new device 
against colon cancer in humans 
i think this is an important advance dr samuel broder 
director of the nci said monday in announcing strong results for 
the drug when used in combination with an anticancer drug we 
might now be able to reduce the death rate due to colon cancer by 
as much as one third 
levamisole a drug widely used to remove worms from the 
intestinal tract of cows horses goats sheep and even elephants 
was used with a cancer drug to dramatically increase the survival 
rate among colon cancer patients nci officials said 
the levamisole was used in combination with 5fluorouracil 
levamisole is not approved for human medical treatment in the 
united states and currently is available to american physicians 
only through a nci research program approved by the food and drug 
administration the drug developed by a belgium pharmaceutical 
firm is used in europe however to treat intestinal parasites in 
humans 
the other drug 5fluorouracil or 5fu has been a standard in 
chemotherapy for some cancers for 30 years 
the drug combination was used successfully in a small clinical 
test and then expanded to a national clinical trial involving about 
1300 patients under the direction of dr charles g moertel of 
the mayo clinic in rochester minn the nci sponsored the national 
trial 
moertel said the findings showed that colon cancer patients at 
an advanced stage of the disease called duke c experienced about a 
onethird reduction in death and cancer recurrence after five years 
when compared to patients who received either no drugs or 
levamisole alone he said previous studies showed that 5fu had no 
effect on colon cancer 
it was only the combination said moertel that gave a 
significant reduction in the death rate just how the two drugs 
work together is not now understood moertel said 
until now there has been virtually no successful treatment 
available for duke c colon cancer patients he said 
duke c or stage iii of colon cancer is named for a physician 
who first characterized the progress of the disease at this stage 
the cancer has penetrated the colon wall and spread to the lymph 
nodes but there are no tumor cells detected in other organs duke 
c patients also have had the obvious tumors removed surgically 
along with the nearby lymph nodes 
broder said that about 110000 patients a year are diagnosed 
with colon cancer and 44000 will die of the disease about 21000 
of those deaths will be among patients who first received treatment 
at the duke c stage of the disease he said 
in the past he said medical science could offer such patients 
only surgery and regular examinations to monitor the disease 
progress fiveyear survival rate for these patients is 30 percent 
to 40 percent 
among duke c patients receiving the drug combination 49 percent 
were alive with no detected cancer recurrence after five years 
among patients in the study treated with surgery solely the 
survival rate was 37 percent he said 
moertel said the treatment has not been demonstrated to be 
effective in other stages of the disease

lawmakers miners developers and 
environmentalists are clashing over legislation that would 
designate about 95 million acres of california land as wilderness 
and national parks 
we need to draw clear lines that development can work around 
while saving some lands as parks and wildernesses sponsor sen 
alan cranston dcalif told a crowded hearing monday conducted by 
the senate energy and resources subcommittee on public lands 
national parks and forests 
congress in 1976 enacted the federal land policy and management 
act which established the california desert conservation area the 
bureau of land management developed a management plan for the 
california desert to balance the demands of environmentalists 
hunters miners ranchers energy developers tourists and the 
military 
however cranston said the blm has failed to protect important 
desert resources 
citing a report by the general accounting office cranston said 
the investigative arm of congress found that the bureau has 
frequently allowed the needs of competing interests such as 
recreation and commercial use to take precedence over wildlife 
interests when conflicts have arisen 
the bureau disputed that charge 
gaos report presents only a partial picture of blms wildlife 
activities in the california desert said cy jamison director of 
the bureau 
robert a sanregret a representative of the western mining 
council inc said the legislation would destroy thousands of 
private businesses and would literally make thousands of citizens

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may face 
a revolt among rankandfile communist party members but his 
reforms are likely to survive according to a senior cia analyst 
even if there is a temporary setback i think the process of 
reform will continue marc zlotnik of the cias office of soviet 
analysis said monday in a lecture at the kennan institute for 
advanced russian studies 
his remarks reflected a general sense of uncertainty among 
experts over the course of soviet politics in the short term after 
four years of often tumultuous reform since gorbachev came to power 
asked to comment on gorbachevs own description of a deepening 
economic and political crisis and reference to rumors of a 
conservative coup in moscow zlotnik said some spark could set 
things off to topple the senior leadership but no one is in a 
position to predict when it will come and whether it can be put out 
quickly 
the crisis is really serious zlotnik said but so far i 
think it is being managed pretty well

with a thursday deadline at hand the united 
states and egypt are exerting heavy pressure on israel to go along 
with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with palestinian 
representatives 
egyptian president hosni mubarak sounded upbeat monday about 
prospects for a peace settlement saying a golden opportunity 
exists that must not be squandered 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has been campaigning 
hard for a more flexible israeli position on the issue said israel 
should not feel threatened by the 10point proposal for peace talks 
set forth by mubarak 
the inner cabinet of ministers from likud and labor is to meet 
thursday on mubaraks ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed 
likud rejects mubaraks acceptance of a usbacked formula that 
involves trading occupied land for peace and including people 
deported by israel in a palestinian negotiating delegation labor 
led by finance minister shimon peres supports both ideas 
mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peace 
process is to persuade the israelis and the palestinians to enter a 
dialogue without preconditions 
we wont get to peace until palestinians and israelis speak to 
each other baker said 
baker regards the egyptian plan as a complement to not a 
substitite for shamirs proposal for elections in which 
palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with israel 
on limited selfgovernment in the occupied territories 
mondays white house session came amid new concern that settling 
jewish immigrants from the soviet union in the israelioccupied 
west bank could threaten peace efforts 
bush administration officials reacted coolly to an israeli 
request for 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 
100000 jewish emigres from the soviet union israeli officials 
have said some dwellings probably will be in the west bank 
the united states policy is to oppose additional settlements 
in the occupied territories baker said 
baker also said us ability to assist israel is limited by 
severe budgetary constraints

a medical research laboratory targeted by 
animal welfare activists faces a 2500 for harassing two 
agriculture department inspectors at the facility during a 1987 
visit 
the agriculture departments chief administrative judge victor 
w palmer on monday ordered sema inc to comply with every 
provision of the animal welfare act and not to interfere with 
federal inspections 
animal rights activists claim the suburban washington lab 
mistreats its chimpanzees and other animals used in viral research 
under contract with the national institutes of health 
the two veterinary inspectors who work for the animal and plant 
health inspection service said company employees prevented them 
from taking pictures of cages decoding information about the 
animals and driving away from the lab on june 29 1987 
in a followup report at the lab the inspectors reported 
finding deficiencies in sanitation that were suggestive of 
violations of regulations but concluded sema did not violate the 
welfare act 
sema president john landon and his attorney declined comment on 
the order until they saw it writing 
the company has 35 days to appeal the decision 
people for the ethical treatment of animals which is based in 
washington has publicly shown films it claims were taken at sema 
during a burglary allegedly by an underground animal rights group 
chimpanzee researcher jane goodall has also publicly criticized the 
company about the size of cages and other treatment of chimps there 
sema had a 15 millionayear contract with nih for research 
into simian aids and hepatitis at the end of last year and was 
conducting experiments on nearly 500 monkeys chimpanzees 
woodchucks and other animals peta has long complained that sema 
has one of the highest mortality rates for its animals in the 
country but the company denies that allegation

the standoff over where to bury 
ferdinand marcos is the latest example of body politics a 
filipino game corazon aquinos supporters once played themselves to 
rally a nation and topple a dictator 
rules of the game demand protracted wakes vigils and novenas 
players include grieving relatives who regale reporters 
television audiences and crowds of spectators with tales of 
injustice and appeals to respect filipino tradition 
the object is to play on the filipinos almost mystical respect 
for the dead to promote the cause of the deceased and the fortunes 
of the living 
since marcos died thursday in exile in hawaii manila radio and 
television stations and newspapers have in daily reports showed the 
grieving widow imelda standing before the former presidents open 
coffin 
mrs marcos has vowed to do all she can to return her husbands 
remains to his homeland despite president aquinos refusal to 
allow his burial here 
i also ask for your prayers to give me strength to that i will 
see the victory of my struggle to clear the name of president 
marcos and the whole nation mrs marcos said in a radio 
interview broadcast here today 
the scene in honolulu is an ironic parody of the events of six 
years ago after mrs aquinos husband sen benigno aquino jr 
was murdered moments after returning from the united states to 
challenge marcos 
after the aug 21 1983 slaying the aquino family held a 
nineday wake during which thousands of people filed by to view the 
body still dressed in the bloodsoaked clothes in which aquino 
died 
perhaps two million people turned out for the funeral as 
aquinos body was paraded over a 19mile route aboard a 10wheel 
flatbed truck 
the outrage over the killing galvanized antimarcos sentiment 
and paved the way for the uprising which toppled the longtime 
president and propelled aquinos widow into the presidency on feb 
25 1986 
body politics has been played by lesser figures too 
marcos mother josefa edralinmarcos died on may 4 1988 but 
marcos followers hoped to use her death to dramatize their 
leaders exile and embarass the government into allowing him to 
return the ploy failed 
mrs edralinmarcos remains unburied lying in an open casket in 
batac 250 miles north of manila diehard marcos loyalists carry 
on a vigil which has been largely forgotten 
the military has also discovered the merits of body politics in 
its campaign to discredit the communist new peoples army which is 
waging a 20year insurgency 
under marcos the military tried to hide figures on the number 
of soldiers killed by both communist insurgents and moslem 
guerrillas in the south but no more 
on sept 3 rebels killed 13 soldiers working on a highway 
construction project in quezon province as commanders spoke of 
this outrage television cameras panned the flagdraped corpses 
and grieving widows 
the military also claims the rebels have been carrying out a 
protracted purge of their ranks and have killed scores of party 
members suspected of disloyalty 
with the discovery of every killing field where rebels 
allegedly bury the victims the military encourages television 
cameras to film as bones are unearthed from shallow graves 
at dinnerhour newscasts filipinos watch as elderly peasants 
weep over the bones supposedly of their sons and daughters 
executed by the rebels

a middle school has transformed itself into a 
laboratory on ways to improve race relations where teachers hope to 
erase past tensions and perhaps serve as a model for the rest of 
the nation 
some kids cultural upbringing is different some of it is 
unconscious we need to learn to understand each other better 
says robert pipkin principal of the prospect middle school center 
for multiracial multiethnic and multicultural education 
prospect teachers and their sixth seventh and eighthgrade 
students are learning the fine points of dealing with whites 
blacks asians hispanics and native americans 
the students split almost evenly among whites and blacks will 
learn about the cultures of other races and ethnic groups in hope 
they will find their differences enlightening rather than divisive 
the school in pittsburghs racially balanced mount washington 
section will retain its traditional curriculum but also will 
teach students to recognize racism and its consequences teachers 
also will try to provide lessons free of racial bias 
another part of the program could prove more controversial 
since some studies indicate children of different races and 
cultural backgrounds have different learning styles teachers will 
be taught to expand their repertoire of teaching methods said 
psychologist stanley denton the pittsburgh school districts 
director of multicultural education 
white children tend to be abstract learners in the area of 
mathematics for example they can learn by being exposed to a 
formula denton said 
black children in general learn best when the lesson is 
embedded within a context or accompanied by examples he said 
this is an oversimplification of course he said there 
are always wide variations and exceptions 
attempts to put these theories to work elsewhere have offended 
blacks 
people tend to equate abstract learning with higher thinking 
which isnt the case at all denton said 
administrators hope the program will generate new ideas that can 
be used in other schools in pittsburgh and perhaps across the 
country 
we want a program that will celebrate diversity and encourage 
kids to be proud of their background and knowledgeable about their 
cultural heritage denton said 
the first year of the program will involve mostly training and 
planning next september however the center will begin projects 
designed to enhance students selfesteem teach the histories of 
different minorities and sensitize teachers to their own racial 
attitudes 
about 52 percent of the districts 39500 students are black and 
47 percent are white one percent come from other minority groups 
of prospects 625 students 48 percent are black 
the district invited teachers to apply to work in the new 
program and 90 percent of prospects teachers and staff are new to 
the school this year 35 percent or 21 of the schools 59 
fulltime teachers are black and the rest are white 
the idea for the changes sprang from a study that found black 
male students in pittsburgh got suspended from schools more often 
than others 
we also had a couple of incidents of racism pipkin said 
we had some teachers making blatant remarks about afroamerican 
kids and episodes between back and while students some racial 
name calling 
changes also were suggested by business and community advisers 
concerned about black students complaints of racial harassment at 
colleges and universities including pennsylvania state university 
indiana university of pennsylvania and carnegie mellon university

automakers criticized a congressional proposal to 
extend californias tough auto exhaust standards to the entire 
country as needlessly expensive and of doubtful value 
the california rules were adopted for a unique part of the 
country with a unique problem said william noack director of 
general motors corps media relations office in washington why 
bring standards for that part of the country nationwide when the 
need for them is not there 
the proposal emerged monday from a subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee on a 220 vote it virtually assures 
some form of tough new tailpipe emission controls because the 
senates clean air legislation is even stricter 
under the house plan passed as a proposed amendment to a clean 
air bill put forth by president bush californiastyle controls 
would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be in effect in 
all states by 1996 
noack said the subcommittee plan wouldnt make the air any 
cleaner than the administration plan but will cost the consumer 
more 
the environmental protection agency has estimated the additional 
emission controls would add 100 to the cost of each car 
ford motor co vice chairman harold poling said his company 
supported bushs proposal despite some reservations 
however this action goes well beyond that proposal poling 
said of the subcommittee plan though the provisions would make 
auto standards far more stringent they would improve air quality a 
mere 1 percent compared with bushs proposal he said 
poling also said there are serious safety questions about vapor 
recovery systems that would be mandated under the provisions 
chrysler corp spokesman tom houston also criticized 
subcommittee proposal first the proposed standards stretch the 
limits of technological feasibility and we presently lack 
assurance that these standards can be met at the levels of 
reliability and quality the american public demands houston said 
andy bucksbaum executive director of the public interest 
research group in michigan praised the proposal 
were very encouraged by this compromise bucksbaum said 
its an excellent first step particularly in area of controlling 
smaller pollutants

the government ordered a probe 
today into why searchers failed to find any trace of a capsized 
yacht whose crew claims to have drifted four months off new zealand 
before being washed ashore 
there are many discrepancies in their story said terry 
knight head of the new zealand search and rescue 
the four say their 42foot trimaran capsized in a storm june 3 
and that they survived the 121day ordeal huddled in the overturned 
craft by spearing fish eating seaweed and trapping rainwater 
the four turned up over the weekend on great barrier island but 
some officials have expressed skepticism about their story saying 
they appear too healthy 
we needed a miracle and we got one said john glennie 
skipper of the sailboat the rose noelle 
glennie said the trimaran left picton on the northern coast of 
the south island on june 1 for a threeweek pacific islands cruise 
to the polynesian kingdom of tonga 
he told authorities the boat was flipped over by a huge wave in 
a 60knot wind on the third day of the journey and that the four 
activated an emergency beacon after scrambling to retrieve radio 
equipment flares clothing and food 
its an amazing story said knight the area the yachtsmen 
say they were in when they made their last radio message was not 
anywhere near where the search was done 
the inquiry was announced by transport minister bill jeffries 
whose responsibilities include the marine division in charge of sea 
rescue operations 
jeffries told reporters his department wanted to clarify why the 
boat was apparenty hundreds of miles from where its distress signal 
was sent and why the yachts emergency beacon apparently operated 
for a week well within range of an aircraft monitoring service 
without being detected 
they say they were just off the new zealand coast but the 
radio message we had put them hundreds of miles away at the 
kermadec islands nearer tonga knight said it was a very big 
area to cover 
alex gibbs a marine division official told the associated 
press there was some confusion about when and where the boat 
capsized 
it is curious he said based on winds and sea currents 
it would make more sense if they were further north 
gibbs said the yacht was smashed on the rocky coast of great 
barrier island 60 miles northeast of auckland after the crew made 
landfall on sunday he said the inquiry was normal procedure 
the crew included owner and skipper glennie phillip hoffman and 
rick hellriegal of new zealand and jim nalepka 38 of minneapolis 
glennie responding to suspicions today the crew was too healthy 
to have survived such an ordeal told reporters its not a 
hoax 
the crew members emerged monday but without the salt water sores 
typical of extended seawater exposure 
hellriegel reunited with his family breakfasted today on 
bacon eggs and mushrooms washed down with fresh coffee said the 
new zealand press association

the us occupational safety and health 
administration reportedly intends to push for regulations to 
protect millions of rescue workers from exposure to aids and other 
bloodborne diseases 
the measures estimated cost is 800 million the highest figure 
in the agencys history the atlanta journalconstitution reported 
today 
the regulations are needed because a cavalier attitude 
toward infections is increasing the danger of sickness and death 
among health workers said dr joseph h coggin jr a consultant 
to osha 
an estimated 53 million nurses police officers ambulance 
drivers embalmers firefighters and prison guards would be covered 
by the regulations 
in spite of a barrage of literature about the modern dangers 
of laboratoryacquired infections and how to prevent them workers 
in the average laboratory today fail to faithfully wear protective 
clothing gloves and face shields said coggin head of the 
department of microbiology and immunology at the university of 
south alabama medical school in mobile 
coggin said he witnessed incidents in which employees lunches 
were kept in a refrigerator along with aidsinfected blood samples 
a surgical assistant used a hallway telephone while wearing 
bloodsoaked gloves and janitors removed biohazardous waste in 
unprotected street clothes 
most of these workers recognize the potential danger and even 
lethal outcomes of a laboratory exposure to bloodborne viruses and 
agents but yield to the pressure of getting the work done 
quickly coggin said 
most health workers coggin said appear to be unaware of 
voluntary guidelines that the national centers for disease control 
in atlanta has suggested for handling contaminated blood 
he said that without the required actions workers in 
laboratories hospitals and research centers will continue to 
have infectious disease transmitted needlessly through blood and 
human materials in the workplace 
the cdc has reported 18 cases of infection with hiv the virus 
that can cause aids as a result of workplace exposure and an 
estimated 12000 healthcare workers now contract hepatitis b every 
year because of occupational exposure 
according to the newspaper osha has proposed requiring 
gloves face shields gowns fluidresistant clothing and other 
equipment for any workers who might be exposed to potentially 
infectious materials 
employerpaid vaccinations of all employees whose jobs exposed 
them to hepatitis b as well as followup examinations and blood 
tests after exposure incidents 
safety features such as double doors easily washed surfaces 
areas for decontamination and sinks for washing in work areas where 
hepatitis b or the aids virus is produced for research purposes 
any rules formulated by osha must be approved by the federal

against the japanese yen in tokyo today despite intervention by 
japans central bank while stock prices fell

of 13930 yen it opened at 13972 yen and ranged between 13970

currency traders said the bank of japan intervened several times 
in the morning selling dollars at about the 140yen level but did 
not act in the afternoon and the dollar rose quickly in the last 
halfhour of trading 
it was not immediately known how much the central bank sold the 
bank normally does not comment on its exchange market activities 
there was no real reason to buy dollars but the market still 
seemed to be short of the currency it looks like the market will 
continue to support the dollar said minori takeuchi a trader at 
chemical bank 
many players were sitting on the sidelines awaiting the results 
of a meeting of west germanys central bank on thursday she said 
there have been rumors that the bank will raise interest rates 
tokyo investors were focusing on selling west german marks and 
buying yen thus helping the dollar to strengthen against other 
major currencies said a bank of tokyo trader on condition of 
anonymity 
on the stock exchange the rebound of the dollar didnt do 
much to help the sentiment of the market said a dealer at 
kleinwort benson securities who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said many investors were sitting on the sidelines watching the 
currency markets 
many people seemed content to lock in the shortterm gains of 
the past few days he said referring to sales for profittaking 
stocks that were strong last week including securities 
insurance railway and retailer sales issues fell back 
shares in some smaller companies and warehousing firms rose 
strongly 
it wasnt all doom and gloom it was mostly the big stocks 
that were being hit in the markets decline the trader said

a rash of overdoses and deaths attributed 
to particularly potent chips of black tar heroin has addicts 
and occasional users alike terrified and frantically seeking 
treatment officials said 
from friday through monday three people died and dozens of 
others were treated after they literally were knocked off their 
feet and rendered unconscious after injecting themselves with the 
mostpopular form of heroin in the drug world 
its the talk of the neighborhood said eddie franks 
director of the facts on crack program at glide memorial church in 
the tenderloin district where most of the overdoses occurred 
what were here for now is prevention and support while this 
epidemic is going on franks said adding that a 24hour crisis 
telephone line has been set up and will operate as long as 
necessary 
police inspector sam osborne said a dealer probably forgot to 
mix the heroin with other materials to dilute its strength which 
normally is 6 percent to 9 percent pure 
tests showed the heroin had a 36 percent to 38 percent purity 
said lt jim mollinari since overdose cases fell off sharply he 
said my guess is theres probably not much more out there 
black tar named for its color and gooey appearance has become 
the most commonly used heroin by san franciscos estimated 15000 
to 18000 addicts since coming on the scene about seven years ago 
said dr alex stalcup medical director of the haightashbury free 
clinic 
it sells for about 20 a bag that can be broken into several 
shots 
the clinic generally treats about 120 people daily and turns 
away about 10 or 15 within a couple of hours monday it had turned 
away almost 40 he said 
the people who buy street heroin are literally playing with 
their lives he said 
the fatalities were said to be men ages 35 41 and 43 the san 
francisco coroners office did not release names 
last week federal drug enforcement administration agents seized 
2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near san francisco 
international airport

a geyserlike volcano blasting nitrogen 
ice and gas five miles high was photographed on neptunes moon 
triton by voyager 2 in the crafts last hurrah of its grand 
solarsystem tour 
the discovery announced monday as voyager 2 formally ended its 
twomonth encounter with neptune proves triton is the solar 
systems third known object with active eruptions scientists said 
the others are earth and jupiters moon io which has 
sulfurspewing volcanoes and geysers 
photographs radioed to earth when voyager flew past neptune and 
triton in august showed dark plumeshaped deposits of material 
lying on tritons south polar ice cap 
at the time scientists believed the deposits were created by 
volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward they said 
they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active during 
the past few centuries 
but it wasnt until late last week that closer examination of 
pictures taken from 62000 miles revealed an eruption in progress 
said ellis miner deputy voyager project scientist at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
we caught one in the act he said 
a national aeronautics and space administration news release 
called such eruptions geyserlike phenomena 
but voyagers project scientist edward stone said from the 
standpoint of a major eruption one would clearly discuss it as a 
volcano 
he said a column of dark material rising five miles from the 
surface can bee seen 
on earth volcanoes erupt material that makes up the planets 
crust molten rock while geysers spew water 
its a semantic issue said university of arizona scientist 
brad smith head of voyagers photographic imaging team 
the eruption isnt apparent in any single image of triton but 
was recognized by examining several images taken from different 
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques nasa said 
calling the discovery voyagers last hurrah in its journey past 
the planets 
voyager 2s encounter with the solar systems fourthlargest 
planet formally started aug 5 and ended monday when the oneton 
probe was 347 million miles past neptune traveling at 37337 mph 
the spacecraft was 283 billion miles from earth and traveled a 
curved 446billionmile path since its launch in 1977 voyager 2 
explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
although voyager will continue to look back at neptune until 
december mondays formal end of the encounter was marked by the 
activation of new computer commands replacing the program that 
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close 
examination of neptune 
voyager 2 like its twin voyager 1 is expected to return 
information to earth for 25 or 30 more years before its plutonium 
power generators fail the probes will measure magnetic fields and 
electrically charged particles in space as they search for the edge 
of the solar system voyager 1 explored jupiter in 1979 and saturn 
in 1980 
scientists dont know what causes the eruptions on triton which 
is about fourfifths the size of earths moon and is the coldest 
known object in the solar system with a surface temperature of 400 
degrees below zero fahrenheit 
stone said one possibility is that heat from sunlight penetrates 
and is trapped below tritons polar ice evaporating nitrogen ice 
into gas that powers the eruptions 
the active volcano is the third and apparently the only active 
type of volcanism discovered on triton

alaskas efforts to prevent oil and gas 
exploration in the rich fishing grounds of bristol bay focused on 
congress as the us supreme court declined to hear the states 
latest appeal 
the court monday left intact rulings that allowed the federal 
government to sell 94 million worth of exploratory leases last 
year on 56 million acres of the bay off southwest alaska 
it means as we suspected that the battle has shifted to 
congress which is moving in the direction of protecting bristol 
bay from development said randall weiner executive director of 
the environmental group trustees for alaska 
state attorney general douglas baily said he was not surprised 
by the courts action weve been focusing on congress in part 
because we didnt want to trust all of our eggs in the basket of 
the supreme court 
state officials environmental groups and fishing organizations 
have said the relatively small chance of finding large amounts of 
oil under bristol bay is not worth the risk of an oil spill to fish 
and wildlife 
they also contend that a spill would do more environmental harm 
there than the exxon valdez spill did to prince william sound the 
march 24 tanker disaster the nations worst oil spill forced the 
closure of several fishing areas 
bristol bay supports the worlds largest red salmon fishery 
worth more than 1 billion annually and the largest herring 
fishery in us waters it also is home to a majority of the 
worlds northern fur seals the pacific gray whale population and 
millions of seabirds geese and ducks 
bristol bay is the only place weve opposed oil development 
and for one chief reason the risk to the fishery isnt worth the 
potential oil spill said gov steve cowper the courts action 
is disappointing but shouldnt be a surprise to anyone 
an agreement in a housesenate conference committee last week 
would prohibit any drilling in the bay for a year and require the 
interior department to consider buying back the leases 
under the plan any buyback recommendation would be tied to the 
results of an interior department study of the effects of the exxon 
valdez spill that study also would look at the adequacy of 
spillcontingency plans for bristol bay development only congress 
could authorize the repurchases 
the agreement is contained in the departments fiscal 1990 
spending bill which was expected to return to the house today and 
the senate by wednesday for final approval said jane robbins 
press secretary for sen ted stevens ralaska 
the studies and interiors recommendation are due by march 1991 
meaning no exploration is likely in bristol bay before then 
sue flensburg director of the bristol bay coastal resource 
service area in dillingham said the congressional moratorium and 
eventual repurchase of the leases represent the last chances to 
protect the bay 
at this point im pretty confident that it will make it 
through the appropriations bill and thats about the best we can 
hope for at this point she said 
weiner said the congressional effort is more significant in 
light of mondays court action 
bristol bay is one of the worlds most productive fisheries 
and home to seven species of endangered mammals he said its 
one of the last places in this country that should be developed for 
oil

californias insurance commissioner put an 
immediate sixmonth freeze on auto insurance rates and said she 
would set the size of votermandated rate rollbacks by the end of 
the year 
commissioner roxani gillespie said monday she ordered the freeze 
partly in response to an announcement last week by farmers 
insurance group that it would raise auto rates by 59 percent nov 
1 that would be one week before proposition 103 gives the state 
department of insurance authority to veto rate increases 
some other insurance companies indicated they had similar plans 
she said 
the rate freeze i am imposing will protect consumers and clamp 
a lid on any insurance company attempting to raise rates she 
said 
gillespie also said she would set industrywide standards for 
the rate rollback required by the proposition and for future rate 
approvals by her department at hearings scheduled to start oct 
30 she said the standards would apply to every insurance company 
in the state 
a court challenge to the freeze is a good possibility said 
david fountain spokesman for farmers and state farm which have 
formed the personal insurance federation of california 
the moves were applauded by consumer groups that had accused 
gillespie of trying to undermine the initiative which was approved 
by voters last november 
were on the road to a solution said nettie hoge of 
consumers union 
in august gillespie said she would consider individually every 
insurance companys request for an exemption from the propositions 
requirement of a 20 percent rate rollback in order to implement a 
state supreme court ruling guaranteeing insurers a fair rate of 
return 
she also made statements widely interpreted as exempting 184 
insurers from even being considered from a rollback companies 
whose profit levels for auto property and liability insurance were 
below 112 percent that represented a 15year industry average 
gillespie said 
gillespie told reporters monday those firms were never 
exempted 
fountain said farmers needed a rate increase because it was 
suffering losses under a program in which insurers are randomly 
assigned policies of highrisk drivers under rates set by the 
state but gillespie said her department would address the 
assignedrisk problem in a hearing friday on a rquest for a 112 
percent rate increase for the program

government officials have for 
the first time negotiated with leading antiapartheid leaders about 
ending the 3yearold rent boycott in soweto the countrys largest 
black township 
business day a johannesburg daily today described the talks as 
the highestlevel bargaining session ever held between the 
whitecontrolled government and major antiapartheid activisits 
it quoted one unidentified activist as calling mondays parley 
in which the government offered to waive some unpaid rent an 
unprecedented breakthrough because the activists were accepted as 
primary negotiating partners 
the boycott has been one of the most effective protests by 
blacks since a national state of emergency was declared in june 
1986 
soweto home to an estimated 25 million blacks on the outskirts 
of johannesburg has been the hardesthit of several townships 
affected by rent boycotts it has lost more than 100 million in 
revenue 
the government delegation led by transvaal province 
administrator danie hough met in pretoria with soweto city 
councilors and prominent activists including anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu the rev frank chikane general secretary of the 
south african council of churches and albertina sisulu 
copresident of the united democratic front antiapartheid 
coalition 
hough said the activists have a very important role to play 
an unusual government acknowledgement of the influence enjoyed by 
militant leaders within black communities he said the delegations 
would meet again 
the government could not accept demands to write off all unpaid 
rent but a partial waiver could be negotiated hough said 
he offered to negotiate ways to transfer ownership of rented 
houses to their occupants another demand of the activists 
hough said a demand that soweto and johannesburg be unified to 
share tax revenue was probably impractical 
chikane the activists spokesman said the meeting showed that 
we can resolve problems by talking rather than relegating the 
solution to the police 
police have tried periodically to evict boycotters from their 
homes one such campaign in august 1986 led to confrontations in 
which more than 20 blacks were killed by police gunfire 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

carnegie halls archivist says he would give 
anything for a ticket from opening night in 1891 to add to the 
souvenirs being collected for the halls 100th anniversary 
gino francesconi says he knows an original ticket is out there 
somewhere 
i was told by a collector that he had seen it five or six 
years ago he said monday 
photos from pre1920 and posters from before 1960 still are 
needed francesconi said 
most of those are just hanging on peoples walls i cant 
believe that there arent posters of mark twain woodrow wilson 
toscanini out there francesconi said 
the call for historic items already has turned up other goodies 
including the silver trowel used by andrew carnegies wife louise 
to lay the cornerstone in 1890 and a ribbon that was cut on opening 
night in 1891 
bennie goodmans daughter rachel edelson donated one of her 
late fathers clarinets and lots of photographs and recordings 
have surfaced 
the items will be shown in special exhibitions in 1990 and 1991 
and some eventually will be displayed in a carnegie hall museum 
francesconi has most of the house programs but is missing those 
from 189298 192837 and 194447 
there are things out there that people assume we have he 
said maybe once upon a time we did but when the hall was 
threatened with demolition in the late 1950s we know stuff 
disappeared they wanted to take souvenirs before carnegie hall was 
gone for good 
francesconi is also hoping to turn up correspondence relating to 
the hall 
people have responded from all over the country its just 
been fantastic he said but were fighting the clock now 
weve given ourselves until march to look for material

mayor coleman young has agreed to pay 11700 a 
year and create a 150000 education trust for a 6yearold boy to 
settle a paternity suit a judge announced 
the outofcourt settlement was called generous by lawyers for 
both sides and resolves the matter five weeks before detroits 
mayoral election in which young is seeking a fifth term 
under terms of the settlement announced monday by chief wayne 
circuit court judge richard kaufman young will pay 225 a week 
11700 annually to joel loving until he turns 19 he also will 
set aside enough money to create a 150000 trust for the boys 
education 
we feel that its a rather good settlement for joel loving 
said noel keane lawyer for the boys mother annivory calvert 
we have virtually established his welfare through age 18 and 
certainly given him a nice little stipend to start his life 
calvert 34 a former detroit city official who is now director 
of public works for the city of fontana calif sued young in 
january in may laboratory tests proved the fourterm 71yearold 
mayor was the boys father 
from this point on ill be able to get on with the rest of my 
life calvert said 
lawrence charfoos youngs lawyer also said the settlement was 
generous 
the mayor has done as fine a job of taking care of his son as 
any son can ask of a father he said 
the trust will pay 10000 installments each year from the boys 
19th through 24th birthday when he turns 25 the trust will 
terminate and he will receive the remaining 90000 the payments 
require the boy who turns 7 on oct 18 him to pursue a 
postsecondary education keane said 
we hope beyond the money young will establish a father 
relationship keane said 
charfoos said youngs relationship with his son is obviously a 
significant concern but wouldnt discuss what young plans to do 
the settlement means youngs income tax returns will remain 
private along with the amount of money in his campaign coffers 
estimated to be about 5 million before the primary 
the mayor is running for a fifth fouryear term against tom 
barrow an accountant whom young defeated soundly four years ago

the government freed opposition leader 
ricardo arias calderon and eight of his colleagues after 
questioning them about their campaign to slash government revenues 
during a 20hour detention 
but all nine face charges including crimes against the state 
crimes against the administration of justice and crimes against the 
national economy attorney general carlos villalaz said 
the most serious of the accusations carries a 15 to 20 year 
prison sentence according to the penal code 
arias a vice presidential candidate in may elections was 
arrested sunday in veraguas province 180 miles west of the 
capital he and the the others had been promoting the 
antigovernment campaign they call not one penny more 
authorities called it economic insurrection and questioned 
him for four hours before he was freed on monday he said 
the opposition is urging panamanians to delay paying taxes and 
utility bills and to boycott the statecontrolled lottery and 
gambling casinos 
the campaign aims to withold essential funds from the government 
run by gen manuel antonio noriega panama has already been badly 
hurt by us economic sanctions 
former presidential candidate guillermo endara is in the 14th 
day of a hunger strike aimed at encouraging panamanians to join the 
campaign 
when the regime reacts in such an exaggerated way to a 
nonviolent campaign it is revealing the impact of the campaign 
the weakness of the regime and its bad conscience arias said in 
divisa 150 miles west of panama city 
he said the group was arrested sunday by about 20 people 
carrying ak47 assault rifles and revolvers 
physically there was no mistreatment but there was 
psychological mistreatment he said 
a statement by endara said the opposition reiterates its 
promise to keep fighting for the establishment of a democratic 
system of government and full respect for human rights by the 
peaceful means we have been following despite the escalation of 
violations and attacks from the dictatorial regime 
villalaz said four other opposition activists were detained 
sunday in chiriqui province 240 miles west of panama city and the 
defense forces said they remained jailed 
arias was one of two opposition vice presidential candidates in 
may 7 national elections the government annulled after returns 
showed the opposition winning by a landslide 
the united states imposed sanctions on panama after noriega was 
indicted on us drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges in 
1988 noriega denies the charges 
the sanctions included witholding taxes owed to panama for use 
of the canal and banning us companies from doing business with a 
list of panamanian individuals and enterprises 
washington considers endara and his running mates panamas 
legitimate leaders 
noriega named his longtime friend francisco rodriguez 
provisional president on sept 1 the day the former presidents 
term ended

borrowing rhetoric from franklin roosevelt 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said a new worldwide 
great depression is looming and called for a new deal for third 
world debtor nations 
right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep 
economic depression shevardnadze said in a speech monday to the 
foreign policy association 
the debt of the third world countries the interest they have 
to pay and the pace of their economic development are these not 
the signs of an impending catastrophe he asked 
developing nations have a 13 trillion foreign debt mostly to 
banks in the industrialized western nations 
many third world nations are unable to pay even the interest on 
their debt and their economies are stagnating as their scarce 
funds are used to repay debt rather than build their economies 
radical new steps are needed a kind of new deal said 
shevardnadze speaking in russian with the help of a translator 
he said the united states and his country should share advanced 
technology with the developing world and said some debt should 
be forgiven a concept already being advanced by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady 
the soviet union holds almost none of the developing worlds 
debt 
shevardnadze compared the soviet unions current social upheaval 
and economic travail with the great depression in america when 
radical sentiment grew and many soviet communists predicted the 
imminent downfall of capitalism 
in 1929 a powerful and confident state took an economic 
nosedive there were bread lines in new yorks times square and 
tents of the jobless huddled along riverside drive 
in washington troops were fighting the bonus army that had 
invaded the capital people were dying in demonstrations strikes 
and riots said shevardnadze adding that the same is happening 
in his country today 
the soviet unions economic system is undergoing an 
adjustment he said something similar happened in the united 
states 60 years ago 
but he added so long as there is the will the understanding 
of the situation and the determination to change things for the 
better and we certainly have them the economy can remedy its 
ills 
shevardnadze predicted that nations would one day compete not 
for political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to 
water fresh air and even a green lawn such conflicts could be 
caused by demographic problems hunger and poverty among part of 
the worlds population or by epidemics of infectious disease 
during a questionandanswer session shevardnadze declined to 
say whether the soviet union is likely to renew diplomatic ties 
with israel any time soon 
he also ducked a question on soviet policy toward the flow of 
refugees from east germany to west germany saying those two 
countries will be able to sort out that problem

a woman has the right to retain two homes 
used in drug sales if she can prove she opposed her husbands 
deals a federal appeals court ruled 
mondays ruling by a threejudge panel of the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals sets a precedent in protecting the privacy of a 
married couple said john paul garhart attorney for jane diloreto 
us district judge gerald weber ordered the property forfeited 
after determining mrs diloreto knew her husband was selling drugs 
from the houses 
but the appeals court said weber should have allowed mrs 
diloreto to argue she opposed her husbands use of the homes the 
court also said weber improperly considered hearsay evidence in 
making his decision 
garhart said mrs diloreto the mother of four faced a dilemma 
either break up the family or continue living with her husband in 
their erie homed despite his drug dealing 
the government would have us carve so deeply into the marital 
relationship for so little gain in the war on drugs he said 
garhart said the appeals court seemed to be trying to make the 
statute comport to the real world 
the 3rd circuit placed the burden of proof on mrs diloreto and 
gave the district court leeway to decide whether she will need any 
evidence beyond her denials to support her defense 
diloretos husband richard 32 was convicted aug 10 1988 of 
conspiracy to sell 1 million worth of cocaine and marijuana two 
counts of using a telephone in the conspiracy and failing to report 
income from cocaine sales 
last month he was sentenced to five years in prison without 
parole 
assistant us attorney constance m bowden would not comment on

a judge sentenced israeli peace activist 
abie nathan today to six months in prison for violating an israeli 
law by meeting with plo chairman yasser arafat 
nathan who pleaded guilty to the charge last week said he 
would fight to overturn the law even from my prison cell he 
received a oneyear suspended sentence in addition to the jail term 
the 63yearold nathan operates the pirate radio station voice 
of peace from a ship in the mediterranean 
dressed in black pants and a black shirt nathan stood silent as 
aharon fass deputy president of the ramle magistrates court read 
the sentence 
he told reporters later that his jailing would not halt his 
efforts for arabisraeli peace 
if somebody thinks im going to stop theyre in for big 
surprises he said i hope that public opinion and the people 
in the streets will understand that this law is an obstacle to 
peace 
i will continue even from my prison cell to protest against 
this law and immediately after prison i shall continue to speak 
to the enemy he said 
the sentencing came as arguments raged in israels coalition 
cabinet over whether to agree to egyptian president hosni mubaraks 
call for israel to hold peace talks with palestinians approved by 
the plo 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo which it calls a 
terrorist organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes 
meeting a ploapproved delegation but the leftleaning labor party 
accepts the plan 
the meetings would be a first step toward resolving the 
21monthold palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the west 
bank and gaza strip at least 575 arabs and 40 israelis have died 
in the revolt 
nathan pleaded guilty wednesday to meeting with arafat and other 
plo activists in tunisia and france in september 1988 
he told the court he knew he was violating a 1986 amendment to 
the antiterror law that prohibits holding meetings with terrorist 
organizations 
the court ruled that nathan could start his sentence after the 
yom kippur jewish holiday on monday 
nathan faced a threeyear sentence but the few people convicted 
as violators have had sentences commuted to public service the 
judgment said nathan had more responsibility as a public figure 
defense lawyer pinhas marinsky said nathan would not appeal the 
sentence 
the court judgment said of nathan no matter the good of his 
intentions or his motives it cannot release him of his criminal 
responsibility in a democratic state its inconceivable to 
take the law into your own hands 
nathan is best known for his dramatic trip to cairo in 1964 to 
try to persuade egypt to make peace with israel in 1978 he went 
on a 45day hunger strike to protest building jewish settlements in 
the occupied territories 
the indianborn nathan first met arafat in 1982 when he traveled 
to lebanon during the israeli siege of beirut in an unsuccessful 
attempt to gain freedom for a captured israeli soldier

a man on trial on charges of planting 13 
bombs around buildings and bridges was motivated by a rivalry with 
a legislator who long ago beat him out for roles in high school 
plays a prosecutor said 
this is a drama that started a number of years ago 
assistant us attorney robert stanley powell said during opening 
arguments monday it started in the mind of john marion hubbard 
a nonconformist who didnt believe in authority 
hubbard 31 is charged with making and planting the bombs found 
in 1988 in salem a community of 6000 
none of the bombs exploded but three ignited and fizzled no 
one was injured 
hubbard could be sentenced to 285 years in prison if convicted 
of conspiracy illegal possession of dynamite 14 counts of making 
bombs and 13 of attempting to destroy buildings and bridges used in 
interstate commerce 
this was a cowardly terroristic act that held the city 
hostage powell said it still holds the city hostage 
defense attorney paul j watts contended the governments case 
was based largely on circumstantial evidence and exaggeration 
drama theatrics and no substance 
powell said the government would introduce tape recordings in 
which hubbard boasted there were only two people in salem smart 
enough to manufacture the bombs he and jerry conrad 42 who 
worked with hubbard at a factory 
conrad was convicted sept 5 on the same counts hubbard is 
charged with and was expected to testify for the government in 
hubbards trial 
powell said the largest of the 13 bombs containing 54 sticks of 
dynamite was found behind the law office of state rep frank 
newkirk jr the prosecutor said hubbard had a rivalry with newkirk 
that dated to their high school days when they competed for 
theater roles 
he was traditionally beat out in almost every instance by 
frank newkirk jr the feelings built up in hubbard powell said 
the prosecutor said hubbard regularly wore camouflage he 
calls himself a survivalist he calls himself antagonistic he 
calls himself a radical and thats what he is powell said 
watts told jurors they would have to decide whether the devices 
found around salem were in fact bombs or were they something 
designed to scare 
watts said his client has a boatload of emotional problems and 
substantial alcohol problems when hes drinking he brags he 
lies and he exaggerates

five amateur astronomers are preparing for an 
undreamedof opportunity to go eyeball to eyeball with the universe 
using what will be the worlds most powerful space telescope 
in a gesture of appreciation for scientific contributions by 
hobbyists using backyard telescopes the space telescope science 
institute has offered 20 hours of observing time on the hubble 
space telescope to projects designed by amateurs 
the telescope to be launched on a space shuttle in march is a 
joint project of the national aeronautics and space administration 
and the european space agency the project based at johns hopkins 
university is expected to cost about 750 million and has been in 
planning stages for a decade 
for someone who is not a professional astronomer the odds of 
getting to use the telescope are comparable to george jetsons 
chances of getting a raise from his tightfisted boss at spacely 
sprockets 
i would guess every amateur astronomer would love to use it 
said one of those selected james secosky a science teacher from 
rochester ny i never thought id get to use an instrument like 
this 
but astronomy is one of the few scientific fields in which 
amateurs make significant breakthroughs 
for example edwin hubble the american astronomer for whom the 
telescope is named developed his theory of the expanding universe 
in cooperation with milton humason a former janitor mule driver 
and highschool dropout 
in actuality outer space begins in your back yard all you 
need is a good pair of binoculars to get started said pete 
kandefer an electrical engineer from new hartford conn who also 
was chosen 
others selected include a computer expert and a homemaker 
professionals already have overbooked time on the telescope the 
first major optical telescope that will be permanently stationed in 
low earth orbit said ray villard an institute spokesman 
the 24000pound instrument about the size of a bus has a 
24meter mirror that will gather enough light to enable 
researchers to make images of things that are 25 to 50 times 
fainter than the dimmest object previously seen 
free of the atmospheres distortion of distant light and the 
earths tendency to absorb the extreme ends of the light spectrum 
the telescope will produce pictures 10 times clearer than anything 
available on the ground villard said 
if your eyes were as good as the telescope you would be able 
to see a dime 20 miles away and know it was a dime villard 
said 
secosky 42 is interested in why jupters moon io sometimes 
appears brighter as it emerges from the planets frigid shadow he 
thinks his observations may detect evidence of frost forming on the 
moon 
kandefers regular job is working on flight controls and 
guidance sensors but the 42yearold engineer spends his free time 
trying to learn about steller magnetic fields 10 times stronger 
than the suns 
the only woman in the group ana larson 41 of seattle was 
half a dozen years into an accounting career when she decided to 
take time off to raise her two children and fell in love with 
astronomy through university of washington correspondence courses 
her goal is to find huge planets taking form around stars a 
process scientists suspect is occurring but cannot prove because it 
is so difficult to distinguish any object that close to a stars 
brightness larson hopes to find planets five to 10 times larger 
than jupiter that release enormous amounts of energy detectable to 
a telescope as heat 
ray sterner a 37yearold computer scientist at hopkins will 
test his theory that luminescent arcs discovered in a distant 
galaxy cluster are made of stars most astronomers consider such 
arcs to be optical illusions caused by gravity bending starlight 
john hewitt who works at a science museum in berkeley calif 
hopes to detect a hypothetical mass of primordial material 
surrounding a star where comets could take form 
we arent professional scientists and we would not qualify as 
observers under the regular procedures hewitt said this is an 
incredible opportunity for an amateur astronomer on what is 
esentially the most capable astronomical instrument ever created

lebanese legislators today debated 
changing the way their government is structured to provide greater 
power sharing between warring moslems and christians 
the members of the lebanese parliament are considering 
balancing and overlapping powers of a christian president a 
sunni moslem premier and a shiite moslem parliament speaker 
conference sources said 
conflicts among these lebanese factions have been feeding the 
civil war that broke out in april 1975 and has ravaged the nation 
claiming the lives of an estimated 150000 people 
most recently christian leader gen michel aoun in march 
sparked six months of lethal shelling when he declared a war of 
liberation against the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon accusing 
them of siding with the moslems 
a arab mediating team made up of saudi arabia morocco and 
algeria acting on mandate of the 22member arab league arranged a 
ceasefire sept 22 that generally has been holding 
sixtythree of the 73 surviving members of the parliament have 
been meeting in this saudi mountain resort since saturday to 
discuss a plan drafted by the arab league team for ending the 
sectarian strife it calls for political reforms and later syrian 
withdrawal 
saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal steered the 
deputies away from christian demands that syria withdraw before 
reforms are agreed to concrentrate on the division of power in the 
lebanese government long dominated by maronite christians 
the conference sources said they expected the result to be 
essentially a mechanism of check recheck and countercheck with 
a view to averting dictatorship or the supremacy of one religious 
faction over the others 
but the debate indicated a continuing difference of views 
sources said several deputies rallied behind maronite christian 
leader george saadeh in advocating that the authority of the 
powerful president a maronite under the present unwritten national 
accord be left unchanged 
it would be hard on us to render our president a mere 
distributor of medals and decorations saadeh was quoted as 
telling the session 
but prosyrian moslem deputy zaher khatib told deputies we are 
not in the process of shifting powers from one religious faction to 
another we are trying to curtail the powers of a dictatorial ruler 
and entrust them to a council of leadership the cabinet of 
ministers 
a compromise called for continuing the presidential powers but 
abolishing the tradition of apportioning senior civil service slots 
along sectarian lines now favoring christians who dominate the 
military judiciary and economy 
the deputies met in closed session 10 miles away from the press 
center where reporters were restricted 
one prosyrian deputy najah wakim unexpectedly showed up at 
the press center late monday and said opinion gaps among the 
legislators on the powers of the president have been bridged the 
general atmosphere of discussions is favorable and we are 
hopeful 
he refused to elaborate and left the press center abruptly 
sources said oct 21 has been tentatively fixed as the date for 
a formal session of parliament in beirut to ratify the new charter 
that would replace the unwritten accord of 1943 
two weeks later the deputies would then meet to elect a new 
president to replace amin gemayel whose term ran out last 
september parliament was unable to meet to elect a successor and 
rival administrations sprang up led by aoun and moslem prime 
minister salim hoss

a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said today that israels two governing parties may head off a 
crisis over the egyptian peace plan by agreeing to hold talks on 
the issue with americans and egyptians 
in tokyo visiting plo chief yasser arafat told the japanese 
prime minister that the plo favors opening israelipalestinian 
talks through egypt officials said israel expressed 
disappointment over japans invitation to arafat 
a compromise between the centerleft labor party and the 
rightwing likud bloc could defuse a tense situation before an 
inner cabinet meeting thursday on egyptian president hosni 
mubaraks offer to arrange preliminary peace talks between 
palestinians and israelis 
the compromise also could reduce american pressure on israel to 
accept mubaraks peace efforts mubarak met monday in washington 
with president bush and said israel should not squander a golden 
opportunity for peace by rejecting his plan 
in the occupied territories meanwhile troops today clashed 
with palestinian stonethrowers wounding four people one 
seriously arab reports said the army said it was checking the 
reports 
at least 123 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as 
suspected collaborators during the 21month uprising against 
israeli occupation more than 580 others have died in clashes with 
soldiers and israeli civilians forty israelis have been slain 
the political feud in israel centers on objections by likud 
headed by shamir to usbacked egyptian proposals for israel to 
negotiate with a team of palestinians before holding elections in 
the occupied territories 
labor headed by finance minister shimon peres supports the 
egyptian idea believing it the only way to break an impasse in the 
peace process 
shamir balks at egypts proposal to include two palestinians 
deported by israel in the delegation he feels this would be 
tantamount to opening the door to the palestine liberation 
organization which israel views as a terrorist group 
shamirs top political aide yossi benaharon indicated in an 
interview with army radio tuesday that the prime minister may be 
open to a compromise that would involve holding more exploratory 
talks on the question 
asked whether shamir would agree to a threeway meeting of 
american egyptian and israeli representatives over the composition 
of a palestinian delegation benaharon replied 
theoretically yes because it sounds reasonable for such a 
tripartite meeting to hold a preliminary discussion over carrying 
out israels political initiative 
he stressed that any talks with palestinians would require prior 
agreement by the arabs to shamirs peace plan published last april 
which calls for elections in the disputed lands pending 
negotiations for an interim settlement he ruled out plo 
involvement 
us officials have been pressuring israel to accept the 
egyptian proposals as a basis for continuing the stalemated peace 
process 
in tokyo a senior foreign ministry official said arafat told 
prime minister toshiki kaifu he positively appraised an 
agreement by bush and mubarak to promote the peace process and to 
support mubaraks peace plan 
the plo has not yet issued an official position on mubaraks 
plan it objects to the fact that no mention is made of an 
independent palestinian state

going on a drinking and buying binge in the united states a 
politburo official said 
the communist party daily pravda reprinted the biting article

premier li peng today told former secretary of 
state alexander haig that richard nixon showed great foresight in 
developing chinaus ties 
li also praised henry kissinger and haig saying their 
contributions in this regard will go down in the annals of 
sinous relations the official xinhua news agency said 
haig a former kissinger aide who served under nixon is now a 
private citizen and president of an international consulting 
agency he is the most prominent american to visit china since the 
june 34 military crackdown on studentled demonstrators that took 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives 
the united states has since stopped all highlevel official 
contacts and suspended arms sales to china bringing relations to 
one of their lowest points since relations were normalized 10 years 
ago 
haig in beijing to attend a business symposium has been given 
a cordial reception by the chinese they invited him to sit on the 
tiananmen gate rostrum with chinas top leaders sunday evening to 
watch celebrations for the nations 40th anniversary 
li described haig as an old friend of the chinese people 
in recent days beijing while blaming washington for the rupture 
in ties has urged that good ties be restored 
nixon is much admired here because he saw the strategic and 
diplomatic importance of china and initiated the normalization of 
relations in 1972 even though china domestically was still in the 
throes of the ultraleftist cultural revolution 
the xinhua report said li and haig also discussed chinas 
domestic situation and li said he hoped us and chinese 
businessmen would increase cooperation

communist party leaders began meeting 
today to discuss ways to overhaul their image and win support of a 
citizenry that has embraced the new solidarityled government 
the party the first ever to lose control of a soviet bloc 
government is even considering changing its official name the 
polish united workers party as part of its effort to improve its 
standing with the populace 
opposition candidates virtually swept all seats available to 
noncommunist candidates in junes partially free elections 
prosolidarity lawmakers eventually put together a coalition with 
parties that were once allied with the communists resulting last 
month in the first noncommunist government in the east bloc 
in 1993 elections are to be fully democratic and the 
communists are trying desperately to find a place in the new 
poland which is embracing democratic reforms in a scramble to 
salvage its collapsing economy 
a survey released at the start of todays central committee 
plenum showed that fully 72 percent of the party members favor 
changing its name to reflect a change in image and purpose 
party leaders were expected to set a date and an agenda for a 
party congress which would enact the changes recommended by the 
central committee the congress would be a meeting of 1000 to 
2000 delegates elected from among the 2 million rankandfile 
party members 
the congress is expected to be set for midfebruary said a 
party official demanding anonymity 
the party official said the internal party survey in which more 
than half the members took part showed there was a strong danger 
that the party could split 
party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski has warned that a split could 
end the party accordingly the plenum has adopted the slogan 
unity at any price 
the official described the split within party ranks as being 
between the leadership and the rankandfile members who favor 
radical reform and the middle level party organizers who want 
to maintain a traditional party 
the party official said the goal is to create a party that will 
be attractive to voters in the 1993 elections the party hopes to 
do well enough in the voting to emerge as the dominant partner in a 
leftist coalition he said 
party secretary leszek miller said the party is inviting society 
to create the party with us and that the party must strive to 
find an identity which will give it a popular base 
the question is whether the polish united workers party can 
fulfill the aspirations of the part of polish society which is 
leftleaning he said 
the plenum also is expected to support internal party democracy 
a statedominated economy for poland and instigate a shakeup of 
the ruling politburo it would be the second leadership shuffle 
since july the official said 
if we remain in unity for three months then we exist and we 
will win the official said if the party is destroyed then 
the left does not exist for practical purposes for many years 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza reported today that 
the draft resolution for the plenum called for development of a 
humanitarian democratic and effective socialism 
on the economic front the draft favors a multisector economy 
dominated by the staterun economy it opposes selling off state 
enterprises a chief economic goal of the solidarityled government 
the draft also obliges all party cells to create conditions 
for free expression of different views the newspaper said

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods rebounded 29 percent in august after falling in july to 
their lowest level in eight months the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufacturered goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 
2372 billion following a 20 percent decline in july to the 
lowest level since last november orders rose 06 percent in june 
the report was the latest in a string of indicators showing that 
the nations economy continued to grow modestly last summer 
despite earlier fears that efforts to control inflation could steer 
it into a recession 
if the july weakness in manufacturing had persisted it could 
have led to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 56 percent the sharpest 
increase in the current economic expansion that began in 1982 
shipments had fallen 23 percent in july the sharpest fall since 
march 1986 
inventories on the other hand gained only 03 percent the 
smallest increase in two years inventories posted a 12 percent 
gain in july the biggest jump in five years 
if inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new 
orders it could signal production cutbacks in the future as 
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots 
however unfilled orders declined 03 percent the first drop 
since a 01 percent fall in february 1987 indicating decreased 
demand for goods 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years rose 39 percent in august that was a 
slight revision of the commerce department report last week that 
durable goods orders boosted by robust automobile sales had 
rebounded 38 percent for their steepest advance this year 
orders for nondurable goods advanced 18 percent 
about half of the improvement in durable goods orders was 
attributed to the transportation sector which rose 69 percent on 
the strength of auto sales despite a decline in aircraft sales 
nonelectrical machinery which includes computers was up 93 
percent 
orders of electrical machinery fell 21 percent and primary 
metals declined 18 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders fell 101 percent in august after 
rising 59 in july

one of the supreme courts abortion rights 
supporters is not taking part in a key abortion case before the 
court in its 198990 term 
justice john paul stevens disqualified himself from the illinois 
case one of three the high court is considering this term for 
unstated reasons court spokeswoman toni house said monday 
stevens had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed 
last july 3 to review the case but a minor court order issued 
monday in the illinois case which deals with abortion clinic 
regulations noted that stevens did not participate 
his absence will not change the outcome of the case if the 
justices line up as they did last july when voting 54 to let 
states make abortion harder to get 
stevens was one of the dissenters 
justice sandra day oconnor still is the key vote if she votes 
against the illinois law the outcome could be a 44 prochoice 
victory if she votes in favor of the law the outcome could be a 
53 antiabortion victory 
a 44 split would not set any legal precedent outside illinois 
the case focuses on a state law that would require abortion 
clinics to add services and equipment now found only in hospitals 
the law could force many clinics to close down and could add up 
to 50 to the cost of an abrtion performed in the first three 
months of pregnancy 
in invalidating the law lower courts said it violated a portion 
of the 1973 ruling in roe vs wade that limited state regulation 
over firsttrimester abortions 
illinois officials are not asking the justices to use the 
illinois case to reverse roe vs wade but legal experts say the 
courts ruling could chip away at the trimesterbytrimester 
approach taken in the 1973 decision 
the two other abortion cases under high court study this term 
focus on parental notification requirements for unwed minors 
seeking to end their pregnancies in minnesota and ohio stevens has 
not disqualified himself from those cases 
the illinois case is turnock vs ragsdale 88790

it took a police roundup on main 
street to get a quorum of 50 for a town hall meeting in this 
village in the berkshires 
town officials appealed to officers when faced with a room of 
empty seats for monday nights meeting on whether stockbridge 
should join an area recycling pact 
police chief richard wilcox stationed cruisers with lights 
flashing in front of town hall and had officers pull over cars and 
check for stockbridge citizens anyone who admitted living here was 
escorted into town hall 
emergency calls also went out to two fire companies and a 
parentteachers meeting at the school in this small town used by 
norman rockwell to illustrate the freedom of speech in his 
series of paintings the four freedoms 
after a brief cattle drive we rounded up the 32 we needed 
wilcox said today 
the chief said that officers learned from previous roundups not 
to let citizens talk their way out of attending 
we hear more excuses than the judge does when someone comes 
before him with a traffic ticket he said youd be amazed how 
many people are in the pajamas at 8 pm when you telephone 
once inside the reluctant participants didnt have to tarry it 
took citizens less than 15 minutes to approve the plan 
monday night football is a lot of competition when theres 
nothing special on the town meeting agenda wilcox said

sales of new homes fell 04 percent in august 
dropping back slightly from a huge doubledigit gain in july the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said that new singlefamily homes were 
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755000 units in 
august following a 161 percent gain in july the largest increase 
in nearly three years 
the july sales increase was the largest monthly advance since 
september 1986 when sales climbed by 229 percent the revised 
july annual rate of 758000 also was the highest level since 
december 1986 when new homes were sold at a rate of 784000 units 
analysts had credited the july advance to a decline in 
fixedrate mortgages which had fallen to 981 percent by the end of 
that month from a peak of 1122 percent last march 
but rates edged back up to 1022 percent by the end of august 
according to a monthly survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
co contributing to the decline in home sales that month 
the august decline was the third so far this year but the first 
since last march although sales were unchanged in june 
sales for the first eight months were down 27 percent from the 
same period in 1988 
the report on new home sales in august followed a report last 
friday that sales of existing homes rose 33 percent that month to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 344 million units 
president ira griben of the national association of realtors 
said the improvement in existing home sales reflected buyers taking 
advantage of declining interest rates 
the commerce department report today said the median price of a 
new home was 122900 in august up 60 percent from 116000 in 
july the median is the point where half of the homes sold for more 
and half for less 
the average price of a new home rose 146 percent to 162300 
new home sales in the northeast declined 09 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107000 units sales had jumped 
50 percent to 108000 units in july 
sales in the midwest were down 279 percent to 93000 units 
after rising 267 percent to 129000 units a month earlier 
sales in the south rose 62 percent to 310000 and were up 66 
percent in the west to 244000 units

the supreme court will vote to approve 
president virgilio barcos decrees allowing extradition of top drug 
suspects to the united states and confiscation of their property 
national television reported 
the television program tv hoy quoting court sources reported 
monday night that a majority of 24 justices on the court supported 
the decrees 
the deadline for the court to rule was today but normally 
several days pass before court rulings are made public 
seven bombs exploded in colombian cities monday night two in 
the carribbean coast city of barranquilla three in the port city 
of santa marta and two in the capital of bogota national police 
said 
two people were injured in barranquilla and two more in santa 
marta the police said they were part of a daily wave of bombings 
presumably set by drug traffickers 
a supreme court ruling allowing extraditions would strengthen 
the barco administration in its war against the drug lords and 
would help allay fears that the court could undermine the antidrug 
crackdown 
tv hoy said however that the court would declare 
unconstitutional an additional decree allowing the colombian army 
to raid drug traffickers property at will 
it said the court will support the governments right to 
confiscate property from drug traffickers but will require that it 
go through judicial channels 
the court will not decide on the legality of property already 
seized leaving that issue for lower courts tv hoy said 
as of a week ago the army had seized 1056 homes ranches 
mansions office buildings and other property allegedly belonging to 
drug traffickers 
the administrations main weapon in the drug war is its power to 
extradite suspected drug figures who have repeatedly shown their 
ability to escape justice in colombia 
the united states has a list of 80 colombians it wants 
extradited to face drug charges but it has disclosed the names of 
only the top 12 
in 1984 the supreme court ruling on a technicality declared 
extraditions to the united states unconstitutional 
the court has not dealt favorably with other important barco 
decrees before barco declared war on the traffickers aug 19 the 
court had knocked down seven decrees he issued in attempts to deal 
with both guerrillas and drug traffickers 
the most important of earlier decrees declared unconstitutional 
was one creating a special tribunal within the supreme court to 
deal with drug trafficking and other cases that present security 
problems for lower court judges 
barco wanted to remove certain cases from the jurisdiction of 
the lower court judges who often have been threatened or killed 
while handling drug trafficking cases 
in the last 10 years 220 court employees including 41 judges 
have been killed many of them by drug traffickers

cambodian guerrillas battled to 
take a governmentheld town in northwestern cambodia today western 
and guerrilla sources said 
the khmer peoples national liberation front and two other 
guerrilla factions launched what they called a general 
offensive against the prohanoi government on saturday they 
claimed to have overrun three towns and many other military 
positions 
the guerrillas called it their biggest victory in about 11 years 
of guerrilla warfare 
vietnam which previously fought alongside cambodian government 
forces after invading the country in 1978 says it withdrew its 
troops a week ago 
thailands foreign ministry claimed today that it held five 
vietnamese soldiers in thailands chanthaburi province who were 
captured in cambodia since the pledged pullout 
however the thai navy which is responsible for the southern 
part of thailands border with cambodia including chanthaburi said 
this was untrue 
foreign ministry spokesman prachadavi tavetikul said he planned 
to show the vietnamese to the press on thursday even though capt 
buncherd phunchoren a royal thai navy spokesman said there had 
been no arrest or detention of any soldier since sept 20 
in the thai border town of aranyaprathet heavy shelling and 
automatic weapons fire could be heard all day to the north and to 
the south across the border in cambodia 
western sources on the frontier following battlefield movements 
said the guerrillas were concentrating their forces on the town of 
kandoun inside cambodia some nine miles from thailand the sources 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the guerrillas also were attempting to prevent the resupply of 
government positions they said 
no reliable reports of casualties have emerged either from the 
guerrillas or the government phnom penh official media have not 
commented on the most recent fighting 
ieng mouly spokesman for the kpnlf in bangkok said the 
offensive was a coordinated effort between the three guerrilla 
factions his own those loyal to exiled monarch prince norodom 
sihanouk and the radical communist khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
during its rule from 1975 until its forces were ousted by the 
vietnamese in late 1978

they were awash in clothing and urged donors to instead send cash 
food and building supplies 
vice president dan quayles wife marilyn returned from a 
helicopter tour of the coast monday sobered by the extent of the 
destruction 
its really incredible there are areas that look like war 
zones said mrs quayle who helped out monday taking

people on the us mainland 
the warning against swimming could last for months and possibly 
affect the spring tourist season said wayne fanning of the 
department of health and environmental control 
the indefinite ban on shellfishing was enacted because the 10 
major sewage treatment plants in the charleston area are not 
working fully and only 30 percent of the pollutants are being 
removed fanning said when released into rivers the waste 
depletes oxygen in the water causing widespread fish kills 
rain that has hurt recovery efforts continued in some parts of

opens the bridge to allow boats to pass on the intracoastal 
waterway

gay men and intravenous drug users have been 
barred from donating sperm in new york state because of worries 
about aids 
the regulations which took effect this week exclude any man 
from donating to a sperm bank if he has had homosexual activity 
intravenous drug use or sex with a high risk person since 1977 
the same people already are barred from donating blood in new 
york state for the same reason said mary anne gardineer health 
department associate director for regulatory affairs 
the regulations for the first time also require sperm banks to 
obtain state licenses 
women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not 
be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal 
illnesses gardineer said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which chiefly afflicts 
homosexual men and intravenous drug users is spread most often 
through sex needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected 
blood and from pregnant women to their offspring 
gardineer said there have been cases of infants who contracted 
aids because of donated sperm but she could not say how many 
the prohibition was recommended by several doctors groups 
the rules require extensive medical background checks on donors 
and tests on the donated sperm all donations must be frozen for 
six months the time it takes for someone infected with the aids 
virus to develop antibodies that show up in tests 
the rules dont apply in cases where a man is donating sperm for 
a specific woman such as his wife because donors have a right to 
privacy officials said 
the growing popularity of artificial insemination made the rules 
necessary said gardineer 
in 1986 about 60000 women gave birth as a result of artificial 
insemination in the united states she estimated there are five 
sperm banks in new york state but said the number isnt certain 
because they havent been licensed 
new york state has 25000 confirmed aids cases about a quarter 
of the nations total most of them are in new york city

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
opened an official visit today and joined president bush in 
promising expanded cooperation in combating crossborder drug 
smuggling 
with bush standing at his side during a white house welcoming 
ceremony salinas declared that the two countries working 
together can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to 
free the world from that international scourge 
in a similar vein bush said the united states and mexico must 
continue to strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and 
trafficking for we know that what threatens one nation in our 
hemisphere threatens us all 
the two presidents then presided over signing of two agreements 
one to promote usmexico trade and the other to provide us 
assistance for combating pollution in mexico city 
bush said relations between the two countries have progressed 
since salinas took office last december citing advances in such 
areas as debt trade investment and the environment 
salinas speaking through a translator said ways must be found 
to deal more humanely with the migration of mexicans to the united 
states 
he also said the two countries must work toward a new stage 
in their trade relations 
salinas is giving high priority to seeking trade concessions 
during his visit but a us official responding monday to remarks 
salinas made to reporters before leaving mexico disagreed with his 
contention that mexico has difficulty penetrating american markets 
after the welcoming ceremony and a meeting with bush salinas 
planned to attend a working lunch with secretary of state james a 
baker iii a white house state dinner is scheduled for this evening 
the bush administration has been highly complimentary of 
salinas performance during his first 10 months in office praising 
his economic reform program and his efforts to crack down on 
drugsmuggling 
but trade appears to be one area where the two sides are far 
apart 
salinas was reported to have complained during his meeting with 
reporters that it is inappropriate for the united states to 
criticize closed markets in japan when the united states itself is 
guilty of protectionist practices 
i think that reciprocity in commercial relations is 
fundamental salinas was reported to have said isnt that what 
the united states is asking of japan 
a us official insisting on anonymity contended the us 
market is far more open than japans whereas the united states has 
a huge trade deficit with japan mexico enjoys a 27 billion trade 
surplus with the united states on total twoway trade of 439 
billion the official said 
the official said that until recently mexico was one of the most 
protectionist countries in the world 
salinas has said he expects to press for preferential treatment 
for mexican exports such as textiles steel and agricultural 
products 
us officials said the administration has made no commitments 
to do what salinas wants but that he will be given a hearing 
the officials acknowledged that textiles and steel are highly 
sensitive areas for the administration because of protectionist 
pressures as for agricultural products they said that mexico 
already supplies 60 percent of all the fruits and vegetables 
consumed in the united states during the winter months 
the two sides are expected to sign seven agreements during 
salinas visit symbolic of increased usmexican cooperation 
since bush and salinas assumed their respective duties within a few 
weeks of each other 
the agreements cover such issues as trade investment the 
environment tourism and law enforcement according to us 
officials 
officials from both sides seem relieved that the spirit of 
hostility that characterized crossborder relations during the 
reagan administration has largely disappeared

what has unfolded before you the last month is a tale of 
corruption immense corruption prosecutor deborah smith said 
during closing arguments 
bakker scribbled notes on a yellow legal pad and occasionally 
glanced at ms smith 
there may have been a time when mr bakker was a man of good 
deeds back in the 1970s but as time progressed into the 1980s he 
began to use people to obtain possessions and power and keep it 
she said 
bakkers lawyer was to deliver his closing argument later in the 
day jury deliberations in the federal court trial were expected to 
begin as early as wednesday 
ms smith described bakker as a worldclass master of using 
half truths he lied to people he used half truths to manipulate 
people he used his position to maintain his power and wealth 
bakker completed his testimony monday by accusing the rev jerry 
falwell of cheating ptl followers and by conceding he and his wife 
accepted millions in bonuses as the ministrys finances foundered 
the real conspiracy to defraud came from that group of people 
who took over the ministry for their own selfish gains said 
bakker who invited falwell to take over the ministry when he 
resigned in 1987 in a sex and money scandal 
bakker also denied the prosecutors assertion that he failed to 
tell ptl board members about the ministrys money problems 
i dont know how the board members could not be aware of the 
financial crisis at heritage usa he testified they knew we 
had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for 
them 
bakker 49 is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
he is accused of diverting more than 37 million in ptl money for 
his own benefit 
if convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 120 years 
in prison and fined more than 5 million 
ms smith asked bakker to explain apparent contradictions 
between his story and testimony and exhibits presented by the 
government including former ptl board members who said they didnt 
remember voting on some of the large bonuses for bakker and his 
wife 
bakker said falwell and his attorney norman roy grutman had 
intimidated the directors 
norman roy grutman and jerry falwell threatened those board 
members that they would be in terrible danger bakker testified 
among the threats bakker said was that the directors might be 
liable to a civil suit 
bakker said he and his wife tammy faye accepted 31 million 
in bonuses in the mid1980s as the ministrys finances ran into 
trouble he said the bonuses amounted to less than 1 percent of the 
more than 425 million he raised for the ministry 
asked by his lawyer what he did with the 425 million bakker 
replied i put it to the work of jesus christ 
board members granted the bonuses of their own free will 
bakker said and often told him he was worth much more than this 
and they would say that over and over again 
bakker who began his testimony friday spent 10 hours on the 
witness stand he was the last defense witness 
under crossexamination on friday bakker testified repeatedly 
that he didnt remember details of his ministrys finances the 
testimony prompted his attorney george davis to say it was very 
damaging very devastating 
during defense questioning monday bakker summed up his case 
we were a church and people always wanted to run it like a 
business i had to keep telling them this was a church not a 
business

the captain of a greek tanker that hit a 
reef and spilled 289000 gallons of heating oil into narragansett 
bay testified today he did not have the required lookout on the 
bridge when entering the harbor 
iakovos georgoudis 43 of greece also said maps made it unclear 
exactly where ships are to pick up their harbor pilots to guide the 
vessel into port the vessel ran aground off newport on june 23 
before a pilot boarded 
the captain of the world prodigy told a board of inquiry 
convened by the coast guard and the national transportation safety 
board that his company and greek regulations required a lookout 
when entering a harbor 
there was no one however because the lookout had been sent 
to help lower the ladder so the pilot could board georgoudis said 
through interpreters 
he said he was doing nearly all the work on the bridge at the 
time of the accident including lookout and navigator i was 
everything he said 
georgoudis had refused to testify previously before the panel 
citing his right against selfincrimination that no longer was an 
issue after he pleaded guilty in august and september to state and 
federal pollution charges 
the captain was fined a total of 30500 a charge of failing to 
have a pilot on board was dropped as part of the plea bargain 
authorities said the commonly agreedon pickup point is actually 
inside the area where state law requires a pilot 
the tankers owner ballard shipping co pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor and was ordered to pay 500000 
us attorney lincoln almond has said it was clear that 
georgoudis had too many duties at the time and the accident was 
caused by negligence not by recklessness 
gov edward diprete said 125000 of ballards fine would be 
used to help rhode islands fishing industry

a judge says he is going to order 
that students at an elementary school wear monitors to test for 
possible electromagnetic radiation from nearby highvoltage power 
lines 
two families who have children in sandpiper shores elementary 
school in boca raton sued contending that electromagnetic fields 
from a series of power lines within 135 feet of the school may be 
harmful to their childrens health 
palm beach county circuit judge timothy poulton said he will 
make his ruling after a school board meeting wednesday 
parents and school officials want to have students wear a 
onepound monitor six students will take turns wearing the 2000 
device on belts such monitors are usually worn by employees of 
utility companies 
sensors also will be installed in the ground outside the school 
and will be carried through the classrooms once a month to measure 
electromagnetic fields created by even the smallest electrical 
current 
the results of research into whether such radiation is harmful 
to humans have been contradictory some contend it can cause 
cancers depression miscarriages or other disorders 
the congressional office of technology assessment issued a 
report in june saying more research is needed to explore the 
potential health risks from electromagnetic fields produced by 
power lines particularly the effects on the nervous system and 
possible role in promoting cancer 
in november 1985 a texas jury ordered houston lighting amp power 
to pay 251 million to a suburban school district for building a 
highpower transmission line that attorneys claimed threatened the 
health of 4000 students at three schools 
poulton ruled this past summer that there was insufficient 
evidence of potential harm to close the school as the parents had 
asked but he did close much of the schoolyard during recess 
in the action poulton said he will order wednesday each 
volunteer will wear the monitor for a full school day once a month 
parents support the plan because the monitor measures a childs 
exposure to radiation as the student walks from room to room as 
opposed to a stationary device gauging radiation in a set location 
poulton said he will review measurements from the monitor and 
the other devices monthly 
parents sharon and robert rausch and steve tenner sued the 
school board last year for locating sandpiper shores elementary 
near highvoltage power lines that can carry up to 230000 volts 
the rausches believe electromagnetic fields from power lines 
near a school may have contributed to the death from brainstem 
cancer in 1985 of their 8yearold son william at the time they 
lived at warner robins ga 
educators want to include five other schools in the radiation 
monitoring plan to prove their theory that electric and magnetic 
fields at sandpiper shores are no different than the radiation 
levels that exist on other campuses 
the plan will cost the school board more than 51000 
florida is among several states with electric field standards 
and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields strong 
opposition is building from florida homeowners parents and 
environmentalists to proposed 500000volt lines in the 
westcentral and southeastern parts of the state

nine infants were hospitalized for severe 
intoxication in tel aviv after mothers mistakenly gave them an 
alcoholbased antiseptic instead of stomach medicine sold in 
similar bottles health officials said tuesday 
all the infants were about a month old and were being treated in 
tel avivs sheba hospital two were in the intensive care unit 
newspaper reports said 
the health ministry issued a warning to mothers on monday after 
learning of the mixup but said it will not order changes in the 
packaging or labels on the bottles 
babic a medicine commonly used to treat gas pains in infants 
is packaged in white plastic bottles that look like those 
containing an alcoholbased antiseptic used externally 
we warned mothers to pay attention to the labels said 
health ministry spokesman gabi zohar 
although the two products have different labels the mothers 
apparently confused the bottles while trying to give medicine at 
night the yediot ahronot daily said it said a mother who realized 
her mistake brought both bottles to the hospital 
zohar said it was unclear why the problem arose in the same area 
of tel aviv at the same time but the jerusalem post reported 
similar problems earlier with the two products 
the alcohol caused breathing difficulties lowered the infants 
blood sugar and made them sluggish and sleepy

secretary jack kemp today is unveiling a 
package of proposals aimed at reforming the scandalplagued 
department of housing and urban development including naming a 
chief financial officer and requiring public registration of 
lobbyists and consultants sources familiar with the proposal said 
today 
kemps proposal also calls for the elimination of hud grant 
funds that are awarded at the discretion of the secretary and 
would impose new restrictions on federal housing 
administrationbacked mortgages for investment and vacation 
property sources said 
the elimination of huds discretionary grants including on the 
3 billion community development block grant program would mean 
the awards would be based on competition 
kemp planned to announce his reform package at an afternoon news 
conference 
portions of his plans already have been discussed by hud 
officials including his intention to create a new toplevel 
independent position of chief financial officer reporting to the 
secretary kemps appointee as assistant secretary for 
administration claire freeman told congress last month that plans 
were being made for financial officer with broad powers a 
position that does not exist now in the scandalplagued department 
hud has been hit by scandals over alleged mismanagement fraud 
influence peddling and the steering of lucrative hud subsidies to 
politically favored developers consultants and lobbyists 
estimates of the cost range into the billions of dollars 
included in kemps package the sources said are a requirement 
that consultants and lobbyists who deal with the agency register 
and publicly disclose their dealings 
a congressional source familiar with the kemp reforms said kemp 
also will propose that hud kill its section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program the multimillion dollar rentsubsidy 
program found to be riddled with influence peddling 
it was an april audit of that program that set off the current 
investigations of hud the auditors found that subsidies appeared 
to have been steered to former agency officials and developers who 
hired prominent gop consultants to lobby hud 
also in the package a source said is a proposal providing that 
15 percent of money in each hud program would be allocated to 
evaluation of how that program is working a move aimed at making 
sure hud officials are aware of program abuses 
other features would require public dislosure by hud when it is 
waiving any regulations and restrictions on the obtaining of 
double subsidies by some developers such as renovation subsidies 
and tax credits 
on fha the sources said the secretary was proposing a 
prohibition on fhabacked loans for investment property and second 
homes used as vacatation homes it will impose tougher capital 
requirements for companies who underwrite a portion of fha loans 
under the multifamily coinsurance program the sources said 
dealings by politically connected lobbyists and consultants was 
the subject of a hearing monday by a house committee that has been 
investigating the hud scandals 
the chairman rep tom lantos dcalif charged that a 
greased sweetheart deal brought 31 million in federal housing 
subsidies to a new jersey renovation project but the apartments 
are still like slums 
lantos said infinitely more worthy projects were denied 
funds when hud made the grant to the housing project in which 
republican lobbyist paul manafort is a partner 
but manafort testified at a hearing monday that his lobbying 
company has worked within the existing system at hud and 
played by the rules 
lantos said his subcommittees staff last week visited 
manaforts 326unit seabrook project in upper deerfield nj a 
1940s complex that manaforts partnership is renovating with the 
hud subsidies 
lantos said his staff found apartments renting for more than 
700 a month including federal subsidies but lacking gutters and 
refrigerators some had suffered water damage he said 
what they saw and heard was shocking particularly for a 
project that is costing taxpayers 31163400 in rent subsidies 
alone plus additional millions in tax credits he said 
referring to the game of monopoly lantos said for well 
over 31 million i would have expected at least marvin gardens 
unfortunately we have here only a slum on baltic or mediterranean 
avenue 
manafort a former campaign adviser to president bush and former 
president reagan and a former business partner of republican 
national chairman lee atwater underwent contentious questioning 
from the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing 
manafort said that while 182 units are occupied construction is 
still under way and asserted when we are finished with 
construction we believe the tenants will be happy 
when he appeared before the panel in june manafort acknowledged 
that his work amounted to influencepeddling however on 
monday he denied receiving an advance tip by hud insiders on the 
availability of subsidies for renovating lowincome housing 
projects which were prized profitmakers for developers 
he said he had little contact with deborah gore dean the former 
executive assistant to former hud secretary sam pierce who is a 
focus of the panels probe into alleged political 
influencepeddling at hud dean pierce and two other former hud 
officials have refused to testify on constitutional grounds 
but two associates in manaforts lobbying company acknowledged 
further contacts with dean laurence gay testified he met with dean 
and discussed the new jersey project another associate richard 
davis was a former white house liaison to hud who said he had been 
in contact with dean daily while in government 
manafort contended that partners in the development faced normal 
business risks including the potential loss of a 450000 down 
payment in buying the dilapidated housing and putting together a 
package of subsidies and financing 
lantos however contended manafort had enjoyed an inside line 
to top hud officials and was able to bypass procedures at huds 
regional office 
this was a greased sweetheart deal where all the 
participants knew what the final outcome would be lantos said 
deborah dean promised them the units of subsidy and she 
delivered on the units those are the facts

a clergyman tuesday sued the state lutheran 
church council for denying him a job because he is a homosexual 
former hospital chaplain jens t olsen 41 was refused a job 
with the council in march council spokesman gunnar vestermoen said 
olsen was not hired because he had lived with his homosexual 
partner of seven years in violation of church teachings 
he was the first choice and was obviously wellqualified 
but the council dropped him because he lived in a homosexual 
relationship said vestermoen 
the case went to court two days after a law took effect in 
neighboring denmark allowing homosexual couples to be registered as 
partners by civil authorities with all the rights of married 
heterosexual couples except adopting children eleven male couples 
were married there sunday 
about 130 church workers including clergymen have supported 
olsen through petitions and newspaper advertisements 
support is warming up i am not alone within the church in 
my views the church discriminates against homosexuals oslen 
told the oslo newspaper dagbladet 
supporters have cited a 1977 church decision to stop condemning 
latent homosexuality to argue olsens case 
it is meaningless to treat feelings and practice 
differently said theology professor jacob jervell the council 
accepts homosexuals but says it is wrong for them to live 
together he told dagbladet

the secret to eternal life may be retirement 
abroad at least for people who receive us government benefits 
judging from available records such people never die they just 
keep collecting their checks the inspector general of the 
department of health and human services told congress on tuesday 
those program benefits go on forever and ever inspector 
general richard kusserow told the senate governmental affairs 
committee 
kusserow said the government doesnt know how widespread the 
problem is or how costly or where it is greatest because hhs 
depends on local governments and the state department to validate 
deaths and tell washington when to stop checks 
in rural mexico or the philippines a local constabulary is 
going to stop a benefit from going into a village no he told 
the panel 
kusserow said hes also suspicious of the long lifespans of 
people who retire to poland where the benefits are distributed 
through the government but theres no evidence of wrongdoing he 
said 
the panels chairman sen john glenn dohio suggested proof 
could be found when you have people who are obviously 120 years 
old collecting benefits 
the departments independent auditor said he liked a suggestion 
by sen william cohen rmaine to impose regular checkin 
requirements on people collecting benefits abroad 
i think its a good idea that periodically they should produce 
evidence that they are alive and well kusserow said pretty 
soon well find people living throughout the world and not just 
transylvania will never die

no commonlaw marriage exists between william 
hurt and sandra jennings a judge ruled today precluding hurts 
former livein lover from claiming nearly half the big chill 
stars movie millions 
state supreme court justice jacqueline silbermann said that the 
relationship was illicit when it began because hurt was married to 
someone else and that it did not become legitimate simply because 
the actor got divorced 
absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married an agreement 
to marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties were 
living together the judge said the contrary is true 
if the judge had determined the two were married under common 
law ms jennings could have pursued up to half hurts earnings 
the decision did not deal with support for the couples 6yearold 
son alexander devon hurt 
jennings lawyer a richard golub called the ruling a joke 
and said he would appeal the judge is so madly in love with this 
defendant bill hurt that we never could have gotten a fair 
shake he said 
if we had won i would have been shocked golub said 
jennings a former dancer sued hurt for equitable distribution 
of his assets estimated by golub at 5 million to 7 million 
after hurt refused to increase financial support to her and their 
son under an agreement between hurt and jennings he was paying 
them 60000 to 65000 a year 
jennings 32 based her suit on four of the 10 weeks she spent 
with hurt in beaufort sc during the winter of 198283 while he 
was there filming the big chill the movie was about a reunion 
of 1960sera college chums 
commonlaw marriages were abolished in 1933 in new york state 
where jennings and hurt also lived but south carolina recognizes 
such unions 
jennings contended that during the four weeks between dec 9 
when hurt learned actress mary beth hurt had divorced him and jan 
10 when jennings and hurt left the state a commonlaw marriage 
existed between them 
hurts publicist lois smith was at the courthouse waiting with 
reporters when copies of the decision were handed out and she 
distributed a statement from the actor who has starred in such 
films as body heat children of a lesser god kiss of the 
spider woman and the accidental tourist 
i am thankful for the ruling received today which is a 
vindication of everything i have said and that has been said by 
those who have supported me the statement said 
hurt was perplexed when jennings brought the suit smith 
said prior to trial hurt had suggested jennings was trying to 
simply shake him down for more support

the supreme court agreed tuesday to 
consider a request that it nullify president corazon aquinos 
decision not to let her predecessor ferdinand marcos be buried in 
the philippines 
imelda marcos the former presidents widow pledged to return 
to the united states for trial on charges of embezzling philippine 
government funds if she was permitted to bury her husband who died 
thursday in honolulu at age 72 in the philippines 
marcos ruled the archipelago for 20 years until a 
civilianmilitary uprising drove him into exile in hawaii in 
february 1986 
several coups have been attempted by marcos supporters mrs 
aquino says the return of the body or of members of the family 
could cause unrest 
philippine officials charge that marcos his family and 
associates looted the country of up to 10 billion during his time 
in power 
sen leticia ramosshahani who is related to marcos but 
supports mrs aquino urged tuesday that the government begin 
negotiations with the marcos family toward allowing the former 
president to be buried in the philippines at the appropriate 
time 
mrs ramosshahani said marcos should be buried in his home 
province ilocos norte with the family allowed to attend the 
funeral 
the two parties should be given time to find a mutually 
acceptable agreement said the senator who is the sister of 
defense secretary fidel ramos amd head of the senate committee on 
foreign relations 
asked by the associated press how soon the body should be 
returned she said one or two months 
former sen arturo tolentino marcos running mate in 1986 said 
monday the body could be flown directly to the international 
airport at laoag capital of ilocos norte instead of passing 
through manila laoag is about 250 miles north of the capital 
also monday marcos supporters petitioned the supreme court to 
overturn mrs aquinos ban and allow imelda marcos and her three 
children to bring the body to the philippines the court agreed 
tuesday to consider the petition and justice teodoro padilla said 
the government was given 10 days to respond 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez said the government would 
argue that the issue is political not legal and that mrs marcos 
might use the opportunity to evade prosecution in the united states 
imelda marcos has been prohibited from leaving the united 
states where she is to be tried in new york in march on charges of 
embezzling philippine government money and investing some of it in 
the united states the marcoses were indicted in october and mrs 
marcos is free on 5 million bond 
i will have to go back to new york because i have to face the 
indictment mrs marcos told the manila radio station dzxl in an 
interview from honolulu on tuesday what i am defending here is 
not only the marcos name but the entire nation 
the government antigraft court temporarily suspended 
proceedings tuesday in the first of 35 civil suits against marcos 
government lawyers said they would file a petition soon to 
substitute either the marcos estate or the late presidents 
executor as a defendant 
in the appeal to the supreme court marcos supporters claimed 
mrs aquinos refusal to permit burial in the philippines violates 
the constitution on sept 15 before marcos died the court ruled 
87 that his return would be a threat to security

the leader of the legislatures 
antiabortion forces today introduced a bill to put sweeping 
restrictions on abortion 
at a news conference republican rep stephen freind said the 
legislation would directly challenge roe vs wade and give the us 
supreme court another chance to overturn its 1973 ruling 
establishing the right to an abortion 
earlier this year the high court gave states broader powers to 
restrict abortions freinds bill which has the backing of 
democratic gov robert p casey could be the first to be adopted 
since that ruling in july 
the suburban philadelphia legislator who arrived at the news 
conference under police guard and was picketed by abortionrights 
advocates said his bill would 
require a 24hour waiting period before a woman can have an 
abortion 
outlaw all abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except 
to save the womans life 
ban abortions by women who want to choose the sex of a child 
require notification of the spouse before a woman has an 
abortion the high court has previously rejected such notification 
laws 
we are very encouraged that the legislation will be passed by 
the pennsylvania legislature said mary beliveau of the 
pennsylvania prolife federation 
abortionrights advocates today introduced their legislative 
package including a proposed constitutional amendment establishing 
a right to an abortion 
the prochoice bills would also restore government funding for 
poor women who have medically necessary abortions and would weaken 
a law requiring parental notification or a court order before a 
minor can obtain an abortion that provision is not in effect 
because it is under court review 
while pennsylvanias legislature historically has opposed 
abortion prochoice advocates said today that most pennsylvania 
voters support the right to choose 
in a poll of 500 likely voters the national abortion rights 
action league said 60 percent favored keeping abortion legal while 
33 percent wanted to outlaw it 
this data shows how dramatically outofstep pennsylvanias 
officials are with their constituents on abortion said kate 
michelman the leagues executive director the political 
atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly charged than ever 
politicians in pennsylvania who support abortion restrictions in 
1989 may well be voted out of office in 1990 
the poll taken sept 2528 by hickmanmaslin research inc has 
a margin of error of plus or minus 44 points

the soviet legislature today imposed a selective 
ban on strikes in key economic areas in a compromise with president 
mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for a complete ban 
gorbachev said he was satisfied with the compromise and that it 
would help restore a normal life 
this is a decision in support of perestroika he said 
a day after hearing gorbachevs proposal to ban all strikes for 
the next 15 months a joint session of the supreme soviets two 
chambers spent all of today in confused debate before arriving at a 
weakened version 
in the end it approved by a vote of 3646 a temporary ban on 
strikes in the industries of transport energy metallurgy and all 
raw materials until it can approve full legislation governing 
strikes 
a detailed law regulating strikes may be ready as soon as next 
week 
a draft law bans strikes that could threaten the lives or health 
of people and also in transportation communications energy 
defense industries and government organs however many of the key 
issues in the draft have not yet been approved 
gorbachev repeated his warning that the soviet economy is 
threatened by waves of politically motivated job actions but did 
not call again for an outright ban on all strikes 
deputies included in their decision language that would allow 
the countrys ministries of interior defense and transport to take 
over railroads in armenia and azerbaijan if necessary to get rail 
traffic moving again to armenia 
earlier during a break in the debate interior ministery vadim 
bakatin called the proposed strike ban unconstitutional 
we dont have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary 
situation he said 
leonid abalkin a deputy premier in charge of economic reform 
said the initiative to change the draft resolution came during an 
overnight meeting of deputies and not from gorbachev 
everyone wants to be sympathethic wants the public to like 
them and nobody wants to take the responsibility he said 
marju lauristin a deputy and leader of the estonian popular 
front said she favored a limit on strikes called for political 
reasons which she said could be used as an excuse for military 
intervention 
gorbachev in calling for a ban on strikes called the measure 
necessary to protect democratization from anarchy and 
irresponsible management 
by inserting the threat to take over operations and security on 
the countrys railroads the legislators were acting to bring an 
end to a blockade by azerbaijanis of rail lines leading from their 
republic into armenia 
soviet law does not ban strikes outright but labor unrest was 
ruthlessly repressed before gorbachev came to power in 1985 and 
began his effort to turn the soviet union into a country ruled by 
law instead of dictate 
gorbachev said monday that his proposal to ban strikes was not 
an effort to stop the processes that are underway in the framework 
of perestroika 
a key element of gorbachevs reforms is perestroika or 
restructuring the soviets unions stumbling and shortageridden 
economy and the soviet leader said that economic transformation is 
under threat because of strikes 
first deputy premier lev voronin told lawmakers monday that the 
economy lost 615 billion in july and august because of strikes 
and supplies of fuel are so low the country might be unable to 
provide enough heat for citizens through the winter 
a letter dated sept 29 and read out to the supreme soviet from 
the trade union of electrical workers suggested that extreme action 
was needed to restore the rhythym of labor in the country 
the most damaging strike this year was a walkout in july by 
thousands of coal miners in the far north siberia and the don 
basin of the eastern ukraine that strike cost the country millions 
of rubles and the government agreed to a package of economic and 
social improvements that officials said will cost about 3 billion 
strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent 
they have afflicted nagornokarabakh a disputed predominantly 
armenian enclave in the southern republic of azerbaijan and 
russian workers in moldavia and estonia have struck to protest 
local laws they say favor the majority estonians and moldavians 
the package of laws under discussion includes the proposed 
creation of a special form of administration for railroads in 
the caucasus republics where azerbaijanis reportedly blocked 
shipments of goods to armenia 
another proposal put forth at todays session was a price freeze 
on all food and manufactured goods 
the measure was proposed by the committee of peoples control a 
part of the supreme soviet committee on labor prices and social 
policy

some 4000 westinghouse electric corp 
retirees who thought they had won 35 million in an age 
discrimination suit may have lost it all as a result of a us 
supreme court ruling a legal specialist says 
the high court monday overturned a lowercourt ruling that the 
pittsburghbased electronics and electric power giant had 
discriminated against the retirees by forcing them to choose 
between severance pay or early pensions 
a judge had ruled in the retirees favor and westinghouse and 
the equal employment opportunity commission representing the 
retirees settled out of court in 1988 for 35 million or an 
average of 8700 per person 
but the eeoc backed out of the settlement in hope of a bigger 
award in court in the meantime westinghouse pursued the case to 
the us supreme court and won 
it means they blew it they got greedy in my opinion said 
dick lauver a pittsburgh pension lawyer not involved in the case 
they chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get a 
favorable court decision 
however donald livingston special assistant to the eeoc 
general counsel in washington said the case is far from over 
there are still a number of areas for the court to decide 
he said 
eeoc spokeswoman deborah graham said the westinghouse case was 
the commissions biggest age discrimination settlement 
westinghouse said it was delighted with mondays ruling

congressional democratic leaders announced 
today an aid program for poland and hungary that includes 887 
million in food and other economic assistance and said they have 
invited solidarity union leader lech walesa to address a joint 
meeting of congress next month 
denouncing bush administration aid efforts to date as grossly 
inadequate the democrats proposed a package that also includes a 
fiveyear moratorium on polands 25 billion debt to us banks 
and 14 billion in loans from international lending institutions 
the package would include the authorization of 887 million in 
us food and economic aid over the next three years 
this contrasts with the administations commitment to date to 
provide a total 255 million in assistance to the two east european 
nations stuggling to discard communist rule and build democratic 
institutions and free markets 
the announcement came at a news conference held by house speaker 
thomas f foley dwash senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and about 10 other democratic figures in both houses 
foley and mitchell said walesa has been invited to speak before 
a joint meeting of congress on nov 15 one of the rare occasions 
in us history when such an assembly will have been addressed by 
a person who is not a head of state or government 
rep lee hamilton dind said the legislation implementing the 
aid package will be sped through congress as quickly as possible in 
light of the fact that poland has nearly exhausted its foreign 
currency reserves 
he said the bill will urge the administration to seek a oneyear 
standby 700 million loan from the international monetary fund and 
a 765 million loan from the world bank 
the legislation also will urge the white house to direct the 
us treasury to make up to 1 billion available to poland from 
currency stabilization funds hamilton said 
hamilton said that of the 887 million authorization for us 
aid to poland and hungary it is contemplated that congress will be 
asked to appropriate 415 million for the 1990 fiscal year which 
opened on oct 1 
the us funds would be obtained by trimming other programs for 
which funds have already been appropriated hamilton said 
we intend to provide the leadership that has been lacking up 
until now rep john dingel dmich told the news conference 
the bush program is grossly inadequate 
this is a new and meaningful initiative mitchell said 
the administrations response to these historic events in eastern 
europe has been woefully inadequate in my viuew the 
admimnistration has failed completely to understand the historic 
nature of what has occurred

moscow is supporting afghanistans 
communist government with the largest military airlift in soviet 
history western diplomatic sources said tuesday 
they said more than 3800 supply flights landed in kabul from 
feb 15 when the red army withdrew after nine years of involvement 
in the afghan civil war and the beginning of september 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity estimated 
soviet military aid to afghanistan during the first half of 1989 
was worth more than 15 billion 
equipment delivered includes mediumrange missiles tanks and 
other armored vehicles artillery and mig21 and sukhoi25 jet 
fighters the sources reported 
moslem rebels supported by neighboring pakistan and the united 
states regularly raid or have cut most roads linking cities 
making overland supply difficult and dangerous 
government forces hold the major cities but guerrillas control 
much of the mountainous countryside after more than 11 years of 
civil war 
prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said tuesday her 
government was working with moscow on a political solution to the 
afghan conflict 
we are discussing with the soviet union a consensus resolution 
on afghanistan which will be presented at the current session of 
the united nations general assembly she told reporters in dhaka 
at the end of a threeday visit to bangladesh she did not 
elaborate 
ms bhutto said a broadbased representative government was the 
only way to peace and stability in afghanistan 
she also said a conducive condition should be created in 
afghanistan for the return of more than 35 million afghans who 
have fled to cities and camps inside pakistan 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a 
communist coup in april 1978 the major insurgent groups are based 
in paksitan 
diplomats and guerrilla spokesman say battles occur regularly 
along the salang highway which connects kabul with the soviet 
border 210 miles to the north they said the army had sent 
reinforcements to help fight guerrillas who fire at convoys from 
the mountains 
many trucks that make it to kabul use a detour built just north 
of the city where guerrillas have controlled a 21mile stretch of 
the salang since june the diplomats reported 
heavy attacks by insurgents also were reported on convoys bound 
for kandahar in the southeast afghanistans secondlargest city 
diplomats said guerrillas firing rockets and antitank weapons 
stopped half of a 1000unit convoy approaching the city and 
destroyed more than 100 vehicles

six explorers crossing antarctica on skis 
and sleds remained trapped tuesday by a mountain snowstorm but were 
out of immediate danger after a support crew airlifted in food and 
three fresh dogs 
spokeswoman jennifer gasperini said from the expeditions st 
paul headquarters that the hurricaneforce winds that had kept the 
adventurers in their tents abated over the weekend however she 
said abovezero temperatures brought 3 feet of fresh snow making 
it impossible for the dogs to travel 
winds of 20 mph monday night helped pack the surface and left 
the snow kneedeep she said tuesday if the relatively light winds 
continue the expedition expects to travel wednesday toward a food 
cache about 15 miles away at mount vang 
high winds low visibility and deep snow have put the 
unprecedented 4000mile traverse of antarctica as much as a week 
behind schedule but the lost time could be made up once the team 
leaves the mountainous antarctic peninsula and reaches mount vang 
the beginning of the flat ice plateau that makes up the continents 
interior gasperini said 
the mushers have traveled 630 miles since july 27 
on saturday a twin otter airplane reached the crew on the 
trail bringing needed food and airlifting out 15 exhausted dogs 
the three additional dogs leave the crew with 24 rather than 36 
sled dogs but the six adventurers have lightened their load by 
sending out one of their three tents

east germany agreed today to let 
as many as 11000 east germans inside and outside the west german 
embassy in prague travel to the west a topranking official in 
bonn said 
the first train of east german refugees will depart prague for 
west germany some time after 8 pm said rudolf seiters chief of 
staff to chancellor helmut kohl 
it was the second time within a week that east germany had 
reluctantly agreed to allow its citizens to emigrate west last 
weekend about 7000 refugees fled to the west from west german 
embassies in poland and czechoslovakia 
the agreement covers 4700 east germans inside the embassy and 
thousands more who raced to czechoslovakia in hopes of gaining 
passage to the west but were unable to get into the overfilled 
embassy compound seiters said 
earlier today about 250 east germans stormed past police and 
into the west german embassy and witnesses said some refugees were 
injured east germany then blocked citizens from traveling to 
czechoslovakia in an effort to stem the flow to the west 
until today east germans needed neither a visa nor a passport 
to travel to czechoslovakia the state news agency adn said that 
effective immediately such documents would be required that will 
effectively block ordinary citizens from going there 
the adn dispatch said the move was based on reports indicating 
that certain circles in west germany are preparing provocations 
in conjunction with the celebrations of our 40th anniversary on 
saturday 
adn did not say anything about changes in travel to poland 
where east germans also have holed up in the west german embassy 
east germans currently need government permission to travel to 
poland 
in bonn chief government spokesman hans klein said east german 
leader erich honecker earlier had refused to talk to west german 
chancellor helmut kohl by telephone about the refugee crisis 
honecker aides said that preparations for saturdays 40th 
anniversary of the communist nation precluded an appointment for 
a telephone call klein said 
the anniversary celebration which is to include a visit by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev comes amid perhaps east 
germanys most embarrassing diplomatic crisis the exodus of 
thousands of its citizens 
in another development the soviet communist party daily pravda 
accused west germany of interfering in east german affairs by 
allowing its embassies in prague and warsaw to grant asylum to 
refugees 
political leaders of west germany have made naked attempts to 
interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign east germany 
pravda said 
before todays announcment east germany had said last weekends 
exodus was a onetime occurrence and demanded that west germany 
expel the thousands of other wouldbe emigres who subsequently 
converged on the missions to follow their countrymen to west 
germany 
after breaking the police lines at the prague embassy the east 
germans scaled a 2yardhigh fence to join the approximately 4500 
refugees already inside embassy grounds 
the crowd broke into the embassy after west germany closed the 
compound because of intense crowding and hundreds of east germans 
waited outside the numbers increasing hourly witnesses said 
they said about 500 people reportedly gathered around the 
embassy some even sitting on nearby rooftops 
between 200 and 250 east germans waiting outside the embassy 
compound finally stormed through barricades around the embassy 
garden fence climbing into the compound they said 
when the refugees battled police who tried to stop them many 
were injured some from jumping from the fence the witnesses said 
the number of injured was not immediately known 
west german foreign ministry spokesman peter rothen told the 
associated press in bonn that the situation in the embassy had 
become unbearable its horribly crowded 
after clashes late monday evening between truncheonwielding 
police and east germans trying to reach the embassy police lifted 
their controls at the main gate allowing them to enter but 
continuing to patrol the garden fence 
west german sources said the embassy had been closed at the 
request of the german red cross which was concerned about 
sanitation problems 
about 1000 children were said by refugees to be among those in 
the embassy people were sleeping three to a bed in the tents 
scattered across the embassy grounds refugees said 
czechoslovak government spokesman miroslav pavel said the 
swelling numbers of east germans seriously upsets public order 
in prague and the government reserved the right to take 
indispensable measures to maintain and restore public order 
he said other embassies in the area including the us embassy 
had requested increased protection 
pavel said in a statement carried by the official ctk news 
agency that relevant czechoslovak authorities had provided 
necessary supplies and humanitarian medical and other technical 
assistance 
he criticized west germany as irresponsible for allowing the 
refugees to enter the building after allegedly assuring east 
germany and czechoslovakia that last weekends situation would not 
be repeated 
in the west german embassy in warsaw the number of east germans 
who have arrived in the past two days reached about 300 rothen 
said but he acknowledged the number could be higher 
east berlin restricted travel to hungary after that countrys 
liberal leaders opened their border with austria on sept 10 and 
thousands of east germans fled west across it more than 20000 
have crossed through hungary since then 
east germans unable to reach hungary then began converging on 
the west german embassies in poland and czechoslovakia 
poland and hungary are two liberal warsaw pact nations growing 
increasingly distant from such hardline allies as czechoslovakia 
and east germany 
the east german opposition group new forum on monday criticized 
the countrys communist leaders for agreeing to the weekend 
release saying in a statement that east germany is losing a 
village every day 
so far this year more than 120000 east germans have reached 
west germany where they are granted automatic citizenship the 
exodus of the mostly young skilled workers has hurt east germanys 
economy 
in leipzig east germany on monday nearly 20000 people 
marched to demand legalization of opposition groups and adoption of 
democratic reforms in the countrys largest such protest since 1953 
witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but 
did not try to break it up

opposition leader neil kinnock said 
tuesday his labor party is ready to start being negotiators in 
government following its renunciation of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament 
it is encouraging an inspiration to see the labor party 
working together exuding to the british people the feeling that 
we are fit to serve our country kinnock said in his keynote 
address on the second day of the partys annual conference in this 
south england resort 
kinnock confident the weeklong conference will endorse a major 
policy overhaul shifting the socialist movement to the center 
added that britons respect us for the changes we have made and 
are making 
kinnock who received a thunderous reception from the 1500 
delegates has clamped down on labors left wing and transformed 
the partys poll ratings in the past year 
the party consistently ahead in the polls since late spring is 
now in its strongest position since its third successive defeat by 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives in 1987 the next 
election must be called by mid1992 
the new defense policy stipulating that a laborled government 
would give up british nuclear weapons only as part of a negotiated 
arms deal is part of the new policy it also ditches some other 
votelosers such as pledges of widespread nationalization 
we seek the power to stop being spectators and start being 
negotiators said kinnock during his speech 
he said that because of deep divisions between east and west 
security will continue to mean the security of negotiated 
disarmament 
the stance represents a marked personal shift for kinnock 47 
who had been an ardent beliver in onesided nuclear disarmament 
since his student days 
he accused mrs thatcher of isolating britain internationally 
citing her combative attitude toward the 12nation european 
economic community her pressure for nato to modernize its 
shortrange nuclear weapons and her refusal to impose tough 
sanctions against south africa 
its not splendid isolation or cunning or sagacity or 
statespersonship said kinnock its a fundamental failure to 
perceive and try to secure britains role in a rapidly changing 
europe and a rapidly changing world

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods rose 29 percent in august the government said tuesday but 
analysts said a onemonth boost from automobile orders belies the 
weakness in the industrial sector 
the commerce department reported that orders for both durable 
and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2372 billion 
after declining 2 percent in july to 2305 billion the lowest 
level since last november orders rose 06 percent in june 
the august gain was driven by the transportation sector which 
rose 69 percent despite a decline in the aircraft component 
orders for automobiles posted a big increase because of 
endofthemodelyear sales incentives 
but the auto sales were a temporary phenomenon said bruce 
steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch capital markets in new 
york 
basically the industrial sector has slowed down he said 
american consumers are spending less exports are still strong 
but they are falling down too domestic capital spending is 
beginning to evaporate 
steinberg said the factory sector would continue to be quite 
sluggish for the rest of the year and into 1990 
john hagens an economist at the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
also sees the industrial sector continuing to slow 
flipflopping from one month to the next 
the commerce report showed orders for durable goods big 
ticket items expected to last more than three year rose 39 
percent in august up from the 38 percent initially reported last 
week nondurable goods orders were up 18 percent 
in addition to transportation the nonelectrical machinery 
durable goods component which includes computers registered a 
gain up 93 percent 
but orders for electrical machinery fell 21 percent mostly due 
to defense communicaioons equipment while primary metals were off 
18 percent 
in the influential category of nondefense capital goods a 
barometer of business investment plans orders fell 101 percent in 
august after rising 59 percent in july 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 56 percent the sharpest 
increase in the current economic expansion which began in 1982 
shipments had fallen 23 percent in july the sharpest drop since 
march 1986 
inventories rose 03 percent the smallest increase in the last 
two years but steinberg attributed this more to recently improved 
inventory control than to increased demand

this rural community has been trying to 
unload its former town hall building for several years while 
hoping a new owner wont kick out the only store in town 
theres nothing much i can do its their property store 
owner norman c bates said in a telephone interview tuesday 
bates 58 who has been ill for some years said he wouldnt 
mind selling his business although he doesnt feel town officials 
appreciate the service hes provided 
bates has run the retail store for 35 years paying the town 
100 a month rent 
the store in this town of about 600 tucked into a fold of the 
berkshire hills is the only place to buy such necessities as bread 
and milk along with such traditional staples as penny candy bates 
said some of its a nickel or a dime now though he added 
no one really knows how the store wound up in the old town hall 
building which was built in the early 1900s but has since been 
replaced 
that goes way way back said selectman chris andersen i 
know that the upstairs part of the building has forever been a town 
hall that was closed down about three years ago because of fire 
regulations 
thats where the town met and danced and ate and had their 
meetings and everything he said 
officials hoped a buyer would keep the store as a tenant 
although that was not a requirement of the sale the closest town 
is adams about eight miles away 
town residents first decided to sell the building and land in 
1985 because it lacks the capital to make repairs 
at first a sale was delayed by a boundary dispute with the 
nextdoor savoy baptist church 
after that was settled in 1988 voters put a special condition 
on the sale that any buyer would have to continue to operate it as 
a retail outlet that effort to sell ended with no bids submitted 
now the building and land are up for sale without restrictions 
and buyers would have to negotiate with bates for the business 
andersen said no price was set for the store he said 
store assistant fran kane said the store is in need of repairs 
particularly the leaking porch roof 
she said bates has suggested increasing the amount he pays the 
town to get an official lease making it worthwhile to do some 
repair work but she said that was rejected because of the desire 
to sell

president bushs plan for 9 million in us 
aid for the nicaraguan elections moved ahead in congress tuesday 
despite misgivings from democrats who said the idea amounted to 
blatant interference in another countrys politics 
the house appropriations committee on a voice vote sent the 
measure to the full house after defeating a move to slash the 
package to just 400000 to pay for election observers the house 
was scheduled to take up the measure on wednesday 
bushs proposal provides 5 million to the national endowment 
for democracy a quasigovernmental agency which promotes 
democratic processes in other countries and 4 million for other 
election support 
some support could go directly to the opposition coalition 
supporting presidential candidate violeta chamorro who is 
challenging nicaraguas sandinistabacked president daniel ortega 
the panel earmarked portions of the 4 million for specific 
organizations 400000 for an election observer team led by former 
president jimmy carter 400000 for the center for training and 
election promotion and 250000 for the center for democracy 
one effect of the earmarks was to lower the maximum amount that 
could go directly to the opposition coalition to about 15 
million with a like amount going to the nicaraguan supreme 
electoral council as a tax required by nicaraguan law 
rep david obey dwis called the package a turkey and 
misguided but urged fellow appropriations committee members to 
send the measure to the full house in accord with a promise to bush 
by the house democratic leadership 
rep mickey edwards rokla called the package necessary to 
seize an opportunity to see whether democracy can be brought to 
that country 
in a related development house intelligence committee chairman 
antony c beilenson dcalif said the bill providing money for 
the nations intelligence agencies for next year contains no money 
for covert us involvement in the feb 25 1990 election 
the administration could undertake covert action only by coming 
to congress to ask for a transfer of money from other programs 
which would give lawmakers a chance to veto such a move he said 
covertly supporting the opposition in nicaragua would be 
unwise as well as unnecessary and counterproductive beilenson 
said in a rules committee hearing we have accepted the 
administrations statements that it will not embark on this path

gen manuel antonio noriega dealt 
with everyone from the cia to colombian cocaine cartels as he 
clawed his way to power in panama and defied american efforts to 
oust him 
on tuesday elements of the defense forces claimed they had 
deposed noriega but the wily strongmans whereabouts were not 
known and forces loyal to noriega said they were resisting a coup 
attempt 
noriega 51 rose from poverty to the pinnacle of panamanian 
power through the ranks of the defense forces he was raised by 
foster parents and joined the defense forces in 1962 after 
attending military college in peru on a scholarship 
his ascent began when he caught the attention of an ambitious 
young officer named omar torrijos 
less than a year after the charismatic torrijos took power in a 
1968 coup he made noriega then an obscure major chief of 
intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel 
it was like having the keys to the city noriega immediately 
began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in panama 
information was power 
his new post also gave him jurisidiction over customs and 
immigration long lucrative sources of income for the military 
noriegas new job also put him in close contact with us 
intelligence agencies he formed powerful alliances 
when torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981 
noriega was poised to shoulder his way to the top of the defense 
forces in 1983 he assumed command of the 15000man force wealth 
and power were his 
he acquired a fleet of expensive cars a home in panama citys 
most exclusive neighborhood and is reputed to have a finger in a 
vast array of lucrative businesses including hotels maritime 
services gambling casinos a television station a dozen radio 
stations maritime services dutyfree liquor stores and 
prostitution 
noriega exercised his power with ruthless assurance he had 
little tolerance for criticism he would close newspapers for 
months at a time and presidents served at his pleasure 
the united states long his close ally began to move away from 
noriega after the headless body of one of his most vocal opponents 
hugo spadadora turned up in a us mailbag in costa rica 
spadadora had publicly accused noriega of drug trafficking 
the full break with washington came in 1988 when two federal 
grand juries in florida indicted noriega on charges drug 
trafficking he was accused of selling out his country to the drug 
lords of medellin colombia of turning panama into a drug 
transshipment point and a haven for money laundering 
the domestic opposition heartened by the indictments began to 
intensify its campaign to force noriega to resign the united 
states imposed crippling economic sanctions on panama 
the general didnt bend an inch 
instead he cloaked himself in torrijos nationalist banner 
accusing the united states of plotting to renege on the 1977 
treaties that put the panama canal in local hands at the end of the 
century 
control of the canal linking the atlantic and pacific oceans 
has long been an emotional issue in panama 
when international observers said the opposition had won the may 
7 general election noriega simply had the balloting annulled and 
installed yet another president the sixth since he took command of 
the defense forces 
shortly after his indictment noriega gave a dramatic speech that 
seemed to epitomize the strongman and his steely intransigence 
the strongman brandished a machete above his head then brought 
it crashing down on the podium 
ni un paso atras he shouted his pockmarked face 
contorted not one step back

the nations newspaper editors must be 
fanatical about developing ties to their communities if they 
hope to reverse a slide in readership the head of the associated 
press managing editors said tuesday 
we must get closer to our communities said paul janensch 
editor and general manager of the rockland journalnews in new york 
citys suburban rockland county ny 
call it what you will customer obsession putting the reader 
first serving the constituents we must do it better he said 
i firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our 
communities we will prosper if we dont we will fade away 
as he opened the annual apme convention janensch pointed to 
figures showing that newspaper readership is declining 
in 1967 about 73 percent of us adults said they read a 
newspaper every day he said last year the number was down to 
51 percent 
janensch said steadily declining readership confronts us with 
the most serious problem facing newspapers today and said it even 
hits markets where the economy is booming 
if you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your 
circulation is going up you may think you dont have a problem 
he said 
wrong even where circulation is going up net newspaper 
penetration is going down there are no exceptions 
frequently lost in the daily pressure of publishing janensch 
said is the need to establish links between a newspaper and the 
community 
we all know the answer but we lose sight of it solving our 
daytoday newsroom problems he said we lose sight of it 
wrestling with budgets performance evaluations and other 
administrative matters 
do you hear what the people in your community are saying about 
your newspaper he asked do you know what they like do you 
know what ticks them off 
surveying readers cant substitute for basics of business such 
as customer service he said 
readership surveys can be useful but they arent enough 
janensch said surveys cant halt sliding readership unless the 
editor and the editors staff are fanatical about getting close to 
the community 
while many are captivated by national news and bigname events 
most of americas newspapers survive by providing residents of the 
community with information they need in their daily lives he said 
is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper 
asked janensch do you care as much about the expansion of a 
local business as you do about the national trade deficit 
in addition to building community ties janensch said a 
newspapers staff must reflect the papers market 
does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic 
diversity of your target readership he asked the editors are 
about half of your staffers women do your staffers have roots in 
the community 
without that commitment to community janensch said the steady 
decline in newspaper readership will inevitably continue costing 
newspapers advertising revenue and that in turn tightens budgets 
and damages the news product 
the new york times might be able to survive with 10 or 15 
percent of its primary market but can you janensch asked 
editors 
the apme is an association of editors from member newspapers of 
the associated press

here is the text of president bushs remarks 
in the oval office about the situation in panama he spoke to the 
media at the outset of a meeting with visiting soviet defense 
minister dmitri yazov 
bush said he was bending his usual rules prohibiting questions 
at photo opportunities given the anxiety and the state of the 
rumor mill 
bush went on 
the first concern that i have as president of the united 
states is the safety of american citizens and of course that would 
include american forces that are there under our treaty rights with 
panama 
secondly there are a lot of rumors around we are staying in 
very close touch with south com southern command we have very 
able military officers who are advising us of the situation on the 
ground 
but beyond that i would simply add to the rumors if i 
commented further and we are watching the situation with the no 1 
priority the lives of americans 
there were rumors around that this was some american operation 
and i can tell you that is not true 
asked if he was willing to help the panamanian defense forces 
bush said 
again thats part of the confusion nobody is sure whats 
happening there people on the ground have the best idea about that 
but i would repeat in the hopes that it be conveyed instantly 
to panama we have no argument with the panamanian defense forces 
we have no argument with them weve had good relations with the 
panamanian defense forces our argument has been as has many other 
countries with mr noriega who aborted the democratic will of the 
people of panama and thats where our argument was and thats 
where our argument is 
and so if you can use all these cameras to get that message to 
the people of panama i really think it would be a good thing for 
peace and i think it would be a good thing in terms of a historic 
relationship between our two countries that i value and that all 
americans want to see improved so sally forth and do your best 
bush refused to answer further questions

parents of a 4yearold who died after a 
swimming lesson described as strenuous have settled a lawsuit 
against instructors and a beach resort for nearly 1 million 
we still cant believe it happened said patricia myers who 
watched at poolside while instructors huddled over her daughter 
amber nicole myers after she lost consciousness during a 50yard 
swim 
amber was taking a swimming lesson in august 1987 from george 
symons and michael hatton at the tides hotel and bath club resort 
in north redington beach 
according to the lawsuit hatton made her swim two laps in the 
75foot pool during the second lap the child who had tearfully 
complained of fatigue lost consciousness and stopped breathing 
with an instructor only a couple feet from her 
the mother of another child in the class and an instruction 
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived 
but amber never breathed on her own again and was placed on life 
support equipment she was removed from the equipment eight days 
later and died 
patricia and stephen myers filed suit against the instructors 
and gulf beach which owns the resort alleging negligence they 
settled monday for 950000 
the couple said they will wage a personal campaign for state and 
national laws requiring instructors and lifeguards be certified in 
lifesaving skills and cpr 
brian harrington attorney for the resort and the instructors 
said the instructors were certified in lifesaving and cpr more 
qualified than was required by either us swimming a sanctioning 
association or florida law 
the last thing mrs myers remembers is amber asking mommy 
how much longer is class i dont want to swim the long way 
ill always have a problem with that mrs myers 32 said 
through tears 
family attorney bob carroll said the couple decided to settle 
rather than take the matter to court this week because of the 
stress a trial would bring they would have been reliving this 
thing 1000 times 
harrington said the hotel is looking at the swim program to see 
if changes need to be made hotel management wanted to get all 
this over and done with first he said 
harrington denied there were serious flaws with the program 
if it were so deficient how did it function for 35 years 
teaching 8000 to 10000 swimmers in three generations without 
another death he asked

east germans were left 
bloodspattered and some even unconscious tuesday at the west 
german embassy as nearly 300 of the most desperate fought police 
broke through barricades and scaled a fence in their bid for 
freedom 
this is pandemonium said a red cross assistant handling 
injured refugees on the embassy grounds 
early tuesday officials closed the embassy leaving nearly 
1000 people stranded outside the baroque lobkowicz palace that 
houses it between 4000 and 5000 people including some 1500 
children were packed into the compound at the time and red cross 
officials feared sanitation problems 
shortly after noon the desperation peaked witnesses saw groups 
of newcomers rush toward the fence of the compound which was 
blocked by a police barricade 
when police tried to stop them the refugees pulled down the 
barricade police resorted to their truncheons they clubbed like 
mad a czechoslovak eyewitness reported 
more people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the 
beatings took place in only minutes almost 300 thronged the 
narrow passage toward a sixfoot fence into the embassy garden 
police beat them as they passed and many reached the fence 
bleeding 
those who broke through scaled the fence refugees quickly built 
a human ladder to help many clear the hurdle the witnesses 
said 
many got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and 
others jumped or fell headfirst to the ground some were later 
seen lying unconscious inside the compound the witnesses said 
outside the embassy families with small children were unable to 
get inside they said they feared police retaliation 
later when the situation had calmed down somewhat young men 
were still seen climbing the embassy facade from a truck they were 
pulled in through windows by other refugees

a dog can get around on three legs but 
rusty is a 40pound dog with two legs who has learned to do 
practically everything normal dogs do 
he might be a step or two slower than he was with four legs 
but not much more than that said owner bill davis hes quick 
enough that im back to using him with the cattle he can run 
around them and get them moving just like he used to 
rusty learned to run on his two right legs after a hay mower 
accident july 1 nearly killed the animal and left his left legs 
dangling as useless stubs the stubs swing back and forth when he 
moves but they dont touch the ground 
davis is amazed as are visitors to his farm 
come to think of it the only thing he cant do that he could 
before is jump a fence he said 
when it happened id been out mowing the end rows of my oat 
field and i was coming back in davis said i came around the 
corner of the hog house and there was rusty it happened so quick i 
couldnt get stopped in time the mower went right over it 
he was just motionless there underneath it bleeding but still 
alive ill tell you it was like running over your own kid well 
almost it about made me sick 
davis 35 raced to the office of veterinarian dr eric 
christianson who agrees the recovery was remarkable 
yeah it is amazing its not like we have physical therapy in 
veterinary medicine but just the fact that he survived is 
something considering how bad he was hurt 
christianson said the dog had lost a lot of blood by the time 
davis brought him in and it was a close call whether were going 
to try to save him or put him to sleep we decided to give it a try 
and if it didnt work or if the dog wasnt having much of a life 
afterward because of just having two legs we could put him to 
sleep later 
the veterinarian said the dog survived the accident because the 
3yearold red heeler was in good shape at the time 
but the biggest factor is that this dog has a real will to 
live a heck of a lot of character most animals would have given 
up christianson said

in hot dimly lit classrooms students 
in the edgewood independent school district have learned what it 
means to struggle 
most come from poor families in the predominantly hispanic 
southwest section of san antonio at school in buildings in need 
of extensive renovation they have had few specialized classes and 
fewer sports programs 
but their dropout rate is low their superintendent is 
recognized by educators statewide and pride pervades 
this is where the battle began to topple texas public school 
finance system to gain financial equality between rich and poor 
districts and where students educators lawyers and legislators 
rejoiced monday over the unanimous texas supreme court ruling 
declaring the finance system unconstitutional 
the court gave the texas legislature until may 1 to come up with 
a solution 
when we first began the lawsuit nobody wanted to join with 
us we were sort of the lone ranger edgewood superintendent 
james vasquez said tuesday 
but that had never bothered this maverick district 
in 1968 edgewood resident demetrio rodriguez led a group of 
parents and students in suing for equality between rich and poor 
school districts 
that lawsuit ended in 1973 when the us supreme court 
overturned a threejudge federal panel that had ordered the texas 
legislature to devise a constitutional funding system 
rodriguez and others remained involved in the battle and in 
1984 with the help of the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund the district began the winning legal war with the 
state 
while the school district had its doubts vasquez said it never 
considered abandoning the fight that same determination has pushed 
the district during its 84year history he said 
weve got to fight for everything we get i think that spirit 
moves us forward said vasquez who has been with edgewood 30 
years as a teacher vice principal principal assistant 
superintendent and now superintendent 
the 15500student district is 95 percent hispanic and covers a 
section of san antonio with 87000 residents many of whom are poor 
or work at one of several nearby military bases school board 
president pete gonzales said 
part of the districts problem has been that its property base 
used to determine taxation is mostly lowincome housing or 
military installations though the federal government pays the 
district about 200000 a year the bases cannot be taxed 
the lack of money means edgewood spends about 3600 per pupil 
per year other texas school districts spend anywhere from 2100 
to 19300 per pupil depending on the districts tax base 
compounding the problem gonzales contends is the higher 
concentration in lowincome districts of students with special 
needs meaning more money must be spent on them and even less 
channeled toward socalled mainstream students 
the school districts priorities vasquez said are implementing 
innovative programs to curtail the dropout rate paying teachers 
competitive salaries and renovating buildings 
some of the buildings need complete refurbishing and many dont 
have air conditioning which vasquez considers a necessity in san 
antonio where mondays temperature reached 95 degrees 
vasquez is proud of the school districts relatively low dropout 
rate at 23 percent it compares favorably with the approximate 50 
percent average statewide for hispanic youths 
former edgewood students typically stay involved with the 
district and offer help once they are established in their careers 
vasquez said 
theyve lived the experience they know what its like out 
there and they want to come back and make things better the 
superintendent said its like a family 
vasquez has had numerous offers to go elsewhere he has lectured 
on school financing at most major texas universities served on 
state education task forces and is cofounder of the austinbased 
equity center which includes more than 200 school districts and 
has its own budget and staff to study school financing 
he sees the texas supreme court ruling not only as a victory for 
his students but for all texas children 
vasquez spent much of monday explaining to his students that 
they were part of history but he said he is still trying to make 
himself believe it 
i think that will sink into me one of these days he said

the federal government tuesday approved a new 
drug to treat severe schizophrenia and a unique monitoring program 
in which patients using the drug will be tested weekly for signs of 
a potentially fatal side effect 
the food and drug administration said the drug clozapine can 
be used only for patients who have not responded to at least two 
regimens of standard less toxic therapy 
an estimated 200000 people could benefit from the drug the fda 
said 
the drug has been shown to relieve the symptoms of severe 
schizophrenia allowing patients to lead more productive lives 
but the drug also can cause a potentially fatal blood disorder 
called agranulocytosis in which the level of infectionfighting 
white blood cells is reduced studies have shown the condition can 
be reversed if caught early 
under the monitoring system a home health care company will 
distribute the prescribed medication to patients each week and 
collect blood samples that will be sent to a national laboratory 
for analysis the fda said 
if the test results indicate the patient must stop taking the 
drug the patients doctor will be notified immediately by 
telephone 
the testing program was proposed by sandoz pharmaceutical corp 
of east hanover nj which will market the drug under the trade 
name clozaril 
it is believed to be the first time the fda has approved such a 
testing plan along with a new drug an agency spokeswoman said 
agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patients 
taking clozapine said sandoz spokesman david winter 
in each of the 15 cases of the blood disorder that occurred 
during testing the side effect was caught early enough for the 
condition to be reversed the fda said however that even with 
the careful monitoring system planned some fraction of patients 
who develop agranulocytosis may die 
the drug is also associated with seizures 
fda commissioner frank young acknowledged the serious risks 
associated with use of the drug but said the severity and 
hopelessness of unremitting chronic schizophrenia was an important 
factor in the decision to approve clozapine 
schizophrenia can be incapacitating without effective treatment 
often leaving the patient incoherent plagued by continual fear and 
threatening hallucinations and unable to care for themselves 
clozapine was first evaluated in the early 1960s by sandoz ltd 
of basel switzerland and marketed in several foreign countries 
but its development as an antipsychotic drug in the united states 
was abandoned and the drug was taken off the market in other 
countries in the mid1970s when it was linked to agranulocytosis 
with several deaths in finland

federal health officials will test 
water from a city pool closed tuesday in a search for the cause of 
a rare respiratory problem diagnosed in four lifeguards 
i have my fingers and toes crossed that maybe this will give 
us the answers were looking for said pierrette ray the citys 
riskmanagement officer 
two lifeguards were diagnosed last month and two were diagnosed 
last week with hypersensitivity pneumonitis a rare allergic 
reaction to prolonged exposure to various organic dusts and 
chemicals 
theyre sick in that they feel tired all the time just like 
if you have a real bad case of the flu ms ray said 
the four lifeguards also have runny noses and runny eyes three 
were assigned other city jobs and one quit to return to school 
in my mind theres no doubt theres a problem with the pool 
but we dont know what it is said dr cecile rose of the 
national jewish center for immunology and respiratory medicine in 
denver she diagnosed three of the four cases 
the national centers for disease control and harvard university 
medical center will test water samples shipped them monday for a 
small protozoa called acanthamoeba which has been associated with 
the disease said govinda visvesvara research biologist with the 
cdcs division of parasitic diseases 
some types of the protozoa are resistant to chlorine 
water and air tests so far have turned up no cause for the 
illnesses results of the additional tests were expected in two to 
three weeks 
the indoor pool was closed pending the additional test results 
and to avoid any harm to the pools 19 other lifeguards who will 
be tested ms ray said

president mikhail s gorbachev suffered his first 
major policy defeat in the 4monthold soviet legislature tuesday 
when it rejected his call for an emergency ban on workers newly 
won right to strike 
but gorbachev told lawmakers he was satsified with a compromise 
that imposes a selective ban on strikes in critical industries he 
said it would help restore a normal life 
gorbachev said monday he wanted a ban on all strikes for the 
next 15 months to prevent anarchy from overwhelming the shaky 
soviet economy a wave of strikes largely over ethnic and 
political conflicts cost the country 65 billion in july and 
august alone 
strikes were ruthlessly suppressed for decades until gorbachev 
began his effort to turn the country from a dictatorship into one 
ruled by law it was only last year that workers began to succeed 
in pressuring for change by walking off the job 
it was the first time the new supreme soviet legislature stood 
up to the government and opted for its own policy though it had 
previously rejected several cabinet nominees the legislatures 
display of independence was particularly significant because it 
came on a package of emergency measures 
the compromise resolution adopted by a vote of 3646 prohibits 
strikes in the transport energy raw materials and metallurgy 
industries but only until the legislature passes a detailed law 
defining the right to strike 
that could be as soon as monday at the next session of the full 
legislature nearly half the articles in the strike law were 
approved tuesday 
the more controversial sections which have yet to face floor 
debate would ban strikes that threaten human life or health as 
well as any aimed at overthrow of the government or violation of 
ethnic equality it also would ban strikes in the transportation 
communications energy and defense industries and among civil 
servants 
the draft also requires arbitration before a strike and allows 
the supreme soviet or its ruling presidium to halt or delay strikes 
it also says those found responsible for a strike can be fired 
and fined up to three months pay to help cover economic damages 
it does not define responsibility leaving open the possibility 
that managers who fail to resolve labor disputes could be held as 
guilty as strike leaders 
all of these points still await debate 
the emergency resolution adopted also permits the countrys 
ministries of interior defense and transport to guarantee 
operation of the railroads in armenia and azerbaijan if necessary 
to get rail traffic moving again to armenia 
strikers in azerbaijan motivated by ethnic demands created a 
virtual economic blockade of armenia by interfering with shipments 
on the main rail and road lines to the neighboring republic 
armenia and azerbaijan are locked in a conflict over the disputed 
territory of nagornokarabakh which has also been hit by lengthy 
strikes trains ship about 80 percent of the goods armenia receives 
from elsewhere in the soviet union 
in july thousands of coal miners walked off the job demanding 
more consumer goods and control over mining operations they 
returned to work only after moscow agreed to a package of economic 
and social improvements that officials say will cost about 3 
billion 
legislators from four committees who worked through the night on 
gorbachevs proposal to ban strikes originally offered him a 
complete rebuff their weakened draft resolution presented to the 
supreme soviet tuesday morning did not even mention any ban on 
strikes 
during the debate a deputy suggested prohibiting strikes only 
in key industries 
gorbachev responded by repeating his warning that the soviet 
economy is threatened by waves of politically motivated job 
actions but he did not call again for an outright ban on all 
strikes 
interior minister vadim bakatin told reporters the blanket ban 
was rejected by the legislative group as unconstitutional 
we dont have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary 
situation he said 
leonid abalkin a deputy premier in charge of economic reform 
confirmed that a dramatically different draft resolution came 
during the overnight meeting of deputies and not from gorbachev 
speaking to reporters during a break in debate he made it clear 
that kremlin leaders believe strong action is needed and 
criticized the deputies for caving into public pressure 
everyone wants to be sympathetic wants the public to like 
them and nobody wants to take the responsibility he said 
gorbachev received support from a number of liberals marju 
lauristin a deputy and leader of the estonian popular front said 
during a break she favored limits on strikes over political issues 
because they damage the economy and could be used as an excuse for 
military intervention 
russian workers in estonia went on strike during the summer to 
protest voting laws they say favor the majority estonians

solidarity leader lech walesa was invited to 
address a joint meeting of congress tuesday as senate and house 
democrats announced an ambitious effort to help poland and hungary 
make the leap from communism to democracy 
democratic leaders of both chambers dismissed president bushs 
219 million package of initiatives in eastern europe as a 
grossly inadequate response to an historic opportunity to 
bolster democracy and free enterprise in the region and to end the 
40year cold war with victory for the west 
they spelled out a legislative program with a potential total 
value of more than 37 billion composed of loans from 
international financial institutions direct american aid and loans 
and a fiveyear halt in polish payments on its us bank debt 
bold action today will be far less costly than timidity 
said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo for if we 
hesitate and the opportunity is lost we will be paying for it for 
a long long time in an escalating arms race 
escalating the partisan attack on republican inititives for 
eastern europe gephardt said it is ironic that a government which 
doubled us military spending to respond to a soviet military 
threat now seems curiously paralyzed unable to respond to the 
possibility of economic freedom democracy and peace breaking out 
in eastern europe 
but raymond seitz assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs denying such paralysis exists said polands new plan for 
restructuring its centralized economy is in many respects a 
declaration of economic independence 
seitz told a house foreign affairs subcommittee that a polish 
request for a 1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is under 
very active review at very high levels there will be a response to 
that shortly 
the invitation to walesa to address a joint meeting of congress 
on nov 15 was extended by house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
walesa who had already announced plans to visit the united 
states is expected to accept 
both democratic leaders compared the proposal to the aid 
announced so far by bush with mitchell calling the presidents 
woefully inadequate 
the bush program is grossly inadequate said rep john 
dingell dmich we intend to provide the leadership that has 
been lacking up to now 
the democratic aid package includes 887 million in new us 
economic and food assistance to poland and hungary of which it is 
contemplated that 415 million would be appropriated for use in the 
1990 fiscal year which opened on sunday 
this would include some 125 million in immediate food aid 
the plan builds on and expands the privatesector enterprise 
fund proposed by bush during his visit to warsaw last summer it 
would help fund a host of smallscale projects encourage joint 
commercial ventures with western corporations and work to 
establish private businesses in the two countries 
the democratic aid plan includes trade credit insurance health 
programs scholarships and scientific and labor exchanges it calls 
for a coordinated aid effort by the overseas private investment 
corp the peace corps the us exportimport bank the labor 
department and the environmental protection agency 
it calls for the use of the treasury departments exchange 
stabilization fund to make available up to 1 billion in loans to 
poland 
our package will instruct the secretary to use that fund for 
bridge loans to poland which they can use to repay debts buy the 
materials necessary for industrial restructuring and jump start 
their economy gephardt said 
the plan would also give poland breathing space by halting for 
five years payments on its 25 billion debt to us lending 
institutions 
another element of the proposal would instruct us 
representatives to the world bank and international monetary fund 
to seek 14 billion in bridge loans for poland and hungary

spurred by concerns about scientific misconduct 
a prestigious medical journal will require study authors to hand 
over their raw data for examination if requested the journal 
editor said tuesday 
the journal also will tighten its requirement on disclosing 
financial interests involved in the research said george lundberg 
of the journal of the american medical association 
the steps are among requirements being imposed to protect the 
credibility of the journal lundberg said the requirements will 
take effect when they are announced in next weeks issue he said 
at a science reporters conference sponsored by the ama 
were calling attention to all these things hoping by 
education or intimidation to keep things straight he said in an 
interview 
to get research published in the journal scientists will have 
to sign a pledge that they will let editors examine their raw data 
if the editors ask for it lundberg said that will help in 
detecting misrepresentation of data or fraud he said 
the journal already asks authors to disclose financial interests 
in their work and weve trusted authors to level with us 
lundberg said the journal will go a step further by requiring a 
signed certification 
financial interests include who paid for the research who 
employs the researchers whether a researcher owns stock in a 
company that would be affected by the study and whether the 
scientist is a paid consultant to such a company 
such information may be published along with the study lundberg 
said 
study authors also will have to certify that they participated 
in the reported work enough to take public responsibility for it 
lundberg said that is aimed at the practice of honorary 
authorship in which a listed author may not have played a 
meaningful role in the study 
in some recent medical fraud cases distinguished scientists who 
were listed as authors had never seen the paper and did not even 
know the reported research was bogus he said but the appearance 
of their names on the papers lent the works credence he said 
authors also will have to vouch for the validity of the study 
and certify that they had reviewed and approved the final 
manuscript 
if an author lies in making the newly required statements the 
journal may publish a notice about it lundberg said 
in a separate presentation at the conference a prominent heart 
disease researcher said federal funding for biomedical research 
should be set as a fixed fraction of the nations spending on 
health care 
without such steps to assure adequate funding in the future the 
field will have trouble attracting young researchers and replacing 
antiquated equipment said antonio gotto of baylor college of 
medicine in houston 
that in turn would endanger its ability to conduct the science 
that leads to new products for health care he said 
in 1985 the nation spent 458 billion or about 108 percent of 
its gross national product on health care costs he said 
federal funding of medical research has declined to about 12 
percent of overall gnp from previous levels of 3 percent he said 
a return to the previous level might be an appropriate target he 
said 
douglas kelly associate vice president for medical research of 
the association of american medical colleges said he believed the 
fixedpercentage idea is not very realistic politically 
it would convert research funding to an entitlement like social 
security and congress would probably be reluctant to do that he 
said in an interview

the bush administration urged east germany on 
tuesday to work out an agreement with west germany permitting the 
emigration of thousands of additional refugees who have flocked to 
bonns embassies in czechoslovakia and poland 
but the best solution the bush administration said would be 
for the east germany to establish permament procedures for people 
to travel without hindrance from their government 
under an agreement between the two germanys more than 6000 
east germans were admitted to west germany over the weekend 
afterward thousands of additional wouldbe emigrants went to the 
west german embassies in prague and warsaw trying to follow their 
countrymen 
however the east german government said the agreement was a 
onetime humanitarian arrangement and demanded that bonn not allow 
the second influx to stay in its embassies 
the bush administration through state department spokesman 
richard boucher came down tuesday on the side of the refugees by 
invoking the 1975 helsinki agreement a 35nation accord that 
pledged a freer flow of people and ideas between east and west 
having signed the accord boucher said the east german 
government is responsible to meet that commitment the us 
official also praised west germany for providing a home for fellow 
germans 
but the statement read by boucher also suggested that east 
germany one of the strictest communist states in europe could 
help keep its people from leaving by undertaking reforms 
we believe that in order to remove the conditions which caused 
so many people to flee to the west the gdr german democratic 
republic leadership should institute reforms which will lead to a 
political and economic system responsive to the population of east 
germany boucher said 
he said the root cause of the situation was that people do 
not want to live in east germany 
if youre going to have a way of resolving the situation in 
the long run there are going to have to be political and economic 
reforms in east germany that will make it a more livable place for 
people 
still the us official stressed the view that east germans 
under the helsinki agreement have a right to go to the west 
boucher said the agreement specified a very clear freedom to 
travel and freedom of emigration 
on capitol hill meanwhile assistant secretary of state raymond 
gh seitz reaffirmed us support for the eventual reunification 
of east and west germany but said that reunification must be 
approached cautiously 
it is correct that the history of the 20th century is a 
history in which the unification of germany led to instability and 
to war history tells us to be very cautious seitz said at a 
congressional hearing

a federal prosecutor said tuesday he was ready and 
waiting to put panamanian military ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega on trial on drug trafficking charges if a coup attempt 
resulted in his extradition 
noriega was accused in a february 1988 indictment here of 
accepting 46 million from colombias medellin drug cartel to 
provide protection and services for traffickers smuggling cocaine 
into the united states 
he also faces a threecount marijuanatrafficking indictment in 
tampa 
i am ready to try him as soon as his defense lawyers are 
ready us attorney dexter lehtinen said tuesday 
noriegas attorney in miami neal sonnett said he had no 
comment on tuesdays events in panama where soldiers opposed to 
noriega seized his headquarters 
the reagan administration once offered to drop the indictment if 
noriega would leave panama but that deal fell through 
now lehtinen said the bush administration is interested in 
trying noriega and the major case against him is in miami 
other federal law enforcement officials said that without a 
formal extradition order noriega might not be sent to miami 
initially but could be detained at us military bases a formal 
extradition treaty exists between the united states and panama but 
it is not obligatory for either nation 
the 12count indictment against noriega in miami upheld by a 
federal judge in january also includes charges against medellin 
cartel leader pablo escobar gaviria 
the indictment alleges that noriega protected drug shipments 
through panama arranged for cocaineprocessing chemicals allowed 
traffickers to set up a processing laboratory in his country and 
laundered cartel profits through panamanian banks 
noriega also allegedly sheltered some of the cartel leaders 
after the assassination of colombian minister of justice rodrigo 
larabonilla according to the indictment 
but at one point the indictment said he raided the cartel 
laboratory and cuban leader fidel castro allegedly mediated the 
resulting dispute between noriega and the cartel 
the tampa indictment accuses noriega of accepting 1 million to 
allow the importation of 14 million pounds of marijuana

angolas marxist government and the usarmed 
rebels opposing it are waging their battle in washingtons public 
relations arena this week 
the bush administration is holding open house for both sides 
scheduling meetings with angolan foreign minister pedro van dunem 
despite the absence of diplomatic relations with his government 
and a white house visit with president bush for jonas savimbi 
leader of the angolan rebels 
in addition at the administrations urging zairean president 
mobutu sese seko is paying a quick visit to washington on wednesday 
and will meet with president bush at the white house officials 
said the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
main agenda item would be angola and the strains between savimbi 
and mobutu 
mobutu who has helped funnel us arms to savimbis union for 
the total independence of angola unita appears to have shifted 
his allegiance in recent weeks openly supporting angolan president 
jose eduardo dos santos 
the us diplomatic efforts are designed to head off a final 
collapse of zaireanmediated truce accords reached last june 
between savimbi one of the largest recipients of us covert aid 
and the sovietbacked government 
the truce began coming apart soon after it went into effect and 
subsequent negotiations between the sides on a permanent agreement 
ending their 14year civil war have failed despite persistent state 
department efforts 
unita is demanding free elections and a change in the countrys 
marxistoriented constitution 
savimbi meanwhile denies claims by dos santos that he agreed 
to go into exile and to integrate his troops into angolas army he 
says such contentions are a ruse to destroy unita politically after 
the government failed to do so militarily 
the two sides have refused to sit in the same room during 
negotiations 
in an interview after his arrival here savimbi said he was 
prepared to meet with a highlevel angolan foreign ministry 
delegation which is due to arrive wednesday 
he also is urging a more active us role in the negotiations 
with angola similar to the american diplomacy last year that 
helped bring about the complex agreement for the pullout of 50000 
cuban troops from angola and the granting of independence to 
namibia 
savimbi who received his guerrilla training in china and until 
last year got most of his military support from south africa is 
aided by a powerful array of us lobbyists and lawyers led by the 
firm of black manafort stone and kelly 
his nearly weeklong agenda is packed with meetings on capitol 
hill the state department and white house as well as with 
reporters and with businessmen seeking a foothold in mineralrich 
angola 
van dunem the angola governments foreign minister is coming 
to washington for only one day and his lobbyists and supporters 
have organized meetings with state department officials and 
reporters to press for us recognition of his government the 
us is the only western country which still doesnt recognize 
angola said randall robinson director of transafrica which is 
lobbying for recognition of angola 
in another salvo between the sides unita supporters led by sen 
orrin hatch rutah have asked attorney general dick thornburgh to 
investigate transafrica accusing it of violating the foreign 
agents registration act by accepting more than 2000 from the 
angolan mission to the united nations i certainly never received 
any money from angola robinson said 
van dunems sidetrip to washington from the un general 
assembly in new york is viewed by state department officials as an 
attempt to counter the effects of savimbis visit 
a kit distributed by fenton communications the firm that 
handles angolas public relations includes a list of 
demonstrations planned this week against savimbi as well as copies 
of recent newspaper articles critical of the rebel leader 
halfpage ads this week in the washington post and the new york 
times paid for by the angolan government said savimbi was coming 
here to press for more covert aid to augment the 40 million unita 
is already getting 
the ads cited an article in the national review which described 
unita as having a classic marxistleninist structure with not a 
vestige of democratic procedures 
a resolution introduced last week by 42 democrats and 15 
republicans in the house calls on the bush administration to 
establish a liaison office in luanda 
but the administration backed by conservatives such as rep dan 
burton has rejected granting any diplomatic ties until the 
government agrees to hold free elections that would give unita a 
shot at powersharing

volunteers have offered to fly a terminally 
ill defense department employee home to massachusetts after the air 
force refused a request from the mans family for a free 
airambulance flight 
but the health of the employee avram brody had declined as of 
tuesday to the point where it may be too late for him to make a 
transcontinental flight his wife said 
brody 25 was diagnosed last year with terminal brain cancer 
the threeyear defense department computer operator who lives in 
palmdale calif about 45 miles north of los angeles sought a 
free airambulance flight to massachusetts from the air force it 
would have cost roughly 29000 to hire a private air ambulance 
amy brody said her husband wanted to return to massachusetts 
where he was born and raised so he could be among relatives and 
friends for the last weeks of his life 
air force officials refused even when congressmen and a white 
house aide were enlisted to help brody after the matter received 
publicity last week several volunteers offered to provide brodys 
flight home 
we had a lot of very wonderful people call giving us offers to 
travel mrs brody said but they just dont feel he can travel 
any more 
mrs brody said she contacted us sen john kerry dmass 
tuesday and told a staff member that she was no longer requesting 
air force help 
the air force said brody failed to meet criteria for a free ride 
courtesy of the government on several counts he is not a uniformed 
officer the flight would have no impact on his chances of 
survival and his illness was not caused by his defense department 
work 
we knew going in that this was unlikely to have a happy 
ending said brad pearson a client advocate for the 
massachusetts office of handicapped affairs who has been working 
on the brody case 
brody received several offers for free flights pearson said a 
new hampshire man who read about brodys plight contacted a state 
representative from brodys hometown of norwood mass and offered 
to fly brody home a californiabased company also offered a free 
flight while a virginiabased medical airlift service was contacted 
about raising funds for a flight 
mrs brody 26 said she did not know if her husbands condition 
might improve enough to make a flight possible brody has already 
outlasted the life expectation given by doctors by several months 
we had a lot of good samaritans calling and its nice to know 
that there are these kind of people in the world mrs brody said

receipt of income from public assistance

the justice department in us district court in conneticut the 
settlement ended a 4year ftc investigation 
the decree does not constitute an admission by ge capital of 
the alleged violation and was signed by the company to avoid 
protracted and expensive litigation said ge capital spokeswoman 
lisa van orden 
according to the ftc complaint a requirement by ge capital that 
persons applying for instant credit be employed full time 
discriminated against the elderly and divorced women

the senate easily approved president bushs 
nomination of a florida businessman to be ambassador to spain on 
tuesday but some democrats used the occasion to accuse bush of 
abusing diplomatic posts as political rewards 
the businessman 55yearold joseph zappala is one of several 
bush appointees who have become lightning rods for accusations that 
the administration is handing out ambassadorships to wealthy but 
unqualified campaign contributors however the senate confirmed 
him on a 7920 vote 
zappala a st petersburg fla real estate developer is not 
college educated has no foreign service experience and does not 
speak spanish he received an unqualified rating from the 
american academy of diplomacy a respected body which evaluates 
ambassadorial nominees 
but democrats are quick to point out that he also gave a 
reported 126000 to republican campaigns in recent years and 
actively raised money for bushs 1988 presidential bid 
the nominee has shown no interest in the people politics or 
history of spain said senate foreign relations committee 
chairman claiborne pell dri i am forced to conclude that the 
main reason for mr zappalas nomination was his fund raising 
and contributions 
sen paul sarbanes dmd a member of the foreign relations 
panel said bush has appointed an unusual number of such people 
to head embassies around the world he said of 58 ambassadorial 
nominations bush has sent to congress for confirmation 22 have 
been career foreign service officers and 36 have been political 
appointees 
to the world at large this says the united states is not 
serious about diplomacy sarbanes said during debate on the 
nomination monday no other major industrial nation appoints its 
nominees in this way 
in the case of spain sarbanes noted democracy is relatively 
new dating from the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 
recognizing the sensitivity of the position presidents since then 
have appointed only professional diplomats as us ambassadors to 
madrid he said 
but sen rudy boschwitz rminn defended the nominee saying 
his background is far broader than that of many senators 
zappalas resume shows he has been an active gop fundraiser and 
headed local charity and drugrehabilitation organizations he is 
a businessman who has branched out far beyond the community 
where he began boschwitz said 
and sen connie mack rfla argued that foreign governments 
often are glad to host an ambassador who while not a 
foreignpolicy expert is a close friend of the president there 
are some indications that the government of spain is pleased to 
have that kind of direct connection he said 
zappala barely survived the confirmation process in the senate 
foreign relations committee which voted 109 to send his name to 
the full senate an exasperated sarbanes then termed zappala a 
political throwaway and said bush might as well put the 
diplomatic posts up for public auction and use the money to defray 
the public debt

congress in its first review of the 
twomonthold savings and loan bailout is scrutinizing ethics 
rules written for the agency created to sell failed institutions 
the resolution trust corp created aug 9 when president bush 
signed the bailout legislation has gotten off to a fast start 
closing 24 small institutions of the 275 insolvent thrifts under 
its control in 33 states 
the agency is reviewing bids on five large institutions all 
with 1 billion or more in assets and hopes to dispose of them by 
the end of next week 
but members of the senate and house banking committees meeting 
wednesday will be probing to see if the fast start is creating 
growing pains and whether the agency is establishing procedures to 
prevent another hudtype scandal 
we want to be very sure there are safeguards in place against 
any kind of special interest activity that would use the side door 
the back door special relationships etc said sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich and the chairman of the senate banking 
committee 
the rtc last week issued an interim ethics code governing the 
thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to 
manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the 
thrifts 
david c cooke the agencys executive director said the rtc is 
trying to prevent improprieties but at the same time avoid defining 
conflict of interest so broadly that it is difficult to hire 
advisers and property managers 
its difficult cooke said in a recent interview many of 
the really big acknowledged experts have potential conflicts we 
need advice on how to sell real estate and the same contractors 
that would provide us advice are probably advising somebody 
else who may be interested in buying that real estate 
the code prohibits contractors from selfdealing favortism and 
conflicts of interest and sets up an agency board to rule on cases 
that arent black and white 
in another safeguard the management of the rtc is split in a 
unique arrangement designed to prevent abuse policies are 
formulated by a cabinetlevel board headed by treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady but the actual operations are being carried out 
by the federal deposit insurance corp the independent agency 
insuring bank and sampl deposits through a staff headed by cooke 
in the first few weeks of the rtcs existence that structure 
led to public squabbling between the fdic and the adminstration 
oversight board cooke said the tension was easing but members of 
congress are still concerned 
the one thing thats troubled me so far is the fighting 
between the fdic and the oversight board is that really 
resolved permanently or is it just quiescent said rep charles 
schumer dny a member of a house task force appointed to 
oversee the rtc 
however cooke said i think were working that out on 
day one theres a certain amount of tension because they may be 
thinking one thing and were thinking something entirely different 
time is making that better 
in its first two months of existence the rtc has spent 20 
billion 18 billion to close the 24 small sampls 83 billion to 
handle the five large institutions and several other 
notyetcompleted deals 85 billion to replace highcost 
deposits and 14 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity 
problems at failed but still open thrifts spokesman steve 
katsanos said tuesday

tens of thousands of people have begun 
arriving in the capital to petition congress and the bush 
administration to lift the homeless from the streets and make 
housing more affordable for all americans 
organizers remained coy tuesday as they have for months about 
the turnout they expect for three days of activities culminating in 
a housing now march saturday on the national mall 
but the breadth of their sponsorship coupled with a massive 
planning effort dating to early in the year could produce one of 
the largest demonstrations washington has seen in years 
were saying enough is enough said washington homeless 
activist mitch snyder today the streets in boston new york and 
washington look like those in calcutta this demonstration is to 
provide some will and some backbone to the administration and 
congress 
the march and related events including a lobbying siege of 
individual members of congress by an estimated 4000 people on 
thursday and friday is backed by more than 200 organizations 
including the aflcio the us conference of mayors the ymca the 
ywca the national urban league catholic charities usa the 
southern christian leadership conference and the national 
organization for women 
more than 200 show business personalities and dozens of state 
and local officials including gov richard celeste of ohio and 
mayor raymond l flynn of boston also have lent their support the 
hollywood contingent is led by actress valerie harper and actor jon 
voight 
snyder head of the community for creative nonviolence and 
barry zigas president of the national lowincome housing 
coalition are among the principal organizers of the march at a 
news conference tuesday zigas repeatedly declined to predict a 
turnout other than to say its going to be a major major 
event he said more than half the participants would actually be 
homeless people some of whom were walking from new york city and 
roanoke va huge caravans were en route meanwhile from los 
angeles chicago and other major cities along the way 
everybody who is not fabulously wealthy has reason to be 
here said snyder who in the past has waged hunger strikes to 
draw attention to the plight of the homeless we demand that 
congress put its hands back in its pockets and come up with the 25 
billion it cut from the housing budget back in 1981 
jack joyce head of the international union of bricklayers and 
allied craftsmen said there has been a paralysis of leadership 
on both ends of pennsylvania avenue on the housing problem housing 
for the homeless is the most obvious of concerns but ordinary 
people working people simply cannot afford housing today 
according to the us conference of mayors there are an 
estimated 3 million homeless people in the united states today 
though that figure has been repeatedly cited as gospel by march 
organizers and some members of congress it is widely disputed the 
liberal urban institute for example said in 1988 that the 
homeless numbered no more than 600000 
other estimates abound a recent report by the american 
affordable housing institute at rutgers university said the 
number of persons likely to be homeless on a given night vary from 
655000 to 4 million and it put the annual growth rate of 
homelessness and anywhere between 20 percent and 40 percent 
activists complain that the reaganbush administrations cut the 
budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77 
percent from 32 billion to less than 8 billion a year and 
cite that as the principal reason for the growing numbers of people 
who sleep in bus stations abandoned cars cardboard boxes or on 
heat grates 
but the department of housing and urban development says that 
while budget authority the spending limit was lowered actual 
spending increased almost 150 percent since 1978 still huds own 
figures indicate that at least 25 million americans spend more than 
half their income on housing currently one in four eligible poor 
renters actually receives federal help 
some conservatives including former president reagan have 
argued that many of the homeless are mentally disturbed people who 
are on the streets not for lack of government or private 
resources but because of recent court decisions which prohibit 
them from being institutionalized against their will 
but the rutgers study says that unlike the former stereotype 
of the bowery bum or the lone drifter todays homeless are 
substantially functioning adults and families with children they 
are a crosssection of our poverty population 
according to the child welfare league of america inc between 
500000 and 750000 children in the united states are homeless 
though all participating organizations have vowed their 
activities will be peaceful one of the more militant groups the 
national union of the homeless has threatened to evict hud 
officials from their offices on friday unless restitution is made 
to the housing budget by those responsible for the departments 
mismanagement scandal nuh leader leona smith declined to specify 
exactly what the group has in mind

leading experts on the potential for 
harnessing the energy that makes the sun and stars shine told 
congress tuesday the government should speed the pace of 
experiments that could produce a breakthrough in the next decade 
harold p furth director of the princeton plasma physics 
laboratory told a house panel that government leadership for the 
magnetic fusion program was floundering just as scientists neared 
the most important experimental stage in 40 years of work 
at the moment there is no schedule for beginning the next 
key experiments furth told the house science space and technology 
subcommittee on investigations 
he said that while the united states has the wherewithal to be a 
world leader in magnetic fusion research were suffering from 
some kind of psychological block that prevents the nation from 
making the necessary commitment 
the united states has spent 55 billion in taxpayers money 
over the last four decades in pursuit of magnetic fusion energy a 
selfsustaining reaction that releases energy when isotopes of 
hydrogen are heated to temperatures hotter than the suns core and 
then fused magnetic fields are used to confine the isotopes 
no one yet has proven the process to be commercially feasible 
but many believe it could be the major source of electricity 
generation by the middle of the 21st century as the nation seeks to 
lessen its dependence on fossil fuels 
the next big step in fusion research the experts told the house 
science space and technology subcommittee on investigations is 
building a compact ignition tokamak the worlds first device 
capable of producing a fusion reaction in which enough heat is 
generated to sustain the reaction without further heating by the 
machine 
the reagan administration had proposed that construction of the 
compact ignition tokamak start in 1992 but the energy department 
in recent months has indicated it wants to spend less on the 
machine and more on trying to determine beforehand whether it would 
work it has not set an official timetable for construction 
furth and other experts said building the 400 million machine 
was vitally important to the program even if the machines success 
could not be assured in advance 
david o overskei senior vice president of the fusion division 
of general atomics told the panel that achieving a selfsustaining 
magnetic fusion reaction was possible in the 1990s and will put 
us on the threshold of fusion energy production

stressing that companies must help right the 
ship of education the national alliance of business released a 
plan of action tuesday to improve schools so students can be 
prepared for the workforce 
nab president william kolberg said the corporate action agenda 
is the first set of reports and action plans to be released since 
president bush met with the nations governors last week in 
charlottesville va 
the goal is to provide immediate and direct answers to business 
people on how they must become involved now to initiate fundamental 
educational change 
kolberg added that key members of the alliance will be 
involved very much in helping to set the national performance 
goals recommended by bush and the governors at the summit 
alliance statistics showed that in 1950 only 574 percent of 
american students graduated from high school but those who failed 
to graduate could still find jobs and lead productive lives today 
some 75 percent of the students graduate but many are in no 
position to absorb education and training beyond the high school 
level 
by 1995 it is estimated that some 14 million americans will be 
unprepared for the jobs available the alliance said 
the corporate action agenda endorsed by education secretary 
lauro cavazos is comprised of four publications and a videotape 
one of the publications a blueprint for business on 
restructuring education outlines five major ways of using the 
experience of business in restructuring americas schools 
schoolbased management professionalism of teachers and 
administrators curriculum and instruction accountability and 
linking schools with social services 
the action plans also provide indepth information on new joint 
ventures and partnerships between businesses and school system and 
details on establishing communitywide collaborative schooltowork 
transition programs 
it is clear the business community has a major role to play in 
helping right the ship of education said kolberg pointing to 
the numerous years businesses have been involved in helping schools 
with much of this effort focused on tinkering at the margin 
kolberg said there are 140800 education partnerships 
nationwide 57 percent sponsored by businesses or business 
organizations yet few of the partnerships have effected 
fundamental educational change he said 
business must do more for our education system than simply 
paying for our athletic uniforms speaking in a classroom 
tutoring offering plant tours or showing up for career days 
said kolberg 
we are ready to work with others to make systemic changes in 
the education system both at the national state and local 
levels he said

the senate voted tuesday to cut off debate on 
longstalled legislation that would require creation of a 
commission to investigate the lengthy eastern airlines strike 
senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture getting 61 votes 
just one more than necessary to limit debate thirtysix senators 
voted against ending the filibuster by senate republicans 
the republicans had been backing president bushs refusal to 
appoint an emergency board under provisions of the railway labor 
act to probe the strike led by machinists which began march 4 
the action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up consideration 
of a measure mandating establishment of a threeperson commission 
to study the work stoppage and make recommendations for its 
solution 
there was no immediate indication when the senate would proceed 
to a vote on the bill under cloture rules no senator may talk for 
more than an hour after debate has been cut off this usually means 
there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate since 
it takes 60 senators in the 100member chamber to invoke cloture 
democrats had said last week that if they were successful in 
achieving a cutoff of debate they would then substitute 
unionbacked language for the housepassed bill creating a 
commission with one member each appointed by bush senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine and house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
i think in fairness we should invoke cloture sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio told colleagues before tuesdays vote i 
believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of eastern 
airlines 
since march republican members of the senate have used delaying 
tactics to block the chambers consideration of housepassed 
legislation requiring bush to appoint an emergency board the 
president has refused to create a board saying management and 
employees should resolve the problem 
but metzenbaum said it was time to force bushs hand 
it is now obvious that the president will not appoint an 
emergency board he said it is now obvious that unless 
congress takes action the president is content to do nothing 
while the families of 30000 eastern workers suffer 
five days after the machinists struck eastern joined by pilots 
and flight attendants the carrier filed for protection under the 
us bankruptcy act eastern has been continuing efforts to 
reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said it plans to 
emerge as a carrier twothirds its former size

the house bogged down with other legislation 
postponed for one day until wednesday its likely vote to repeal 
catastrophic health insurance for the nations elderly 
proponents of the program enacted a year ago in a rush of 
bipartisan fervor acknowledged tuesday that the best they could 
hope for was to salvage a sliver of the new benefits which marked 
the first major expansion of medicare in two decades 
since the program began legislators have been buffeted by 
criticism from elderly americans upset about the cost of the 
insurance 
the chamber had been expected to vote on repealing the program 
tuesday but scheduled debate on other legislation took so long 
that the vote was put off until wednesday 
even if the house votes to repeal the program its fate wont be 
known until later in the fall after negotiations with the senate 
which is expected to deal with the matter on its own later this 
week 
at stake were significant new hospital and doctorbill benefits 
for 33 million elderly and disabled americans covered by medicare 
many of the benefits do not take effect until january 
the cry for repeal came from three quarters 
retirees who complained their former employers were already 
giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase 
from medicare 
upper income retirees who objected to having to pay a 
disproportionate share of the costs in the form of an income tax 
surcharge to make up for a more modest assessment on the 
estimated 56 percent of medicare beneficiaries who dont have 
enough money to owe any income taxes 
those who complained that the program did not address the main 
need of elderly americans insurance for nursing home and other 
longterm care a benefit that many studies have said would be as 
much as 10 times as costly 
ironically house leaders said legislators painful experience 
with this run at a major expansion of acute care health protection 
probably would make them less inclined to pursue even more costly 
programs for the elderly in the future 
future programs are going to have to be more carefully 
considered house speaker thomas s foley told reporters shortly 
before debate was to have begun on the proposal to repeal 
catastrophic health insurance 
earlier foley had described a mood of frustration as 
settling over house health policy leaders 
indeed rep fortney stark dcalif a major force behind the 
catastrophic program said monday that i think they lawmakers 
feel theyd just like to get rid of this annoyance and they 
certainly are going to be very skeptical when i come to them in the 
future with a bill to help the senior citizens 
stark said catastrophic care supporters lost the information 
battle to groups that preyed on the fears of the elderly 
its very easy to take very fragile very insecure seniors who 
are easily confused and confuse them even further he said 
the income tax surcharge ranges up to 800 this year for 
medicareeligible people in upper income ranges the congressional 
budget office said about 6 percent of the 33 million people covered 
would be hit with the maximum 
most of the 15 million or so americans who would be subject to 
the surcharge at all would pay much less 15 per 150 of tax 
liability this year the additional cost for the majority of those 
covered by medicare 4 per month both the flat monthly premium 
and the surtax officially called a supplemental premium would 
increase in future years 
whoever won the information battle mentioned by stark there 
was no question that house members were inundated with mail urging 
them to repeal the program and almost none urging them to keep it 
rep steve gunderson rwis illustrated that in a brief speech 
explaining his intention to vote for repeal even before formal 
debate began he said he had received 2172 letters urging repeal 
and one supporting the program 
rep bill paxon rny said his office received 3807 letters 
urging repeal 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act was aimed at protecting 
the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a 
prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs 
the program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a 
onceayear deductible of 560 in 1989 previously medicare 
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year 
the plan also would limit starting jan 1 the amount that 
beneficiaries must pay for hospital care physician services 
medical supplies and prescription drugs and would expand other 
health care benefits as well

the first western united states case of a 
rare type of aids infection was diagnosed in a man who had sex with 
20 to 40 women here since 1979 but the risk to his lovers is 
fairly low doctors said tuesday 
the man who hasnt developed aids is definitely the first 
case i know of on the west coast of infection by hiv2 a 
relative of the aids virus which is rare in this country compared 
with the main aids virus hiv1 said dr thomas obrien an 
epidemiologist at the national centers for disease control 
until now only seven cases of hiv2 infection had been 
confirmed in the united states three in massachusetts and one 
each in connecticut rhode island florida and new jersey and 
three of the patients developed aids symptoms obrien said by 
phone from atlanta 
almost all the patients imported the virus from west africa 
where hiv2 is endemic 
of the west coast mans lovers weve identified one 
individual with whom he had multiple unprotected sexual contacts 
over a long period of time and that person has been tested and is 
not infected with this virus that is reassuring said dr peter 
kerndt los angeles countys director of aids epidemiology 
a second lover also is uninfected but officials expect to 
locate only two or three more of the 20 to 40 women with whom the 
man had sex since he moved here in 1979 from the west african 
nation of sierra leone kerndt said 
the infected los angeles resident is in his 30s works fulltime 
and attends school parttime officials withheld his identity he 
has refrained from sex since learning three months ago he might be 
infected with hiv2 said dr david ho aids virology laboratory 
director at cedarssinai medical center 
this man is a pretty decent person ho said hes had a 
couple of traceable contacts and they are negative aidsfree but 
he had multiple other nontraceable contacts onenight stands 
hes fully cooperative but he doesnt know these other women he 
had casual sex with 
a private doctor referred the man to cedarssinai for aids 
testing but he wasnt hospitalized ho said 
hiv2 or human immunodeficiency virus type 2 was first 
described in 1985 in west african prostitutes who had no symptoms 
then was reported in 1986 in two west africans who suffered aids 
obrien said 
hiv1 and hiv2 both can cripple the bodys ability to fight 
disease leading to fatal infections and cancers 
the question that remains is whether it hiv2 can lead to 
immunodeficiency as quickly or as often as hiv1 which has 
caused aids in more than 105000 americans killing some 61000 of 
them obrien said 
the infected los angeles man has very low levels of hiv2 in his 
blood so the risk of transmission in casual sexual contacts is 
very low kerndt said 
he said the man may have been infected before coming to the 
country in 1979 or during a visit home in 1983 
kerndt said the infected man never donated blood has not used 
drugs intravenously nor has he engaged in any homosexual 
activity 
so far the risk to the blood supply is considered low because 
blood bank guidelines prohibit blood donations by west africans 
and because the test used to detect blood infected with hiv1 can 
detect 85 percent to 90 percent of samples of blood infected with 
hiv2 kerndt said 
hiv2 and hiv1 are equally common in the ivory coast and hiv2 
may be more common in guinea bissau and perhaps senegal obrien 
said adding that hiv2 infection also has been reported in europe 
south america and other parts of africa

panamanian troops loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega recaptured military headquarters from rebel 
soldiers today after a sixhour battle and officials in washington 
and panama city agreed the coup was crushed 
the rebels failed to capture noriega in the coup attempt 
according to the reports 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the coup appeared to have failed 
the rebel troops claimed that they seized and held the defense 
forces headquarters in downtown panama city troops loyal to 
noriega climbed the roofs of surrounding buildings throwing hand 
grenades firing mortars and sniping at targets inside the compound 
noriega has defied us efforts to oust him for two years and 
survived a coup attempt in march 1988 he has been indicted on drug 
charges in the united states which accuses him of having ties to 
colombia drug traffickers 
the coup announcement was read over national radio at about 
1130 am it said the entire high command was forced into 
retirement by middleranking officers led by maj moises giraldi 
vega head of the urraca battalion in charge of security at defense 
forces headquarters 
the communique was signed by giraldi capt javier licona of the 
cavalry and capt jesus george balma of the special forces 
this is strictly a military movement there is no politics 
involved the communique said referring to the civilian 
opposition that has been trying to topple noriega with us help 
the communique did not say whether any members of the high 
command were in custody 
an hour later a man who identified himself as lt col arnulfo 
castrejon made a television broadcast saying that forces loyal to 
noriega were ready to give their lives to defend gen noriega 
this is a betrayal 
however nobody was visible on the screen as the broadcast was 
made the camera showed only a clock on a wall 
the communique said noriega and six top colonels were being 
retired because they had been on active service for more than 
25 years and exceeded the deadline for mandatory retirement 
jose blandon a panamanian defector and former close aide to 
noriega said in washington that he had spoken by telephone with 
balma one of the leaders of the coup who told him that noriega 
had been wounded and was in custody 
he said officers intended to send noriega to the united states 
to face drug charges but that it would be difficult to do so 
because other officers in the defense forces also were involved in 
the drug trade 
blandon said the coup had been timed for a moment when many 
troops loyal to noriega were outside of panama participating in an 
island training exercise 
at the united nations panamas provisional president accused 
the united states of undermining his nation with financial 
terrorism economic blackmail and political interference 
the government today has had to control a new attempt at 
subversion frustrated by the will of our people and our armed 
forces president francisco rodriguez told the general assembly 
president bush denied that the united states was involved in the 
operation 
nobodys sure whats happening there the president told 
reporters at the white house there were rumors around that this 
was some american operation and i can tell you that is not true 
but bush implying his endorsement to oust noriega added we 
have no argument with the panamanian defense forces we have no 
argument with them 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he was unable to 
confirm that noriega had been ousted he said the united states had 
advance word of the uprising 
one us administration official said the white house was not 
convinced noriega had been toppled although that was possible 
weve got conflicting reports the official said speaking 
on condition of anonymity there have been conflicting reports 
about how successful its been 
in washington former panamanian ambassador juan b sosa an 
antinoriega activist said before the radio announcement that the 
shooting was part of a coup attempt carried out by dissidents 
within the defense forces 
sosa said there has been discontent among some officers who were 
passed over in recent promotions and who were dissatisfied for 
other reasons 
its been building over the past few days he said 
there was no confirmation of casualties but neighbors of the 
headquarters in panama city told the associated press there were 
dead and wounded 
the us southern command put its troops and civilians on delta 
alert its highest level of readiness 
us troops in combat gear took up positions only 600 yards from 
the barracks which is in downtown panama city near the canal the 
us southern command has installations at fort amador and quarry 
heights less than a mile from the barracks the pentagon said no 
us troops were involved in shooting 
a us military jet and helicopter gunships were seen in the 
area but apparently were only observing the action and did not 
participate 
shooting began with a few bursts of fire shortly around 7 am 
8 am edt and was continuing more than three hours later 
neighbors who insisted on not being identified said they heard 
small arms being fired and bursts of automatic weapons 
neighbors and reporters saw three ambulances leave the 
headquarters compound 
journalists were kept more than 100 yards away by police backed 
by panamanian armored personnel carriers and watercannon trucks 
vehicle traffic to the headquarters compound was also blocked by 
the military 
armed men in civilian clothes surrounded the department of 
national investigations panamas political police located about 
500 yards from the headquarters 
in washington the pentagon said gunfire had been heard by 
forces at the southern command and americans were told to avoid 
dangerous areas 
there are about 12000 us troops stationed in panama many of 
them within five miles of panama city all us civilian dependents 
were moved onto us military installations as of july 1 in the 
wake of violence that followed panamanian elections held on may 7 
noriega panamas de facto leader assumed command of the 
military in 1983 the united states has been trying to oust noriega 
since he was indicted on us drug charges in february 1988 
noriega says the drug charges are part of a us plot to abrogate 
the panama canal treaties and retain control of the canal at the 
end of the century 
us efforts to oust noriega have focused on encouraging the 
civilian opposition and on attempting to undercut his support in 
the military encouraging members of the defense forces to ask him 
to leave or oust him by force 
efforts by the united states to remove him including economic 
sanctions against panama have failed

police misconduct is likely to increase if the 
supreme court creates a new loophole in the rule barring unlawfully 
obtained evidence from criminal trials a chicago lawyer warned 
tuesday 
expansion of the use of unlawfully obtained evidence is a 
major step the court should not take at this time said martin 
carlson arguing in behalf of a young convicted murderer before the 
supreme court it would add significant incentive to police to 
violate protected rights he contended 
but terence madsen an assistant attorney general for illinois 
said the justices would enhance the truthseeking process of 
criminal trials nationwide if allowing such an expansion 
the states arguments are supported in a friendofthecourt 
brief submitted by the bush administration 
at issue in the case to be decided by july is whether 
statements a criminal defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may 
be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness trial 
testimony 
the socalled exclusionary rule created by the supreme 
court nearly 75 years ago generally prohibits the use at trial of 
any illegally obtained evidence 
the high court later carved out an exception to the rule by 
allowing prosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a 
defendants own trial testimony but the justices never have said 
such evidence may be used to rebut or discredit other witnesses 
testimony 
the illinois supreme court by a 43 vote allowed such evidence 
to be introduced at the trial of darryl james sentenced to 30 
years in prison for a 1982 murder 
james was 15 when arrested in his mothers beauty parlor for a 
pair of aug 30 1982 shootings he was tried as an adult 
prosecutors said james shot and killed geliria boyd and wounded 
another youth in a latenight confrontation on a south chicago 
street 
several prosecution witnesses identified james as the 
triggerman and testified that on the night of the crime he had 
long reddishbrown hair 
at his trial james had short black hair 
james did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in his 
behalf one said that james had short black hair the night of the 
shootings 
prosecutors then won the judges permission to let a police 
detective testify that james when arrested said he had long 
reddishbrown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hair 
dyed and cut at his mothers shop 
the trial judge previously had disallowed such testimony ruling 
that james arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not 
have a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing 
a crime 
madsen the states lawyer was questioned rigorously by justice 
john paul stevens the courts only illinois native 
if unlawfully obtained evidence can be used by prosecutors any 
time a defendant mounts any kind of defense stevens suggested 
police would have every incentive to bend the rules 
police departments around the country would alter their 
procedures to make sure such evidence is obtained stevens said 
but madsen disagreed saying its not correct to presume that 
the police would not do it right 
the case is james vs illinois 886075

a member of the senate armed services 
committee said tuesday he was outraged to find marine recruits at 
parris island sc using the slogan kill rape pillage burn 
during basic training 
sen john mccain rariz a heavily decorated retired navy 
captain and exprisoner of war said the marines ought to be 
ashamed he has asked the commandant of the corps to investigate 
mccains reaction stemmed from a photograph sent to him by the 
parents of a man who graduated in august from the marine corps 
recruit depot at parris island 
the 8x10 color photograph was a formal platoon graduation 
picture showing the recruits standing at attention on risers with 
the officers who trained them n the foreground 
eight of the men held four handpainted signs bearing pictures 
and slogans which one of the recruits said were used as signs for 
the men to march behind during training 
one showed a naked woman another had a skull and crossbones 
with the words kill rape pillage burn 
i was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like 
this mccain who was a prisoner of war in north vietnam for 5 
years said in an interview with the associated press 
its outrageous he said 
capt jr mill public affairs officer at parris island said 
the signs were done in bad taste which represents neither the 
policy nor the philosophy of this command or the united states 
marine corps and we are taking corrective action concerning this 
situation 
mill said that the sign was made under the supervision and 
approval of a drill instructor but that this is not a normal 
occurrence and i would consider this isolated incident 
mccain said the blame lay with the officers 
it shows a lack of supervision he said we are paying 
those officers with taxpayers dollars we want them to be 
honorable fighting men 
the senator in a letter sent monday to the marine commandant 
gen alfred gray said the signs violate the values which 
americans expect their marines to carry with them in defense of the 
nation 
while platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale 
in the boot camp environment the high standards of the marine 
corps demands a philosophy a set of values a dedication and a 
resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply 
incompatible mccain wrote 
he asked gray to look into the incident and ensure that the 
commanders of the the platoon in the photograph understand and 
embrace proper marine corps values 
mccain also asked gray to make sure that the recruits in the 
photograph were contacted and that they understand why this type 
of conduct is inconsistent with the marine corps values and 
tradition

the communists decided tuesday to hold a 
congress in january which could be their last because a poll of 
members indicates 72 percent want the party completely reorganized 
and given a new name 
the eleventh party congress was scheduled for jan 27 by a 
resolution accepted at a oneday meeting of the central committee 
the committee also called for congress delegates to be elected 
under new democratic rules 
the party officially called the polish united workers party 
was established in its current form in 1948 
after crushing election losses this year party leaders seem 
determined to rename the party and create a broader leftist 
political organization that would include socialists and social 
democrats 
people from under different shades of the red banner should 
be able to find their place in it party secretary leszek 
miller told the committee tuesday the party should become open 
to reality and to the challenges that the future brings he said 
tomasz nalec who represents a reformist club within the party 
said the full party meeting should be considered the founding 
congress of a new party of democratic socialism 
seventytwo percent of party members polled over the past month 
favor changing the partys name charter and program according to 
partial results announced at the plenums opening the survey 
involved more than 11 million of the 21 million party members 
officials of the party seeking to recast its identity since 
overwhelming losses to solidarity in junes firstever democratic 
parliamentary elections say it must change to survive 
politburo member marian orzechowski has said the party should 
rename itself the polish socialist party of the working people 
the key changes are to be made at the congress expected to be 
made up of 1000 to 2000 elected delegates under the leadership of 
first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski 
a communist official who briefed reporters before the plenum on 
condition of anonymity also said another shakeup in the partys 
ruling politburo was expected it would be the second since july 
miller discussing preparations for the congress at the plenum 
said the party planned open competitive election campaigns for 
congress delegates in order to get the public interested in the 
partys affairs 
the party is inviting society to create the party with us 
he said and the party must strive to find an identity which will 
give it a popular base 
the question is whether the polish united workers party can 
fulfill the aspirations of the part of polish society which is 
leftleaning he said 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza reported tuesday 
that the draft plenums resolution favored a multisector economy 
dominated by development of the staterun economy the draft 
opposed privatizing and selling off state enterprises a chief 
economic goal of the solidarityled government the newspaper said 
the draft also obliges all party cells to create conditions 
for free expression of different views the newspaper said

a community of interest between 
government and the news media often limits war coverage a 
historian who has studied vietnam war reporting told newspaper 
editors tuesday 
military historian william hammond has stirred controversy with 
his book the military and the media by contending that 
overall news accounts of the vietnam war gave a better picture of 
that conflict than did official reports 
but he says the news media passed over some major stories 
the media is much less an outsider from the government than 
perhaps it might think hammond told the annual convention of 
the associated press managing editors theres a tremendous 
interplay between the government and the media not only do 
individuals constantly go from the media into government or from 
the government into media but there is a community of interest 
here 
hammond a historian at the army center of military history in 
washington said reporters operated with selfimposed limitations 
in reporting the vietnam war to avoid burning bridges with 
military authorities 
hes going to have to be back over there again dealing with 
them to get some more news he said 
nonetheless hammond said news accounts sometimes informed 
senior military commanders of what actually was happening in the 
war 
sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the 
last one to find out anything he said 
news coverage often prompted a change in tactics that benefited 
the war effort he said 
in this case media coverage actually extended the vision of 
the commander and he was able to make a response that was very 
important to the overall goal of the american military in vietnam 
but major stories that would have bruised the armys image went 
largely unreported including the persistent problems of the m16 
the primary infantry weapon used in the war he said 
far from assisting in the war that lack of reporting may have 
damaged the military effort because there was no call for changes 
to the m16 hammond said 
the press in vietnam did not pick up the story with any 
consistency he said what happened the military never had any 
kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon 
the apme comprises news executives of the member newspapers of 
the associated press the newsgathering cooperative

a dancer who claimed she was actor william 
hurts commonlaw wife and entitled to half his money could not 
consider their relationship a marriage because living together is 
not the same thing a judge ruled tuesday 
state supreme court justice jacqueline silbermann ruled that 
although sandra jennings lived with hurt and had a child with him 
a marriage did not exist even during the time they were in south 
carolina which recognizes commonlaw marriage 
absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married an agreement 
to marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties were 
living together silbermann wrote the contrary is true 
she also said the relationship was illicit when it began because 
hurt was married and did not become legitimate simply because he 
got divorced 
the 14page decision did not deal with financial support for 
jennings and the couples 6yearold son alexander devon hurt 
hurt currently pays 60000 to 65000 a year to jennings and the 
boy before the trial he refused to increase the amount and 
jennings petitioned for 16000 a month which silbermann rejected 
i am thankful for the ruling received today which is a 
vindication of everything i have said hurt said in a statement 
issued by his publicist 
i felt that i simply could not continually give in to the 
pressures that have been constantly put on me for more and more 
money and other accommodations from sandra jennings and others 
the statement said 
jennings lawyer said he would appeal the ruling because he felt 
the judge was madly in love with hurt 
let five judges who are all men decide this not one woman who 
is impressed by a movie star a richard golub said in new york 
the state supreme court is a triallevel court 
silbermann is so madly in love with this defendant bill hurt 
that we never could have gotten a fair shake all her rulings came 
down that way if we had won i would have been shocked he said 
jennings met hurt in saratoga ny in the summer of 1981 when 
he was 31 and a rising star and she was a 24yearold ballerina 
with the new york city ballet although she knew he was still 
married to actress mary beth hurt jennings began living with hurt 
they had a child less than a year later 
jennings based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she spent 
with hurt in beaufort sc during the winter of 198283 while he 
was there filming the big chill 
some of hurts other movies include body heat children of 
a lesser god kiss of the spider woman broadcast news 
and the accidental tourist he won an oscar in 1986 for

many of the reforms jack kemp proposed tuesday 
for the department of housing and urban development were suggested 
to congress more than five years ago by the general accounting 
office but fell on deaf ears 
lawmakers are listening now 
report after report of scandal and mismanagement at the 
department during the reagan administration have made hud big news 
creating an impetus for reform and giving new housing secretary 
kemp a highprofile platform from which to promote his housing 
initiatives 
still the democraticcontrolled congress is unlikely to accept 
all of kemps ideas and almost certain to use tales of huge fees 
paid to republican consultants to try to pressure kemp and the bush 
administration to back up their outrage over the scandals with more 
money to house the victims of the mismanagement 
kemp was quick tuesday to credit congress for many of his 
recommendations and hail the bipartisan spirit with which lawmakers 
have been investigating past abuses he was equally quick to assess 
the political impact of the problems believed to have cost the 
government more than 6 billion 
this problem has turned out to be i believe and will turn 
out to be a blessing in disguise because its giving us an 
opportunity to get back on the right track kemp told reporters 
theres no disagreement on that point but there are myriad 
views on just what the right track should be 
for example kemp proposed eliminating the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program many in congress support the program and 
were successful in fighting back repeated efforts by reagan to kill 
it 
this year has brought reports of widespread influence peddling 
in the program allowing millions of dollars to be steered to 
former hud officials and developers who hired gop constultants 
but many prominent democrats still believe that the program is 
the best way to rehabilitate housing for lowincome families and 
the elderly and think that restrictions on lobbying and a 
competitive financing process would end the abuses many of those 
same democrats also suspect the administration will use the 
scandals to shrink or eliminate other hud programs congress favors 
its extremely important we do not allow the scandal during 
the previous administration the mismanagement the lost billions 
to drive us into giving up the goal which is to provide 
affordable safe healthy reasonable housing for tens of millions 
of american families said rep thomas lantos dcalif and the 
chairman of the house subcommittee investigating hud 
ideological fights over housing programs will no doubt continue 
and probably will block any major redirection of housing policy in 
the short term 
but the scandals kemps blessing in disguise and his 
involving congress in the drafting of his reform package likely 
will prevent fights over the management aspects of kemps plan so 
big that they must be settled in congress

the house approved legislation tuesday that 
will allow continuned logging of the oldgrowth forests in the 
pacific northwest while at the same time imposing protections for 
the spotted owl 
the legislation was part of the interior appropriations bill for 
the fiscal year that began sunday which was approved by the house 
on a 38141 vote final approval by the senate is expected this 
week 
the action came over the objections of rep bob smith rore 
who said congress was caving into the demands of radical 
environmentalists and the legislation would result in a 
substantial and grevious reduction in timber harvest 
this is beyond compromise this is surrender said smith 
smith said the legislation would do little to end the litigation 
that has tied up timber sales in the regions federal forests and 
would cost thousands of jobs 
but in a series of heated exchanges with smith democratic reps 
les aucoin of oregon and norm dicks of washington state defended 
the compromise legislation 
i regret my colleague from oregon finds fault with this 
compromise said aucoin i find fault but you cant sit on a 
porch and call it surrender 
aucoin said the legislation would save roughly 11000 jobs in 
the northwest threatened by current court injunctions barring 
logging in oldgrowth forests which provide prime nesting habitat 
for the owl 
i understand the gentlemans frustration said dicks but 
sometimes in the political process you have to deal with what is 
practical and doable 
dicks and aucoin said that more than 100 house members had 
expressed opposition to a senatepassed timber plan which would 
have drastically curbed the power of the federal courts to halt 
timber sales and had vowed to oppose any effort to pass it in the 
house smith had supported the senate plan 
i supported the senate amendment too but it wasnt going to 
pass said aucoin its better to save 11000 jobs then get 
mowed down in a ball of flame 
but smith wasnt about to back down 
i always thought a majority around here was 218 votes and 
not 100 said smith radical environmentalists have 
percipitated a threering circus in the forests the congress and 
the courts 
the compromise legislation which has the reluctant support of 
many industry and environmental groups will allow 96 billion 
board feet of timber to be sold in the regions federal forest 
during the new fiscal year 
it also imposes strict deadlines on the corts for resolving 
appeals of individual timber sales requires that about half the 
sales currently enjoined be released and requires that federal 
agencies minimize fragmentation of environmentally significant 
oldgrowth forest stands 
the fish and wildlife service is trying to decide whether to 
list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species such a 
listing would require federal agencies including the major 
timberselling agencies the forest service and the bureau of land 
management to avoid actions that would destroy habitat 
biologists say the owl lives almost exclusively in the 
oldgrowth forests of the pacific northwest with each nesting pair 
requiring a large amount of undisturbed forest

an official of the un monitoring 
force said tuesday the demobilization of a controversial police 
unit over the weekend was not conducted properly and must be done 
again 
fred eckhard chief spokesman for the multinational force said 
procedures used by territorial police to demobilize the former 
koevoet counterinsurgency unit saturday were not at all 
satisfactory 
eckhard said only 900 of koevoets estimated 1200 former 
members showed up for the demobilization at a northern police base 
and no steps were taken to identify them or ascertain the 
whereabouts of their weapons 
since arriving in april to monitor namibias transition to 
independence un officials have sought to deactivate all police 
who served with koevoet which means crowbar in afrikaans during 
a 23year war between south africanled security forces and 
proindependence guerrillas 
the unit made up of black namibians commanded by white 
officers was accused of atrocities during the war and of harassing 
guerrilla supporters since april when its members were integrated 
into the regular police force 
gerhard roux spokesman for the territorial administrator 
installed by south africa louis pienaar said police would try to 
trace the remaining 300 exkoevoet members and serve them with 
demobilization papers he said there would be no further 
demobilization ceremonies and added that the units weapons were 
stored securely at okave police base 
unsupervised elections are scheduled for nov 711 to elect 
an assembly to draft a constitution for an independent namibia the 
southwest africa peoples organization which waged the guerrilla 
war is favored to get the most votes but needs a twothirds 
majority to have full control of the assembly 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i in violation 
of un resolutions since 1966 last year it agreed last year to 
grant independence as part of a regional treaty that also included 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola namibias northern neighbor

a top state department official said tuesday 
that sanctions against south africa which the reagan 
administration had opposed had played a role in moderating the 
apartheid policies of that nations government 
the official also left open the possibility of further us 
economic sanctions against the whiteruled government an option 
the reagan administration refused even to consider 
sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinking 
within the white power structure said herman j cohen assistant 
secretary of state for aftican affairs in an admission never made 
by officials of the previous administration 
it is now increasingly clear to that government that the well 
being of the white minority cannot be sustained without a 
negotiated political settlement that results in political equality 
for all south africans cohen said 
i cannot imagine your predecessor in the reagan 
administration making that statement said sen paul simon 
dill chairman of the senate foreign relations subcomittee on 
africa applauding the formulation as a shift in position 
cohen said that while he wouldnt characterize the bush 
administrations position as a change the white house does 
recognize that without positive steps to dismantle south africas 
system of racial apartheid pressures will build for more 
sanctions 
it becomes clear he said that we cannot wait indefinitely 
however cohen discouraged calls for stiffer measures saying 
the administration by far prefers a course of negotiations not 
punitive sanctions 
cohens testimony coincided with the state departments release 
of a congressionally mandated report to determine the impact of 
sanctions imposed by the united states in 1986 and to evaluate 
whether additional measures are necessary 
while asserting that the 1986 sanctions have not succeeded in 
abolishing apartheid the report said there is some reason for 
hope that the opportunity for a peaceful end to apartheid has not 
yet been lost 
the study said further sanctions are not needed at this time 
and would be counterproductive in view of steps being taken within 
south africa and the region to bring about change through peaceful 
means 
the report concluded additional sanctions mandated by congress 
have not to date been successful in moving the south african 
government toward the goals that are shared by the 
administration and congress 
cohen said the administration is committed to effectively 
enforcing the existing sanctions in the hope and expectation that 
positive signs of a commitment to change will appear in the near 
future 
cohens appearance represented the first administration 
testimony on south africa since the inauguration of the government 
of president f w de klerk who campaigned for the office on a 
moderate platform 
for the first time in years it is possible to be somewhat 
hopeful that a negotiation scenario may be just beyond the 
horizon cohen said adding that south africa appears to be 
entering a period of talking about talks 
external and internal pressures are helping convince the south 
african government that it must move beyond its current position 
and accept fundamental change he said 
in fact the new de klerk government has indicated it is 
prepared to take concrete steps to address this need 
for this reason the administration recommends that no new 
sanctions be considered at the present time he said 
during the reagan administration the democratic majority in 
congress engaged in fierce battles with the white house over south 
african policy battles which resulted in the passage of 
comprehensive economic sanctions in 1986 
cohen said that south africa was quickly identified by secretary 
of state james a baker iii as an area where the breakdown of 
bipartisan support undercut the ability of the united states to 
encourage a peaceful transition to democracy 
we want to be able to send a a clear signal of broad 
bipartisan support for a policy premised on unequivocal abhorrence 
of apartheid reflected in a sustained us commitment to promoting 
negotiations btween the government of in pretoria and legitimate 
black representatives leading to a nonracial and democratic south 
africa cohen said 
another witness sen edward m kennedy dmass complained 
however that the bush administration is engaged in unacceptable 
foot dragging on south africa 
we should make clear we are prepared to impose additional us 
sanctions against south africa if there is no progress 
kennedy said suggesting that leverage might be found in 
negotiations set for next year to restructured 9 billion in south 
african debt to us banks

a group demanding the release of a 
palestinian wanted on terrorism charges in the united states 
occupied the justice ministry for eight hours tuesday 
about 20 members of the movement for the defense of social and 
political rights who entered the ministry at 1150 am left 
after justice minister fotis kouvelis promised them positive 
developments in the case of mohammed rashid 
the interim conservativeleftist government has said decisions 
on extradition and other foreign policy matters would be left to 
the administration formed after elections scheduled for nov 5 
rashid 35 is accused in the bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over 
hawaii in 1982 which killed a japanese teenager and wounded 15 
people 
extradition has been approved by the supreme court but the 
final decision rests with the justice minister 
conservative premier tzannis tzannetakis government is 
scheduled to resign friday and be replaced by a cabinet that will 
run the country during the period leading up to and during the 
elections 
kouvelis condemned the sitin saying the protesters had chosen 
to show their support for rashid in the worst way he said 
violence would not be used to eject them 
rashid has been in custody in greece since his arrest in may 
1988 he first served a fivemonth prison term for trying to enter 
the country with a false syrian passport and in march was sentenced 
to eight more months after homemade knives were discovered in his 
cell

president bush signed legislation tuesday 
making a national historic site of the st louis county mo 
estate where ulysses s grant and his wife lived before the civil 
war 
bush also signed a separate bill paving the way for the 
acquisition of three additional houses adjacent to harry s 
trumans home in independence mo which is already a national 
historic site 
the 965acre grant estate called white haven was the home of 
grants wife julia the grants lived there from 1854 to 1860 and 
owned the estate until grants death in 1885 
grant led the union troops in the civil war and became the 18th 
president in 1869 
the grants lived together at white haven during the crucial 
precivil war years it was during this time that grants strength 
of character was developed through economic adversity bush said 
in a statement 
grant developed then such traits as a relentless pursuit of 
success and a determination to move ahead despite temporary 
setbacks that later served him well both as an incomparable 
military leader and in the white house bush said 
while saying white haven will be a worthy addition to the 
national park system bush expressed chagrin that congress passed 
it without first waiting for a formal study as the interior 
department had recommended 
bush said that in the future completion of a formal study 
should be a prerequisite for establishment of any new unit of the 
national park system 
such studies enable the national park service to examine the 
suitability feasibility and alternatives for managing proposed new 
park units the president said 
white haven is in what are now the suburbs of st louis the 
county of st louis acquired the home after a civic campaign was 
launched in 1985 to save the grant estate 
while the legislation sponsored by house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo and others stipulates that the estate 
will be donated to the government as a historic site it allows the 
government to acquire other grant artifacts by either donation or 
purchase 
it also authorizes the interior department to spend up to 1 
million restoring the estate and estimates the annual operating 
budget and upkeep at 400000 
the separate truman legislation authorizes the government to 
spend 250000 acquiring three houses in independence adjacent to 
the truman home giving the current owners the right of tenancy for 
25 years or until death whichever is later 
administration officials estimated it will cost 75000 to 
repair and convert a vacant house into a visitors center with an 
annual operating cost of 15000 the measure was sponsored by rep 
alan wheat dmo and others 
truman the 33rd president died in 1972

ten artists who want to display works featuring 
the us flag are being sued by the city which wants to test a new 
statute outlawing flag desecration lawyers said tuesday 
these artists each have done works that depict the flag 
said gwen osborne spokeswoman for the american civil liberties 
union in chicago 
needless to say curators and galleries were hesitant to 
display them osborne whose organization is representing the 
artists 
the lawsuit filed monday in cook county circuit court was 
moved to the court of us district judge george m marovich after 
the aclu said the case raised questions of constitutionality 
even though the artists are named as defendants essentially 
we are asking the judge to make a decision as to whether the flag 
ordinance is constitutional and can be enforced said connie 
busceni spokeswoman for the office of the citys corporation 
counsel 
if it is well decide what we want to do then regarding 
prosecuting the artists for their displays she said 
the artists sculptures paintings and collages are part of a 
twomonth exhibit probing censorship of the arts the artists could 
not be reached immediately for comment 
the multimedia exhibit called inalienable rights alienable 
wrongs also features poetry readings and film bookstores 
galleries and theaters are showing segments of the exhibit from 
sept 15 through nov 15 said harvey grossman the aclus legal 
director 
galleries fearing prosecution have refused to display the 
segment focusing on the us flag he said 
these artists and curators must be able to exhibit their works 
without the threat of arrest seizure of their art and meritless 
prosecutions grossman said 
the aclu sent a letter sept 25 to the citys attorneys and the 
police chief on behalf of the 10 artists who believed they might 
be arrested if their flagrelated works were shown 
instead of responding directly grossman said the city filed 
the lawsuit to seek clarification of the ordinance passed march 16 
the measure was prompted by the controversy that erupted when 
student artist dread scott tyler placed a flag on the floor for 
his piece what is the proper way to display a us flag the 
work was part of a student exhibit at the school of the art 
institute of chicago 
scotts work outraged many veterans and others thousands 
marched and demonstrated at the museum demanding removal of the 
work 
the city council then passed the ordinance barring the display 
of us flags on the floor or of flags that have been marked or 
have items attached to them it also prohibits reproducing the flag 
on merchandise or containers 
the aclu said the law is vague and the wording makes it unclear 
what type of artwork would be in violation of the ordinance 
tyler one of the artists named in the suit does not have a 
listed telephone and could not be reached through an artists group 
with which he is affiliated

sperm banks in the state can no longer 
accept gay men and intravenous drug users as donors because of new 
state health regulations prompted by fears about aids officials 
said tuesday 
for the first time sperm banks must get a state license and 
must subject all donors to at least two aids tests before their 
sperm is used said mary anne gardineer an associate director of 
the new york state health department 
women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not 
be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal 
illnesses she said 
the regulations took effect monday and automatically exclude a 
person from donating sperm if he has had homosexual activity 
intravenous drug use or sex since 1977 with a person at high risk 
for the aids virus 
the same people already are barred from donating blood in the 
state for the same reason gardineer said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta have no 
documented cases of aids being transmitted through sperm donors 
said a spokesman chuck fallis 
gardineer said australia had one case eight women who received 
sperm from the same donor who tested positive for the aids virus 
four of the women later tested positive for the virus but three of 
their babies born through artificial insemination were healthy 
gardineer said the fourth pregnancy never came to term 
new york state has about onequarter of the nations aids cases 
with 25000 confirmed cases 
geoffrey knox a spokesman for the gay mens health crisis said 
he had no problem with the sperm bank prohibition against gay men 
we have the same goal in mind which is having a safe sperm 
bank knox said 
the new state rules forbid the release of a sperm donors name 
and address except in cases where the man specifically gives his 
consent 
gardineer said she could not be sure how many sperm banks the 
state has because they have never been licensed before 
the regulations dont apply in cases where a person is donating 
sperm for a specific person such as his wife

with cbs news president david burke a representative of cbs news 
said 
however the cbs representative declined comment when asked 
whether burke and cameraman mike hoover discussed the accusations 
against hoover or whether another meeting has been scheduled 
the new york post reported claims last wednesday that footage 
broadcast by cbs in 1984 was fake that hoover had staged scenes 
of guerrilla sabotage and had made a pakistani jet fighter on a 
training run appear to be a soviet plane bombing afghan villages 
as a freelancer hoover sold the film to cbs news which he 
said had approved his proposals for trips inside afghanistan to 
film the war there some of his footage also was used in a 1987 
cbs reports documentary the battle for afghanistan 
the post reported earlier tuesday that hoover had flown in from 
new zealand for the cbs interview and would be accompanied by an 
attorney at the meeting

was that it is the goal of cbs news in every instance to gather 
and report the news accurately fairly and with integrity in the 
case of the afghan war we believe we have done so

lebanese legislators considered a 
proposal tuesday to expand the 99seat parliament giving moslems 
more representation under a new constitution aimed at ending the 
long sectarian civil war 
they also examined ways of increasing the powers of the prime 
minister traditionally a sunni moslem lebanese sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
sixtythree of parliaments 73 surviving deputies have been 
meeting in taif since saturday in a session removed from lebanon 
because of a battle that began in march between christians and a 
moslem alliance led by syrian troops 
at the united nations in new york syrian foreign minister 
farouk alshara said his country would not withdraw its 40000 
soldiers and claimed the military presence guarantees some 
stability in lebanon 
in the general assembly he said syria would help a lebanese 
government of national reconciliation to extend its authority all 
over the lebanese territory motivated by the special 
syrianlebanese relationship 
in tehran iran leaders of the two main moslem militia factions 
in lebanon druse chieftain walid jumblatt and nabih berri head of 
the shiite militia amal conferred with irans spiritual leader 
ayatollah ali khamenei 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said khamenei told them 
lebanon is an islamic country and control must be wrenched out 
of maronite christian hands 
the trip to tehran by jumblatt and berri prompted fears among 
some legislators that iran would try to undermine their peace 
efforts 
a new charter they are considering would give the cabinet the 
power to veto presidential decisions the authority of the 
president himself a christian under lebanons 46yearold 
unwritten national covenant would otherwise remain untouched 
christians have dominated the government army and judiciary 
since lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 they were 
considered to be the majority in 1943 but moslems now are 
estimated to account for 55 percent of the 4 million people 
conference sources said the legislators were moving toward 
balancing and overlapping powers of the president prime 
minister and the parliament speaker who traditionally is a shiite 
moslem 
the draft charter was put forth by an arab league committee of 
saudi arabia algeria and morocco which has a mandate to settle 
the 14yearold civil war by the end of november 
sources said the draft would increase the number of deputies in 
the unicameral parliament to from 99 to 128 but many legislators 
appeared to favor adding only nine seats all for moslems 
ten days ago the arab committee succeeded in halting six months 
of bloody duels between christian army units under gen michel aoun 
and syrian troops 
syria sent troops into lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate 
from the arab league 
christians want the syrian soldiers removed describing them as 
an occupation force rather than peacekeepers 
the legislators are expected to formulate the charter while in 
taif but leave its ratification for another session tentatively 
planned for oct21 in beirut

theres a possibility us forces will have to 
withdraw from their four major bases in greece next year a state 
department official said tuesday 
negotiations on continued use of the bases are expected to 
resume after elections and formation of a new greek government in 
november 
once the talks restart i dont think anyone can rule out that 
the negotiations might be unsuccessful assistant secretary of 
state raymond g h seitz told a house subcommittee on europe and 
the middle east 
i think were close to agreement seitz said describing the 
situation at the last session of the negotiations in may but there 
are many uncertainties he indicated in answering a battery of 
questions 
he said the united states expects to resume negotiations but 
we dont know what kind of government will be elected or what 
its mandate will be 
the answer is yes seitz answered with evident hesitation to 
the question of whether there was any contingency planning for 
dismantling of the bases by greeces may 1990 deadline for a new 
agreement 
greeces interim government said in july the installations must 
be dismantled by then if a new pact is not concluded 
a fiveyear agreement signed by the former socialist government 
expired last year and the 1990 deadline was fixed for removal of 
the bases in absence of new arrangements 
the current governing coalition of conservatives and leftists 
has said it will avoid national issues including the bases matter 
until after the election it was formed after the june 18 vote 
failed to give any simgle party a majority in the 300member 
onechamber parliament the interim government has said it will 
deal mainly with scandals surrounding officials of the defeated 
administration of prime minister andreas papandreou 
two of the us bases are on the aegean island of crete where 
the navys 6th fleet refuels and the air force maintains a 
communications station the navy has a listening post near athens 
and the air force has a support group at hellenikon outside athens

a lawmaker introduced a measure tuesday 
that would place sweeping restrictions on abortion in pennsylvania 
and directly challenge a 1973 us supreme court ruling giving 
women the right to end a pregnancy 
rep stephen freind rdel outlined the fivepart proposal he 
said shows pennsylvania will always be downtheline prolife 
the supreme court earlier this year gave states broader powers 
to restrict a womans access to abortions freinds bill which has 
the backing of gov robert p casey could be the first to be 
adopted since that ruling in july 
also tuesday a legislative committee in madison wis 
recommended approval of a measure to repeal an obsolete state law 
establishing prison penalties for women who have abortions and 
doctors who perform them 
the bill would repeal the currently unenforceable penalties for 
both physicians and women although a law passed in 1985 stated 
women who had abortions would not be prosecuted 
at a capitol news conference in harrisburg freind said his 
proposal would give the high court another chance to overturn the 
roe vs wade decision 
his legislation would require a 24hour waiting period before a 
woman can have an abortion outlaw all abortions after the 24th 
week of pregnancy except to save the womans life and ban 
abortions used for choosing the sex of a child 
it also would require notification of the husband before a woman 
has an abortion except in a few cases order physicians to inform 
women of the surgical procedure to be used the fetus stage of 
development the dangers of childbirth and abortion and 
alternatives to abortion and ban most fetal experimentation which 
includes prohibiting the sale and use of tissue organs or other 
remains from the aborted fetus 
after the news conference an estimated 8500 antiabortion 
advocates cheered freind and his proposal at a rally on the state 
capitol steps people carried graphic signs showing aborted fetuses 
and saying the unborn need freedom too and prochoice means 
pro murder 
more than 5000 prochoice supporters held a rally here last 
week 
one difference between them and us is that we have joy and 
they cant freind said because there is nothing joyous in the 
killing of unborn children 
freinds bill has more than 70 cosponsors some of whom joined 
him at the news conference and the rally along with leaders of 
various antiabortion groups 
the lawmaker said he expected his proposal to pass the general 
assembly and move to the governor sometime later this month or 
early next month 
also tuesday abortion rights advocates formally introduced 
their legislative package it includes a proposed constitutional 
amendment affirming a womans right to have an abortion 
the prochoice bills would restore government funding for poor 
women who have medically necessary abortions and would weaken a 
state law that requires parental notification or a court order 
before a minor can obtain an abortion that provision is not in 
effect because it under court review 
prochoice advocates said a majority of pennsylvanias voters 
support a womans right to choose 
in a poll of 500 likely voters in the state the national 
abortion rights action league said 60 percent of the respondents 
favored keeping abortion legal while 33 percent wanted to outlaw 
it 
this data shows how dramatically outofstep pennsylvanias 
officials are with their constituents on abortion said kate 
michelman the leagues executive director 
the political atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly 
charged than ever politicians in pennsylvania who support 
abortion restrictions in 1989 may well be voted out of office in 
1990 
the poll conducted by hickmanmaslin research inc has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 44 percent the polling was done

housing secretary jack kemp on tuesday 
proposed major management changes at the scandaltarred department 
of housing and urban development including eliminating programs 
and a special fund he said either were tainted by political 
influence or not targeted to the needy 
many past funding decisions were frankly based on political 
influence rather than merit kemp said in releasing his 58point 
plan to reform the agency under my stewardship no decisions 
will be made at hud for the political advantage or personal gain of 
any one person or of a political party 
kemp in his first news conference as secretary also announced 
that hud has barred from doing government business a mortgage 
lender whose defaults in a hud program total more than 700 million 
while praising the congressional investigation of influence 
peddling fraud and mismanagement at hud during the reagan 
administration kemp said he did not believe it was necessary to 
appoint a special prosecutor as suggested by some republicans and 
democrats involved in the reviews 
kemps proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative 
steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that would 
require congressional approval 
the agencys federal housing administration and its 
multibilliondollar loan programs would be significantly affected 
with several programs kemp said have deviated from helping the 
needy eliminated outright 
and the entire agency would be subjected to intense public 
scrutiny through the publishing of all funding and other major 
decisions in the federal register kemp also promised to improve 
targeting of scarce hud funds to those most in need and vowed to 
try to collect money bilked from the agency in the past 
more proposals are likely he said after additional reviews of 
hud management 
initial reaction from members of congress was favorable 
although there was opposition to what some lawmakers interpreted as 
a kemp effort to kill the section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program which huds inspector general said in april was riddled 
with influence peddling by former agency officials and prominent 
republican consultants kemp did not directly propose killing the 
program but referred to its problems and said its goals could be 
accomplished through several other hud programs 
i think the secretarys recommendations with respect to 
ethics management reform tighter fiscal controls the 
introduction of a chief financial officer of hud are all 
excellent said rep thomas lantos dcalif the chairman of a 
house subcommittee investigation of the department 
when we come into the programatic field i think well have to 
study those recommendations much more carefully said lantos 
among a number of lawmakers who said they were not yet convinced 
the rehabilitation program should be killed instead of reformed 
many of kemps proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984 
general accounting office report to congress while others were 
molded after more recent suggestions made in congress to limit the 
role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding decisions 
still others came from kemp aides after their own review 
eliminated along with the mod rehab program would be 
discretionary funds under the hud secretarys control we are 
trying to get rid of the slush fund approach said hud 
undersecretary alfred dellibovi 
hud budgets traditionally have included a large setaside for 
the secretarys discretionary fund and hud and congressional 
investigators have found several instances in which projects that 
had been opposed by agency experts were funded through the account 
kemp also proposed killing another program huds title x land 
development insurance citing use of the money to build upscale 
projects such as a condominiumgolf complex in california fha 
programs for vacation home loans 
but he said he was committed to huds coinsurance program to 
date the source of nearly 1 billion in sour loans the program 
allows private lenders to approve hudinsured mortgages and was a 
major part of the reagan administrations efforts to reduce the 
federal work force by contracting business to private companies 
the company kemp said has been barred from hud work drg funding 
corp has experienced defaults on 709 million of the 11 billion 
in hudinsured loans it approved the government is liable for 80 
percent of such mortgages 
the problem was not the idea kemp said the problem was 
in the implementation of the idea these reforms are designed 
to make a good idea better 
kemp said the program would be revived with improved hud 
oversight of the lenders and new certification requirements for the 
lenders appraisers and others involved in handling the 
applications 
other highlights of the kemp package include 
appointment of a chief financial officer for hud and a separate 
comptroller for the fha whose loan programs have been troubled by 
fraud and mismanagement believed to have cost more than 4 billion 
requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on hud 
proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees 
which hud could deduct from any funding awards kemp asked congress 
to impose civil fines of up to 10000 for violations of the 
registration requirement he also proposed similar fines for hud 
employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public 
announcements 
allocating up to 100 million for monitoring of hud housing and 
community development programs kemp said the department now spends 
less than 25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10 
times that amount 
allowing hud officials to adjust subsidy and loan amounts to 
take into account other benefits developers receive for building 
lowincome housing including tax credits 
increasing the staff of the departments inspector general and 
granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its 
investigations 
offering incentives to lowincome homeowners who got 
hudinsured mortgages to encourage them to refinance at todays 
lower interest rates something kemp said could save the government 
200 million 
raising from 60 percent to 100 percent the amount of community 
development block grant money that affluent communities must spend 
on projects benefiting low and moderateincome residents 
requiring the fha to be audited annually and to begin 
programbyprogram accounting and regional accounting kemp said 
that shoddy record keeping has prevented a thorough audit of fha 
for the past 15 years that umbrella accounting practices have 
failed to detect problems in specific programs and that current 
practices do not take into account regional differences in the real 
estate market

east germany issued an order 
tuesday banning free travel to czechoslovakia but agreed that at 
least 10000 of its citizens already in prague could emigrate to 
the west 
east german leader erich honecker accused west germany of 
insolently breaking promises by letting the east germans into 
its embassies in prague and warsaw 
they believe in west germany that they can destabilize east 
germany with a broadbased attack but it will not work he said 
in his first major speech since returning to work after a long 
convalescence from gallbladder surgery adn the official east 
german news agency carried his remarks 
the crackdown on travel came after hundreds of east germans 
stormed through police lines to get inside the embassy in prague 
they climbed facades rooftops and a fence to reach the crowded 
compound many were left bloodspattered by police and some fell 
unconscious inside the grounds 
rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff 
initially said east german refugees would begin leaving prague for 
west germany by train tuesday evening but their departure was 
delayed for hours 
police were withdrawn from the railroad station at 10 pm and 
an hour later the refugees were still in and around the embassy 
waiting in freezing weather 
seiters said an estimated 4700 refugees in the the embassy and 
about 6000 milling outside would be traveling west 
he said kohl was informed of the east german decision by premier 
ladislav adamec of czechoslovakia 
east germanys decision appeared to be part of an effort to 
avoid possible embarrassing disturbances during celebrations of the 
communist states 40th anniversary saturday soviet president 
mikhail s gobachev is scheduled to attend 
thousands of east germans have streamed across the border into 
neighboring czechoslovakia and to other soviet bloc countries in 
the last few weeks in an attempt to reach west gemany 
adn said the travel ban stemmed from reports that certain 
circles in west germany are preparing provocations in conjunction 
with the celebrations 
last weekend east germany agreed to the departure of about 
7000 refugees from the west german embassies in prague and in 
warsaw poland but said it was a onetime arrangement 
previously east germans did not need a visa or passport to 
reach czechoslovakia but adn said such documents would be required 
from now on that effectively bans all ordinary east germans from 
traveling to czechoslovakia 
it also will make it much more difficult for east germans to 
reach hungary where the liberal leadership opened its western 
border sept 11 since the usual route to hungary is through 
czechoslovakia 
west germany closed its embassy early tuesday after thousands of 
east germans streamed into the compound overnight bringing the 
total seeking asylum there to some 4500 red cross officials said 
they feared sanitation problems 
after the east german decision was announced the embassy opened 
its doors refugees said 
hundreds of east germans hopeful of gaining access to the 
embassy had continued arriving throughout tuesday and they grew 
desperate as the day wore on 
police had blockaded the embassy garden fence but nearly 300 
refugees stormed the police lines scaled the fence and fought off 
clubwielding police trying to keep them back 
they clubbed like mad a czechoslovak witness said 
witnesses said many people were injured in scuffles with police 
others got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and 
still others jumped or fell head first to the ground some lay 
unconscious inside the compound witnesses said 
this is pandemonium said a red cross assistant handling 
injured refugees only a doctor and several refugees witnessed the 
incident 
in bonn chief government spokesman hans klein said honecker 
refused to talk to kohl by telephone tuesday about the problem 
klein told reporters honecker aides told the west germans 
preparations for satudays celebrations precluded an appointment 
for a telephone call 
the soviet communist party daily pravda came to east germanys 
defense accusing west germany of interfering in east german 
affairs 
west german officials have said foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze of the soviet union was instrumental in winning the 
release of the east german refugees during the weekend 
earlier tuesday czechoslovak government spokesman miroslav 
pavel said the east germans in prague were seriously upsetting 
public order he said other embassies in the area including 
the us embassy had requested increased protection 
in the west german embassy in warsaw the number of east germans 
arriving over the past two days reached about 300 officials said 
refugees in warsaw said their government was no longer issuing 
the special travel cards needed for poland as quickly as in the 
past 
more than 120000 east germans have reached west germany so far 
this year either legally or illegally they say they are denied 
basic freedoms in their country 
west german ambassador hermann huber was summoned to the foreign 
ministry on tuesday to receive a formal protest note for what the 
state news agency ctk said was west german violation of the 1961 
convention on diplomatic relations 
the protest referred to the undesirable situation caused by 
the illegal stay of gdr east german citizens at bonns 
mission and said czechoslovakia expects west german authorities 
will seek to prevent a repetition of the situation

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
and president bush on tuesday pledged mutual trust and 
understanding on crossboundary issues agreeing to conduct trade 
negotiations and to clean up mexico city and tijuana pollution 
salinas publicly raised the touchy trade issue calling on the 
united states to open its markets to mexican products something 
us officials say is largely true anyway 
during a lengthy toast that amounted to a speech at a state 
dinner in his honor at the white house salinas noted changes in 
the mexican economy 
few economies have opened up as much and as rapidly as 
mexicos a similar opening of the american market would not only 
represent reciprocal treatment but a stimulus to our new 
friendship the mexican leader said he praised bush for open and 
substantial dialogue and said it signalled a new relationship of 
friendship free of myths and mistrusts 
bush in a very brief toast also talked of close ties between the 
two neighbors and thanked salinas for his efforts in fighting drug 
trafficking 
bush during his presidential campaign said he would seek a free 
trade agreement with mexico possibly akin to the one negotiated 
with canda under former president reagan however no such 
agreement has materialized 
to mark salinas visit to washington the two governments signed 
seven agreements on trade environment investment and tourism 
the agreements bush said in praising the closeness of 
usmexico ties are concrete examples of how our 
administrations have worked closely together during the last 10 
months they show what can and must be done to make relations 
between our two great nations even closer than they are today 
salinas also cheered for a close relationship but said his 
primary goal in facilitating us investment in mexico was to 
open up additional sources of employment in mexico for mexicans 
the agreements were generally nonspecific but two 
environmental pacts commit the nations to construct an 
international sewage treatment plant in california just across the 
border from tijuana they also will conduct joint scientific and 
technical projects to fight air pollution in mexico city 
the sewage problem has become a matter of increasing 
usmexican tensions because tijuana waste pollutes the waters and 
the beaches of san diego 
the agreement provides that the new plant will provide secondary 
treatment and disposal of waste not now treated in tijuana 
salinas in remarks at the signing ceremony also acknowledged 
mexico city is the most polluted city in the world we want 
better air for the mexicans for their children and for children of 
their children in mexico 
the two countries agreed to work on the problem of smog in the 
mexican capital through technology transfers scientific and 
technical advice environmental monitoring and environmental 
impact assessments by mexican authorities joint meetings and 
reviews exchange of relevant personnel and exchanges of 
environmental information and data coordination on national 
programs and funding cooperation 
a separate environmental agreement committed the two countries 
to address air pollution in urban border areas beginning with el 
paso texas and ciudad juarez chihuahua in mexico 
the agreement on trade signed at the white house by secretary 
of state james a baker iii and his mexican counterpart fernando 
solana was an agreement to negotiate toward facilitating and 
enhancing usmexico trade relations 
in november the two countries are to decide what trade issues 
are negotiable 
a separate agreement commited the countries to work on easing 
investment opportunity for us firms in mexico 
salinas said that pact will further the investment processes 
so that mexicans can find a job in mexico that is the central 
purpose of my visit to this country 
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher will travel to mexico in 
november to discuss the investment situation officials said 
the mexican president was with bush when word arrived from us 
military forces in panama that gunshots had been heard near the 
military headquarters of gen manuel antonio noriega said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater there were reports of a coup attempt 
salinas and bush were briefed on what details were available by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said fitzwater 
bush in an outdoor white house welcoming ceremony for salinas 
said the two countries must cooperate in efforts to bring about 
democracy in panama as well as for fair elections in nicaragua 
bush said the united states and mexico must continue to 
strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and trafficking 
for we know that what threatens one nation in our hemisphere 
threatens us all 
we can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to free 
the world from that international scourge salinas added vowing 
to fight jointly against illegal narcotics trafficking 
salinas speaking through a translator called for more humane 
ways to deal with migration of mexicans to the united states 
the mexican called for a new stage in trade relations he 
earlier had said he would seek trade concessions mexican exports 
such as textiles steel and agricultural products but us 
officials have disagreed with his contention that mexico has 
difficulty penetrating american markets 
one official said that until recently mexico was one of the most 
protectionist countries in the world 
mexico has a 27 billion trade surplus with the united states 
on total twoway trade of 439 billion the official said 
the administration and the mexicans also signed a tourism 
agreement geared toward easing procedures to promote us tourism 
in mexico

a japanese court tuesday ruled legal a government 
program of screening school textbooks including deleting 
references to some japanese military actions in world war ii 
such government screening brought protests earlier from china 
and other countries which accused japan of trying to cover up 
military brutality 
despite its ruling on wartime operations the court held in one 
case that a governmentordered rewrite distorted history 
the tokyo district court ruled in professor saburo iyenagas 
25year battle against the education ministrys textbook screening 
it ordered the ministry to pay him 711 
iyenaga who writes textbooks plans to appeal to the high 
court said district court spokesman akira saito 
iyenaga 76 had demanded 14235 and wanted the screening 
system overturned his complaint dealt mainly with 
governmentordered rewrites concerning japans actions in world war 
ii the court rejected that portion of his argument 
however judge kazuo kato said the education ministry abused its 
inspection authority and contradicted mainstream academic theories 
in ordering iyenaga to rewrite part of a 1980 textbook dealing with 
an attempted coup by farmers against the tokugawa shogunate 
government in 1868 
the court ruled against iyenaga on his complaints that in 
writing textbooks he could not use the terms invasion 
nanking massacre no 731 regiment and battle in 
okinawa in describing wartime actions by japanese troops 
china says more than 300000 people mostly civilians were 
killed or raped by japanese soldiers in december 1937 after 
nanking then chinas capital fell to japanese invasion forces 
western historians have estimated that 200000 were killed in the 
massacre 
the battle of okinawa in 1945 was japans last and bloodiest 
stand during world war ii okinawan officials said japanese troops 
killed 800 okinawan civilians because they were an obstacle to 
military operations and ordered others to commit suicide 
no 731 regiment refers to a unit alleged to have conducted germ 
experiments on war prisoners 
kato said textbook inspection was justified to preserve accuracy 
and neutrality in education he held that textbook inspection does 
not violate the constitutional right to freedom of expression 
because material rejected by the ministry still can be published 
he said in his ruling considering students inability to 
evaluate educational contents the little choice of educational 
tools allowed to teachers and the need for equal opportunity for 
education the government cannot allow teachers complete freedom to 
publish their own studies as textbooks 
education minister kazuya ishibashi said in a statement the 
adequacy and necessity of the textbook inspection system were 
reconfirmed by todays court ruling and we in the education 
ministry will work even harder to make the contents of textbooks 
more satisfying 
he said however that he objected to the payment and said the 
government might appeal 
iyenaga told reporters we are very disappointed by the 
ruling but the education ministry should take it seriously and 
blame itself for having gone too far in its censorship 
i am also disappointed by the courts backward and biased 
attitude 
the suit filed in 1984 was iyenagas third against the 
screening system

tuesday 
i dont think were going to have to worry about it any 
longer said robert molleda spokesman for the national hurricane

showed the depression was no longer identifiable due the strong 
upper level winds that developed over the system throughout the

regenerated which was not expected the center reported 
the depression the 13th of the atlantic hurricane season

intensify to tropical storm strength by tuesday

was centered near 17 degrees north latitude and 50 degrees west

shellfish harvesting was banned tuesday 
and warnings were issued against swimming in ocean water and rivers 
choked with untreated sewage because of damage from hurricane hugo 
us sen ernest hollings said he would ask for an investigation 
of the federal emergency management agencys response to victims of 
the hurricane but marilyn quayle wife of the vice president said 
the agency had been unfairly criticized 
crews working to reestablish a land link between the barrier 
islands and the mainland hoped to raise the ben sawyer bridge back 
into place wednesday during high tide the bridge tilted at a 
45degree angle has rested in the intracoastal waterway for 13 
days since the hurricane struck 
hollings dsc who last week called employees of fema a 
bunch of bureaucratic jackasses said he will ask the general 
accounting office congress watchdog agency to investigate femas 
incompetent handling of disaster relief 
fema is the agency responsible for coordinating federal aid in 
national disasters the agency with a budget of 600 million and 
2200 employees reports directly to the president 
gao needs to find out why this agency couldnt perform in an 
emergency he said from washington thats femas job its in 
the title theyre supposed to manage emergencies not cause them 
hollings criticized fema for opening too few offices to handle 
disaster relief applications about 10 offices are open in the 22 
south carolina counties that president bush declared disaster areas 
fema spokesman bill mcada said he disagreed with hollings 
assessment of the agencys response but said he would welcome an 
investigation 
our charter under law is for the longterm recovery and 
response to the situation mcada said by telephone from 
washington i believe were doing that and under the 
circumstances doing it as fast as it can be expected to be done 
mrs quayle in charleston to help at disaster and american red 
cross centers also defended fema 
everyones natural reaction is to want everything done 
yesterday she said but from what ive been able to observe 
fema very frankly got a bum rap 
sewage treatment plants in the area are only partially 
operational and are removing only 30 percent of the pollutants from 
sewage when fully operational about 95 percent of the pollutants 
are removed before the sewage is dumped into the ocean 
the waters are turning black and there are fish kills all 
over said wayne fanning of the state department of health and 
environmental control 
the swimming advisory could last months and possibly affect next 
springs tourist season 
some 10 million visitors were attracted last year to the grand 
strand 60 miles of beach from georgetown to the north carolina 
line and accounted for an estimated 35 percent of the states 
total tourism revenue of 47 billion officials said 
the longterm effect on the shellfishing industry is going to 
be devastating fanning said 
shellfishing also is a multimilliondollar industry in south 
carolina 
hurricane hugo slammed into south carolina sept 21 with 135 mph 
wind killing at least 18 and leaving 50000 homeless 270000 
jobless and homes businesses schools and municipal buildings 
damaged or destroyed as far inland as sumter and north to north 
carolina in all 29 people were killed on the us mainland 
damage in south carolina alone has been estimated at 3 billion 
or more with crop damage placed at some 100 million 
south of charleston workers planned to float barges under the 
dangling section of the ben sawyer bridge and use wednesday 
mornings rising tide to help raise the bridge that connects isle 
of palms and sullivans island to the mainland said army corps of 
engineers spokesman rod ruffennach then cranes will swing the 
bridge back into position 
the bridge will be left in position for cars until experts 
determine if they can repair the swing mechanism that opens the 
bridge for boats on the intracoastal waterway 
in murrells inlet 10 miles south of myrtle beach author mickey 
spillane examined the wreckage of his home and office where he has 
written detective novels since 1963 one section of a wall was 
gone and first editions of his books including i the jury 
and my gun is quick had disappeared also gone was a 
manuscript of a book in progress 
hey not to worry he said you get a flat tire you fix 
it right 
the missing manuscript no big deal ill make it up in two

troops loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriego put down an attempted coup by a small rebel force tuesday 
retaking the headquarters of the panamanian defense forces after a 
sixhour gunfight 
this incident corresponds to the permanent aggression of us 
forces against the tranquillity of our country the proof is that 
us forces closed access routes to the barracks noriega said in 
a television statement from defense forces headquarters after the 
fighting sputtered to an end 
noriega later stepped out of his headquarters with several 
fellow officers and waved to reporters but made no statement 
the rebels surrendered to general noriega in person said 
defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez he said more than 
60 rebel troopers and four or five officers had been detained 
the defense forces serves as both the military and police and has a 
total strength of about 15000 members 
rebel troops seized the headquarters in an attack launched 
around 7 am but failed to capture noriega troops loyal to the 
general who commands the defense forces and controls the 
government launched a counterattack and by 1 pm the shooting had 
tapered off as noriegas backers gained the upper hand noriega 
appeared on television around 4 pm 
the united states which has been trying to oust noriega since 
he was indicted nearly two years ago in florida on drug charges 
denied any involvement in the coup attempt the uprising was 
launched by junior defense forces officers 
us troops assigned to the panama canal zone took up positions 
about 600 yards from the headquarters placed between the fighting 
at the compound and us installations at fort amador and quarry 
heights however a spokesman for the us southern command said 
the american troops took no part in the fighting and were 
dispatched for security reasons 
it was the second time in 18 months that noriega had survived a 
coup attempt by his own officers 
in a radio broadcast after the rebels seized the headquarters 
the insurgents claimed noriega had been ousted but loyal forces 
soon took control of the broadcast networks 
we want to underline that the situation in the country has 
been duly controlled to guarantee the peace and tranquillity that 
the state should assure for its citizens said a statement 
released by justice and interior minister olmedo miranda 
it declared an 8 pmto5 am curfew and said the news media 
could report only official statements on the revolt 
guillermo ford an opposition candidate for vice president in 
the may 7 election was interviewed in new york on cbs evening news 
and asked about the foiled coup 
i think noriegas going to get stronger regarding the 
panamanian people ford said hes been holding them hostage 
for the last two years 
international observers at the may 7 balloting said the 
opposition slate won by a substantial margin but the 
noriegacontrolled government annulled the election 
panamas provisional president francisco rodriguez speaking to 
the un general assembly in new york said the attempted coup 
against his government had been crushed 
rodriguez in his midafternoon address did not accuse the 
united states of complicity in the revolt but said washington had 
undermined his nation with financial terrorism economic 
blackmail and political interference 
a small group of defense forces had tried to overthrow noriega 
in march 1988 but that attempt also was crushed quickly by forces 
loyal to the general 
the united states has been been applying pressure on panama 
including economic sanctions in an effort to force noriega to step 
down 
the rebels claimed in a broadcast around noon that they had 
overthrown noriega and retired top officers but that communique 
was not repeated 
an officer loyal to noriega later said the general was at an 
undisclosed location controlling the operations against the 
insurgents 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday afternoon in 
washington that officials had heard early rumblings of the 
uprising he said later it appeared that noriegas forces are 
back in control 
a communique by loyalists read over channel 2 television said 
the nationalist officers of all ranks and in all the barracks 
countrywide have confirmed their loyalty to the fatherland and 
to our commanderinchief gen manuel antonio noriega 
the few who allowed themselves to fall prey to cowardice to 
foreign money and to treason are a minority who advocated foreign 
intervention the communique added in the next few hours this 
group will appear before justice covered with shame 
several ambulances were seen leaving the area and witnesses 
said there were some dead and wounded but the number of casualties 
was not immediately known 
troops of the southern command were put on delta alert the 
highest level of readiness 
about 12000 us soldiers are stationed in panama many within 
five miles of panama city all us civilian dependents were moved 
onto us military installations july 1 because of violence that 
followed panamanian elections held may 7 noriega nullified the 
results of the vote which showed the opposition winning 
president bush told reporters in washington there were rumors 
around that this was some american operation and i can tell you 
that is not true nobodys sure whats happening there 
rebels managed to gain control of the military headquarters in a 
congested part of downtown panama city those loyal to noriega then 
went to the roofs of surrounding buildings hurling grenades and 
firing mortars and small arms into the compound 
several hours of gunfire inside and outside the headquarters 
preceded the rebel broadcast that said the entire high command was 
forced into retirement by middleranking officers led by maj 
moises giraldi vega head of the urraca battalion that handles 
security at defense forces headquarters 
the radio said the communique announcing a coup was signed by 
giraldi capt javier licona of the cavalry and capt jesus george 
balma of the special forces 
this is strictly a military movement there is no politics 
involved the communique said referring to the civilian 
opposition alliance that has been trying to oust noriega with us 
help 
an hour after the statement was read a man who identified 
himself as lt col arnulfo castrejon said on pronoriega channel 
2 television that loyalists were ready to give their lives to 
defend gen noriega this is a betrayal 
castrejon who identified himself as a spokesman for pronoriega 
forces said noriega remained in control of air and naval units and 
of battalion 2000 a special unit created to defend the panama 
canal after it is turned over to panama on dec 31 1999 
noriega inherited command of the military from gen omar 
torrijos who seized power in 1968 and was killed in a plane crash 
in 1981 
noriega claims the us charges of drug trafficking and money 
laundering are part of a us plot to abrogate the panama canal 
treaties of 1977

fortyeight wounded guerrillas 
most of them amputees moved tuesday to the mexican embassy from 
the metropolitan cathedral they had occupied for six weeks 
the occupation began aug 20 with eight wounded entering the 
church and the number had reached 48 by last weekend annoying both 
the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani and roman 
catholic church leaders 
the cathedral is not a hotel monsignor arturo rivera damas 
archbishop of san salvador said late last month in an appeal to 
vacate the church 
the guerrillas had said they would stay in the cathedral until 
they and wounded comrades on battlefronts were given safe conduct 
out of the country for medical treatment 
but rivera damas chagrin apparently changed their minds red 
cross vans took the 46 men and two women from the cathedral to the 
mexican embassy 
one man who said he lost his right arm in combat told the 
associated press through the embassy gate the wounded will not 
comment on future plans until arrangements were worked out with the 
mexican ambassador 
access to the embassy was barred repeated telephone calls went 
unanswered 
earlier insurgents denounced cristianis speech monday to the 
un general assembly in which he called for a ceasefire in the 
10yearold civil war 
cristiani who took office june 1 said his government would 
propose a complete cessation of hostilities during peace talks with 
rebels scheduled for oct 1617 in costa rica 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln umbrella 
for five guerrilla groups has insisted an agreement must be 
reached on democratic reforms before the war can end 
joaquin villalobos a rebel negotiator said we want 
democracy and peace it must be in that order because if peace 
comes before democracy it will be the peace of the cemetery 
the rebels demand an end to what they call official repression 
an overhaul of the judiciary and reduction of the armed forces 
cristiani filled his speech with words like human rights 
peace and democracy at the same time what were seeing is a wave 
of arrests of members of popular organizations tortures 
disappearances and murders said the rebels on their clandestine 
radio venceremos 
vice president francisco merino told journalists monday the call 
for a ceasefire is not a call for the surrender of the fmln 
he said a cessation of hostilities would create appropriate 
conditions for the search for lasting peace 
the rebels observed an 11day unilateral ceasefire between 
sept 1323 for the preliminary talks they accused the government 
of taking advantage of the truce to move forces into 
guerrillacontrolled zones and arrest leaders of labor and peasant 
organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities

the senate became snarled late tuesday in a 
fight over whether to authorize the use of us troops against 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega indicted in the united states 
on drug trafficking charges as it debated legislation to bolster 
the war on drugs 
we had a golden opportunity to help the people of panama rid 
themselves of a malignancy sen jesse helms rnc said as he 
offered his plan 
his offering came as senators churned through a wideranging 
bill that would add hundreds of new agents federal marshals and 
prosecutors to the war on drugs and place care of crack addicts 
under the medicaid program 
these amendments will lay the groundwork for a new expanded 
drug control strategy judiciary committee chairman joseph r 
biden jr ddel said as the senate approved the additions 
senators planned to put the finishing touches on the bill 
wednesday 
helms proposal would authorize the president to use the armed 
forces of the united states to secure the removal of general manuel 
antonio noriega from his illegal control of the republic of 
panama 
biden expressed concern about the measure saying i wonder if 
it is so broad that we are authorizing the president to declare 
war 
he said it was possible that the gulf of tonkin resolution 
might blush by comparison the tonkin resolution of 1965 led to 
escalation of the vietnam war 
the noriega proposal followed the failure of a coup attempt 
against him by members of the panama defense forces 
earlier the senate approved drug bill provisions that would 
authorize 57 million for 1000 new fbi agents 475 million for 
250 drug enforcement agents in rural areas and 24 million for 313 
additional posts in federal prosecutors offices it also would 
authorize more for judges marshals and probation officers 
the bill also would place treatment of crack cocaine users and 
perhaps other substance abusers under medicaid beginning a year 
from now at a cost estimated by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
at 300 million 
moynihan the author of the provision said the price tag would 
be comparatively low because care available for crack addicts is 
limited in any case there is no treatment he told reporters 
the bill was designed to help implement president bushs war on 
drugs as it went into the hopper the measure would have required 
drug testing of persons arrested jailed and placed on probation or 
paroled 
a states failure to satisfy the attorney general about the 
extent of its testing program could have led to a cutoff of federal 
law enforcement funds 
the senate however junked those provisions in favor of a plan 
by sen christopher bon rmo providing for a 5 million pilot 
program of testing federal prisoners to determine which procedures 
work best bond said lawmakers were leery of handing the attorney 
general the powers in the original plan 
senators worked late into the night heaping additions of their 
own onto the bill ranging from a study of the possibility of 
ending the use of disposable needles to earmarking forfeited drug 
funds to buy weapons and body armor for agents 
well probably pass a lot of these things and then they will 
never see the light of day said sen orrin hatch rutah the 
gop floor leader 
the house wont let it happen and the senate itself might 
have some second thoughts before final action hatch said

using what will be the worlds most powerful space telescope 
in a gesture of appreciation for scientific contributions by 
hobbyists using backyard and rooftop telescopes the space 
telescope science institute has offered 20 hours of observing time 
on the hubble space telescope to projects designed by amateurs 
the telescope to be launched on a space shuttle in march is a 
joint project of the national aeronautics and space administration 
and the european space agency the project based at johns hopkins 
university is expected to cost about 750 million and has been in 
planning stages for a decade 
for someone who is not a professional astronomer the odds of 
getting to use the telescope are comparable to george jetsons 
chances of getting a raise from his tightfisted boss at spacely

film till the end of time a 1946 drama with robert mitchum 
and dorothy mcguire 
the late late show of a local tv station no 
its tonights primetime fare on tnt which on tuesday 
celebrated its first cabletv birthday with little hoopla a record 
of solid growth and anticipation of more 
the brainchild and fourth network of cable wizard ted turner 
turner network television arrived on oct 3 1989 its basic fare 
classic and maybenotsoclassic films of yesteryear and 
bigbudget madeforcable movies 
when it began amid considerable drumbeating and cables first 
showing of gone with the wind tnt a 24houraday operation 
had 17 million subscribers now it says the figure is up to 33 
million 
tnt isnt yet in the top 10 list of cable networks a list led 
by mostly sports espn with more than 52 million subscribers we 
still have a way to go to catch up with the leaders concedes 
gerry hogan tnts boss 
but we feel theres plenty of growth left adds hogan who 
as president of turner entertainment networks is in charge of both 
tnt and tbs the latter turners cable superstation in atlanta 
turners other networks are the allnews cable news network and 
headline news 
tnts madeforcable movies now include miniseries such as the 
justconcluded threepart historical drama captain cooke and 
last months fourpart the nightmare years based on cbs 
correspondent william shirers memoirs about germany during 
hitlers rise to power 
early examples of tnts madefors as tv movies are called 
included charlton heston in a man for all seasons and a drama 
with farrah fawcett as the celebrated news photographer margaret 
bourkewhite 
costing an average of 3 million each the movies initially 
bowed on a oneamonth basis the premieres this month went to a 
twoamonth basis and a spokeswoman says will go up to three a 
month by october next year and four each month in 1991 
although tnts target audience is in the 2554 age range the 
network does have youngerviewer fare in the morning and early 
evening reruns of jim hensons acclaimed the muppet show 
series and fraggle rock 
it also is edging into sports with more than 70 national 
basketball association games slotted for this winter during the 
1992 and 1994 winter olympics tnt says it will air 50 live hours 
from each games under a 50 million deal turner struck last month 
with cbs sports 
but what hogan calls the heart and soul of tnt is its huge 
library of mgm rko studios and pre1950 warner bros films more 
than 3300 movies that range from casablanca to the prisoner 
of zenda 
we run 250 films a month says hogan who praises lisa 
mateas tnts scheduling director as close to a genius in the way 
she schedules the movies of which new prints have been made and 
sound tracks restored 
sometimes he says she schedules two or three titles together 
to show stages of development of a particular player such as bette 
davis or to show a yesteryear star such as myrna loy to a new 
generation of film fans 
sometimes her scheduling also displays a pixie sense of humor 
one night last year offered a tnt triplefeature he couldnt say 
no she couldnt say no and she had to say yes 
shes just magic hogan says 
tnt may be a treasure trove for movie buffs but the size of its 
average audience each night poses no major threat yet to the major

its muchpublicized margaret bourkewhite last april got 
tnts highest ratings to date a 51 that works out to just over 
25 million homes which is very good for cable but relatively 
small potatoes by network standards 
still tnts growth and acceptance by viewers have impressed 
even a top cable executive who once was what he calls a 
naysayer to tnt partly because he didnt think its film 
library would prove that big a draw 
i thought we should have stayed back and waited a year to see 
what happened says robert clasen president of comcast cable 
communications one of the nations largest cable companies 
but comcast which is based near philadelphia and according to 
clasen serves 24 million subscribers decided to take a chance 
it offered the new tnt service as part of a promotional strategy 
last fall the network was very successful very wellreceived 
by subscribers of cable systems comcast owns or manages he says 
he sees little that could stop tnts growth he also is he 
says completely sold on turners longrange goal for the 
network one major event each night that is the centerpiece of the 
nights program 
this is the cable era where people dont watch channels 
anymore clasen says they look at individual products they 
want to be sure theres something significant to watch when they

when the subject of affordable housing is 
discussed which is often most recommendations offered seem to 
involve the federal government in some capacity 
it is an old tradition part of the american culture 
exemplified by the federal housing administration and veterans 
administration mortgage programs by taxfavored building programs 
and by income tax breaks for homeowners 
homeownership is sacred ask any homebuilder or real estate 
group and theyll claim that homeowners are hardworking community 
spirited highly responsible and dutiful voters and as they say 
in the real estate ads much much more 
homeowners they might add are the embodiment of the american 
spirit of independence creativity and opportunity a high level of 
homeownership they point out distinguishes america from so many 
other countries 
but when the subject is affordable housing many housing people 
habitually turn to washington for a solution citing figures that 
show the typical new house is priced beyond the means of the 
typical income family 
meanwhile many young couples are in effect saying so what 
and are managing to buy suitable houses by means of oldfashioned 
ingenuity a quality often available to those who need to tap it 
among their devices is that of obtaining financial assistance 
from the seller sellers who have owned their houses for many years 
generally have built up sizable equity they have money to invest 
many of them also are contemplating retirement and wondering 
about a retirement income to extend a purchase loan a second 
mortgage might be considered an opportunity by them both rate and 
security are a1 
the device is commonly used but not nearly as commonly 
recommended but thousands of young couples are in homes of their 
own today because of it and all they did was ask 
others are buying homes in need of repairs the house isnt the 
place of their dreams but submitting to reality they recognize it 
is the best they can do they buy and using brains and backs 
create the house of their dreams 
in so doing they create equity too almost always adding more 
to their assets than the couple who postpone buying while 
attempting to save enough for a dream house in the future one 
couple has a house the other a forlorn dream 
others tip the price scale in their favor by moving farther out 
from core cities while others push deeper into the cores even 
into slums in search of prices within their means its a start 
they reason better times will come 
indeed they usually do whatever they manage to buy assuming 
they exercised prudence the new homeowners are likely to find the 
market value higher in the future 
the increases might be modest maybe averaging just a few 
percentage points a year but thats better than in most 
investments homeowners may put up only 20 percent of the purchase 
price but they take 100 percent of the appreciation 
true prices might stagnate in the future conceivably they 
could even drop but over periods of a decade or more it is 
relatively rare for houses to lose market value real estate is 
cyclical but the price trend is up 
houses that couldnt be sold eight years ago in detroit now 
might be available for double their old price since 1986 the 
median sale price of existing singlefamily homes there has risen 
more than 15000 
in houston where in middecade the market had dropped 
drastically the median price in the second quarter of 1989 was 82 
percent higher than a year earlier prices are up in san antonio 
again and in dallas too 
and those who scrimped struggled sacrificed and innovated in 
order to buy those houses are reaping the benefits now without 
help from uncle sam

the unassuming facade of the observatory 
gave no hint of the significance of what was inside but like a 
good book dee longenbaughs bookstore could not be judged by its 
cover 
inside was a collection that had become a treasure to book and 
map collectors worldwide longenbaughs specialty is alaskana 
books maps and prints that tell of the last frontiers colorful 
past 
the treasure still exists but not in this scenic fishing port 
and mill town along southeast alaskas rain forest coast sitka and 
its 8000 residents recently lost the best collection of literary 
alaskana to santa fe nm 
for longenbaugh 55 the move south represents a return to her 
roots she grew up in northern new mexico 
its very very interesting because i have lived in sitka for 
26 years she said so am i still a northern new mexican am i 
an alaskan dont know gotta go down and find out 
longenbaugh doesnt plan to open her new store until later this 
year but she expects it will offer more space than the cramped 
quarters of her sitka shop where the lack of order was enough to 
make a librarian faint thousands of books were crammed on shelves 
stacked on the floor and buried under desks everywhere except on 
a narrow ribbon of linoleum that snaked through the shops two 
small rooms 
the handprinted signs that separated the books by subject did 
little to alleviate the disheveled appearance longenbaughs 
passion for outofprint books long ago overcame any passing 
interest in library science 
im at the other end of the spectrum from the book dealer who 
has thousands of volumes and knows where every one is she said 
recently before the move 
longenbaugh began to turn her love for books and fascination 
with polarregion history into a business 13 years ago her 
children were growing up and she was looking for something fun and 
profitable to do with her time 
she started trading books from her home on a tiny island off 
sitkas waterfront but soon realized she needed a store in 1977 
she rented a small house on a back street and converted it into the 
observatory with 343 outofprint books on alaska 
today she has about 3000 volumes on alaska 6000 on other 
subjects 2200 historic prints and maps and dozens of reference 
books she began trading in maps and prints in 1979 after a buying 
trip to england 
i kept noticing in little towns there would be a little print 
and map shop she recalled i thought gosh i wonder if 
anybody in alaska would be interested in old maps of alaska 
they were alaskans comprised about 50 percent of longenbaughs 
clientele about 40 percent were from other states and about 10 
percent traded from overseas 
with virtually no advertising the selftaught 
historianbookseller built an international business she remains 
somewhat perplexed about how she became so wellknown among book 
and map collectors 
i dont know she said word of mouth i think 
although longenbaugh hopes to go upmarket somewhat with her 
santa fe store she easily resists being stereotyped as a 
highfalutin trader of rare books and maps 
on purpose i run a democratic bookstore my idea is that you 
can come into the shop and you may not see anything you like and 
you can leave but i dont want you to say there wasnt anything 
in that place i could afford 
good reading is good reading she said if its an old 
library discard thats ok the content is still perfectly good 
and its fun to read 
longenbaugh also rejects the notion that booksellers shouldnt 
specialize in their favorite subjects 
the rule of thumb goes you are never never to deal in a 
specialty where you yourself collect because you will cheat your 
customers by grabbing off the good stuff 
my feeling is if i dealt with something that bored me i 
wouldnt enjoy doing it sure i take one now and then but i 
always figure theres another copy out there the customer can 
have the next one 
a friendly woman with a hearty laugh and insatiable curiosity 
she revels in playing detective for customers seeking a particular 
outofprint book 
its just so much fun she said lots of dealers dont 
like to do book searches because they are so time consuming i 
charge a dollar and a half and im sure i spend a lot more than 
that 
her sitka customers now have to request that service by mail 
they also can no longer hear her classical music show on the local 
public radio station or enjoy her narration of the stations daily 
soap opera 
people like dee are irreplaceable said jake schumacher 
program director for kcawfm her particular combination of 
personality and talent is something that is rare even in a big 
city let alone in a town our size 
longenbaugh is touched by such sentiment bless their hearts 
everybodys being really regretful 
and im so pleased because think how horrible it would be to 
live in a place so many years and have nobody care when you took 
off

its horseshoes instead of horseback riding 
the movies are newer and the guest list is longer as president bush 
settles in at the weekend white house in the catoctin mountains of 
maryland 
in 37 weekends of bushs presidency he has been to the camp 
20 times six weekends have been spent at his oceanfront home in 
maine 
his stays at camp david usually begin with a jog aides say 
saturdays will typically include more athletic endeavors 
jogging tennis swimming horsehoe pitching and wally ball a 
form of vollyeball played on a squash court and work in his 
office 
sundays he attends interdenominational church services along 
with personnel from the camp which is operated by the navy 
barbara bush routinely accompanies her husband to the retreat 
she reads a lot does her mail takes work with her up 
there says anna perez the first ladys press secretary if 
her husband is having guests and they bring the spouses along 
which happens quite a bit shell maybe go bowling with the 
spouses she always goes swimming when shes up there they play 
tennis its a quiet time for her 
as was the case when ronald and nancy reagan used the camp 
friday and saturday nights are often devoted to films in the camps 
movie theater the reagans with backgrounds in the golden age of 
hollywood preferred old movies the bushes taste runs to newer 
offerings 
last weekend they watched sea of love and shirley 
valentine 
reagan used camp david 187 times more than any other president 
since franklin d roosevelt had it built in 1942 weekends for the 
reagans were usually quiet times spent without family or other 
visitors 
it was a place that the reagans enjoyed to be alone together 
and to unwind and to be away from the pressures of the gilded cage 
of the white house says mark weinberg a spokesman for the 
former president in los angeles 
the reagans son ron who visited the camp several times with 
his wife doria said the routine was to sleep late depending on 
the weather take a swim have a ride come back hang out and 
probably see a movie in the evening after dinner 
reagans daughter maureen has said she visited the camp only 
once his other daughter patti was estranged from her parents for 
much of the administration 
michael reagan and his wife colleen parents of the reagans 
only grandchildren were living in california and did not visit the 
camp 
for the bushes in contrast weekends at camp david often bring 
gatherings of family and friends 
the first familys newest grandchild ashley came to camp david 
on easter less than two months after she was born in denver to 
neil bush and his wife sharon the older grandchildren enjoy 
riding around the camp in golf carts 
you see grandkids putting around all the time says one aide 
who has accompanied the bushes to the retreat 65 miles northwest of 
washington 
one weekend the president invited pam shriver and a group for a 
weekend of tennis 
even foreign dignitaries have spend the night prince charles 
was there in february australian prime minister bob hawke went in 
june and egyptian president hosni mubarak was there last weekend 
one more thing there is now a nintendo game at camp david

the number of mergers and acquisitions in the 
united states trailed off during the third quarter although the 
dollar value of those deals was up according to a financial 
research company 
securities data co said mondat that 334 acquisitions of us 
companies worth 1147 billion were announced during the third 
quarter that compared with 357 transactions worth 923 billion in 
the first quarter and 378 deals worth 75 billion in the second 
quarter 
merger and acquisition activity has slowed as prices for 
companies has gone up and financing has been harder to come by the 
big banks that finance deals have become more cautious and 
investors are also more wary 
in reaching its totals securities data included acquisitions of 
majority and entire interests in us firms recapitalizations 
spinoffs selftenders and exchange offers for stock or securities 
convertible into stock each transaction was worth 10 million or 
more 
the figures included several major deals including the planned 
114 billion merger of bristolmyers co and squibb corp the 
proposed 36 billion acquisition of columbia pictures 
entertainment inc by sony corp and the planned 47 billion 
merger of citizens and southern corp with sovran financial corp 
they also included the approximately 55 billion in 
divestitures announced by rjr nabisco inc following its own 2453 
billion buyout earlier this year 
so far in 1989 there have been 1140 transactions totaling 
3025 billion down 14 percent from the 1256 deals totaling 
3531 billion during the first nine months of 1988 according to 
newark njbased securities data 
the companys figures also indicate a slowing in leveraged 
buyouts those made with largely borrowed funds 
leveraged buyouts declined to 24 deals totaling 199 billion in 
the third quarter compared with 47 deals worth 183 billion in 
the first quarter and 56 transactions totaling 196 billion in the 
second quarter 
for the year to date there have been 132 lbos totaling 577 
billion down sharply from 183 buyouts totaling 733 billion in 
the same period a year earlier 
lbo activity is expected to continue to decline because of 
uncertainty in junk bonds a popular form of financing for 
leveraged buyouts the junk bond market suffered heavy losses last 
month after campeau corp announced it was having difficulty 
meeting interest payments on some of its bonds 
campeau which relied heavily on junk bonds for its 66 billion 
buyout of federated department stores inc last year has received 
a 250 million loan from olympia amp york developments ltd so it 
could make its payments 
idd information services another financial information concern 
also reported a slowing of merger activity during the first three 
quarters of the year 
idd which tallied merger and acquisition activity around the 
world said 3666 targets worth 24853 billion were acquired 
during the first nine months of 1989 down from 4171 targets worth 
24857 billion 
the company noted that the 1989 dollar amount was swelled by the 
rjr nabisco deal without that transaction the drop in terms of 
dollars would have been sharper

equipped with driverside air bags about 500000 gm cars will have 
them and about 1 million ford lincoln and mercury cars will be 
equipped with the devices

prices set in august those who already have ordered 1990 ford 
thunderbird festiva and tempo and mercury cougar and topaz cars 
will get rebates since the retail price announced monday is lower 
than the preintroduction prices of those models spokesman dave 
krupp said 
he said other retail prices were the same as preintroductory 
quotes and some were higher those customers will not have to pay 
more 
gm ford and chrysler already have announced incentive plans for 
some of their 1990 model cars and trucks which would soften the

believes they will be called back if zenith wins a military 
contract on which it is bidding

lesauskis said of the sale which is subject to shareholder and 
regulatory approval 
it might be good this french company has markets overseas 
that might be helpful for the employees and company itself to 
expand

fatten his personal account 
the civil lawsuit filed monday in us district court claims 
that marc stuart weiner deposited 99000 in clients money into 
his own bank account and the rest into the accounts of nine other 
people from april 1986 to july 1987 
one alleged fraud involved 200000 from an elderly widow the 
sec said represented the proceeds from the sale of her home the 
lawsuit claims weiner invested only 80000 of the womans money 
and told her the remaining 120000 was safely invested despite 
discrepancies on her account statement 
according to the lawsuit weiner deposited 131000 into three 
accounts to satisfy gambling debts the sec said it is unaware of 
reasons for the remaining deposits

reimbursed 
according to the complaint weiner received individual orders 
ranging from 3000 to 120000 for basic brokerage accounts that 
included a choice of money funds and a checking account and bank 
card 
the sec charged that weiner simply did not open accounts for 
customers who gave him money and deposited checks into his own or 
other accounts in some cases he allegedly debited customer margin 
accounts to account for transactions 
merrill lynch spokesman fred yager said the firm discovered 
discrepancies in weiners accounts after he left the firm and 
reported them to the sec criminal agencies and prudentialbache 
yager said all merrill lynch clients were reimbursed for losses 
a telephone message left for a marc weiner in brooklyn was not 
immediately returned 
the sec names the allegedly defrauded clients as well as the 
alleged recipients of their money including those weiner allegedly 
paid off gambling debts

forseeable future 
the business research organizations consumer confidence index 
totaled 1154 in september the same as a month earlier the group 
said monday the july figure was 1204

measurement of consumer trust in the economic future based on 
buying plans job availability and general business conditions it 
is based on a 1985 base year of 100 
the sustained high level of public confidence despite some 
indications that business activity may be slowing is 
encouraging fabian linden executive director of the boards 
consumer research center said in a press release 
recent consumer survey findings do not show the slightest 
signs of recession he said the strong employment situation 
the benign pace of inflation and receding interest rates add up to 
a comfortable economic environment for the consumer 
the survey showed that nearly 27 percent of respondents thought 
business conditions were good roughly the same as a month earlier 
but opinion on job availability declined with 30 percent of 
respondents describing employment as plentiful vs 316 percent in 
august and about 33 percent in july

but plans to purchase cars rose to 78 percent of respondents 
vs 74 percent in august 71 percent in july and 67 percent in 
june 
consumer behavior is scrutinized by forecasters because it can 
provide important evidence on the direction of the economy 
consumerism accounts for a majority of us economic activity 
the conference board is a worldwide business network of 
companies from more than 50 countries based in new york

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home rose in august to the highest level 
in four months a housing industry group said 
the national association of realtors said monday its index rose 
to 1022 meaning that a family with a median income of 32992 had 
1022 percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing 
home costing 94900 
the association said the increase reflects both falling home 
prices and mortgage interest rates 
it was the highest level since the index read 1032 in april 
the median means that half of the families earn more and half 
less or that half the homes sell for more and half for less 
the nar said the median price for existing homes fell from 
96700 while interest rates dropped from 1039 percent to 1011 
percent it also said a 116 increase in the median income also 
helped raise the index 
the association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixedrate 
and adjustablerate mortgages 
the changes lowered the monthly principal and interest payment 
on a median home by 29 to 672 which represents 245 percent of 
the median familys income 
by region the median family in the midwest had 1344 percent of 
the income needed to purchase a medianpriced home southern 
families had 1013 percent western families 750 percent and 
residents of the northeast 725 percent 
realtors president ira gribin said that while the index reflects 
improved overall buying conditions it masks the difficulty 
firsttime buyers continue to experience 
in expensive areas home prices are so out of sync with 
incomes that renters with no equity are pushed out of the buying 
market he said

entrepreneur richard branson says he has sold a 25 
percent stake in his virgin music group to fujisankei 
communications group of japan for 150 million 
the stake would be the largest holding by a japanese company in 
an existing british concern virgin music said 
the announcement monday followed last weeks news that columbia 
pictures entertainment corp of the united states agreed to be 
acquired by sony corp of japan for 34 billion it also marks a 
trend of corporate takeovers in the us entertainment industry 
especially by foreign firms 
virgin music and the media conglomerate fujisankei through its 
subsidiary pony canyon inc plan to launch a new record label in 
japan to promote sales of top british pop artists in the far east 
virgin musics lineup includes singers mike oldfield phil 
collins peter gabriel keith richards simple minds human league 
ub40 and boy george many of them already popular in japan 
we could not have hoped for a better partner than fuji 
branson said they dont think just short term 
virgin music consciously chose a partnership which would not 
only ensure our future independence under existing management but 
would provide a springboard for our ambitions to become the worlds 
no 1 music group he said 
branson took virgin music private last year saying he wasnt 
happy with the stock markets valuation of the shares which were 
sold to the public in 1986 
virgin music had revenue of 400 million in 1988 making it the 
sixth largest record company in the world the company said 
branson also owns virgin atlantic airways a cutrate 
transatlantic airline 
virgin is the latest of independent record labels to be snapped 
up recently by big corporations following a trend in the music 
film and television business 
dutchowned polygram currently is in talks to purchase los 
angeles aampm records herb alperts label for a reported 500 
million 
in other deals in recent years mca records bought motown 
records for 61 million and thornemi of great britain paid about 
80 million for a 50 percent stake in britains chrysalis records 
the consolidation trend intensified this summer when philips 
polygram records unit bought independent island records for what 
analysts estimated was 300 million 
a stillindependent major label belongs to david geffen but it 
is closely allied with timewarner incs record unit which was 
one of the chief attractions in time incs 14 billion merger with 
warner in july 
among big labels cbs records was snapped up by sony corp and 
rca records was bought by bertelsman ag of west germany 
bucking the trend was mca records chief irving azoff who 
announced in august he was leaving mca to start his own label mca 
is negotiating with azoff to help fund the deal in a setup like the 
geffens with warner 
azoff estimated it would take 75 million to 100 million in 
funding to launch an independent record label and said all five 
competing us record distributors and several wall street 
investment groups have expressed interest in bankrolling him should 
the deal with mca fail

his clients industries read like an 
environmental hit list nuclear energy chemicals hazardous waste 
disposal and lawn care 
its not surprising that bruce mccarthy has made a big business 
out of crisis public relations 
companies that have turned to him for help include wr grace amp 
co borden incs chemical division and chemlawn corp 
he helped kemper insurance pull out of the highly regulated 
massachusetts auto insurance market without incurring fines and he 
represents new hampshire yankee operator of the troubled 
overbudget seabrook nh nuclear power plant 
mccarthys first job of course is to help such clients avoid 
debacles in the first place 
we tell them you live in a fishbowl today and you have to 
expect everything you do and say is going to land on the front page 
of your newspaper he said youre not going to be able to go 
back to your boardroom and communicate with no one but your 
shareholders those days are gone 
so when oil spills radiation leaks or regulatory agencies 
sting when government inspectors arrive to seize files and 
reporters descend to put tales of corporate wrongdoing on page one 
mccarthy provides damage control 
he prescribes an oldfashioned remedy newly in vogue in 
crisismanagement public relations tell all apologize if 
necessary make amends before the government and the courts make 
them for you 
full disclosure is where its at mccarthy said 
recentlydrench any kind of a crisis and any kind of a difficult 
story in information get it all out very quickly and assume its 
all going to come out in the end 
he argues that stonewalling only encourages reporters to dig for 
themselves with help from the corporations foes if a company 
gets the facts out fast the media will quickly lose interest in 
the story 
mccarthys nemesis is the corporate attorney 
when disaster strikes attorneys frequently counsel executives 
to say as little as possible and especially not to apologize lest 
those statements be used against them in a liability suit 
often times the attorney wins and that leads to negative 
stories that run on for days said mccarthy 54 who cut his 
teeth in public relations as a utility company spokesman during the 
arab oil embargo then eventually the company relents and decides 
to open up but by that time so much damage has been done and they 
are so defensive that it usually works against them 
advice costs 50 to 200 an hour at mccarthys 5yearold bmc 
strategies inc in the boston suburb of lexington 
though he has been successful his staff of 30 is up against 
tough competitors including major law firms with more specializing 
in governmental relations that can mean anything from lobbying 
lawmakers to negotiating with regulatory agencies to running 
interference with the media 
william weld former head of the us justice departments 
criminal division has launched a unit within the boston law firm 
of hale amp dorr representing companies or individuals who find 
themselves the targets of white collar crime investigations 
weld agreed that candor usually pays but he said he would 
advise the company to meet privately with government officials 
first 
the worst thing i think for a company in trouble to do is 
for the ceo to go public and declare we are blameless and then 
be left twisting in the wind as three weeks of negative details 
come out weld said 
but he warned you dont want to take a shot into the unknown 
and make a statement which is essentially a guilty plea toward a 
felony without having some notion of what the government attitude 
is likely to be 
kate mcdonough managing director of the adams amp rinehart public 
relations agency in new york said the way a company responds to a 
crisis can influence prosecutor judge and jury 
did the company try to cover up or did it act responsibly 
those are issues that are legitimately put before the court 
mcdonough said 
whether the public approves of a companys response to a 
disaster can affect the bottom line just as much as a lawsuit she 
added 
because of johnson amp johnsons quick candid and aggressive 
response to the tylenol poisonings a few years ago the market 
share of the painkiller actually increased after the incident she 
said but exxon corp widely faulted for its response to the 
valdez oil spill was threatened with a consumer boycott

zenith electronics corp is returning to its 
consumerelectronics roots with the proposed sale of its computer 
unit but the future of the last major usbased television maker 
remains fuzzy 
both the north american television market and the stock market 
appear to be friendly toward zenith at the moment 
but experts say there are no guarantees that the highdefinition 
television technologies to which zenith is committed will ever find 
a large market or that zenith will be able to survive in a sea of 
hungry foreign competitors 
its a good company but its not a good business said james 
magid an electronicsindustry analyst with the new york investment 
firm needham amp co inc 
glenviewbased zenith announced monday it had agreed to sell its 
computer unit to frances groupe bull and would use the proceeds to 
lighten its debt load and sharpen its focus on new television 
technology 
the decision surprised some observers since the company had 
long been rumored to be seeking a buyer for its 
consumerelectronics unit by far the weaker of zeniths two major 
divisions 
but zenith received only firesale prices for its television 
business so it decided to sell its computer division instead 
which makes personal and laptop models chairman jerry k pearlman 
told a news conference monday in new york 
we are a highly leveraged company in two very tough 
businesses he said we couldnt do either of them appropriate 
justice 
zeniths stock surged 325 to close at 1725 a share monday on 
the new york stock exchange 
pearlman and industry analysts said the deal valued at more 
than 600 million would give zenith a solid financial base from 
which to continue battling foreign competitors 
pearlman estimated zeniths total debt at 600 million he said 
zenith will pay down all its shortterm debt and a portion of its 
longterm debt with the money from the sale leaving it with less 
than 50 million in proceeds to be used for other things 
in a statement zenith said it would use some of the cash from 
the sale to fund work on new consumer electronics and component 
technologies particularly highdefinition television and advanced 
highresolution color displays 
analysts said highdefinition television which produces much 
sharper pictures than todays television screens is something of a 
gamble given the unknown size of the market 
hdtv is only one piece a futuristic piece of the consumer 
electronics pie said analyst laura lederman of duff amp phelps 
inc in chicago and its a piece of pie that hasnt even been 
baked yet 
faced with the possibility of a foreign onslaught of hdtv sets 
the commerce department proposed last year that the government take 
a major role in hdtv research in this country 
but the bush administration now considers hdtv just one of 
several telecommunications technologies worthy of federal support 
said eileen dougherty a spokeswoman for the national 
telecommunications and information administration 
ms dougherty denied any reduction in the administrations 
commitment to assist hdtvs development 
there may appear to be less of a commitment only because hdtv 
is now being considered along with the broader issue of 
telecommunications she said 
another zenith technology the flattensionmask video monitor 
is the industry standard in the portable computer field analysts 
said and would represent a significant improvement in television 
picture quality if it could be enlarged with or without 
accompanying hdtv components 
zenith envisions the flat tension mask as one component of an 
hdtv system 
the deal to sell the computer division which is subject to 
shareholder and regulatory approval was seen as a coup for 
parisbased bull which will acquire zeniths successful and highly 
regarded supersport line of laptop computers as part of the 
purchase 
the 10yearold computer division which employs 4000 of 
zeniths 37000 workers has been a bright performer for zenith 
during a decade that proved disastrous to the us television 
industry 
but television prices stabilized this year halting an 
eightyear slide and are expected to rise next year due in part 
to a shortage of glass for picture tubes 
meanwhile zeniths computer sales have begun to sag 
last month the company announced it was deferring employee 
raises as part of a costcutting program to combat losses from 
slack computer sales 
zenith turned a profit of 117 million last year after three 
years of widening losses but had a net loss of 17 million for the 
first half of 1989

house leaders say the angry reaction of senior 
citizens toward the medicare catastrophic illness plan will push 
congress away from addressing the major health needs of the 
elderly perhaps for years 
catastrophic illness protection was considered one of the major 
achievements of president reagans second term but elderly groups 
have mobilized their members against it and the house was on the 
brink of voting a repeal today 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said monday there was a mood 
of frustration among house members most would want to let the 
dust settle before embracing any new comprehensive plans to provide 
catastrophic illness insurance or longterm care he said 
i think they lawmakers feel theyd just like to get rid of 
this annoyance and they certainly are going to be very skeptical 
when i come to them in the future with a bill to help the senior 
citizens said rep fortney stark dcalif chairman of the 
house ways and means subcommittee on health 
stark and rep henry waxman dcalif were asking the house 
today to approve an amendment that would salvage a portion of the 
health programs benefits including some coverage for prescription 
drugs stark said his chances at best were even 
stark said supporters of the catastrophic care program lost 
the information battle to groups that preyed on the fears of the 
elderly many elderly were led by hysteriamongers to believe 
their costs were astronomical and chances of benefits unlikely he 
said 
its very easy to take very fragile very insecure seniors who 
are easily confused and confuse them even further he said 
while the bush administration has officially endorsed keeping 
the program the president has avoided personal involvement with 
that politically unpopular stance house republicans have announced 
they will vote in a bloc to kill the plan and say they have 
assurances bush would sign a repeal 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday the white 
house position was to retain the benefits and mitigate the 
premium costs but it wasnt endorsing any specific proposal 
foley said the house democratic leaders werent taking an 
official stance either although he personally supported the 
starkwaxman approach 
if it is going to be meaningful up here there must be some 
effort on the part of the president to persuade the members to cast 
their votes against repeal he said 
if he bush did half as much as he did on capital gains tax 
wed have a real zinger tomorrow stark said referring to the 
presidents victory last week on his tax cut proposal 
foley while critical of the president for sitting out the 
controversy on catastrophic health care said he wasnt sure the 
white house could turn the tide at this point 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act was aimed at protecting 
the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a 
prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs 
the program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a 
onceayear deductible of 560 in 1989 previously medicare 
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year 
the plan also limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for 
hospital care physician services medical supplies and 
prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well 
but the elderly many of whom had some similar benefits from 
private insurance plans objected to paying for the new federal 
coverage the surtax could be as high as 800 this year and higher 
in the future for upperincome elderly

northwest airlines will be bigger and its 
employees more personable in five years if its new owners 
accomplish their goals 
personal relations of our people with the passengers is whats 
going to be the biggest difference said alfred checchi who led 
a 365 billion buyout of northwests parent company in june and 
replaced steven rothmeier as chairman last week 
if you can move a few market share points to your aircraft 
you really drive the economics of this business he said 
checchi and northwest president frederic malek said monday that 
the timing of rothmeiers resignation was a mild surprise but they 
said his departure was not altogether unexpected given that the 
43yearold rothmeier is a relatively young executive who was not 
accustomed to reporting to a group of private investors 
he made it clear from the very first day he would be assessing 
the situation checchi said a man like steve undoubtedly has a 
lot of options 
rothmeiers three top officers also resigned last week but 
malek and checchi said they do not expect other executives to leave 
nwa inc malek one of the investors in the nwa buyout said he has 
met individually with about 30 northwest executives and discussed 
possible pay raises 
we believe we have the enthusiastic participation from 
everyone who is left malek said 
neither checchi nor malek has airline experience and the two 
former marriott corp officers said they are relying heavily on the 
experience of senior employees 
in a wideranging 90minute news conference monday the two men 
said 
management will consider selling stock to employees and 
possibly making northwest a public company again through a public 
stock sale if the money is needed for expansion or other reasons 
northwest is within weeks of announcing a purchase of new 
airplanes checchi and malek did not identify the companies they 
are negotiating with or how much money they intend to spend 
the airline intends to expand its pacific rim routes and its 
domestic flight schedule a move that could require additional 
financing 
the airline is evaluating 15 to 20 proposals to develop its 
land in japan which some analysts have said could fetch up to 500 
million if sold checchi said the proposed deals would improve 
the property and liberate cash he said one of the proposals 
will be chosen during the first three months of next year 
james cronin hired last week as executive vice president is 
exploring the possibility of starting an airplane leasing 
subsidiary for northwest 
checchi and malek said their chief concern is to make northwest 
the airline of choice for business and leisure travelers northwest 
does not now enjoy that status they said 
after northwest acquired republic airlines in 1986 for 884 
million performance at the nations fourthlargest carrier 
suffered late arrival and baggage complaints were common as 
management was slow in bringing former republic workers up to par 
in pay with their northwest counterparts 
we are in the fortuante position that the hard work from that 
acquisition is virtually complete checchi said 
checchi said he will spend most of the next year meeting with 
northwest employees around the globe to boost morale and tap the 
workers for ideas he said he wants to give autonomy to managers at 
the lowest levels of the hierarchy as part of his philosophy of 
decentralized decisionmaking 
the two stressed that they do not view themselves as interim 
managers 
we are operating executives who have taken a longterm point 
of view said malek a finalist in december 1987 for the top job 
at united airlines 
said checchi this has got to be the most exciting industry in 
the world i mean it is fun 
checchi said he has not decided how to replace 230 million in 
equity that belongs to klm royal dutch airlines transportation 
secretary samuel skinner ordered northwest to reduce klms 
investment in the buyout by that much to reduce concerns about 
foreign ownership of us airlines

hong kong has withstood economic damage from the 
june crackdown on chinas democracy movement though it is facing a 
serious problem in building confidence in the capitalist british 
territory that reverts to chinese rule in seven years its 
financial secretary says 
i am not going to tell you that we have no problems in hong 
kong and that everything is as right as rain sir piers jacobs 
said monday in a speech to the asia society in new york where he 
was visiting business executives and bankers 
but jacobs said i have every reason to believe that hong 
kong will come out of recent events fitter and more vigorous than 
before ours is a city of survivors well used to living on the 
edge 
thousands of hong kong residents have sought to leave the 
capitalist territory adjoining southern china since the violent 
military suppression of a studentled democracy drive three months 
ago in beijing by some estimates emigration will rise 25 percent 
next year to 55000 
the chinese communist governments handling of the crackdown 
suggested to many wouldbe hong kong emigrants that it will violate 
an agreement to preserve hong kongs capitalist way of life for 50 
years beyond the takeover in 1997 
the rising number of people seeking sanctuary abroad has 
depressed hong kong stocks and property values caused a 
braindrain in many industries and raised pressure on britain 
to provide refuge for those who want to leave 
moreover unease about hong kongs future has spread increasing 
doubts about the territorys role as one of the most dynamic and 
productive economic centers of asia 
as part of his argument to dispel these doubts jacobs carried a 
list of 20 major international investments in hong kong since the 
crackdown in tiananmen square 
among them are a 667 million citicorp loan for a highrise 
office complex in which the us bank will retain a 10 percent 
stake a 134 billion loan from a consortium of banks to finance 
expansion of hong kongs container port a commitment from walt 
disney to base its pacific headquarters in hong kong and an 
agreement by mobil corp to double its oilterminal capacity there 
what has been the effect on our economy of the recent events 
in china and in particular tiananmen square surprisingly perhaps 
the answer is not very great jacobs said 
he said although the emigration of talented professionals was 
regrettable there can be absolutely no question of our impeding 
their departure in any way whatsoever what we have to do is to 
provide the right sort of environment to persuade people to stay or 
even to encourage them to return 
the finance official was in the united states for talks with 
international bankers and business executives american companies 
historically have been the biggest foreign investors in hong kong 
and their role there is deemed crucial for the territory to thrive

international business machines corp cray research inc and 
motorola inc have announced plans to eliminate the jobs of 
hundreds of workers each to cut costs 
ibm said monday it is offering special payments to people who 
quit or retire at four locations a step that is expected to cut 
600 to 1000 jobs 
the job cuts which are voluntary represent less than half of 1 
percent of ibms us work force of 223000 
the four locations are owego ny and manassas va where ibm 
makes specialized equipment for defense contracts endicott ny 
where it makes the 9370 line of minicomputers and lexington ky 
where it makes typewriters and printers 
most of the people who will be offered the special payments are 
in administrative and support areas ibm spokesman john reilly 
said they will be given a bonus of one weeks pay for each six 
months they have worked for ibm up to a maximum of one years pay 
ibm spokesman peter thonis said the cost of the cuts would not 
significantly hurt the companys profits he said the cuts were not 
related to a slowdown in sales of products made at the four 
locations 
schaumburg illbased motorola inc announced monday a plan to 
reduce its 105000employee work force by about 2500 positions 
primarily salaried jobs at its us plants 
weve improved our normal voluntary severance package said 
motorola spokesman chuck sengstock those applying who are 
accepted will now receive two weeks severance pay for each year of 
service 
sengstock said most of those being urged to take the severance 
package work in the electronics companys communications and 
semiconductor products groups 
if not enough workers take the severance package there may be 
layoffs said sengstock 
the company said a pretax provision of about 43 million to 
cover the cost of the severance program would be reflected in 
thirdquarter earnings to be announced next week 
motorola president george fisher said the program simply 
reflects what we at motorola consider to be good and prudent 
management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base 
he said the company was not predicting an earnings downturn 
the package will be offered to workers at selected motorola 
facilities until about midnovember sengstock said he mentioned 
plants in chicago phoenix austin texas fort worth texas fort 
lauderdale fla and boynton beach fla as among the facilities 
where salaried employees would be encouraged to take severance 
cray research one of the worlds largest supercomputer 
manufacturers announced monday it is laying off 400 employees at 
two wisconsin plants 
the layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and 
the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture todays 
supercomputer systems the minneapolisbased company said cray 
said it has essentially completed the transition from the cray xmp 
system to the more advanced cray ymp product line 
cray has about 5400 employees worldwide 
the company said all costs associated with the manufacturing 
work force reduction would be incurred in 1989 and are expected to 
total about 3 million 
cray said it was eliminating 280 jobs at chippewa falls and 120 
at its rice lake plant 
the company offered full salary to the end of year for any 
employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month any layoffs 
will be based on seniority cray said 
workers who lose their jobs would also get 4000 in education 
grants the company said

inc will remain american even after the company is acquired by 
sony corp for 34 billion sony chairman akio morita said tuesday 
morita said sony will leave filmmaking decisions to american 
managers just as it has left daytoday management of cbs records 
which it acquired in 1987 to local executives industry analysts 
say sony has taken a handsoff approach to running cbs records the 
worlds largest music company 
columbia pictures and cbs records will remain in the hands of 
american management morita told a news conference 
we manage our subsidiaries as autonomous businesses and though 
we provide financial backing we give complete autonomy and make a 
business environment where local people can do creative work 
on tuesday cocacola cos board of directors gave formal 
approval to the sale of the companys 538 million shares of 
columbia pictures to sony usa inc a subsidiary of sony at 27 a 
share 
with that completed morita said sonys tender offer for the 
shares would begin wednesday 
morita said sony has no immediate plans to send japanese 
executives to work at columbia and said his company would work to 
allay fears of a japanese invasion 
some americans have expressed concern that sony may use its 
ownership for propaganda purposes or may censor films critical 
of japan congresswoman helen delich bentley has called for an 
investigation into whether sonys takeover of columbia will reduce 
competition thereby violating antitrust laws kyodo news service 
reported 
critics in both japan and the united states have raised fears 
that the takeover may increase friction at a time when a 50 
billion bilateral trade imbalance and rapidly increasing japanese 
investment in the united states are raising economic tensions 
i think its too bad such concerns have been raised morita 
said 
he stressed that the takeover was a friendly one welcomed by 
columbia and said he expected the relationship would follow the 
pattern of sonys buyout of cbs records 
in the united states i spoke with cbs records executives and 
they said thank you very much for buying us and i was very happy 
when i heard that morita said we worked hard to make a good 
working environment and theyre completely satisfied 
morita said he hoped that rather than increasing friction 
sonys management of us entertainment firms would set a good 
example 
if we show the acquisition of columbia is a success for 
its american employees we can remove apprehensions and concerns 
and americans may no longer feel japanese are strangers or cant be 
understood morita said 
he said recent takeovers by nonjapanese firms have not raised 
as many fears among americans australianborn media tycoon rupert 
murdoch bought 20thcentury fox and the australian firm qintex 
entertainment recently purchased mgmua communications with less

usx corp could get 15 billion for the 
natural gas and oil reserves it has offered for sale through its 
texas oil amp gas corp subsidiary wall street analysts said 
a sale would leave texas oil with its biggest business gas 
gathering still intact but would eliminate a business that one 
analyst said was draining the subsidiary 
i estimate that txos producing properties are losing 30 
million to 40 million per year on an operating basis said david 
n fleischer of prudential bache securities 
the pittsburghbased steel and energy giant said it would use 
the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 58 billion debt and to 
buy back stock in an effort to boost shareholder value and enhance 
its balance sheet 
texas oil has been a disappointment to usx since it was acquired 
in 1986 in a 3 billion stock swap 
i think shareholders have just lost their patience 
fleischer said monday after the sale was announced 
usx is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably 
will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stocks 
value now he said 
this is a very strong statement that theyre committed to 
shareholders fleischer said 
chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate 
raider carl icahn who holds an 11 percent stake in usx 
fleischer and analyst frank bracken of fidelity investments of 
boston valued the reserves at around 15 billion a sale is 
anticipated by years end said usx spokesman william e keslar 
who declined to say how usx values the reserves 
usx said it has retained the investment banking firm first 
boston corp to handle the sale the reserves are principally 
located in texas oklahoma arkansas louisiana colorado and 
kansas 
after racking up impressive operating income of 547 million in 
1984 and 377 million in 1985 texas oil amp gas reported an 
operating loss of 21 million the year usx acquired it it then 
broke about even with 2 million the next year and lost 31 million 
last year 
the sale besides boosting texas oils earnings will help with 
usxs goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of stock 
or raise the dividend he said 
usx had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at texas oil on 
the prospect of a surge in natural gas prices 
im bullish on gas prices bracken said id expect over 
the next two to three years gas would reach btu parity with oil 
if priced equally with the energy content of oil at 20 per 
barrel gas would cost 250 to 275 per thousand cubic feet he 
said the spot price of gas now is around 150 per thousand cubic 
feet although it is expected to average 160 to 175 for the 
year 
texas oil has 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in reserve 
about a quarter of the 35 trillion cubic feet held by the other 
usx subsidiary marathon oil co texas oil has 28 million barrels 
of oil or 3 percent of marathons 766 million 
the sale would not affect gas gathering the bulk of txos 
business or contract drilling usx said the steel company will 
retain texas oils vast transmission business as well as its gas 
gathering and contract drilling business 
gas gathering accounted for 538 million of txos 937 million 
in total sales last year drilling and other activites had sales 
totaling 41 million 
the remainder or 358 million came from the sale of petroleum

european foreign ministers tuesday adopted a 
measure intended to prompt local television stations to use mostly 
homegrown programs 
the officials representing the 12 nations of the european 
community approved the proposal during the start of daylong talks 
on a range of foreign policy and trade issues 
only belgium and denmark opposed the tv plan according to a 
community spokesman who demanded anonymity 
the proposal called television without frontiers has sparked 
sharp complaints from the us government and film industry 
it sets out the trading blocs blueprint for opening up tv 
broadcasting as part of the move to a single europeanwide market 
of 320 million consumers in late 1992 by that date the dozen 
nations of the common market intend to remove the many trade 
barriers restricting the free movement of money goods services 
and people 
the tv measure would enable broadcasters in europe to transmit 
channels throughout the trading bloc as long as they did not 
violate certain moral and other standards 
but it also contained a provision designed to ensure that 
where practicable a majority of entertainment programs shown 
on european television be made in europe 
in approving the measure the foreign ministers agreed on 
wording that according to the spokesman says this is an 
obligation which is politically binding on member states to 
achieve 
the united states has urged the community to scrap the plan the 
american tv industry said its european earnings would be seriously 
hurt by such a restriction 
during a european swing last month us trade representative 
carla hills reiterated the american opposition 
we are not in favor of local content in any context and more 
particularly in the province of thoughts she said 
local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a 
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically 
there has been concern in the united states about several 
community proposals that would appear to throw up protectionist 
barriers around the europeanwide market in 1992 
mrs hills had earlier written key members of the european 
parliament the communitys legislative body to complain about the 
tv measure 
community quotas she wrote would be blatantly 
discriminatory patently unjustifiable and would almost certainly 
have a disastrous effect on the us industrys substantial 
european earnings 
defenders of quotas argued that european culture was at stake 
they fear a flood of american soap operas sitcoms and other 
programs would tie up the airwaves 
news sports and game shows would be excluded

a former soybean trader at the chicago board of 
trade became the 13th person to plead guilty in connection with a 
federal investigation into illegal commodity trading activity 
john eggum 47 pleaded guilty monday to two counts of mail 
fraud before us district court judge william t hart eggum 
admitted to making a prearranged trade with an undercover fbi 
agent said assistant us attorney mark rotert 
eggum misled the customer by noting a false time for placing 
his order and made about 125 on may 19 1988 on a curb trade 
after official trading had ended rotert said 
also on jan 5 1989 eggum admitted to making 50 for a fellow 
trader to make up for a mistake eggum had made rotert said 
he deliberately sold at a price below what the lot was 
trading he said he used the customer order to repay another 
trader 
the charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine but prosecutors have said they will seek lighter 
sentences for those who agreed to cooperate 
the trader to whom eggum paid the 50 was harry patten iii who 
already has entered a guilty plea for two counts of violation of 
the commodities exchange act 
the fbi spent 2 years investigating fraudulent trading at the 
bot and chicago mercantile exchange in all 46 traders and a clerk 
were indicted thirteen people have pleaded guilty and three have 
not yet entered pleas the rest have pleaded innocent

teamsters joint council 73 weary of 
wisecracks about former union president jimmy hoffa has passed a 
resolution condemning politicians who make jokes about his 
disappearance 
the resolution was adopted unanimously monday by the joint 
councils legislative conference in atlantic city the council 
represents most union locals in new york and new jersey with a 
total of about 100000 members 
in an interview in the november issue of playboy magazine a 
selfprofessed hitman claims hoffas body was buried near the west 
end zone of giants stadium in east rutherford 
gov thomas kean seeking to boost fellow republican james 
courters bid to replace him invoked hoffas name in taking a jab 
at the democratic gubernatorial nominee rep james florio 
trying to find out where jim florio stands is like trying to 
find out where jimmy hoffa is buried and its not under giants 
stadium kean said last week in addressing a gop fundraiser that 
was attended by president bush 
anthony rizzo business manager of teamsters local 945 in wayne 
introduced the measure 
if you dont have any respect for the man then think at least deadline 
at hand the united 
states and egypt are exerting heavy pressure on israel to go along 
with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with palestinian 
representatives 
egyptian president hosni mubarak sounded upbeat monday about 
prospects for a peace settlement saying a golden opportunity 
exists that must not be squandered 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has been campaigning 
hard for a more flexible israeli position on the issue said israel 
should not feel threatened by the 10point proposal for peace talks 
set forth by mubarak 
the inner cabinet of ministers from likud and labor is to meet 
thursday on mubaraks ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed 
likud rejects mubaraks acceptance of a usbacked formula that 
involves trading occupied land for peace and including people 
deported by israel in a palestinian negotiating delegation labor 
led by finance minister shimon peres supports both ideas 
meanwhile president bush called israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir on monday and told him a dialogue was necessary between 
israel and the palestinians presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater disclosed today 
fitzwater said that bush spoke with the israeli leader for 
just a few minutes in advance of mondays white house meeting 
with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
the discussion was very general fitzwater said saying bush 
contacted shamir mainly as a courtesy 
he emphasized our interest in the peace processthat he 
obviously felt a dialogue was necessary fitzwater said 
mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peace 
process is to persuade the israelis and the palestinians to enter a 
dialogue without preconditions 
we wont get to peace until palestinians and israelis speak to 
each other baker said 
baker regards the egyptian plan as a complement to not a 
substitute for shamirs proposal for elections in which 
palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with israel 
on limited selfgovernment in the occupied territories 
mondays white house session came amid new concern that settling 
jewish immigrants from the soviet union in the israelioccupied 
west bank could threaten peace efforts 
bush administration officials reacted coolly to an israeli 
request for 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 
100000 jewish emigres from the soviet union israeli officials 
have said some dwellings probably will be in the west bank 
the united states policy is to oppose additional settlements 
in the occupied territories baker said 
baker also said us ability to assist israel is limited by 
severe budgetary constraints

payments of 35 million the largest age 
discrimination settlement ever reached by the equal employment 
opportunity commission may be out of reach for 4000 westinghouse 
electric corp retirees due to a us supreme court ruling a legal 
specialist said 
the court on monday overturned a lower ruling that the 
pittsburghbased electronics and electric power giant had 
discriminated against the retirees when it offered them a choice 
between severence pay or early pensions the employees could not 
have both under the company program 
backed by a us 3rd circuit court of appeals ruling favoring 
the retirees the eeoc negotiated a settlement with westinghouse a 
year ago the 4000 employees would have shared 35 million or an 
average of 8700 per person to settle their claims 
eeoc spokeswoman deborah graham in washington said the 
westinghouse case was the commissions largest age discrimination 
settlement 
the eeoc however decided instead to seek a court ruling she 
said 
it means they blew it they got greedy in my opinion said 
dick lauver a pittsburgh pension lawyer who was not involved in 
the case they chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get 
a favorable court decision 
the case is far from over said donald livingston special 
assistant to the eeoc general counsel in washington there are 
still a number of areas for the court to decide 
if the eeoc was a law firm they could probably be sued for 
negligence lauver said those westinghouse employees are 
probably very upset 
westinghouse said it was delighted with mondays supreme court 
ruling the company will ask the 3rd circuit court to reconsider 
its case in light of the new ruling and a supreme court ruling in 
june that puts more of a burden on the employee to prove 
discrimination

franchise and selling interests in three southern states to contel 
cellular inc 
the first agreement could lead to mccaw gaining sole control 
over one of the two cellulartelephone franchises in new york the 
nations biggest market 
the second covering 13 mobiletelephone franchises in alabama 
kentucky and tennessee would make the contel corp subsidiary the 
nations seventhlargest cellular phone company according to a 
statement issued by mccaw the largest 
the statement said mccaw signed an agreement to acquire the 
metromedia co interest in one of two new york cellular franchises 
for 19 billion in cash about 275 per pop subject to a 
45day right of first refusal by lin broadcasting corp 
a pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a market 
area population by the percentage ownership of a cellular company 
serving the market two cellular franchises one for the local 
telephone company and one for an independent operation like mccaw 
are available in each market 
the metromedia deal would give mccaw a 50 percent voting 
interest and 4567 percent equity interest in the new york 
franchise 
lin holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity 
interest in the franchise which would be controlled entirely by

mccaws separate 110ashare cash tender offer for the 
approximately 53 million shares in lin a deal amounting to 250 to 
265 a pop has been extended to oct 13 mccaw lins largest 
shareholder with a 10 percent interest has been tendered more than 
8 million shares said tom campo at adams amp rinehart representing 
mccaw in new york 
the contel agreement would provide mccaw about 13 billion in 
cash about 205 a pop subject to closing price adjustments 
the metromedia deal covers about 68 million pops and the contel 
deal about 61 million pops 
these are two more steps toward achieving our longstanding 
strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that 
will give american consumers an independent alternative to 
traditional providers of telephone service mccaw chairman craig 
o mccaw said 
he described contel as a fellow independent with whom we have 
had a long and mutually beneficial relationship 
mccaw based in this seattle suburb operates in 127 areas with 
a total of 50 million pops in 26 states including major regional 
systems along the west coast and in the rocky mountains northeast

brazil the worlds biggest coffee producer 
dashed hopes wednesday of any early agreement to bring the 
depressed world coffee market back under international control 
brazils chief coffee executive jorio dauster said there was 
no chance of having quotas again in the near future because 
members of the international coffee group cant come to terms on 
export limits that ultimately set prices 
dauster heads the brazilian delegation attending talks in london 
at the international coffee organization 
i dont see any real change in the positions that led us into 
the deadlock dauster told reporters at a news conference we 
should not rush into new negotiations unless we see that the 
elements that led us to deadlock have been removed 
the organization monday announced a twoyear extension of the 
international coffee agreement retroactive to sunday but without 
any pricesupport provisions 
the agreement keeps in existence the international coffee 
organization as a forum for discussing matters of mutual concern to 
41 coffee exporting countries and 18 importing countries 
the organization was propping up prices in the glutted world 
market through export quotas aimed at supporting prices of beans at 
120 per pound or more 
the organizations regulatory powers were suspended indefinitely 
on july 4 after the united states pulled out in a price dispute 
with coffeeproducing nations the united states wanted an increase 
in export quotas for higherquality coffees enjoyed by us 
consumers 
since july the price of coffee beans has dropped by more than 
30 percent to a 14year low threatening a huge loss in income for 
producing countries such as uganda the ivory coast colombia and 
most central american nations where coffee is one of the top 
foreign income earners 
the suspension of quotas followed a fight among producers over 
export market shares 
in the previous negotiations brazil resisted moves to cut its 
30 percent share of the export quota to bump up the allocation of 
central american producers of the popular mild arabica variety 
colombia the worlds second biggest producer has led the 
campaign to bring back quotas seeing increased export earnings as 
critical to help it finance the fight against the countrys drug 
cartel

mgm grand inc announced plans 
today to convert a las vegas golf course into a movie theme park 
and a 5000room hotelcasino in efforts to entice both family 
funseekers and high rollers 
the theme as far as movies is concerned has always been an 
interesting mouse trap said mgm grand chairman fred benninger at 
a news conference here 
the kirk kerkorianowned company has agreed to purchase 115 
acres on the strip the current site of the marina hotel and casino 
and tropicana country club and golf course for the asyet named 
theme park said benninger 
the purchase of the land means mgm will construct a theme park 
twice the size originally planned for property on the mgmowned 
desert inn 
the purchase price was not revealed but benninger said that mgm 
grand plans to spend as much as 700 million to add 4300 rooms to 
the 700room marina and to build the theme park with a working film 
and television studio 
the mgm grand complex to open in 1992 is the latest effort to 
woo families to las vegas circus circus the first resort to do so 
more than a decade ago is now one of the most successful gaming 
and entertainment operations in nevada 
clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for 
quite a while and i believe its another extension of what las 
vegas stands for said harold vogel the veteran entertainment 
analyst for merrill lynch amp co 
its an adult resort and now theyre going to extend it so 
the rest of the family members can enjoy it too vogel said 
thursday 
mgm grand a separate company from mgmua owns an allfrills 
los angelesnew york airline and the desert inn in las vegas it 
also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous mgm lion 
the beverly hills billionaire 72 had sold and bought back bits 
and pieces of mgmua for two decades a period during which he also 
traded las vegas hotels the way most people buy cars 
then last month australias qintex group agreed to purchase 
mgmua including the original lion logo for 15 billion 
outbidding media mogul rupert murdoch by 100 million 
las vegas city and tourism officials have said for years that 
the city needed a major theme park to help attract families as 
visitors a water theme park built on the las vegas strip five 
years ago has been extremely successful 
las vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year up 
from 11 million in 1980 
the city is approaching the size that could support such a 
venture boosters of the idea say las vegas had 300000 residents 
eight years ago today it has more than 700000 and is one of the 
fastest growing cities in the country 
a fire at the original mgm grand hotel in las vegas which 
kerkorian built in 1973 killed 84 people in 1980 in 1985 
kerkorian sold that mgm grand and its sister hotel in reno to bally 
manufacturing co of chicago for nearly 500 million

new home sales fell a slight 04 percent in 
august but remained over 750000 for the second straight month the 
government reported tuesday as buyers took advantage of lower 
interest rates 
analysts had forecast a steeper slide in august sales from a 
doubledigit gain in july the largest advance in three years they 
said the pace cannot be sustained but will remain healthy for the 
rest of the year 
the commerce department said that new singlefamily homes were 
sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 755000 in august a 
relatively small drop from julys revised 758000 rate which was a 
161 percent increase over june 
the commerce report indicated new home sales were stronger 
throughout the summer than previously thought not only was the 
july figure revised upward so too were the may and june figures 
both of which totaled 653000 units 
it appears that the new home market is steaming along said 
economist john a tuccillo of the national association of realtors 
what is noteworthy about the august numbers is not that they have 
gone down but that sales remained at an extremely high level 
the sales improvement was attributed by analysts to fixedrate 
mortgages that dropped from an 1122 percent peak in march to 981 
percent at the end of august 
the lower rates also improved sales of existing homes which 
according to the national association of realtors rose 33 percent 
in august to 344 million units 
however mortgage rates had climbed back up to 1016 percent by 
last friday according to a survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp and analysts said the increase will affect future 
sales 
it will be difficult to maintain this new home sales rate 
particularly since mortgage rates have increased said michael 
carliner an economist at the national association of home builders 
richard peach an economist at the mortgage bankers association 
agreed the current pace is not sustainable but said a sales range 
of between 680000 to 700000 still would be a very healthy pace 
for the new home market 
mark obrinsky an economist at the federal national mortgage 
association also said the summer sales which lowered inventories 
from an eightmonth backlog in july to a sixmonth supply 
currently should result in increased singlefamily housing starts 
this fall 
despite the recent boom sales for the first eight months were 
held back 27 percent from the same period in 1988 by the higher 
interest rates earlier in the year as the federal reserve tightened 
credit to slow inflation 
sales of new homes in the northeast which had jumped 50 percent 
to 108000 units in july slipped 09 percent in august to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107000 units 
sales in the midwest were down 279 percent to 93000 units 
after rising 267 percent to 12900 units a month earlier sales in 
the south rose 62 percent to 310000 and were up 66 percent in 
the west to 244000 units 
the commerce department report said the median price of a new 
home was 122900 in august up 60 percent from 116000 in july 
the median is the point where half of the homes sold for more and 
half for less 
the average price of a new home rose 146 percent to 162300

agreed to buy fm radio stations in denver and tampa fla and will 
seek a waiver to operate the tampa station in a market where the 
company operates a television station 
great american did not disclose what it will pay sandusky radio 
for the two stations kbpi in denver and wkrl in tampa the 
purchase brings to 12 the number of fm stations great american owns 
we are looking forward to entering the denver radio market 
our former company taft broadcasting owned radio stations in 
tampa and we are pleased that great american broadcasting will 
return to that outstanding radio market carl j wagner great 
american broadcast group president said monday in announcing the 
purchase 
great american sold its previous tampa stations when it acquired 
wtsptv in 1985 if the federal communications commission approves 
the purchase of wkrl it will be the second time great american has 
taken advantage of a more liberal fcc policy toward common 
ownership of tv and radio stations within a single market 
the fcc relaxed waiver standards earlier this year saying it 
would look favorably on applications in top 25 markets with a 
diversity of independent broadcast voices 
in applying for a waiver earlier this year for cincinnati and 
kansas city great american cited numerous operating efficiencies 
gained from having both tv and radio stations in a market the fcc 
granted waivers in both cases although cincinnati and kansas city 
rank just below the top 25 markets

japans nomura securities co tuesday named an 
american veteran of wall street as cochairman of its us 
securities operation a step toward giving it an american identity 
and management style 
max c chapman jr the 46yearold former president and chief 
executive of kidder peabody amp co inc said he hoped to put a 
wall street stamp on the us operations of the worlds largest 
securities firm 
i believe nomura is deadly serious about trying to find a way 
to marry their system and the good parts of the american system 
together he said in a telephone interview 
chapman who served as a captain in the marine corps reserve 
and played football four years at the university of north carolina 
will share the top job at nomura with the current chairman 
katsuya takanashi 
nomura has invested heavily in its new york operation but has 
yet to show consistent success its us operations lost about 18 
million in the year ended sept 30 1988 and nomura has reduced 
its brokerdealer staff to 550 from a peak of 650 before the 1987 
stock market crash the company said 
chapman who spent his entire career at kidder said he resigned 
from the firm earlier this year after being passed over for the job 
of chief executive of kidders parent company kidder peabody 
group inc which is majority owned by general electric co 
nomura is the last of japans big four securities firms to have 
an american in the rank of cochairman or vice chairman chapman 
will serve as cochairman of both nomura securities international 
inc and nomura holding america inc 
nomuras main business in the united states is funneling money 
from japanese investors into the us stock and bond markets it 
also works with japanese companies doing business in the united 
states its goal is to pick up more american customers 
particularly corporations that need sophisticated financial 
services 
chapman said the united states has the worlds most efficient 
financial markets and he believes he can help spread american 
innovations to other markets including tokyos 
someone had to satisfy me that there was a sincere desire to 
modify and work together to build an americantype firm within a 
japanese organization chapman said that will determine the 
success of many multinationals to find bridge between cultures and 
styles

smart toilets and car radar will usher in the 
hightech advances coming in the 1990s while bad service loud 
rock music and mexican beer will become passe says the american 
forecaster 1990 
other trends on the rise for 1990 are new age radio portraits 
commissioned for ego gratification and wet beer to serve on the 
rocks says kim long author of the yearly book 
white will be the fashionable color in clothing for women who 
will favor shorter hair he says men will grow their hair longer 
and wear wider ties the forecaster predicts 
in the 1990s we will see phenomenal advances a popular phrase 
some futurists are using is that life has the potential to move 
forward very rapidly because 80 percent of all the scientists and 
engineers who have ever lived are alive today said long 
the corollary to that is that 80 percent of all the artists 
crackpots and loonies who have ever lived are alive today we will 
see some intriguing things happen in the 1990s he said 
including a wave of bizarre prognostications as the year 2000 
approaches 
long 40 is a denver freelance author who began writing the 
forecaster in 1983 and claims an 80 percent accuracy rate he 
wrongly predicted a dukakis presidency and the demise of 
televisions dallas and dynasty but he estimated half his 
material reflects inevitable consumer trends 
for example a few years ago he forecast that cabbage patch 
doll sales would drop by half they dropped off by more than 
half it wasnt guesswork the information came from the toy 
industry which says that all fad toys that sell that well that 
quickly are temporary phenomena 
his predictions sometimes are based on his research into 
japanese product development 
smart toilets are made by a japanese company to measure 
recent hospital outpatients blood pressure pulse urine 
temperature and body weight results are displayed on a builtin 
monitor long predicts gadget lovers will pay the 3000 to have a 
conversation piece 
other hightech trends in 1990 will be robot hamburgermakers 
employed by fastfood franchises to solve chronic labor problems 
and car radar 
long said car radar systems will gauge other vehicles speeds 
and may incorporate automatic braking some experts believe if all 
vehicles had the devices highways could be safely packed with 
vehicles moving at high speeds 
new age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend said 
long 
its going to be a permanent form of programming he said 
its been called musical wallpaper at its most disparaging its 
somewhere between jazz and soft rock and it has the potential to 
not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population 
meanwhile affluent executives are commissioning sculptures and 
portraits of themselves and their families a trend long calls 
egoart they are recycling what once was a very solid 
artistic tradition 
a lowbudget version the video booth is cropping up in 
shopping centers and shouldering aside the booths where people used 
to have walletsize snapshots taken they shoot a five or 
10minute videotape said long you can speak sing or quote 
poetry its the concept of immortalizing yourself 
a major trend that will carry through the 1990s is a campaign by 
retailers to stamp out bad service 
surveys polls and extensive studies have shown that this is 
the top priority long said we have become linesensitive 
queueing up is a foreign disease that we dont want to catch 
ear plugs are being offered to customers at pop music clubs and 
rock concerts because of concern about hearing loss according to 
the american forecaster he notes that at the same time 
overamped car sound systems are booming 
among drinkers the mexican beer fad will be on the way out he 
predicted liquor with lower alcohol levels and wet beer a 
brew served on the rocks will debut in 1990 while lowalcohol beer 
will continue to founder said long 
longs book which sells fewer than 10000 copies despite all 
the interest it stirs up may be in for some hightech changes 
itself in the works is a possible video version with computer 
animation and long is exploring use of a computer database and 
facsimile machine to dispense his prognostications

boeing co workers cast ballots today to decide 
whether to accept a threeyear contract offer from the prospering 
aerospace company or reaffirm a midnight strike deadline for about 
50000 employees 
boeing and the machinists union said talks that began sept 21 
and were joined by a federal mediator during the weekend ended 
early monday 
they said this is our final and best offer this is it its 
over said tom baker president of district lodge 751 in seattle 
neither baker nor paul binder of boeing referred to the offer as 
an agreement or tentative settlement neither side would disclose 
any details and baker wouldnt say whether union leaders recommend 
acceptance or rejection 
the seattle postintelligencer today quoted unnamed sources as 
saying the proposed pact provides pay boosts of 4 percent in the 
first year and 3 percent in the second and third years as well as 
production bonuses of 8 percent and 4 percent respectively in the 
first two years the last contract included annual bonuses but no 
increase in base wages which determine other benefits 
the pact also contains some reduction in mandatory overtime 
which is limited to 200 hours per quarter under the current 
contract the newspaper reported 
weve made progress in some areas but were not jumping up 
and down baker said monday 
groups of workers picketed on monday outside an administration 
building in everett and at the westin hotel in seattle where the 
latest talks took place 
the tension here is so thick that you can feel it said a 
worker on the 767 production line in everett the worker who asked 
that his name not be used said some workers marched through the 
plant chanting strike strike strike during their lunch hour 
monday 
simultaneous votes were scheduled today for the 43300 
seattlearea members of the union lodge as well as 12000 
machinists in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and several 
hundred at smaller boeing job sites around the country baker said 
a simple majority is sufficient for acceptance or rejection of 
the contract but twothirds is required for a strike the union 
last struck boeing in 1977 that walkout lasted two months 
the current contract expires at midnight tonight the same time 
as the unions strike deadline 
boeing the worlds largest commercial airplane builder is 
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders with 
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth 385 
billion so far this year 
though pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business boeing 
commercial airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1600 jets worth about 
70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid1990s 
during the first part of the year boeing had net earnings of 
356 million on sales of 907 billion for 1988 profits were 614 
million on 1696 billion in sales boeing also holds 366 billion 
in cash and shortterm notes 
the boeing co is better off than it has ever been in history 
and we should be better off than weve ever been baker told a 
rally last month 
worldwide boeing employs 144725 people including 106000 in

wheat futures prices advanced while other grain 
and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade 
the modest advance in the wheat market was linked in part to 
expectations that the agriculture department eventually will accept 
an egyptian bid for 500000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
the usda rejected an egyptian bid tuesday morning but analysts 
said egypt had come back with a higher bid 
corn and soybean futures opened lower and stayed on the 
defensive for most of the session the selling reflected harvest 
pressure and profittaking after a strong rally in the previous 
session 
a national weather service six to 10day outlook issued late 
monday called for little or no rain for the midwestern corn and 
soybean country during the first four day of next week 
corn and soybean harvesting advanced at a strong pace last week 
under ideal weather conditions according to an agriculture 
department report that showed 16 percent of the corn crop and 18 
percent of the soybean crop harvested as of sunday compared to 10 
percent and 4 percent respectively a week earlier 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 409 a bushel corn 
futures were cent lower to cent higher with december at 241 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with december at 
147 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher

zenith electronics corp is making the right move 
by giving up its global leadership in the laptop computer market 
but its success in the cutthroat television business is far from 
assured industry experts say 
the outlook for higher tv prices bodes well in the near term for 
zenith which is the last major tv manufacturer based in the united 
states and the secondbiggest seller of color tvs 
but zeniths survival in consumer electronics over the long haul 
depends on its ability to develop innovative products while keeping 
its costs low and its public profile high 
its going to be a grunt and grind to do this thing robert 
johnson an analyst with the houstonbased brokerage firm rotan 
mosle inc said tuesday but now theyve got the cash to do it 
zenith announced on monday it had agreed to sell its computer 
division which includes zenith data systems and the 
buildityourself heath co to frances groupe bull for as much as 
635 million 
zenith will use the proceeds to eliminate most of its burdensome 
debt load the glenviewbased company will have an aftertax gain 
of 22 million chairman jerry k pearlman said monday 
zenith data systems sold 14 billion worth of computers last 
year and is the worlds larget seller of batterypowered laptop 
computers with 276 percent of the world market according to 
dataquest a hightechnology marketing research firm 
but in the past year other major computer makers have 
introduced laptop models that compete with zeniths for both 
consumer and defensecontract business 
faced with tough competition in both computers and televisions 
and unable to finance both analysts say zenith was forced to 
choose between borrowing more money or selling part of the company 
unable to find a buyer willing to pay more than about 200 
million for its consumerelectronics unit zenith opted out of the 
more salable computer business instead 
i thought it was something they should do but i wasnt sure 
they would they would do it said mark hassenberg of donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette one of many analysts who applauded the decision 
according to television digest a publication that tracks the tv 
industry zenith ranked second to frenchowned rca in sales of 1989 
model color tvs to us dealers but its share of the market has 
slipped to 12 percent from 185 percent over the past seven years 
while such competitors as sharp mitsubishi and toshiba have 
steadily gained market share 
pearlman said zeniths consumer electronics business was 
profitable in 1988 excluding interest costs and is expected to be 
15 million more profitable than that in 1989 again excluding 
interest costs 
he also emphasized zeniths commitment to highdefinition 
television using sharperpicture technology that some see as the 
future of tv 
but analysts said hdtv is still several years away and 
prospects for higher tv prices after nearly a decade of decline are 
tied to a continued shortage of glass for picture tubes and 
continued strong demand from china 
the zenith that emerges after the computerdivision sale will 
have lots of cash and not much debt which could make it an 
attractive takeover target some analysts believe 
but other say foreign television makers the most likely 
suitors would be reluctant to bid for americas last tv maker 
that was what made it difficult to sell the television business in 
the first place 
its easier for a foreign company to buy the computer business 
because there are a lot of other us computer businesses said 
analyst laura lederman of duff amp phelps inc in chicago

gillette co unveiled a new razor tuesday and 
said it would support it with a 175 million multinational sales 
and marketing campaign which the company said would be the biggest 
ever in the shaving industry 
but analysts said the company could nick itself in the 
pocketbook if consumers dont take to the higherpriced product 
which gillette is billing as the biggest shaving advance in 20 
years 
the silver and black razor called sensor and featuring two 
spring mounted ultrathin blades will be sold starting in 
january at an introductory price of 375 
we want to make sure people are not inhibited from using it 
because of a high price for trial said peter hoffman vice 
president of marketing for gillette 
the systems refill cartridges will cost 25 percent more than 
similar blades now on the market hoffman said and double the cost 
of disposable razors 
hoffman said using the sensor system would cost about 20 a 
year compared with about 16 for gillettes atra plus and about 
10 for disposable razors 
the new product will be promoted in 19 north atlantic countries 
with about 80 million of the 175 million to be spent in the 
united states 
in trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange gillettes 
stock rose 1 to 4787 a share its stock price has surged from 
about 33 a share last december partly in anticipation of the new 
product 
the big concern would be can consumers tell the difference 
between the new system and the old said bonita austin analyst 
with the investment concern wertheim schroder also it will be 
more expensive to the consumer so will the margins be as good as 
other products 
gillette officials said last week that the new razor was 
developed over the course of about 10 years at a cost of some 200 
million 
sensor is similar to gillettes atra brand which has a 
pivoting twinblade razor head however sensors design also 
enables each springcushioned blade to move independently which 
gillette says allows it to hug the skin without digging in the 
atra plus with two cartridges sells for about 4 
many analysts declined to comment on the new product before they 
had the opportunity to view it firsthand but most agreed the 
production costs were high 
they spent lot of money on it said brenda landry analyst 
with the investment firm morgan stanley amp co but historically 
when gillette has brought out a new blade it has been successful 
market share will be critical wertheims austin said 
they will need to take enough market share to justify the 
expenses 
gillette said it holds 18 patents on the product and four others 
are pending 
landry said the company will license the razors eventually to 
make a compatible blade but it wont be this coming year 
other razor companies were quick to point out the benefits of 
their own products and find fault with the new razor 
youre still putting cold steel on your face which i 
understood was done away in a number of countries when they did 
away with the guillotine it is not the modern away of shaving 
said victor kiam president of remington products inc which has 
aout 40 percent of the electric shaver market 
kiam added that the new product could benefit his company 
what gillette is trying to do is trade people up from 
disposables to systems he said were in the upper end of the 
market and therefore it should help the growth of that entire 
segment 
warnerlambert co which makes schick razors cited the new 
razors expected higher retail price schicks ultrex plus and slim 
twin razors sell for under 3 
with sensor gillette is asking consumers to pay a 
significantly higher premium price said ray lefebvre 
president of warnerlamberts consumer health products unit 
lefebvre also said that schicks total market share has risen 
while gillettes has declined 
if gillette is indeed the best a man can get referring to 
gillettes advertising slogan their recent sales dont support 
it 
gillette said the new product was simultaneously launched in the 
united states canada and europe the first such international 
marketing blitz for the company 
gillette has interests in toiletries and writing products but 
its biggest stake is in razors where it controls more than 60 
percent of the world market 
analysts have said the new product would help expand market 
share and improve earnings for bostonbased gillette which fended 
off takeover attempts in recent years but had to weather major 
restructurings in the process 
the company undertook a major restructuring after turning down a 
412 billion revlon group inc buyout offer in november 1986 last 
year gillette repurchased 156 million of its shares to head off 
an attempted takeover by coniston partners of new york

at the talks brazils reluctance to accept a lower coffee export 
quota was one of the factors that led to a breakdown of the coffee 
price support system three months ago

the elements that led us to deadlock have been removed dauster 
told reporters at a news conference 
few observers expect the london meeting to produce a new 
pricesupport mechanism to succeed the export quotas that were 
suspended july 4 precipitating a 30 percent drop in coffee prices

market is headed lower still

other in a battle for market share eliminating an incentive for 
coffee roasters to buy in large quantity

mgm grand inc said tuesday it will 
spend 700 million to convert a las vegas golf course into a movie 
theme park and a 5000room hotelcasino gambling on luring 
families to the best mouse trap in town 
i remember the days when las vegas lived almost entirely on 
the high roller mgm grand chairman fred benninger said at a news 
conference at the beverly hills hotel you cant do that 
anymore 
the site is on the las vegas strip location where the tropicana 
country club and marina hotel and casino now stand benninger 
wouldnt reveal how much mgm grand paid for those properties 
other details were sketchy as well although conceptual drawings 
showed towering spires and domes like a futuristic version of 
sleeping beautys castle at disneyland 
mgm grand owned by beverly hills billionaire kirk kerkorian 
said last month it might build the theme park on a 60acre site 
beside the desert inn which it owns and is promoting as a topend 
hotelcasino 
the new theme park site at 115 acres is nearly twice as large 
benninger said finding enough space was a more important 
consideration than money 
the new mgm grand hotel and theme park are tentatively expected 
to open by late 1992 
benninger said he was confident the complex with hotel rooms 
costing about 40 a night would cash in on the trend toward family 
tourism in las vegas that began with the opening of circus circus a 
decade ago 
las vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year up 
from 11 million in 1980 its population has boomed from 300000 
eight years ago to more than 700000 
las vegas officials have said for years that the city needed a 
major theme park to help attract families a water theme park 
built on the las vegas strip five years ago has been extremely 
successful 
clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for 
quite a while said harold vogel veteran entertainment analyst 
for merrill lynch amp co its an adult resort and now theyre 
going to extend it so the rest of the family members can enjoy it 
too 
benninger said movie themes had proved an enduring lure to 
tourists as proved by expansions of walt disney co and mca incs 
universal studios into florida movie theme parks 
there has always been competition in las vegas benninger 
said im not worried about competition were building the best 
mouse trap in town 
benninger said mgm grand will add 4300 rooms to the 700room 
marina at a cost of about 250 million the theme park which will 
cost about 450 million will include a working film and television 
studio although he said it might have just one sound stage 
it is anticipated that the complex will employ 7000 workers 
other details were sketchy a name for the complex and even its 
designers have yet to be selected benninger wouldnt reveal 
details about the attractions being considered although he said 
there were many 
he said two or three organizations had approached him about 
possible partnerships and left open the possibility of finding 
another partner 
benninger said mgm grand regarded the development as a prototype 
and had already received calls from unidentified organizations 
about developing similar complexes elsewhere 
mgm grand a separate company from mgmua communications corp 
owns an allfrills los angelesnew york airline as well as the 
desert inn it also retains rights to a stylized version of the 
famous mgm lion 
kerkorian 72 had sold and bought back bits and pieces of 
mgmua communications for two decades a period during which he 
also traded las vegas hotels the way most people buy cars 
then last month australias qintex group agreed to purchase 
mgmua including the original lion logo for 15 billion 
outbidding media mogul rupert murdoch by 100 million 
a fire at the original mgm grand hotel which kerkorian built in 
1973 killed 84 people in 1980 in 1985 kerkorian sold the hotel 
and its sister hotel in reno to bally manufacturing co of chicago 
for nearly 500 million

the chairmen of the senate finance and energy 
committees have included a new tax on offshore oil and gas 
production in pending legislation and want to use the millions of 
dollars in expected revenues to protect and restore coastal 
wetlands 
spokesmen for the oil and gas industry say however that 
drilling on the outercontinental shelf has done little to harm the 
gulf coasts troubled wetlands they said their industry is opposed 
to being solely responsible for financing the proposed coastal 
wetlands trust fund under the provision backed by the chairmen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas and bennett johnston dla 
since most of the causes of wetlands losses were unintended 
consequences of activities that provided public benefits an 
equitable solution would be to fund wetlands conservation programs 
out of general revenues it is unfair to tax a single industry to 
address a broad landuse problem joseph lastelic a spokesman 
for the american petroleum institute said tuesday 
environmentalists however say offshore drilling has damaged 
coastal wetlands in louisiana and texas and although 
outercontinental shelf drilling may not directly cause wetlands 
erosion setting up and operating support facilities on the 
mainland have contributed to losses of coastal marshes 
under the plan drafted by bentsen and johnston dla 
production from federal offshore waters would be taxed at 2 cents 
per 1000 cubic feet of natural gas and 3 cents per barrel of oil 
industry estimates say the plan would raise about 100 million 
annually while the senators say revenues would be closer to 383 
million over five years 
the plan is included in bentsens version of what is known as 
budget reconciliation legislation pending before the finance 
committee of which bentsen is chairman there have been no 
hearings on the plan 
johnston said late monday that getting the tax included in the 
reconciliation bill was the difficult part of moving the plan 
through the senate 
the bill is the chief legislative vehicle for enacting spending 
cuts to meet budget targets 
according to a fact sheet from johnstons office wetlands loss 
on the gulf coast is critical especially in louisiana johnstons 
office also said oil and gas activity is one cause of erosion in 
coastal wetlands which provide habitat for migratory birds fish 
and other ildlife as well as commercial and recreational benefits 
navigation access and pipeline canals and other activities 
related to the exploration development and production of oil and 
gas along the gulf coast and on the outer continental shelf have 
had adverse effects on many of the coastal wetlands of the gulf 
coast region johnstons office said 
oil and gas production in the coastal areas have contributed 
to wetlands losses i wouldnt say its the no 1 factor but 
they have contributed their part said bill reffalt refuge 
program director for the wilderness society 
mike baly executive vice president of the american gas 
association said natural gas is probably less than 10 percent of 
the problem 
baly said the natural gas industry would pay the greatest share 
of the tax accounting for 91 percent of what the association 
projects will be 98 million in annual revenues 
at a time when 50 percent of our oil comes from foreign 
countries and concern about reducing our deficit from oil imports 
its difficult for us to understand why theyre lessening the 
competitive factor for natural gas by applying a federal tax 
baly said 
scott feierabend director of the fisheries and wildlife 
division at the national wildlife federation said he would support 
the bentsenjohnston approach 
bentsen said monday his plan would be a great thing for the 
coastal waters louisiana texas and the united states

crazy eddie inc the discount electronics 
chain known for its highpitched commercials turned down the 
volume for good tuesday announcing it would liquidate its last 18 
stores 
the company which had been seeking to reorganize under chapter 
11 of the bankruptcy laws said it would liquidate because vendors 
were no longer willing to extend credit among other factors 
without the credit it could not keep operating the company 
said because liabilities greatly exceeded assets stockholders 
would receive nothing it said trading had been suspended when the 
share price fell below 25 cents 
managers were told of the planned closings during a morning 
meeting at the companys headquarters in edison said humphrey 
stokes manager of the crazy eddie store here 
it was kind of like a load being lifted off your shoulders 
he said 
the announcement ends a turbulent 20year history for the 
company founded by highschool dropout eddie antar with a lone 
store in brooklyn ny at its peak crazy eddie had 43 stores in 
new york new jersey connecticut and pennsylvania 
they employed 1500 people and once brought in sales of 300 
million the companys stock reached 21 a share the tag line 
our prices are insane screamed so often on television and 
radio spots by former disc jockeyactor jerry carroll made the 
chain known to millions 
but a rift among antar family members who served as executives 
declining demand for electronics tougher competition and seeming 
disorganization brought on severe financial woes 
antar who brought the company public in 1984 later sold much 
of his stock and resigned as president but stayed on as chairman 
he dropped from sight and never granted interviews 
dissident shareholders led by turnaround specialist victor 
palmieri and houston electronics retailer elias zinn took control 
of the company in november 1987 and found a huge inventory 
shortfall 
nearly three months after crazy eddie sought bankruptcy 
protection in june the securities and exchange commission accused 
antar and top management with insider trading and systematically 
doctoring financial figures to inflate earnings 
the scheme allegedly involved exaggerating inventory and falsely 
reducing bills to suppliers 
meanwhile at the store here the floor contained compact disc 
players and other stereo equipment in their boxes and pyramids of 
mr coffee machines stokes said he wanted to show customers that 
the store had goods to sell but conceded that the stock room was 
far from brimming over 
this is my job my livelihood said stokes but youve got 
to make the best of it he said confident he could find work in 
the computer industry stokes vowed to go out of business in the 
crazy eddie tradition blowout blitzes

the senate voted tuesday to cut off debate on 
longstalled legislation that would require creation of a 
commission to investigate the lengthy eastern airlines strike 
senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture getting 61 votes 
just one more than necessary to limit debate thirtysix senators 
voted against ending the filibuster by senate republicans 
the republicans had been backing president bushs refusal to 
appoint an emergency board under provisions of the railway labor 
act to probe the strike led by machinists which began march 4 
a spokesman for eastern termed ludicrous the legislation 
being considered by the senate 
its hard to believe at a time when the senate is so bogged 
down in matters of great importance to the country that it would 
take this much time to deal with ludicrous legislation on behalf of 
special interests said robin matell from easterns headquarters 
in miami 
bush has said he would veto such a bill and there are more 
than enough votes in congress to sustain a presidential veto 
matell said 
in a separate development tuesday a federal bankruptcy judge in 
new york released 75 million from escrow to eastern and gave the 
troubled carrier permission to sell a 30 million note that it owns 
the senate action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up 
consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a 
threeperson commission to study the work stoppage and make 
recommendations for its solution 
there was no immediate indication when the senate would proceed 
to a vote on the bill under cloture rules no senator may talk for 
more than an hour after debate has been cut off this usually means 
there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate since 
it takes 60 senators in the 100member chamber to invoke cloture 
democrats had said last week that if they were successful in 
achieving a cutoff of debate they would then substitute 
unionbacked language for the housepassed bill creating a 
commission with one member each appointed by bush senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine and house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
i think in fairness we should invoke cloture sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio told colleagues before tuesdays vote i 
believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of eastern 
airlines 
since march republican members of the senate have used delaying 
tactics to block the chambers consideration of housepassed 
legislation requiring bush to appoint an emergency board the 
president has refused to create a board saying management and 
employees should resolve the problem 
but metzenbaum said it was time to force bushs hand 
it is now obvious that the president will not appoint an 
emergency board he said it is now obvious that unless 
congress takes action the president is content to do nothing 
while the families of 30000 eastern workers suffer 
five days after the machinists struck eastern joined by pilots 
and flight attendants the carrier filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code eastern has been continuing 
efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said 
it plans to emerge as a carrier twothirds its former size

george e and joan b johnson started one of the 
nations largest blackowned companies together with 250 in 1954 
but the family ties that bound the company and the couple have come 
undone 
johnson signed the company chairmanship and the bulk of its 
shares over to her this week in their divorce settlement 
johnson products makes haircare and cosmetics under such brand 
names as gentletreatment ultra sheen and classy curl 
this is a family company and she wanted to preserve the 
company for the family the children and she obviously feels that 
she can make this company into something even better than it is 
today bernard rinella ms johnsons divorce lawyer said 
tuesday 
she and the couples eldest son eric g johnson will seek to 
guide johnson products co back to profitability after eight 
straight years of losses he said 
the companys stock closed up 12 cents tuesday at 250 a share 
on the american stock exchange 
johnson 62 who had been the companys principal shareholder 
turned his stock over to his former wife and resigned as chairman 
and chief executive officer on monday when the divorce was granted 
ms johnson 60 formerly the company treasurer replaced him as 
chairman and now owns or controls 61 percent of the 
personalproduct companys common stock 
eric johnson who has been president of the company since 
december was named chief executive officer 
george johnson will stay on as a consultant he also is chairman 
of the holding company that owns independence bank of chicago and 
drexel national bank in chicago 
the changes were approved monday by johnson products board of 
directors 
alvin j boutte chairman of independence bank of chicago and a 
member of the johnson products board of directors declined to 
elaborate on the move 
this was strictly a family affair they amicably agreed to do 
it this way said boutte 
he added he did not expect radical changes at the company 
eric has really been running the company on a daytoday 
basis boutte said 
other terms of the settlement were not disclosed and rinella 
said the divorce records were impounded and not available to the 
public 
george johnsons attorney robert hirsch did not return 
telephone calls to his office 
neither george nor joan johnson could be reached through the 
company on tuesday 
rinella said johnson products which is completing an internal 
reorganization begun 18 months ago would benefit from the 
management change 
i think she can turn it around he said 
the divorce action had been pending for more than a year while 
the two sides discussed terms of the settlement including the 
change in ownership of the company rinella said 
asked whether george johnson had considered selling the company 
instead of turning it over rinella said it could have been an 
option but that never developed 
the johnsons founded the company in chicago and it became the 
first blackowned company traded on the american stock exchange in 
1971 
while the company has lost money for the past eight years it 
posted small gains in the past two quarters 
the company reported a loss of 37 million on sales of 291 
million in fiscal 1988 the company registered a 22 million 
onetime gain in the first quarter of its 1989 fiscal year after 
selling land near its south side headquarters 
johnson products was 17th on this years list of the nations 
100 largest blackowned companies compiled by black enterprise

a 35 million age discrimination settlement 
the equal employment opportunity commissions largest ever may be 
out of reach for 4000 westinghouse electric corp retirees 
following two supreme court decisions a legal specialist said 
the supreme court on monday vacated an appeals court ruling that 
westinghouse discriminated against the retirees by offering them a 
choice of either severance pay or early pensions but not both 
the appeals court must now reconsider eeocs charges against 
westinghouse in light of a june supreme court ruling that tilts 
the discrimination law in favor of employers 
the eeoc had a 35 million settlement in hand in august 1988 but 
walked away from it to seek a court ruling that could have led to 
an even bigger payment for the retirees 
it means they blew it they got greedy dick lauver a 
pittsburgh pension lawyer who was not involved in the case said 
monday night they chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to 
get a favorable court decision 
donald livingston executive assistant to the eeoc general 
counsel said tuesday that lauver knows nothing of the settlement 
and knows nothing of the settlement process and maybe hes not 
adequately familiar with the case 
livingston said eeoc believed that up to 10000 westinghouse 
retirees might have qualified to share in the settlement but the 
two sides could not agree on guidelines for identifying additional 
retirees 
in addition the settlement would have required the agency to 
approve a future benefits plan that was too similar to the one the 
3rd us circuit court of appeals deemed illegal 
livingston said that 35 million seemed to be an inadequate 
settlement 
the case was pending before the federal appeals court when the 
two sides settled after the eeoc backed away the appeals court 
took up the case again and ruled against westinghouse the company 
appealed to the supreme court early this year 
the supreme courts june ruling came in an ohio case the court 
said employees have the burden of proving that the employer 
intended to discriminate before the decision employers had to 
demonstrate why the disputed programs were not discriminatory 
the law is much more beneficial to westinghouse than it was in 
june livingston said right now i dont know what this case 
is worth 
a number of issues remain to be decided in the westinghouse 
case he said 
i think the case is far from over livingston said 
the june ruling could affect about 30 cases pending in the 
courts said eeoc spokeswoman deborah graham an additional 406 
complaints still being investigated by the eeoc could also be 
affected she said 
three bills have been introduced in congress that would restore 
the law to its terms before the supreme courts june decision 
although not all of them would be retroactive 
westinghouse meanwhile is looking forward to having the 
appeals cour reconsider its case said company spokesman jim 
schmitt 
westinghouse is delighted he said

announced the resignation of senior vice president john j shields 
described as the no 2 man at one of the worlds largest computer 
companies 
shields 51 made a personal decision to leave the company to 
pursue other interests a statement from digital said 
jack was instrumental in creating the 70000person 
international sales and services organization that helped make 
digital the worlds second largest computer company said digital 
president kenneth olsen 
olsen said shields played a key role in formulating the 
companys sales services and marketing strategy

was unavailable for comment at digital and his home address was 
not available 
digitals stock fell 225 a share to 8875 tuesday on the new

sonny monosson who publishes a newsletter covering digitals 
activities said that for many years shields was being groomed as 
a successor to olsen 
but recently he said shields became less visible at the 
company 
it was pretty obvious something was up monosson said he 
publishes the monosson report in boston 
monosson said shields apparently believed he could not attain 
the no 1 spot and so decided to leave 
there were some indications that shields responsibilities had 
been offloaded to other individuals in the digital hierarchy 
said paul zorfass director of research at the yankee group in 
boston 
nikki richardson a digital spokeswoman said shields decision 
was made for personal reasons and any other comments were 
speculation

and in 1964 was named manager of field service in 1974 he was 
promoted to vice president of field service and training 
he continued to expand his duties and in 1986 was named senior

nissan motor corp on tuesday unveiled 
new ads for its infiniti luxury car line that finally gives a 
glimpse if a fuzzy one of a nameplate previously wrapped in 
advertising mystery 
the new ads are to begin appearing later this month as part of a 
60 million print and television campaign by the japansese 
automaker that so far has lacked direct reference to either of the 
two infiniti models 
the new television commercials continue the style of pastoral 
scenery but now include a blurry car whizzing past at the close 
the changes in the ad campaign begin oct 16 nationally and oct 
23 in the 30 markets where there are infiniti dealers infiniti 
division general manager william bruce said 
he said more commercials will air nov 5 but declined to say 
whether the infiniti q45 or m30 cars would appear in them the cars 
go on sale nov 8 
the infiniti cars are the second japanese luxury car line to be 
introduced this year in the united states toyota motor corp began 
selling its lexus line last month lexus officials have said they 
anticipate selling around 70000 vehicles in 1990 
nissan which changed its name from datsun earlier this decade 
is attempting to make the name infiniti familiar to potential 
buyers before the car itself using brand rather than product 
advertising 
i find them a breath of fresh air and rather intriguing 
said automotive analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co i 
hear everybody talking about it i suppose you have to give them 
credit in breaking new ground in automotive advertising 
but analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co said my 
personal belief is that to sell a car you should show a car 
the new ads were shown at what nissan called the national media 
introduction of the infiniti cars which will sell for 23500 and 
38000 the cars also were shown on the autoshow circuit earlier 
this year bruce declined to say how many cars the division 
expected to sell 
the lines print ads to date have shown such natureoriented 
scenes as an outcropping of rocks crashing waves or a field of hay 
along with oftenphilosophical text that does not prominently 
mention the name of the car

reorganization of business systems officials said

president of marketing to the board of directors 
farmers spokesman jeffrey beyer said the restructuring was part 
of a process that denlea launched two years ago and was unrelated 
to the uncertainties surrounding a hostile takeover bid for 
farmers parent the british bat industries plc conglomerate 
farmers the 15thbiggest us insurer was acquired last year 
by londonbased bat which is now trying to fight off a 22 billion 
takeover bid by hoylake investments a consortium put together by

farmers to a french insurer axamidi assurances for 45 billion

georgia as well as plotting how to strengthen its operations in

poultry giant tyson foods inc of 
springdale said tuesday it had signed a contract to provide chicken 
parts to the soviet union 
tyson spokesman jim blair said the contract was signed with 
another us food company which he declined to name that has 
agreed to supply the soviet union with chicken blair also declined 
to disclose volume or price figures saying nondisclosure of that 
information was part of the contract 
the russians have committed themselves to a major purchasing 
program of consumer items including food and this is simply part 
of the program said blair tysons general counsel 
he declined to say when the contract was signed but said it was 
announced to tyson management monday 
according to blair the contract calls for a substantial amount 
of frozen chicken hindquarters thighs and legs to be shipped in 
containers to us ports where the containers would be transferred 
to cargo ships for transport to the soviet union 
shipments are to begin almost immediately he said 
the effect on the us chicken market will be very limited he 
said 
it wont do anything to the american market except add 
stability as any big contract does over a period of time tyson 
said in fact there wont be any disruption in the supply to our 
normal customers 
blair said the contract is with a company with which tyson 
normally competes in the united states he would not say whether 
the company was either conagra inc of omaha neb or perdue farms 
inc of salisbury md 
the multicompany arrangement he said arose because i dont 
think any single company would have the capacity to fulfill the 
contract without disruption of its normal operations 
he said that as far as he knew the arrangements with the 
soviet union involve no export subsidy by the us government the 
sale by tyson blair said was at us market prices as was the 
sale to the soviet union by the company with which tyson has 
contracted

threatening a fresh trade spat with the united 
states european foreign ministers tuesday agreed to push their 
television stations to air a majority of homegrown not foreign 
entertainment programs 
the united states has argued the measure would hurt the american 
film and television industrys earnings abroad and suggested it 
might violate international trade rules 
despite strong us lobbying in recent months the foreign 
ministers of the european community approved a plan that would 
remove barriers to tv broadcasting in the 12nation trading bloc 
belgium and denmark opposed the measure according to community 
spokesmen 
martin bangemann the communitys top official on industrial 
matters said criticism of the measure was unjustified 
it cannot constitute an infringement of international trade 
rules he told reporters 
there was no immediate reaction from us officials 
the plan television without frontiers is part of the 
communitys move to create a single market of 320 million consumers 
in late 1992 
by the end of 1992 the dozen nations are scheduled to remove the 
many trade barriers restricting the free movement of money goods 
services and people 
the tv measure set out the conditions under which broadcasters 
in europe would be allowed to transmit channels throughout the 
trading bloc 
in doing so it said governments must ensure that a majority of 
transmission time be reserved where practicable and by 
appropriate means for europeanmade programs 
excluded from the provision were news sports and games programs 
as well as ads 
british foreign secretary john king said there were assurances 
that the measure would not be regarded as applying legally binding 
quotas 
we clearly wanted to avoid a fortress europe and the fears 
of a fortress europe he told reporters 
the measure he said was seen as political objectives and not 
a numerical straitjacket 
its not a legal obligation said bangemann its a 
political commitment 
king said britain would not change its treatment of us 
programs about 15 percent of the programs broadcst by major 
british stations comes from outside the community he said 
any fans of dallas or dynasty need have no doubt 
whatsoever that they will continue to get their programs he said 
the united states has urged the community to scrap the plan the 
american entertainment industry said its european earnings would be 
seriously hurt by such a restriction 
during a european swing last month us trade representative 
carla hills reiterated the american opposition 
we are not in favor of local content in any context and more 
particularly in the province of thoughts she said 
local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a 
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically 
mrs hills had earlier written key members of the european 
parliament the communitys legislative body to complain about the 
tv measure 
community quotas she wrote would be blatantly 
discriminatory patently unjustifiable and would almost certainly 
have a disastrous effect on the us industrys substantial 
european earnings 
defenders of quotas argued that european culture was at stake 
they fear a flood of american soap operas sitcoms and other 
programs would tie up the airwaves
