american roman catholic bishops have lent 
moral support for archbishop marcos mcgraths nowsuspended offer 
to mediate talks between the panamanian government and the 
opposition which has been trying to oust gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
a letter of support from the american bishops to mcgrath the 
archbishop of panama was released on thursday just hours before 
mcgrath announced he was suspending the mediation effort 
mcgrath said he was withdrawing his offer because opposition 
groups refused to talk to the government until it showed a 
willingness to discuss noriegas departure noriega hadnt offered 
explicit backing of the initiative in writing and there were no 
assurances that the four international leaders who proposed the 
talks could be present 
archbishop john l may president of the national conference of 
catholic bishops in the letter to mcgrath said the voice of 
the church in panama has been clear and consistent denouncing the 
instances of civic corruption and state violence that have 
tragically become so much a part of recent news reports 
the letter was made public thursday 
manuel solis palma the acting president of panama said his 
government agreed to talks mediated by the church but the 
opposition insists on assurances that noriega is willing to step 
down and leave the country 
i write to express our full support and ecclesial solidarity 
with you your fellow bishops and all the suffering people of 
panama may said in his letter to mcgrath 
he added that we continue to urge our own national leaders to 
exercise the greatest care in balancing pursuit of legitimate us 
interests in the region with the essential quest for a peaceful and 
just settlement of this crisis

the nations only college croquet 
court plays host to its first intercollegiate tournament friday 
with little fanfare and some embarrassment to smith college 
officials says the professor who raised money for the field 
im told that this event promotes the idea that smith is 
elitist said richard young a literature professor emeritus at 
the 2000student school who was instrumental in getting the court 
built if it werent theyd be out of business 
administrators at the private womens college denied any 
embarrassment about the 105foot by 84foot field 
there might have been a few faculty snickers and comments made 
on why we would spend time and money building a croquet court when 
there are other more important things to do said director of 
development charlotte heartt 
but it was no skin off our backs it didnt cost us 
anything she said the 16000 court was paid for by donations 
from alumnae interested in the sport 
however young said the already jittery administrators were 
delivered an blow when new england monthly magazine noted in its 
january issue that the mere 16000 spent on the elaborately 
irrigated court would nearly cover a years tuition and room and 
board charges for a scholarship student 
this is preposterous said young who has described croquet 
as a cross between billiards and chess this is the one sport 
that is absolutely neutral in age and gender it didnt even occur 
to me to add race 
and its cheaper than golf by a whole lot 
concerns about the schools elitist image began with its recent 
racial problems the first black woman to earn tenure at the 
college quit in december saying smith was lethargic in combating 
racism two black administrators followed soon after 
but the school argues that it has taken great pains to fight 
racism and attract minorities since a spraypainted slur appeared 
on the steps of a campus building in october 1986 
a survey smith commissioned found its image problem had more to 
do with elitism than racism more than half the 788 students staff 
and administrators polled said they had been victims of class 
discrimination according to the survey released in november 
one problem remaining for the croquet court is getting it 
dedicated 
ms heartt said the college had arranged for a ceremony april 23 
before learning that the schools croquet team would be in lenox 
for a tournament and president mary maples dunn will be out of 
town this weekend 
we cant get a schedule clear that suits both me and the 
team ms dunn said through a spokeswoman 
in the english version that will be played this weekend among 40 
competitors from nine of new england schools from harvard and 
wellesley to the universities of maine and massachusetts teams of 
two players each shepherd two balls twice around a wicketed turf 
fridays game at the smith court which means players no longer 
have to go 50 miles to a lenox hotel court is the first of the 
season for the fledgling new england collegiate croquet association 
i can understand why the college is nervous said necca 
director xandra kayden they dont have enough experience with 
college croquet to understand the good press it gets but i can 
also understand dick because croquet changed his life 
young 66 lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to his 
other foot during world war ii he had trouble moving and had given 
up on sports until he discovered croquet a few years ago he 
organized the smith team and persuaded alumnae to donate the money 
for the court

one of the thousands of small commuter 
buses that careen about kenya every day carries an appropriate 
bumper sticker you never know heaven could be nearer than 
home 
authorities say the overcrowded poorly maintained wildly 
driven buses called matatus have contributed heavily to kenyas 
highway death toll of nearly 200 so far this year 
at that rate the toll is roughly on pace with 1987 when 1889 
people died in traffic accidents or one person killed for every 
166 cars on kenyas roads a similar rate in the united states 
would mean that annual highway fatalities now fewer than 50000 
would reach more than 1 million a year 
the privately owned matatus carry such names as survival of 
the fittest and living devil 
scary as it all may be the poor people who use them have no 
other choice 
the brightly colored vehicles are legally allowed to carry no 
more than 25 passengers but usually matatu crews cram in twice 
that many or more to get more fares those who cant fit inside 
climb onto the roof and cling to luggage as the buses go into a 
list on highspeed turns 
thirtyone people were killed feb 29 in a threematatu crash 
that incensed a nation already accustomed to headlines screaming of 
horror smashes and matatu madness 
for days after the crash newspapers printed pictures of victims 
strewn across the road and of the crumpled matatus 
commentaries called for something to be done about matatus and 
a roadsafety program was reintroduced on the governments voice of 
kenya television 
the head of the matatu association of kenya resigned rather he 
said than be cursed by the innocent blood of the commuters who 
die daily on our roads at the hands of reckless matatu drivers 
president daniel arap moi whose government in 1984 passed the 
first legislation aimed at controlling matatus decided they had 
become more an agent of death and destruction than an asset to 
the commuter 
police began a crackdown netting hundreds of unroadworthy and 
overcrowded vehicles matatu crews as well as unseated passengers 
were hit with heavy fines 
the ministry of transport issued a new and more stringent list 
of regulations and ordered all matatu drivers retested 
but the matatu industry retaliated with a strike that stranded 
hundreds of thousands of people moi rescinded the retesting order 
and the matatus returned after a day off the roads 
mois response to the strike underscored the matatu industrys 
stranglehold on the nations transportation sector 
less than 1 percent of kenyas 22 million people own cars and 
fewer than 600 buses are on the roads the lack of vehicles leaves 
a demand for transportation met by the tens of thousands of 
matatus which mostly are vans and minibuses that travel even the 
most rural routes 
matatus first appeared as pirate taxis in the mid1950s when 
kenya was a british colony and movement by the native population 
was restricted 
the industry burgeoned after independence in 1963 when 
restrictions were lifted and people were allowed to move to the 
cities swelling metropolitan populations and increasing the need 
for public transport 
the name matatu comes from the kikuyu term mangotore 
matatus meaning 30 kenyan cents which at that time was the 
standard matatu fare 
today the average fare around nairobi is 3 shillings 19 us 
cents and routes are flexible 
to increase profits and their own 40 to 75 monthly salaries 
matatu crews overload the buses work overly long hours at the 
wheel and drive at high speeds in order to meet daily quotas set by 
matatu owners 
at least 80 percent of the matatu crews work sevenday weeks and 
average 10 hours a day in vehicles that suffer most often from 
engine brake or gearbox failure according to a 1982 study by the 
nairobibased mazengira institute 
many drivers admit to chewing khat a stimulative twig or 
smoking marijuana to keep themselves alert 
in one of the dozens of commentaries on matatus a columnist for 
the daily nation kenyas leading newspaper blamed greed 
brainless bravado and showmanship for the road carnage caused by 
matatus 
the nation should not allow lunatics to ply the roads any 
longer the columnist said

with the spiriting away of juan ramon matta 
from honduras to an illinois prison three of four reputed drug 
barons sought in the killing of an american drug agent are behind 
bars 
the feb 7 1985 kidnapping of enrique camarena salazar a 
special agent of the us drug enforcement administration put the 
spotlight on the immense power and wealth accumulated by drug 
traffickers in mexico 
the bodies of camarena and alfredo zavala avelar were found 
march 5 1985 zavala avelar was a mexican pilot who worked with 
camarena in antinarcotics programs from their base in guadalajara 
mexicos secondlargest city 
during the hunt for camarena and then for his killers an 
outline of a powerful drug organization became clear us 
officials called the organization la familia the family 
talk of mexican cooperation in antidrug programs was replaced 
in washington by charges of widespread corruption the narcotics 
issue has remained a major sticking point in usmexican relations 
the four top men in the illicit drug trade were said to be 
ernesto don neto fonseca reportedly the organizations leader 
rafael caro quintero miguel angel felix gallardo and matta 
matta is a honduran citizen and the others are mexican 
although they were not all accused of direct participation 
their organization that was believed responsible for ordering 
camarenas murder 
these people were all involved in a drug trafficking 
organization us embassy spokesman william graves said 
caro quintero and fonseca were taken into custody in spring 1985 
and remain imprisoned charged in camarenas murder 
matta was picked up tuesday in a predawn helicopter police raid 
at his home in tegucigalpa the honduran capital and put on a 
flight out of the country without a passport 
honduran legislators angrily called the incident a 
kidnapping and the foreign ministry started an investigation of 
the procedures used 
the exploits of caro quintero in particular his rise from 
poverty to vast wealth have given him almost a folk hero status in 
mexico two escape tunnels were discovered last fall near his 
prison one almost complete 
felix gallardo remains at large no warrant has been issued for 
him in mexico reports surface from time to time that he dined with 
a governor or made some other public appearace 
there are more than 50 people imprisoned felipe flores 
spokesman for the federal attorney generals office said wednesday 
when asked for a status report on the camarena case 
the us embassy count is 63 people in custody in the case a 
small number of them sentenced 
we expect the mexican judicial system to find these people 
guilty we expect convictions given the overwhelming evidence 
against them graves said 
in january a federal grand jury in los angeles indicted nine 
people including caro quintero on charges stemming from the 
camarena kidnap and murder 
the attorney generals office said the respective trials will 
continue to develop before the mexican jurisdictional bodies 
independent of whatever procedure is opened in the united states or 
in third countries 
attorney general sergio garcia ramirez said in a february 
interview with the associated press that recriminations between 
mexico and the united states over which one is lagging in the drug 
trade war are not in the interest of either country 
we find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the united 
states of what really goes on in mexico he said the border is 
not a border between black and white good and evil it is a border 
between countries

a civil court will hear the rev charles e 
currans complaints that catholic university illegally ousted him 
from his teaching post as a result of vatican displeasure with his 
theology 
curran a prominent professor of theology is suing the 
university for breach of contract 
superior court judge bruce d beaudin on tuesday rejected the 
universitys claim that currans suspension was under church law 
and therefore is immune to civil court review 
this court finds the universitys position without merit 
beaudin said in a written order denying a motion by the university 
for dismissal of the suit professor currans claim is based on 
an employment contract governed by the civil law and contract 
principles of the district of columbia beaudin said 
ann smith a spokeswoman for the university said we dont 
comment on ongoing litigation 
the vatican in 1986 declared curran unfit to teach as a 
catholic theologian because of his dissenting views on sexual 
issues 
he had expressed the view that contraception and sterilization 
are not intrinsically evil and that in certain 
circumstances the church should allow divorce he has also said 
that for a genuine homosexual homosexual acts in the context of 
a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain 
sense be objectively and morally acceptable 
archbishop james a hickey of washington dc the exofficio 
chancellor of catholic university suspended curran from all 
teaching at the university last january 
curran who now teaches at cornell university challenged the 
suspension in court as a breach of university bylaws and his 
contract the school asked dismissal of the suit principally on 
the ground that court interference in canon law is barred by the 
freedom of religion clause in the constitution 
beaudine said he did not dispute the schools contention that 
the court lacks authority to review and examine the universitys 
interpretation and application of canon law and that his ruling 
applied only to currans academic tenure and employment contract 
in a statement released by his lawyers curran said he is not 
asking the church to do or change anything in its decision 
concerning me i am asking the court to ensure that a civilly 
incorporated university follow its own bylaws and its contract with 
me

the agriculture department has ordered an 
immediate quarantine for 13 states to help prevent the further 
spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the us bee industry 
the restrictions announced wednesday ban the shipment from 
those states of bees and apiary equipment said larry b slagle 
acting associate administrator of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service 
states affected by the quarantine are florida illinois maine 
michigan mississippi nebraska new york ohio pennsylvania 
south carolina south dakota washington and wisconsin 
of the major honey producing states only california and north 
dakota so far remain unaffected by the mites whose scientific name 
is varroa jacobsoni the female is about onetwentieth of an inch 
in diameter and the male is somewhat smaller 
the mites were discovered in the united states last september in 
a wisconsin apiary and since have spread to the 12 other states 
varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees 
package bees hives pollen honeycomb with brood cells and apiary 
equipment and vehicles slagle said under our regulations 
these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from 
quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met 
the female varroa mite lays 3 to 20 eggs in the protective comb 
cell of a developing bee young mites emerge and suck the blood of 
the bee larvae killing or causing them to be deformed and useless 
to the hive in which case they are killed by the worker bees 
if agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites 
they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out 
of the quarantined states slagle said in other cases a limited 
permit may be issued to move articles that do not pose a pest 
risk provided that additional precautions are taken 
slagle said the quarantine order will help protect our 
beekeeping industry as well as the estimated 20 billion worth of 
agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year 
the external parasites can infest bees and their developing 
larvae so gradually that the mites are unnoticed until serious 
damage is done the damage includes decreased broods deformed bees 
and a weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants and 
produce honey 
caree lawrence an agency spokeswoman said no termination date 
for the quarantine was set and that she had no idea when the 
restrictions might be lifted 
the environmental protection agency in january approved the use 
of a chemical fluvalinate in the fumigation of bees and hives for 
mites she said a texas company zoecon corp of dallas 
manufactures a plastic strip under the commercial name apistan 
which contains fluvalinate 
ms lawrence said the strips can be used to fumigate bees and 
hives with the supers or honey collectors removed first in order 
to be certified as free of mites 
but as for a general breakthrough in the prevention or rapid 
eradication of varroa mites she said usda scientists are still 
looking 
after the mites were detected last year some experts speculated 
that the pests might have come into the united states as much as 
two or three years before but no one knows for sure 
some authorities said the varroa mite orginated in asia where it 
coexisted with asian honeybees however us bees are of european 
origin and are highly vulnerable to the pests

cattle tick fever is being targeted by 
agriculture department scientists in a new experiment this year on 
st croix in the us virgin islands 
millions of sterile male cattle ticks will be released on a st 
croix test site to see whether the procedure can be used to control 
cattle fever officials said wednesday 
we hope sterile male releases will stop female ticks from 
producing new generations that would infest cattle said ronald 
b davey an entomologist in the departments agricultural research 
service island people are safe from the disease humans are not 
bitten by the tick nor do they get the disease 
cattle fever or babesiosis kills up to 80 percent of the adult 
cattle that get the disease he said 
the experiment will be tried for the first time late this 
year on st croix cattle fever is widespread in the caribbean 
including the us virgin islands and puerto rico as well as in 
mexico and many other areas he said 
davey who works at the agencys cattle tick fever research 
laboratory mission texas said cattle become anemic after the 
ticks bite them and injects a protozoan parasite into the 
bloodstream 
cattle ticks periodically sneak over the mexican border into 
texas where a usda eradication program stops them from spreading 
beyond a buffer zone he said 
these ticks are tough davey said in a statement issued 
here if they were to get a strong hold again in the southern 
united states the disease could devastate the southern cattle 
industry all us cattle breeds are susceptible 
the sterile male ticks are hybrids which produce no offspring 
when they mate davey said the test will be on 130 wooded acres

president reagans men are dropping hints that 
the president is ready to hit the campaign trail on george bushs 
behalf after a hopedfor triumphal return from the moscow summit 
yet no matter when reagan makes his choice known his 
involvement in the bush campaign must walk a careful line its 
possible reagans involvement could overshadow rather than enhance 
the vice presidents effort 
the president will help the vice president in any way shape 
or form predicted ed rollins reagans former political adviser 
but its got to be george bush who lays out the bush agenda 
wed love to see ronald reagan campaign for george bush 
said rep tony coelho dcalif the house democratic whip 
reagans strength is his personality and thats not george bushs 
strength on the stump reagan would make bush look weak 
reagan has been meticulous about maintaining an official 
neutrality now that bush has nearly racked up enough delegates to 
be the nominee the white house has given notice reagan is itching 
to take a more active role 
hes ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on the 
road spokesman marlin fitzwater announced last week 
taking note of bushs string of primary and caucus victories 
fitzwater said he wanted to raise the possibility that reagan will 
abandon his pledge to campaign only after a nominee had been chosen 
at the aug 1518 gop convention in new orleans 
i think that in view of the way the campaign has developed 
we could see the president involved in some political activities 
before the nominating convention activities that are directly 
associated with the nominee fitzwater said 
but another white house aide speaking privately said reagan 
realizes he will be a target in the campaign and he will not make a 
step until bush asks him 
clearly a lot of dialogue this fall will focus on us with the 
democrats attacking our record and the vice president supporting 
it the official said anything we do will be carefully 
coordinated with the vice president 
white house political director frank donatelli refused to 
speculate on what form reagans activities might take 
but he said reagan will not take part in any active 
campaigning until after the summit with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev the meeting is scheduled for the second week of june 
rollins who most recently worked on jack kemps failed bid to 
win the nomination said that will be the perfect time for 
reagan to designate his successor 
hell come back riding high in the polls hell be as popular 
as hes ever been said rollins 
however rollins warned that the stature of the presidency could 
work against bush as well as help him 
bush needs to put his own stamp on his campaign rollins 
said if reagan is the one who gets into the debate with the 
democrats in the fall he could overshadow bush 
both rollins and donatelli contend that reagans involvement 
will help focus not fuzz the republican nominees message 
ronald reagan might not be able to determine the future but 
he can define the present and thats an important contribution to 
make to the dialogue donatelli said pointing out that reagan 
has referred repeatedly to the strength of the economy and low 
unemployment 
but rollins warned that some favorite reagan topics might well 
be avoided 
if the two of them go out and talk about the lineitem veto 
and the economic bill of rights theyll bore everybody to death 
he said 
and other issues such as the irancontra affair and edwin 
meeses legal difficulties are likely to be ignored 
if he spends the next months talking defending everything hes 
done and anybody whos ever worked for him he wont be 
effective rollins said of reagan 
it is just such issues that will attract voters to the 
democratic side coelho said 
he argued that american voters want a change and that bush must 
present himself as something different from reagan but when the 
president goes out for him it clouds bushs message reagan is the 
great communicator not bush the california democrat said 
coelho also argued that reagans approach to dealing with the 
soviets is one that is personally identified with the president 
and that it has never transferred to george bush 
george bushs resume is supposedly grounded on foreign policy 
as his forte and he hasnt shown that in eight years coelho said 
coelho also pointed out that reagan failed when he attempted in 
the 1986 campaign to keep the senate in gop hands although the 
president campaigned for months the republicans lost eight seats 
wed encourage such participation again he added with a 
laugh

glasnost has brought challenges for the voice 
of america the us government radio station reviled for years by 
the kremlin now that the soviets have stopped jamming its 
broadcasts voa has to be more interesting 
we now use more actualities and music voa director richard 
carlson said in an interview and instead of recycling programs 
several times a day to go through despite jamming voa now produces 
fresh material for every program 
we now have to be more competitive carlson said citing 
broadcasts of the british broadcasting corp and the moreopen 
soviet media under the glasnost or openness policies of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
we have tried to make our programming more interesting now 
that people dont have to listen through eight frequencies of 
interference 
but the voa hasnt softened its view of soviet affairs 
editorials try to put gorbachevs reforms within a realistic 
context carlson said like jamming it is intellectually 
difficult to applaud people for stopping what they were not 
supposed to be doing in the first place 
one of the things that we have not changed is the tone and 
tenor of our broadcasting we are not being kinder to gorbachev we 
think we have been fair all along 
carlson last december returned from a 10day tour of the soviet 
union the first ever by a voa director charles z wick head of 
the us information agency which administers voa also has 
traveled to the soviet union and poland 
and the head of voas russian service gerd von demming is just 
back from a trip that took him to soviet armenia a week before 
demonstrations broke out there in february 
after they left the soviet union von demming and a colleague 
voas vienna correspondent joylon naegle telephoned contacts they 
made in armenia and broadcast reports on the demonstrations there 
although gorbachev has opened some doors to voa he still voices 
the longtime soviet complaint about foreign voices fomenting 
unrest 
various radio stations including official ones have joined 
in the subversive activity gorbachev said tuesday especially 
active is deutsche welle west german radio 
they are trying to interfere in our internal affairs to 
exacerbate problems from the outside and engaging in 
provocations he said in remarks distributed by tass news agency 
at present this is particularly visible in connection with the 
events around nagornokarabakh a scene of armenian unrest 
carlson said he hopes that kremlin ire will not torpedo voas 
longstanding request to open a bureau in moscow 
in keeping with all the remarkably successful public relations 
moves by the soviets we think we may win approval carlson said 
later this month voa is planning its first callin show in 
which broadcasters will field questions relayed from soviet 
listeners dialing direct to london 
and on tuesday voa conducted its first telephone interview with 
a soviet official pyotr morozov director of the department of 
scientific research at the allunion institute for mental health in 
moscow morozovs boss marat vartanian for years has denied 
allegations that the soviet union incarcerated dissidents in 
psychiatric hospitals 
during the interview said carlson morozov repeated the soviet 
denials but acknowledged that some people sentenced for criminal 
offenses were treated in psychiatric hospitals 
soviet authorities treat political dissidents with debilitating 
drugs in psychiatric hospitals according to peter reddaway 
secretary of the kennan institute for advanced russian studies and 
ellen mercer of the american psychiatric association numerous 
soviet emigre accounts also have described the practice 
we have a list of more than 100 people who were convicted of 
political crimes and sent to psychiatric hospitals said cathy 
fitzpatrick of the helsinki watch committee in new york 
carlson said voa would combine morozovs comments with those of 
mercer fitzpatrick and a moscowbased dissident during a broadcast 
to the soviet union next week 
previously said carlson voa has spoken by phone with 
dissidents such as andrei d sakharov but never with an official 
the soviet union jammed voa broadcasts until 1973 when a period 
of sovietamerican detente began jamming resumed in 1980 with the 
rise of the independent solidarity trade union in poland 
the soviets stopped jamming broadcasts to the soviet union last 
may 26 and stopped interfering with broadcasts to poland this 
january polishlanguage broadcasts had been jammed by military 
transmitters inside the soviet union said carlson 
although the soviets have stopped jamming broadcasts by voa the 
bbc and deutsche welle they still try to block reception of two 
other usfunded stations radio liberty and radio free europe 
to reach different groups in the soviet union voa broadcasts in 
a number of languages including russian ukrainian uzbek azeri 
lithuanian estonian latvian armenian and georgian 
voa transmissions to other countries in the soviet bloc include 
broadcasts in polish czech slovak hungarian romanian and german

a nonprofit housing group says its new poll 
shows that people are willing to pay higher taxes to ensure that 
poor and middleclass americans get decent affordable housing 
theres no doubt the american people support programs to 
expand home ownership help lowincome renters and aid the 
homeless national housing institute chairman john atlas said 
wednesday and contrary to the conventional wisdom theyre 
willing to pay 
the poll found that most americans believe there is a lack of 
affordable housing for the poor and middle class most of those 
surveyed said they would pay an extra 10 to 15 a month in taxes 
for programs to aid the homeless the elderly and middleclass 
families unable to make down payments to buy houses 
the survey also found that nearly 75 percent of the american 
public believes a presidential candidate who advocates housing 
programs for middleand workingclass families understands the 
real needs in america 
the vast majority 86 percent said they feel homelessness is 
a national disgrace and an even higher percentage 93 percent 
said homelessness is an important problem that should be 
eliminated 
politically a presidential candidate who guarantees every 
american a decent affordable home might have a new home himself 
on pennsylvania avenue atlas said 
the report a status report on the american dream how the 
american people view housing problems and programs today was 
based on polling by r l associates of princeton nj the firm 
interviewed 1001 adults by telephone during february and march 
michael rappaport spokesman for the polling firm said the margin 
of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points 
in general the survey found that at least twothirds of those 
questioned support programs to finance renovations in housing for 
the elderly to rehabilitate old and vacant buildings to establish 
a homeless prevention program to help those close to eviction for 
financial reasons and to begin a mortgage assistance program to 
help with downpayments 
on the issue of higher taxes to support housing programs 66 
percent said they would be willing to spend 10 a month more while 
55 percent said they would agree to pay 15 a month more 
the poll also found that half of those surveyed said they would 
be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports a package of 
housing programs while only 6 percent said they would be less 
likely to support such a candidate 
seventyfour percent said they believe a presidential candidate 
who advocates housing programs for middle and workingclass 
families understands the real needs in america 
the american people are increasingly aware that this nation 
faces a housing problem atlas said our poll shows that 
americans understand that its hard to find affordable housing and 
that americans are shocked at homelessness 
he said the housing institute which describes itself as a 
representative of housing interests for moderate and lowincome 
families cannot lobby congress for housing programs because of its 
nonprofit status it does plan to provide its poll data to other 
groups that can promote the programs 
atlas said spending authority for the department of housing and 
urban development dropped 57 percent from 1980 to 1987 from 357 
billion a year to 152 billion and he said that the hud budget 
last year represented 1 percent of the federal budget

only about half the adults who have a computer 
at home actually use it as opposed to nearly threequarters of all 
children the census bureau reports 
youngsters use computers for learning and for games and many 
children are also exposed to the machines in school said bureau 
statistician robert kominski whose survey was released wednesday 
even though many adults use computers at work the home computer 
may have been bought by one adult for a specific use and not be of 
interest to others in the home kominski suggested 
in addition many computers were bought as learning tools and 
game machines for children he said so there probably are 
quite a few situations in households where children use a computer 
and not the adults at all 
the report was based on a survey taken in october 1984 the only 
time the bureau has looked at computer use the report was delayed 
because of other priorities he said 
computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million home 
computers in use at the time of the survey 
international data corp a bostonbased market research group 
estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly 
165 million as of last year 
and electronic industries association a trade group estimates 
the total at 176 million homes as of january 
while it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use the 
census analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses the 
machines 
of 221 million americans aged 3 and over in 1984 more than one 
in five 211 percent reported using computers in some direct 
way 
some 82 percent of households 69 million owned a home 
computer 
ownership was most likely in households with incomes of 50000 
or more 229 percent only 17 percent of households with incomes 
under 10000 had a computer 
people aged 34 to 44 were most likely to own computers those 
with children were three times more likely to have a machine than 
were the childless 
of the 15 million adults in computer households 533 percent 
reported using the machine use by men was 631 percent compared 
to 482 percent of women usage was highest in the 25 to 34 age 
group 
adults in the west and northeast were most likely to have a 
computer at home 103 percent and 102 percent respectively but 
westerners were much more likely to use them 579 percent to 498 
percent 
in the midwest 89 percent of adults had a home computer and 
545 percent of them used it the rates were 77 percent of adults 
in the south with a computer and 516 percent using it 
nearly onefourth 246 percent of all employed adults used a 
computer at work reversing the home pattern women were more 
likely to use them there 290 percent to 212 percent 
the highest rate of use was 391 percent of women in technical 
and support jobs while the top rate for men was 386 percent in 
administrative and management positions 
among children aged 3 to 17 153 percent had a computer at 
home and 742 percent of those used it of those enrolled in 
school 28 percent reported using computers 
among youngsters the study found boys generally use computers 
more than girls 
if you want to risk saying anything is a sociocultural 
difference at this time thats certainly where it lies kominski 
said people who study computer games find boys use these things 
much more than girls do they go to video parlors more and they 
use computers more at home and school too 
in school the highest usage was in the midwest where 339 
percent of students said they had computers the rate was 308 
percent in the northeast 294 percent in the west and 213 percent 
in the south

three years ago paul walton set up a card 
table on a downtown street corner here to preach the benefits of 
longdistance telephone competition and sign up customers for a 
company called us telecom 
the 32yearold san diego entrepreneur returned to that street 
corner wednesday to tell customers shareholders and anyone else 
who would listen that the company now called us sprint 
communications co is plagued by billing and management problems 
that are costing millions in lost business 
walton who says he signed up more than 600000 residential 
customers for us sprint has been waging an unusual grassroots 
campaign to oust the companys management and install himself as 
president to clean house 
im appealing to customers and shareholders not to rely on the 
present management to correct the problems walton said in an 
interview before a speech to a curious lunchtime crowd outside the 
federal communications commissions headquarters 
management has been totally unresponsive to the problems 
which walton says cost him millions in lost commissions for his 
sales efforts as well as millions in lost business for the company 
us sprint the nations thirdlargest longdistance carrier has 
acknowledged its billing problems and admitted that bad debt has 
contributed to the companys losses spokesman syd courson said the 
firm plans to have new computer software installed by january to 
take care of the problem 
weve owned up to our billing problems and weve done a lot to 
correct them courson said adding that walton has become a 
nuisance 
last week walton took his entourage complete with a large 
campaign banner to los angeles dallas st louis chicago and 
atlanta this week he touched down in san francisco and denver 
before arriving in washington 
all this is leading up to election appeals he hopes to make 
personally to shareholders at meetings april 12 for united 
telecommunications inc in kansas city and april 20 for gte corp 
in stamford conn us sprint was formed as a joint venture by those 
two companies in july 1986 
but he faces one big stumbling block shareholders do not elect 
the president 
shareholders however can raise issues like his at annual 
meetings and since he owns united telecommunications stock he can 
make comments at that meeting but since there is no election i 
dont know what his purpose is said united telecommunications 
spokesman don forsythe walton is not a gte shareholder 
walton worked as an independent sales contractor for us telecom 
and us sprint from 1984 to 1986 during that period the former 
high school teacher hired a sales force of about 400 young people 
who worked street corners and college campuses across the country 
signing up new customers 
but many of those they signed up never got service were billed 
for calls never made never received bills from us sprint but were 
contacted by collection agencies or had other problems with 
service he said 
for walton this meant problems receiving his commissions he 
was supposed to be credited when customers made their first us 
sprint calls but because of problems installing service and 
billing customers walton estimated that about half his recruits 
were never counted for a commission 
after his contract with us sprint was ended in september 1986 
walton wrote scores of letters to us sprint executives about his 
lost commissions and the companys billing problems 
at the time walton said the company owed him between 3 
million and 8 million in unpaid commissions he eventually settled 
for nearly 2 million including a 17 million payment in january 
in total he said he received about 6 million from us sprint 
during his 2 years of recruiting he said he paid close to 5 
million of that to his young workers 
but walton says it is not the money that is driving his campaign 
to oust us sprint president robert h snedaker 
my integrity is at stake walton said i wanted to make 
more money and feel good about it at the same time

they were together at the discovery of the 
north pole in 1909 but in death matthew alexander henson was in a 
shared grave in new york while adm robert e peary was honored at 
arlington national cemetery 
henson was black and for that reason said supporter dr s 
allen counter he was denied proper recognition because of the 
racial attitudes of his time 
on wednesday 79 years to the day after henson planted the 
american flag on the north pole the two explorers were reunited as 
hensons remains and those of his wife were reinterred with full 
military honors at arlington 
now finally matthew henson and robert peary can talk about 
old days out there a parteskimo grandson qitdlaq henson of 
qaanaaq greenland said through a translator his cousin navarana 
harper at a news conference following the ceremony 
i have waited for this day for over 30 years hensons great 
niece olive henson fulton of roxbury mass told the gathering of 
about 100 relatives and admirers at the windswept hilltop burial 
site 
recalling that she was expelled from school because she had 
written a paper about henson when her assignment had been to write 
about a hero ms fulton said finally my uncle is given his 
place in history 
counter said the reinterment of henson and his wife lucy ross 
henson was long overdue recognition for our hero that 
would right a tragic wrong 
welcome home matthew henson he said welcome home to a 
new day in america may your presence here inspire generations 
of explorers 
last october president reagan approved counters petition to 
allow hensons remains to be reinterred at arlington he had been 
buried in 1955 in woodlawn cemetery in new york 
among those honoring henson at the ceremony were gen julius 
beckton of the white house military office who conveyed greetings 
from reagan john h johnson the chairman and chief executive 
officer of johnson publishing co which publishes ebony and jet 
magazines col guion s bluford the first black astronaut and 
dorothy height the president of the national council of negro 
women 
counter an associate professor of neurophysiology at harvard 
university who previously had brought together hensons and pearys 
parteskimo offspring said peary had insisted before his own death 
in 1920 that hensons achievements be recognized 
descendants of matthew and lucy henson were joined at the 
ceremony by hensons parteskimo descendants 
this is a very special day for them ms harper said at the 
news conference translating for another of hensons grandsons

to express that 
hensons eldest parteskimo grandson avataq henson also of 
morriussaq clutched to his chest the flag that had draped his

george bushs campaign treasury is filled to 
the brim and campaign officials say the biggest worry now is 
guarding against spending more than the 27 million preconvention 
limit set by federal election law 
the vice presidents campaign has already spent all but 4 
million of that cap with more than four months yet to go to the 
republican convention this august said campaign treasurer fred 
bush 
the bush campaign hit the contribution limit on wednesday 
reporting that it had raised a total of 30 million including 
225 million in direct contributions and commitments for another 
75 million in federal matching funds 
this total includes about 3 million earmarked for legal and 
accounting expenses which are exempt from the 27 millionlimit 
the challenge is to take that 4 million we have left and 
maximize it so that george bush gets the best benefit out of that 
he can said the campaign official who is not related to 
candidate bush 
im thrilled fred bush said in an interview as far as 
this process is concerned were finished 
the cap applies to both raising funds and spending them 
gop contender pat robertson was the first candidate to actually 
bump up against the spending ceiling 
the former televison evangelist said after the costly super 
tuesday contests on march 8 that he was within 2 million of the 
spending cap since then he has laid off staff and dropped an 
extensive television marketing operation though he has only 17 
delegates to bushs 888 he remains in the race and is spending the 
rest of his money primarily on personal travel 
fred bush said staying within the limits is far easier because 
bush is now running virtually unopposed among republicans 
its a fait accompli as far as the nomination you dont have 
to go on advertising you dont have to buy more tv ads you dont 
have to have a huge entourage he said 
the vice president had already scaled down his campaign schedule 
in the aftermath of sen bob doles withdrawal last week from the 
race 
the vice president plans to go ahead with fundraising events 
scheduled for this weekend in texas and florida next week in new 
york and connecticut and later in the month in washington dc 
the reason fred bush said that the campaign is still entitled 
to raise another 28 million to go into a compliance fund 
money needed for complying with various provisions enforced by the 
federal election commission 
he said the campaign will still continue to raise funds until 
that 28 million has been met and then will close up its 
fundraising operation 
funds for the general election campaign are provided from tax 
dollars and from a presidential trust funds that can be 
raised and spent by the national parties on behalf of their 
nominees 
fred bush said contributors who have written checks to the 
george bush campaign that havent yet been cashed soon will be 
receiving letters 
we will write those people and explain to them that we are 
over the legal maximum and would they allow us to use that check 
for the compliance fund we have to have their signature 
otherwise we will have to return the check 
i think it will be a pretty easy 28 million to raise he 
added

democratic party leaders are looking to new 
york and asking if michael dukakis can extend his winning streak to 
four and finally give the party a presidential frontrunner 
while many democrats were sounding optimistic about the 
prospects of a breakthrough in the long rollercoaster race they 
also were painfully aware of the many occasions one or another 
candidate looked on the verge of claiming the title of frontrunner 
every time we get a frontrunner it seems folks want to slow 
it down said john c white a former national party chairman who 
is advising jesse jackson 
watching most closely are those elected and party officials 
645 strong designated as uncommitted delegates to the democratic 
national convention the socalled super delegates expected to hold 
the balance of power 
the super delegates are looking for a candidate who can rattle 
off a big string of wins said rick wiener michigan democratic 
party chairman 
it was in michigans caucuses in march 26 that jackson trounced 
dukakis and surged to the forefront of the contest raising talk of 
the likelihood of a brokered convention michigan came shortly 
after a dukakis loss in illinois 
but since then the massachusetts governor has scored victories 
in connecticut colorado and wisconsin and now is favored to extend 
his streak in new york which holds its primary on april 19 
the nominee will be determined in new york and pennsylvania 
said rachelle horowitz political director of the american 
federation of teachers and a member of the democratic national 
committee i think we have a twoperson race and we have a 
frontrunner the likelihood is well have a nominee and not a 
brokered convention 
the wisconsin vote gives a little boost to dukakis said 
joseph crangle erie county ny democratic chairman and one of 
the partys super delegates but youve got to put a qualifying 
clause there that youve got to have a pattern youve got to go 
two or three states in a row in order to say that youre a 
frontrunner 
party chairman paul g kirk jr predicted the democrats would 
choose their nominee on the first ballot of the atlanta convention 
and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stopjackson 
movement 
theres not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders 
trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another said kirk 
a total of 2082 delegates is needed for a convention majority 
to reach that number either dukakis or jackson would need to win 
more than 1300 of the 1600plus committed delegates yet to be 
chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates 
the super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while 
predicted white 
wiener said the super delegates were looking for a candidate 
who can rattle off a big string of wins he said most of those 
delegates accept the view that if there is a clear leader after 
california and new jersey the last two big states to hold 
primaries that super delegates ought to play a leading role in 
propelling that person over the top at three in a row gov 
dukakis has gotten a very good start on that

the judge in the irancontra case says he 
wants to streamline procedures for pretrial disclosure of 150000 
pages of classified documents to the four defendants 
signaling his intention to move the case to trial as quickly as 
possible us district judge gerhard a gesell on wednesday 
rejected independent counsel lawrence e walshs proposal to 
prevent unauthorized disclosure of the classified material as too 
cumbersome 
the proposed procedure for three months of pretrial discovery 
appears to be far too complex lacks definite time restrictions 
and creates undue obstacles to the fair and expeditious disposition 
of this case gesell said in a brief opinion 
at a hearing scheduled for next tuesday gesell said he 
intends to determine the timing of discovery disclosures in 
relation to a realistic trial date 
gesell said he will ask walsh to say which documents will be 
made available immediately to the defense walsh had said in 
pleadings filed monday that he planned to turn over the material to 
the defendants in the next three months 
the judge also said he wants to set a deadline this month for 
completion of an interagency review of the documents which walsh 
says describe in detail some of the nations most carefully held 
secrets about its foreign policy its intelligence activities and 
its covert activities 
an objection to walshs plan was filed by defense lawyers for 
former national security adviser john m poindexter lt col 
oliver l north and arms dealers richard v secord and albert hakim 
the four are accused of conspiring to illegally divert proceeds 
from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
among elements of the security plan the defense found 
objectionable was a requirement that the defendants and their 
lawyers answer detailed government questionnaires in order to 
obtain security clearances to review the documents 
requiring the defendants to answer detailed questions about 
their travel aliases corporate affiliations and other matters 
potentially at issue in the case could violate their fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination the defense said 
the joint opposition also noted that north and poindexter had 
previously had access to many of the documents when they worked at 
the national security council 
gesell said it will be necessary to frame a more limited 
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case which in 
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified 
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site

vice president george bush met wednesday with 
senate minority leader bob dole his vanquished rival for the 
republican presidential nomination in their first private session 
since a stormy confrontation in february on the senate floor 
bush told reporters that the men had a good friendly 
discussion during which they talked about how to beat 
democrats 
the meeting held in the capitol followed an earlier session in 
the same building between dole and pat robertson the former 
television evangelist is continuing his quest for the gop 
presidential nomination but has all but conceded that bush will be 
his partys selection 
asked after his meeting with bush whether the two men had buried 
the hatchet dole said i dont have a hatchet im a nice 
fellow 
bush said he envisioned a role for dole in the general election 
in which the kansan would work as much as he possibly has time to 
give a lot of its here and a lot of it i hope will be around the 
country 
dole said that bush had asked for the meeting and said the 
discussion was about getting george elected in november 
dole spokesman walt riker said later that the men talked about 
keeping the republican nomination interesting until the 
convention in august and ways to get the issues out there 
in an unusual floor confrontation feb 4 amid a contra aid vote 
dole accused bush of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to 
groveling in the mud 
the faceoff was sparked by a bush campaign statement headlined 
doles cronyism and meanspiritedness questioned the statement 
by an iowa aide implied that dole accepted favors from the wealthy 
and said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind 
trust once held by his wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth hanford dole 
dole called the statement nasty mean personal and 
vindictive bushs campaign manager lee atwater said dole was 
overreacting and behaving like a typical schoolyard bully he 
can dish it out but if someone hits him back he starts whining 
the incident epitomized the bitterness of the campaign between 
the two men but dole dropped out of the race and endorsed bush 
last month 
after his meeting with dole robertson said he would stay in the 
race until he was assured that the gop platform would be 
conservative enough to keep his supporters active in the campaign 
he promised he would be loyal to the partys candidate 
theres no question that we plan to support the republican 
nominee and it looks as though its going to be george bush 
robertson said 
robertson said he wanted to be a rallying point for 
conservatives at the gop convention in new orleans so he could 
encourage his supporters to remain involved in republican politics 
i want to make sure that its the type of platform that will 
make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work he 
said 
robertson told the new york times he would not campaign in new 
york before the april 19 primary and said he would ask for the 
termination of his secret service protection 
in an interview published in thursdays editions of the paper 
he said it would be more quixotic than it is realistic to 
continue actively campaigning 
robertson had already laid off most of his campaign staff and 
has made only a few campaign appearances recently because he is 
bumping up against federal campaign spending limits

the need to protect against people with the 
aids virus who knowingly try to spread the disease must be balanced 
against the need to protect individual rights a public health 
expert told the white house aids commission 
an isolation statute could require a due process determination 
that a viral carrier is unwilling or unable to refrain from 
engaging in conduct likely to spread the disease larry gostin 
testified wednesday before the panel 
constitutionally allowable isolation would not focus on a 
persons status as having an infection or a disease but upon his 
or her behavior leading to transmission said gostin 
gostin executive director of the american society of law amp 
medicine and associate professor at the harvard school of public 
health was among 28 witnesses appearing before the panel in two 
days of hearings this week 
the commission working toward a june 24 final report has 
scheduled three more days of hearings later this month 
a michigan prosecutor told the commission that existing laws are 
inadequate to deal with people who know they are infected with the 
virus and behave in a manner that could spread it to others 
the citizens of this country deserve protection from being 
recklessly or intentionally targeted for exposure to this dreadful 
disease said robert e weiss of flint mich 
weiss the elected prosecuting attorney in genesee county 
explained his rationale for filing assault with intent to murder 
charges against a man infected with the virus who tried to spit on 
police after being arrested for drunken driving 
he fought with the arresting officers and once lodged kept 
spitting through the bars of his cell taunting the officers and 
daring them to come closer so he could give them aids said 
weiss 
we filed under the theory that his expressed intention to 
communicate an incurable terminal disease amounted to an intent to 
cause death he explained 
the court reduced the attempted murder charge to assault on an 
officer partially on grounds there is insufficient evidence that 
the virus can be spread by spitting said weiss 
he said that although the percentage of aids carriers who will 
maliciously or irresponsibly place others at risk is largely 
speculative this fact should not deter us from developing a 
legislative framework to control such conduct

the national highway traffic safety 
administration says crash tests of nine 1988 vehicles show drivers 
of the peugeot 505 gls have the greatest chance of sustaining a 
head injury 
a 35 mph crash of the fourdoor compact into a fixed barrier 
produced a headinjury criterion of 1701 on the driver the highest 
recorded among this years tests 
the headinjury criterion is an index of the force experienced 
by occupants of the car as measured by a test dummy the 
passengerside dummy recorded a headinjury criterion of 1457 
the peugeot results were among six released wednesday by nhtsa 
the agency had tested three vehicles earlier in the year 
the toyota corolla fx twodoor hatchback a subcompact produced 
a headinjury criterion of 593 for the driver and 397 for the 
passenger the driver headinjury criterion was the least among the 
nine models tested this year 
a second subcompact the toyota tercel twodoor hatchback 
produced a headinjury criterion of 1005 for the driver and 398 for 
the passenger 
in compact car crash tests the nissan maxima se fourdoor 
produced a headinjury criteria of 907 for the driver and 861 for 
the passenger and the pontiac le mans twodoor aerocoupe produced 
headinjury criteria of 819 for the driver and 897 for the 
passenger 
wednesdays test results included one van the volkswagen 
vanagon with headinjury criteria of 1320 for the driver and 899 
for the passenger 
earlier nhtsa had released test results on the 1988 volkswagen 
fox ford taurus and mercury sable 
the crashtest results are intended to help consumers compare 
vehicles when deciding which to buy nhtsa said only one vehicle 
of each model is tested and further crash tests could produce 
different results nhtsa said 
the 35 mph crash speed was 5 mph faster or onethird more 
severe than that specified by federal motor vehicle safety 
standards the 30 mph standards permit a maximum headinjury 
criterion of 1000 and higher figures can be expected at the higher 
speed nhtsa said

two local republicans riding with george bush in 
the vice presidential limousine were serving as a welcoming 
committee but bush wanted to talk business 
if dukakis wins this thing on the other side you guys are 
going to have to help me in setting the record straight bush 
told them as his motorcade wound through narrow city streets from 
the coast guard station in bostons north end to a political rally 
at faneuil hall 
the vice president was talking about massachusetts gov michael 
s dukakis who has a strong shot at facing bush in the general 
election next fall bush wanted to make sure he knows the full 
details of the governors record said state sen paul cellucci 
who sat next to bush 
riding in the jump seat was state sen david locke who along 
with cellucci is cochairman of the bush campaign in massachusetts 
if we can help you understand the dukakis philosophy we will 
do that locke told bush 
that conversation as recalled by the two senators occurred 
feb 24 two weeks before bushs super tuesday landslide since 
then his principal rival bob dole has bowed out 
with the nomination virtually locked up bush is plotting 
strategy against the democrats 
dukakis whose treasury and organization far outstrip those of 
the other democrats has drawn by far the most attention with 
three wins in a row under his belt in connecticut colorado and 
wisconsin he is well positioned for the new york primary later 
this month 
in addition dukakis is the only democrat who competes well 
against bush in hypothetical matchups in recent public opinion 
polls 
theres a perception within the bush campaign that dukakis is 
in a strong position to win it cellucci said were compiling 
data that will indicate that the governor did not have much to do 
with the strong economy in massachusetts 
he maintained that military spending tax cuts a property tax 
limitation law and reaganomics are responsible 
we also want to be in a position where the vice president can 
demonstrate that mike dukakis is a liberal and he believes in big 
government cellucci said i dont think thats anything thats 
going to be too difficult to demonstrate 
dukakis cellucci said has been trying to move to the 
middle by touting his own tax reductions his record of balancing 
budgets and his opposition to communist expansion in central 
america but cellucci said the change is so startling and 
dramatic that you have to question its sincerity 
the intelligencegathering effort on dukakis is not limited to 
the material locke and cellucci can provide 
the republican national committee which looks into the 
background of all the democratic candidates has had a researcher 
assigned to dukakis for nearly a year according to rnc spokesman 
albert maruggi the researcher spent a full week at republican 
state committee headquarters in boston poring over clippings files 
and old speeches 
the rnc now has an extensive computer file at its fingertips 
into which key words like taxes budgets and welfare 
can be punched to yield whatever dukakis has said on the subjects 
citizens for limited taxation a conservative taxpayer advocacy 
group in boston has distributed a 60page information packet to 
reporters republican researchers and operatives for dukakis 
democratic opponents 
the packet colorcoded by issues includes newspaper 
clippings with headlines like tax cut is vetoed by dukakis 
and report downplays dukakis impact on economy

drug agents jokingly refer to it as mexican 
extradition courts use the more dignified term informal 
rendition defense attorneys call it just plain kidnapping 
whatever name you use us authorities flexing the long arm of 
their law have had several successes luring spiriting or forcing 
criminal suspects out of seeming safe havens abroad into custody in 
america 
it happened last year to an arab who fell prey to an fbi ruse 
and ended up in custody to await trial in a 1985 beirut plane 
hijacking to edwin wilson a former cia agent accused of selling 
weapons to libya and to dr timothy leary the drug cultists icon 
of the 1960s who was tracked down in afghanistan after escaping 
from a california jail 
the most recent example occurred tuesday when a monthlong 
ushonduran operation led to the unwilling odyssey of alleged 
international cocaine czar juan ramon matta ballesteros from his 
home in honduras to a jail in illinois 
honduran police abetted by us marshals arrested matta and put 
him on a plane to the dominican republic where he was hustled to a 
flight bound for new york and shipped to a federal penitentiary in 
marion ill us officials said 
matta who holds colombian and honduran citizenship was wanted 
on drug charges in the united states and was sought for questioning 
in the murder of a us drug enforcement agent in mexico 
one law enforcement official described matta as being 
stunned to find himself in the united states as the result of 
an operation apparently designed to get around honduran law 
the united states has extradition treaties with more than 100 
countries but many nations like honduras do not extradite their 
nationals even when they do or if a us citizen is involved the 
legal proceedings are sometimes long and often fruitless 
there are surer ways to bring a suspect to the united states 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said wednesday one 
method as in the matta case is to get foreign governments to 
cooperate with us authorities to arrange a transfer 
or the suspect is lured back without foreign help 
there have been some dramatic examples 
last year according to the fbi undercover agents tracking 
fawaz younis a suspect in the hijacking of a jordanian aircraft 
tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the mediterranean sea and 
arrested him under a us law giving american courts jurisdiction 
to try suspected terrorists who act against us citizens younis 
is awaiting trial in washington 
in 1982 former cia agent wilson who had fled to libya after 
being indicted on weapons sales charges was duped by an 
acquaintance into flying to the dominican republic 
authorities there put him on a nonstop flight to the united 
states where he was arrested 
leary who escaped in 1970 from a california jail was turned 
over to us narcotics agents in afghanistan even though the two 
countries had no extradition treaty 
in a case that did involve extradition carlos lehder a 
colombian wanted in connection with a massive drug conspiracy was 
flown to florida last year to stand trial on narcotics charges 
the dea which has 65 offices in 43 countries is especially 
active in what it calls coptocop arrangements with foreign 
police agencies 
turning suspects over to us authorities without formal 
proceedings is often called mexican extradition from the 
tradition of authorities in that country taking people to the us 
border and sending them across the line into the waiting arms of 
american police 
the legal term is informal rendition a us government 
attorney said we find someone in another country who is wanted 
here we go to the authorities and say were interested in the 
person they kick him out by putting him on a plane to the united 
states and thats it 
he said it was not clear how many suspects come to the united 
states each year by such means 
defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases notably the 
wilson and younis cases have sought dismissal of charges on 
grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendants rights by in 
effect kidnapping them 
appeals courts however have upheld the prosecutions in most 
cases saying they are not particularly concerned about execution 
of the laws in foreign countries or how defendants got to the 
united states 
the only exception based on a ruling by the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals would be a case in which the manner of a 
suspects arrest and arrival in us custody shocked the 
conscience of the court 
under that rule the government could lose a case if the suspect 
proves he was tortured or otherwise severely mistreated in being 
arrested younis who arrived in the united states with two broken 
wrists after being arrested by the fbi is making such a claim 
sometimes information supplied by us authorities leads to 
extradition between two other countries 
in their investigation of the 1985 murder of dea agent enrique 
camarena salazar in guadalajara mexico us authorities informed 
costa rican police that a suspect rafael caroquintero was living 
in costa rica 
he was arrested there and extradited to mexico to stand trial

contempt citations are being sought against 
white house budget chief james miller and assistant labor secretary 
john pendergrass on a claim they are illegally blocking 
courtordered warnings to 18 million american workers about toxic 
chemicals 
the united steelworkers union filed suit against the two reagan 
administration officials wednesday in the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals in philadelphia which ordered the warnings last year 
under righttoknow regulations ordered last may by the 
court and issued in august by the occupational safety and health 
administration headed by pendergrass the labor department was 
scheduled to begin levying fines of up to 10000 when the warnings 
are absent 
however the office of management and budget headed by miller 
has delayed implementation of the new requirements the budget 
office claims some of the provisions run contrary to the 1980 
paperwork reduction act to reduce the mounting number of forms that 
the government requires businesses to handle 
in addition to the contempt citations the steelworkers want a 
court order fully implementing the regulations as issued last 
august by osha and an injunction prohibiting the administration 
from taking any further action to thwart them 
barbara clay a spokeswoman for the budget office said 
officials have not seen the suit yet and therefore had no comment 
on it 
the philadelphia appeals court is the same one that last may 
ordered pendergrass to issue the regulations or face a contempt 
citation then 
the regulations require employers in several industries to make 
sure warning labels are on some 600000 hazardous chemical products 
in an estimated 35 million workplaces employing 18 million workers 
administration officials have repeatedly cited the regulations 
as negating the need for the government to warn workers 
individually about health risks from exposure to carcinogens and 
other toxic substances 
those arguments were instrumental last week in the senates 
defeat of a housepassed bill that would have required individual 
warnings from the government to go out annually to some 300000 
workers judged to be at the greatest risk 
the american cancer society had estimated those individual 
warnings and medical monitoring programs based on them would have 
prevented 250000 cancer deaths over the next 10 years 
osha estimated that the righttoknow regulations would 
reduce chemically related injuries illnesses and deaths in 
nonmanufacturing industries by 20 percent a year 
the regulations were recommended in 1975 by a federal advisory 
commission to combat the annual 100000 deaths and 340000 
disabling illnesses and injuries blamed on occupational diseases 
formally known as the hazard communication standard the 
warnings were imposed by osha on the chemical industry and its 14 
million workers in 1985 
a year later under court orders in response to an earlier suit 
by the steelworkers union they were expanded to cover 14 million 
more workers employed by some 300000 manufacturers 
then the philadelphia federal appeals court last may ordered 
osha to expand the requirements further to protect the 18 million 
workers in agriculture construction services transportation and 
office occupations 
wed thought that after a decade of litigation we had won 
this fight margaret seminario a job health and safety 
specialist for the aflcio said wednesday now omb through the 
back door is trying to negate it all 
the regulations do not ban any hazardous substances or order any 
reductions in exposure however they do require employers to post 
data sheets offering information on each hazardous product and to 
train workers on proper safeguards 
the white house budget office has demanded that construction 
sites be excluded from the data sheet requirements 
and in response to complaints from the formaldehyde industry 
it also has disapproved language requiring warnings on building 
materials and permanentpress fabrics treated with that chemical 
when they are shipped to apparel manufacturers 
while many employers had sought the regulations because they 
preempt state and local righttoknow laws that often were more 
stringent others opposed them out of fears of potential lawsuits 
documentary evidence has hung many a king politician 
financial wizard whatever said robert moran a private 
washington attorney who specializes in workplace health and safety 
issues and thats what this regulation provides

chicago bears coach mike ditka is 
taking his steakandchops fare on the road after signing a 
tentative agreement to transform a bowling alley into a copy of his 
popular restaurantnightclub 
merribowl owners william and mary biernat said they have 
decided to retire from the 20000squarefoot business they founded 
27 years ago in this chicago suburb 
the biernats recently signed a tentative contract with ditka and 
a group of investors to sell the 24lane bowling alley host to 
about 1000 bowlers in various leagues 
if zoning changes are approved the proposed 15 million

a washington magazine is asking the pulitzer 
prize board to reconsider an award to the philadelphia inquirer 
saying the newspapers prizewinning entry replicated earlier work 
by others including one of the magazines reporters 
inquirer editors wednesday denied the accusation by the national 
journal that reporter tim weiner used an earlier article by journal 
reporter david c morrison as a blueprint for his series on a 
secret pentagon budget weiners series won a pulitzer for national 
writing 
jim naughton inquirer deputy managing editor said i think 
its a cheap publicity stunt to call attention to the magazine 
richard frank national journal editor wrote wednesday to the 
pulitzer board saying we make no accusation of plagiarism but 
by no account does the philadelphia inquirer series deserve a 
pulitzer because weiners reporting on the size and composition of 
the black budget plows no new journalistic ground 
the weekly journal owned by timesmirror does indepth 
reporting on government and has a circulation of 5000 mostly 
among government officials and journalists an annual subscription 
costs 584 
frank in an interview said he did not complain about the 
weiner articles when they first appeared because his publication is 
used to having its work lead to reporting by others but usually 
with some credit given 
the inquirer articles published in february 1987 do not 
mention the national journals report nearly a year earlier 
they could have avoided this if they had given some credit 
said frank but then they would not have won the pulitzer 
weiner who shared a 1982 pulitzer for reporting for the kansas 
city times said he wrote a sidebar to his articles citing morrison 
and describing how he analyzed the secret budget but it was 
spiked because it was deemed too boring 
weiner said he does not write to win prizes and feared 
journalism would be hurt by what he said are false allegations 
robert christopher pulitzer board secretary said he had been 
informed of the complaint but had not yet read the letter 
requesting board action clearly any allegation of this kind any 
complaint of this kind would be considered said christopher 
frank wrote that weiners story can only be read as a blatant 
and egregious case of building a news story according to someone 
elses blueprint in this case the national journals march 1 
1986 cover story the pentagons black budget 
frank told the board that several other news organizations also 
had earlier written about the money used to underwrite secret 
defense research and unpublicized aspects of the arms buildup 
he enclosed copies of the journal and inquirer stories along 
with a washington post article on preparations for world war iv 
which he said weiner substantially replicates in one of his 
reports 
the letter cites quotations from morrisons story that are 
nearly identical to those in weiners article and says in several 
places weiners phrasing and detail echo those in morrisons 
article 
however frank said he was not accusing weiner of lifting quotes 
he said at least one official acknowledged saying exactly the 
same thing to both reporters 
most of weiners sources are pretty much the ones that 
morrison had used a year earlier frank wrote 
we are confident that the board armed with these facts will 
reconsider its awarding of the prize to the weiner series the 
letter said 
frank said morrison in 1985 became the first to use pentagon 
documents to determine the size of the black budget at the 
time morrison was a senior research analyst at the center for 
defense information an independent think tank he later joined the 
journal 
morrison interviewed at the journal office said he thought 
weiner did an amazingly poor job in developing the story 
considering the amount of time he had he said the pulitzer board 
should make awards for groundbreaking stories adding im sorry 
they failed to do this 
inquirer managing editor gene foreman called the journal protest 
an unfair attack on tims reporting he said both stories quote 
some of the same sources because there are few sources available on 
the matter 
the journal did not inspire our story we did not replicate 
but went well beyond what it reported foreman said 
weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people around the 
country and was kneedeep in this before i saw davids work 
i think david morrison is a terrific reporter and he did fine 
work on this subject but hes making a false accusations and its 
a false controversy thats going to ultimately hurt journalism 
he said 
i dont write stories to win prizes and i wrote these to 
bring an important public policy issue to peoples attention he 
said 
jonathan neumann inquirer editor for investigative projects 
said the inquirer laid the groundwork for the black budget 
story even before weiner became involved and long before the 
morrison article was written

a technique for analyzing extremely small bits 
of genetic material shows promise for helping identify criminals 
from a single hair left at a crime scene researchers reported 
today 
the technique revealed which variant of a particular gene each 
of six people had by analysis of a single hair each person had 
shed the scientists wrote in the british journal nature 
john hicks deputy assistant director of the fbi laboratory in 
washington dc called the work very exciting 
the technique cannot yet prove that a hair came from a 
particular person but in combination with other evidence its 
result can be seen as very very significant he said 
further refinements may let it make identifications with more 
certainty 
the work was conducted by russell higuchi and henry erlich of 
the cetus corp of emeryville calif and george sensabaugh and 
cecilia von beroldingen of the university of california berkeley 
it focuses on dna or deoxyribonucleic acid which forms tiny 
threadlike structures called chromosomes in every cell of the 
body dna consists of sequences of chemicals some sequences form 
genes which control the activities of a cell 
details of dna sequences vary from person to person and 
researchers have exploited that fact to help solve crimes by 
studying such dna fingerprints 
in february for example a florida jury convicted a 24yearold 
man of rape after testimony that his dna matched that found in 
semen left by the rapist 
hair that has been ripped from the body as in a struggle often 
contains enough living tissue in its root area for conventional dna 
analysis 
but more often police recover hair that has simply fallen off a 
person at the crime scene and that hair contains far less dna 
experts say 
the california researchers overcame that problem by using a 
laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction that created 
100 billion copies of a particular portion of dna 
the ability to analyze a single hair is important said hicks 
because that is typically all that is available at crime scenes in 
addition multiple hairs from a crime scene may have come from 
different people said forensic hair expert skip palenik at mccrone 
associates in chicago 
at present a shed hair is examined microscopically for its 
physical appearance palenik said but because different people can 
have similarlooking hairs the new dna technique represents a 
very important first step toward firm identification of people 
from a shed hair he said 
in the study the researchers reported using a test to determine 
which of 21 versions of the dq alpha gene is present in an 
individual the gene plays a role in the diseasefighting immune 
system 
in tests of six people the researchers reported a single shed 
hair correctly indicated which version of the gene each person had 
more recent tests show success rates of 40 to 70 percent 
higuchi said in a telephone interview adding that researchers plan 
to try an improved testing procedure 
he said the next step is testing for more genetic 
characteristics to allow greater certainty in linking a hair to a 
particular person if the hair and a person share characteristics 
that fewer than one in 1000 people possess that would greatly 
help in making the link in court he said 
standard dna fingerprint techniques offer more definitive 
matches with the chance of two people sharing the same dna 
characteristics described as one in several billion 
hicks said that with further development the new technique 
could well approach the fingerprinttype identifying capability 
thats what wed be looking for down the road

university of kentucky students marched 
wednesday to protest a racial slur made the previous day by former 
gov ab happy chandler who helped the first black players 
get into major league baseball 
about 40 students marched across campus to meet with university 
president david roselle to call for an apology by chandler or his 
resignation from the schools board of trustees some marchers 
expressed anger with placards such as hopefully happy is sad 
while others demanded an explanation shouting we want to know 
chandler a twotime governor of kentucky and former us 
senator reacted by saying theyre trying to make a mountain out 
of a molehill he said he had no plans to apologize unless asked 
to do so by roselle or gov wallace wilkinson 
but in an interview with the lexington heraldleader he said 
if it is offensive im ready to say im just really sad and 
sorry in other words my head is bloody but unbowed 
during a committees discussion tuesday of the universitys 1985 
decision to sell off its investments in south africa chandler 
said you know zimbabwes all nigger now there arent any 
whites 
i dont think i should be censured for this he said in a 
telephone interview from his home in versailles ky i dont 
think i deserve any harsh treatment 
chandler 89 was commissioner of baseball from 194551 and 
takes credit for opening the door for jackie robinson to become the 
first black to play majorleague baseball when robinson signed with 
the brooklyn dodgers in 1947 
wilkinson who appointed chandler to a voting position on the 
university governing board earlier this year said wednesday that 
he believed chandler meant nothing derogatory but should apologize 
anyway 
it was a bad statement and it was a statement that should 
never be made wilkinson said and im going to recommend to 
him that he apologize and explain it 
in the telephone interview chandler said that while growing up 
in corydon in henderson county there were 400 whites and 400 
blacks we called them niggers and they didnt mind we loved each 
other we never had any trouble 
i integrated schools when other governors were sending troops 
in to keep blacks out i was sending troops in to keep them in 
he was governor in 193539 and again in 195559 
roselle told the students that the university completely and 
totally repudiates what it is governor chandler says but he said 
he didnt known yet whether there would be any action against 
chandler 
roselle said he hopes some good comes from the incident such as 
the need for a continuing aggressive program of action to put 
aside all semblances of racial prejudice at this university of 
kentucky

the bitter baby m custody fight ended with 
surrogate mother mary beth whiteheadgould winning unsupervised 
visitation rights she says will allow a meaningful and 
substantial relationship with her daughter 
superior court judge birger m sween on wednesday urged both 
sides in the dispute to protect 2yearold melissa stern known to 
the world as baby m by resolving their differences and keeping the 
child out of the public eye 
the court does not underestimate the great difficulty the 
parties will have in accepting others roles in melissas life 
sween said in the ruling granting gradually expanded unsupervised 
visitation to mrs whiteheadgould 
however family tragedies in our society are not uncommon and 
parents often are called upon to make sacrifices arising from 
unforseen circumstances sween said 
mrs whiteheadgould and melissas father william stern and 
his wife elizabeth wont appeal sweens ruling bringing an end 
to a highly publicized dispute that sparked worldwide debate on 
reproduction technologies 
sween also barred both sides from discussing publicly their 
relationships with melissa but allowed them to talk about their 
experiences in general this clears the way for publication of mrs 
whiteheadgoulds book it has no effect on films or books written 
without the involvement of the people in the case 
sween rejected the sterns contention during a threeday hearing 
last week that melissa would suffer psychologically by seeing mrs 
whiteheadgould and that the child had developed no emotional 
attachment to her mother 
mrs whiteheadgould who is 31 today will have one sixhour 
visit a week under the ruling sween said the schedule will be 
expanded during the next year to include overnight stays holidays 
and two weeks in the summer of 1989 
i am delighted and grateful to know that as melissa grows up 
we will have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each 
other mrs whiteheadgould said in a statement released by her 
lawyers 
i have struggled in order to preserve our relationship she 
said that relationship has been preserved in fact it will be 
strenghthened and advanced 
the sterns who have custody of melissa and are both 42 years 
old wanted sween to delay for at least six years visits between 
melissa and mrs whiteheadgould who had been seeing the child for 
two hours once a week under supervision 
they were disappointed with the ruling on visitation but 
pleased with the judges decision on publicity said frank donahue 
one of the tenafly couples attorneys 
they wanted to put an end to the litigation and the publicity 
and protect melissa donahue said 
the judge in a written decision filed in hackensack and made 
public here said both sides must come to terms with their new 
relationship 
the judge said mrs whiteheadgould must remember she is not the 
primary caretaker for the child she named sara but now calls 
melissa he said the sterns will make parental decisions in such 
areas as religion and education 
mary beth whiteheadgould must accept and understand that 
melissa is not sara and that her father and stepmother will be her 
parental role models and provide the daytoday parentchild 
interaction sween said 
william and elizabeth stern must accept and understand that 
melissa will develop a different and special relationship with her 
mother stepfather siblings and extended family and that these 
relationships need not dminish their parentchild relationship with 
melissa sween said 
the tugofwar began after mrs whiteheadgould then married to 
richard whitehead agreed to be artificially inseminated with 
sterns sperm 
she gave birth to melissa on march 31 1986 but decided to 
refuse the 10000 surrogate fee and keep the baby 
that led to a landmark new jersey supreme court ruling which 
outlawed surrogacyforpay restored mrs whiteheadgoulds 
parental rights upheld custody for the sterns and ordered the 
lower court hearing on visitation rights 
mrs whiteheadgould has since divorced whitehead and married 
dean gould the couple from east brunswick is expecting a child 
soon 
in a related development a florida senate committee wednesday 
approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear 
a child

an 18yearold man married a woman he had 
never seen outside of jail or the courtroom five minutes before he 
was sentenced to 27yearstolife in prison for murder 
joseph mastropietro and his 30yearold bride antoinette natale 
exchanged vows in a state supreme court judges chambers shortly 
after his sentencing judge refused to perform the ceremony said 
defense attorney gaspar castillo jr 
mastropietro of troy was convicted for his role in the 1987 
stabbing death of 81yearold irene farrell in the albany suburb of 
watervliet a companion lloyd cummings received an 
18yearstolife sentence 
mastropietro was introduced to natale an albany hairdresser 
during a jailhouse visit shortly after he was arrested in march 
1987 castillo said 
the pair corresponded frequently and natale visited mastropietro 
in jail the attorney said she faithfully attended her future 
husbands murder trial a few days before the sentencing 
mastropietro told his lawyer he wanted to get married 
i attempted to discourage them because they really didnt have 
an opportunity to formulate a relationship castillo said they 
insisted that they wanted to get married 
natale dressed in a plain white dress for her wedding said she 
didnt want people thinking shes foolish for marrying 
mastropietro i love him and i believe hes innocent she said 
before ducking away from reporters 
castillo said albany county court judge joseph harris refused to 
marry the couple but delayed sentencing to give the lawyer a 
chance to find a judge who would perform the ceremony supreme 
court judge edward conway agreed 
mastoprietro couldnt have been married after the sentencing 
because under state law prisoners serving life sentences cannot 
get a marriage license castillo said 
during the ceremony natale gave a ring to mastropietro who 
couldnt reciprocate 
the lawyer said he wasnt sure when the couple will have the 
chance to be alone together only some new york prisons allow 
conjugal visits but theres a long waiting list for the privilege 
he said 
i spoke to this woman at length and shes committed to this 
young man castillo said im not sure if its love or the kind 
of human concern that develops for another person that doesnt have 
anything to do with romantic love 
castillo said hes appealing mastroprietros conviction 
mastroprietro was given the maximum sentence 
harris rejected castillos bid for leniency in sentencing 
mastropietro saying what happened here transcended the normal 
bounds of society 
farrell was found stabbed in her home on march 8 1987 
mastroprietro and cummings had gone there with the intent of 
stealing her car the womans hands were tied and she was stabbed 
three times in her side doctors said she lingered for several 
hours before dying

a drug ring openly run by a smalltown 
fire chief police chief and their families was protected by a web 
of bribes that has implicated two county sheriffs and 
commissioners according to court documents 
the latest to agree to a plea bargain in the case involving the 
town of kermit was mingo county sheriff charles e eddie 
hilbert who is trying to avoid trial on 13 felony counts alleging 
that he bought his job for 100000 and then protected the ring 
court documents say 
assistant us attorney joseph f savage called hilberts 
alleged activities the most appalling abuse of public office 
since napoleon gave away the monarchies in europe to his 
relatives 
the joint federalstate probe began two years ago when 
investigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in kermit a 
town of 700 in mingo county that undercover officers were able to 
photograph a no drugs today sign posted outside a trailer 
so far the investigation of the ring which sold cocaine pcp 
and other drugs has netted more than 50 convictions or guilty 
pleas with no acquittals 
among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operating 
the ring are former kermit fire chief wilburn preece his wife 
virginia their soninlaw former police chief david ramey and 
their four sons and two of their daughters a third daughter was 
placed on probation 
hilbert will be sentenced in federal court on april 18 the same 
day as johnie owens a onetime mingo county democratic chairman 
and sheriff accused of selling his sheriffs job to hilbert owens 
faces up to 14 years in prison and 700000 in fines 
an court order filed tuesday provided no further information on 
hilberts proposed plea agreement hilbert would face a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment without parole if convicted of all 13 
counts 
in an interview this week owens denied knowing about the preece 
drug operation when he sold his job but said its going to be a 
better mingo because of the investigation 
if nothing else its made people realize that it was wrong 
even if they knew it was wrong they didnt know the extent it was 
wrong he said 
hilbert who is free on 100000 bail and continues to serve as 
sheriff could not be reached at his office wednesday night and 
his home number was unlisted 
owens said he accepted a 20000 downpayment on the 100000 
bribe from hilbert then persuaded the three county commissioners 
to accept his resignation and appoint hilbert in exchange for half 
of the bribe 
former commissioner rastie runyon jr has pleaded guilty to 
federal income tax evasion charges related to the bribe and awaits 
sentencing later this month commissioner steve adkins the only 
member of the 1982 panel still in office was indicted jan 15 on 
one count of bribery he has denied the charge but is not running 
for reelection 
the third commissioner state sen h truman chafin has not 
been charged in federal or state court he has adamantly denied any 
knowledge of the sale of the sheriffs office 
also caught by the investigation was county political boss larry 
hamrick who pleaded guilty to three felony charges of protecting 
the preece drug ring using public funds for political campaigns 
and intimidating a witness 
the indictment against hilbert accuses him of two counts of 
racketeering in connection with buying both his office and a spot 
on a powerful county political slate from owens he also faces two 
counts of aiding and abetting the preece family drug operation by 
seeing to it the law wasnt enforced in return for illegal 
campaign contributions

the court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that 
melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by 
continued and expanded visitation with her mother 
william and elizabeth stern offered no evidence to support their

the court does not underestimate the great difficulty the 
parties will have in accepting the others role in melissas life 
family dreams have been shattered insults and false accusations 
have been exchanged and lies and deceptions made in the heat of 
litigation however family tragedies in our society are not 
uncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrifices 
arising from unforeseen circumstances in the context of family 
problems frequently seen by family court judges the causes of the 
parties estrangement do not appear insurmountable 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the parties do not have the emotional scars of a failure of an 
intimate relationship intertwined with that of their child they 
have never been emotionally involved and should be able to make 
rational decisions in their mutual best interests and the best 
interest of melissa 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the parties have represented that they have no intention of 
selling any movie rights they may have concerning baby m as 
the sale of such rights may permit the parites melissa or their 
activies to be fictionally portrayed therefore the court will 
restrain and enjoin the parties from the sale of any such rights 
they may have without prior approval of the court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the court will not infringe on the parties right to communicate 
publicly on the issue of surrogate parenting and their personal

the arab hijackers of a kuwaiti airliner 
today released 32 more hostages in iran and told negotiators those 
remaining aboard will be in serious danger if their demands are not 
met 
the hijackers singled out three members of the kuwaiti royal 
family two of them women who they said will be among the first 
passengers to pay a dear price according to irans official 
islamic republic news agency or irna 
the hijackers armed with grenades and pistols are demanding 
the release of 17 proiranian shiite moslem extremists imprisoned 
in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies in that persian 
gulf state in 1983 
kuwait rejected the demand calling it blackmail but also 
sent a government delegation to mashhad airport in northeastern 
tehran to negotiate 
fiftyseven passengers and crew members have been freed by the 
arabicspeaking hijackers since they forced the kuwait airways 
boeing 747 to land at mashhad airport on tuesday 
that left roughly 50 hostages aboard the jumbo jet which was 
comandeered en route to kuwait from bangkok all the remaining 
hostages were believed to be arabs including at least 30 kuwaitis 
and all but two of them men 
the nationality of the hijackers was not known hostages who 
have been freed said there are five or six hijackers all wearing 
masks 
in a statement the hijackers today said they considered those 
remaining aboard political prisoners they will use to settle our 
account with the kuwaiti government said irna which is 
monitored in nicosia 
as soon as the 32 left the plane at 230 am today 7 pm edt 
wednesday the hijackers slammed the doors shut and switched off 
the lights in the cabin warning iranian security forces not to 
approach the aircraft the agency said 
irna said the 32 hostages released today included 12 britons 
six thais three pakistanis two austrians two syrians one 
japanese one irish one german one lebanese one sudanese one 
south korean and one from south yemen 
twentyfour female hostages were released on wednesday and a 
jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on tuesday 
in a statement issued shortly before todays release the 
hijackers said they they wanted the world to know the kuwait 
government severely tortures moslem prisoners irna reported 
the statement said the world must realize the real nature of 
the kuwaiti rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the 
moslem world at the top of them the issue of palestine and the 
brave palestinians who are fighting israel the hijackers 
stressed they would not back down from their demand even if the 
price is too high 
the members of the kuwait royal family aboard have been 
identified as fadel khaled alsabah a businessman and his two 
sisters ebtesam and anware 
tehran radio said anware on wednesday relayed a message to the 
mashhad control tower through a doctor asking the kuwaiti 
delegation at the airport to negotiate with the hijackers to ask 
kuwaits ruling alsabah family to accept the hijackers demands 
tehran radio said anware whose voice was shaking was 
overtaken by strong physical tension and panic 
the hijackers had contacted the control tower earlier wednesday 
asking for a doctor to be sent to the plane after receiving 
treatment from the doctor anware passed her message to the tower 
adding that she and her sister were feeling alright the radio 
added 
food was also brought earlier wednesday to those still aboard 
the jet 
release of the 17 jailed shiites has been a recurring demand of 
shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to iranian ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 western hostages 
in lebanon 
many acts of terrorism in kuwait have been blamed on shiite 
moslems acting for iran which has been at war with iraq since 
september 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding iraq

relief may be in sight for frustrated 
motorists trapped on californias gridlocked highways in sight 
that is on a 4inch dashboard video screen 
as part of a pilot traffic management program unveiled wednesday 
by the state department of transportation little black boxes will 
alert drivers to road congestion and traffic accidents on 
electronic road maps displayed on the dash 
the sophisticated devices which transportation officials used 
last year to help monitor traffic during pope john paul iis visit 
to los angeles will then help motorists snake their way around 
traffic problems by flashing alternate routes on the screen 
this system will help the user avoid problems rather than 
driving into and becoming part of the problem itself department 
director robert k best said at a news conference announcing the 
project 
the 16 million test of the system will begin this summer in 
los angeles during the study which is a joint project involving 
the department the federal highway administration and general 
motors drivers hired by the state will cruise the congested santa 
monica freeway in 25 cars equipped with the units 
onboard computers will relay the location and speed of the cars 
to the the state agencys traffic operations office in los angeles 
improving the accuracy and timeliness of traffic reports the 
department relays to media outlets 
to operate the device a driver inserts a cassette containing an 
electronic map of an area up to 10 miles from the car and selects a 
destination an arrow on the 4inchsquare screen then traces the 
vehicles progress along roads 
the state agency currently uses television monitoring and 
electronic road sensors placed every quartermile along 300 miles 
of los angeles most congested freeways to gather road information 
los angeles notorious for its rushhour traffic is the only 
area now wired to accommodate the twoway hightech navigational 
system which will utilize the sensor monitoring system 
a similar system for 215 miles of congested freeways in san 
francisco would cost 130 million officials said 
the units which are commercially available for about 2500 
apiece will cost between 300 and 500 when they are 
massproduced officials said but even if the pilot program goes 
well it may be 10 years before the technology is perfected and the 
system is available to most drivers 
in a test run after the news conference officials were 
embarrassed when one of four units failed to work properly 
this one needs to be recalibrated i guess said driver don 
juje of the state agency i guess we pushed too many buttons 
nevertheless officials heralded the beginning of the project as 
an important next step 
if we want to continue to make owning and operating a car a 
pleasure instead of a chore one challenge our industry must take 
up and quickly is improving the commuting experience said 
dr william g angew director of programs and planning for general 
motors 
gm is providing the cars and support personnel for the project 
the state is contributing 900000 and the federal agency is 
providing 750000 and technical assistance 
more than half of all congestion is caused by accidents and 
incidents that distract drivers attention officials said 
urban congestion cant be solved entirely by more asphalt and 
concrete said robert e farris an official with the federal 
agency

a government prosecutor late 
wednesday said an arrest warrant has been issued for deposed 
president eric arturo delvalle 
prosecutor alvaro visuetti said in an interview on channel 2 a 
military controlled television station that warrants had been 
issued for delvalle and gabriel lewis galindo a former ambassador 
to the united states 
he said that a warrant had been issued earlier for the arrest of 
juan b sosa delvalles ambassador to the united states 
the warrants reportedly accuse the three of crimes against the 
state usurping public power and crimes against the economic 
security of panama 
delvalle was fired by the national legislature at the end of 
february after he tried to fire gen manuel antonio noriega as head 
of the 15000member panamanian defense forces noriega the power 
behind the civilian government is under indictment in the united 
states on drug trafficking charges 
delvalle has been in hiding ever since his dismissal the united 
states still considers him panamas legitimate president and has 
frozen all panamanian bank funds in the united states 
since delvalles ousting the nation has been gripped by a 
severe political and economic crisis that shows no signs of abating 
in other developments wednesday police fired tear gas and 
birdshot to break up an opposition demonstration in panama city 
and the united states completed deployment of 1300 extra troops to 
panama to beef up security for american personnel and property in 
the former panama canal zone 
also wednesday panamas civilian chief executive manuel solis 
palma announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition 
groups without preconditions or irreconcilable demands 
the reagan administration said 800 marines would start arriving 
in panama on friday for what it described as three weeks of routine 
jungle training 
panamas opposition which has been seeking noriegas ouster for 
more than 10 months sponsored a march against hunger wednesday 
afternoon but police flooded the park where it was to take place 
in panama city 
nonetheless about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and 
began a march to the central business district they had gone 
nearly a mile when police stopped them with a barrage of tear gas 
and birdshot hundreds of people jeered at the police from 
sidewalks and balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that 
enveloped blocks of central avenue the main shopping thoroughfare 
many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and 
set fire to piles of refuse it took more than an hour for police 
to restore order no injuries were immediately reported 
a stateowned television station reported that two us soldiers 
in an army jeep were stopped and detained by panamanian troops near 
the protest maj ann crum of the us southern command said the 
soldiers were freed an hour later 
a spokesman for the us southern command who spoke on 
condition he was not identified said the two american soldiers 
apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident he said 
the army was investigating the case 
the march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic 
situation that has left thousands of panamanians penniless

bob and linda cornyn and 23 of their 28 
children pulled up in the family bus and then received the keys to 
a 15bedroom eightbathroom dream house remodeled for them with 
government help 
this is all very exciting said cornyn a 42yearold chief 
warrant officer stationed at nearby fort lewis who has been in the 
army for 24 years were all very ecstatic 
the cornyns adopted 25 of their children including some who are 
south korean colombian indian amerasian and black and some with 
disabilities 
some are wheelchairbound or move about on crutches they all 
help care for each other 
we have a rainbow family said cornyn we have just about 
every color there is we look at the rainbow as gods promise 
the family except for three children who were in school and two 
in a hospital were at wednesdays ceremonies 
perhaps in the future well need more bedrooms said mrs 
cornyn but this is a dream come true somebody believed in us 
enough to help us this is something we thought would never 
happen 
excited smiles shone on the faces of the children who range 
from age 8 months to 26 years as they explored the 
5620squarefoot house 
it has eight bathrooms a downstairs family room that takes up 
nearly the entire floor and two washing machines dryers and 
dishwashers a yard big enough for a softball game surrounds the 
rambling white house at the end of a treelined road in this rural 
town 30 miles south of seattle 
i have two children believe me youve got to be 
courageous said rep norm dicks dwash who presented the keys 
to the cornyns its touching and rewarding to see a family like 
this 
the house was remodeled at a cost of 60000 by the pierce 
county housing development association which was formed last april 
24 
called project 30 because the cornyn family numbers 30 the home 
purchase and remodeling job is the first project undertaken by the 
association which is leasing the house to the cornyns 
the cornyns were high school sweethearts in michigan who married 
as soon as linda graduated they adopted their first child when the 
family was stationed in south korea in 1979 
i guess we do it because it feels good and its the right 
thing to do coryn said it just makes us feel good to help 
someone else we enjoy seeing these children grow physically and 
mentally 
he noted that many of his adopted children would be in 
institutions if he and his wife hadnt adopted them 
cornyn said some of his adopted children received supplemental 
social security benefits and the family also receives food from 
local food banks and clothes from lots of people 
the cornyns are the largest family housed under the us 
department of housing and urban developments housing voucher 
program receiving 700 monthly toward rent and utilities 
the cornyns are moving from a sixbedroom home in puyallup to 
their new home which has been expanded during the past six months 
from eight bedrooms 
it seems like weve never had enough room said cornyn

the environmental protection agency says it 
intends to reaffirm an air pollution standard for benzene a known 
cause of cancer but critics say the proposal could subject exposed 
people to 10 times the risk the agency normally considers 
acceptable 
a memorandum from epa administrator lee m thomas made 
available wednesday said the agency would not propose further 
regulations for benzene equipment leaks which probably subject the 
most exposed individual to a one in 1000 risk of leukemia 
the memo called on agency officials to draft regulations 
essentially reaffirming the agencys decisions in 1984 not to 
regulate benzene exposure from the manufacture of ethylbenzene and 
styrene storage of benzene in tanks and the manufacture of maleic 
anyhydride but to impose regulations on coke oven emissions and 
equipment leaks in chemical plants and refineries the leaks 
regulations have been adopted the coke oven regulations are still 
only a proposal 
a leading environmentalist attorney david doniger of the 
natural resources defense council called the epa move an 
outrageous decision and a complete betrayal of the public health 
objectives of the clean air act saying the new standard will 
allow a level of risk 1000 times what should be permitted 
but an agency spokesman said that only an estimated two people 
are exposed to a risk of greater than one in 10000 under the epa 
standards

the justice department is retreating from a 
stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from having 
their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge 
earlier rules proposed last aug 28 would have required that all 
claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum 
officers of the immigration and naturalization service 
civil liberties groups say ins is unsympathetic to 
asylumseekers an accusation the agency denies 
under the latest proposed revision immigration judges who 
work for the justice department not ins would continue to 
conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylumseekers facing 
exclusion from the united states or deportation 
the change is an important improvement said arthur helton 
a attorney for the lawyers committee for human rights 
initial asylum applications will be heard by ins asylum 
officers but those officers will receive training from the justice 
department 
the revised rule published in the federal register will become 
final after a 30day public comment period

left for dead in a vacant house liles said 
miller said a bloodstained man knocked on the back door of the 
dabner home at about 430 am and told mrs dabner he needed to 
use the phone because he had been in a bad accident and his wife 
was seriously injured 
once inside the man took 20 from mrs dabner and beat her on 
the head with a piece of wood before fleeing liles said 
dabner later said he suspected the man may have been walking by 
his home when he saw dabner driving to the assignment 
it was a coincidence he said we didnt know the guy or 
anything 
a manhunt led to the arrest of riles about five hours later 
police said 
an affidavit filed in north lee county district court said that 
after his arrest riles waived his rights to remain silent and to 
have an attorney present and admitted to all the charges but 
attempted murder 
riles was released from a state prison last november and from a 
halfway house in cedar rapids recently to complete a sentence for 
an earlier conviction for theft and willful injury liles said 
liles said it was his understanding that riles had satisfied the 
15year sentence by serving six years with the remainder of the 
time accounted for by such provisions as time off for good behavior

the government issued an arrest 
warrant for deposed president eric arturo delvalle saying he will 
be charged with crimes against the state and the nations economic 
security 
in another development the government offered to hold 
churchmediated talks with the political opposition the offer came 
after police fired birdshot to break up an antigovernment rally by 
50 people on wednesday two us soldiers were briefly detained 
near the site of the protest 
delvalle has been in hiding since feb 26 when he was removed 
from office after trying to fire gen manuel antonio noriega as 
head of the 15000strong defense forces noriega is the power 
behind the civilian government 
the united states which still recognizes delvalle as president 
responded to his ouster by imposing economic sanctions on panama in 
a bid to drive out noriega who was indicted in the united states 
on drug trafficking charges 
the sanctions forced panamas banks to close and noriega has not 
been able to make the government payroll food and cash are in 
short supply 
the government announced wednesday night that it had issued 
arrest warrants for delvalle and for gabriel lewis galindo a 
businessman and former ambassador to the united states the 
government said a warrant was issued earlier for juan b sosa 
delvalles ambassador to washington who has remained there 
in another development wednesday the united states completed 
deployment of 1300 extra troops to beef up security for american 
personnel and property in the canal zone an additional 800 marines 
are to begin arriving friday for what the white house called three 
weeks of routine jungle training that had been planned before the 
campaign to oust noriega plunged panama into crisis 
panama has called the deployment a prelude to invasion 
the arrest warrants were announced wednesday night by government 
prosecutor alvaro visuetti on militarycontrolled channel 2 
television 
he said an investigation had uncovered sufficient evidence to 
charge delvalle with crimes against the state usurping public 
duties and crimes against the nations economic security 
earlier wednesday acting president manuel solis palma said the 
government had agreed to roman catholic churchmediated talks with 
the opposition which has been trying to oust noriega since june 
in a letter to archbishop marcos mcgrath solis palma said the 
meeting should be held without preconditions or irreconcilable 
demands he said the general had named him to head the government 
mediation effort 
the opposition has said that before entering such talks it 
wants assurances that noriega is willing to step down and leave the 
country it had no immediate response to solis palmas letter 
the 1300 newly arrived us troops joined about 10000 american 
military personnel based at the us southern command and 670 
others sent in earlier in the crisis they include members of an 
army aviation battalion from fort ord calif and military police 
from fort bragg nc and fort mead md also ferried in were 26 
helicopters including seven powerful ah1 cobra gunships 
in ordering the buildup last week the pentagon said the new 
troops were needed to provide security for us citizens and 
installations because of noriegas heavyhanded tactics 
a heavy police presence thwarted a planned march against 
hunger in panama city on wednesday but about 50 demonstrators 
nevertheless began walking to the central business district from a 
church 
they shouted antinoriega slogans and waved white handkerchiefs 
until police caught up with them and dispersed them shoppers and 
other pedestrians with birdshot and volleys of tear gas 
plainclothes police armed with m16 rifles made several arrests 
but no injuries were immediately reported 
from three tiers of balconies above apartment residents hurled 
garbage into the street to protest the police action 
this is what they shoot at the people like we were beasts 
yelled a middleaged woman as she held up two empty 12gauge 
shotgun shell casings she picked up on the street weve had it 
up to here 
panamanians are tired of this she said we want the 
gringos to attack not tomorrow today 
a stateowned television station said panamanian troops stopped 
and detained two us soldiers they stopped in an army jeep near 
the demonstration 
southern command spokeswoman maj ann crum said the soldiers 
were released an hour later 
the soldiers apparently got lost and drove into the area by 
accident said an officer at the southern command speaking on 
condition of anonymity

the democratic presidential quartet effectively becomes a trio 
today as sen paul simon puts his campaign on hold michael dukakis 
and albert gore meanwhile zeroed in on mideast issues seen as a 
likely sore spot for jesse jackson in the upcoming new york primary 
simon who has lost everywhere except in his home state of 
illinois scheduled a capitol hill news conference to talk about 
his campaign future aides said he was suspending the campaign but 
stopping short of dropping out 
the three remaining active democrats were all campaigning today 
in new york which holds its primary april 19 at stake are 255 
delegates in what will be the biggest state contest to date 
new york gov mario cuomo in an interview published today said 
he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary and he 
warned the democrats singling out gore that negative 
campaigning is terribly dangerous 
on the republican side there was plenty of parley vice 
president george bush the nominee in all but name met wednesday 
with former rival sen bob dole who pledged to work to get bush 
elected and dole talked with pat robertson who remains in the 
republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being 
nominated 
simons decision to suspend campaigning reflects the reality 
of having lost a great many primaries and caucuses said 
spokesman terry michael adding that by remaining in the race he 
would give his supporters a voice at the convention 
simons mother ruth said her son would remain an official 
candidate if not an active one hes going to hang in there till 
the end she said 
simon made his last stand in wisconsin where he finished a weak 
fourth in tuesdays primary the illinois senator ran second in the 
leadoff iowa caucuses on feb 8 in what was to be his best showing 
of the campaign outside of his home state 
after finishing third in new hampshire a week later he did not 
have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on 
super tuesday march 8 and was consequently clobbered 
many expected him to drop out after that but simon under 
pressure from illinois supporters stayed in for his homestate 
primary then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in 
the race 
for the other democrats the battle of new york began in earnest 
on wednesday dukakis was at work courting voters in new yorks 
large jewish community stressing the need for a mideast peace plan 
that would allow israel to live in peace and harmony 
gore reiterated his strong support for israel as he campaigned 
wednesday in new york city he said as president he would create a 
cabinetlevel position to focus fulltime on mideast negotiations 
gore also blasted dukakis and jackson for a lack of experience in 
international affairs 
cuomo decried such infighting saying his admonition was 
directed mainly at gore 
it does not work and its terribly dangerous and 
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the 
nominee he said in an interview with the washington post 
cuomo seen by some democrats as a potential draftee in the 
event of a deadlocked convention said he preferred to wait until 
after the primary season to make an endorsement 
thats the time for leadership in this process the governor 
said 
jackson was campaigning in new york today after spending a day 
in arizona which holds democratic caucuses on april 16 and 
indiana where primary day is may 3 in indianapolis jackson was 
asked how he expected to do among new yorks jewish voters 
youll never get all of any one group he said all you 
can do is reach out ive reached out and im glad to see people 
are responding 
many jews were offended by jacksons 1984 reference to new york 
as hymietown for which he apologized and his association 
with muslim leader louis farrakhan who called judaism a gutter 
religion jackson no longer has ties to farrakhan his campaign 
says 
jackson has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the jewish 
community 
after three straight wins in connecticut colorado and 
wisconsin dukakis was leading in the national delegate race the 
latest ap count put him at 74055 jackson at 70455 uncommitted 
at 5136 gore at 3948 and simon at 1705 
even if he is not actively campaigning simon could continue to 
gain delegates and keep those he has that would leave him in 
control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the 
democratic national convention 
whether he meant it to or not simons decision to technically 
remain a candidate helps dukakis remain the leader in the delegate 
race 
under party rules simon is entitled to 47 atlarge delegates 
from illinois jackson to 13 and dukakis none a simon withdrawal 
would automatically shift his 47 delegates to jacksons column and 
thus put him ahead in national delegate count 
meanwhile dukakis widened his margin of victory over jackson in 
mondays colorado caucuses returns on tuesday showed dukakis had 
narrowly won on wednesday with 85 percent of the precincts 
reporting dukakis had widened his lead to 11 percentage points 45 
to 34 percent

the aging baby boom generation may run out of 
doctors early in the next century as a widely predicted surplus of 
physicians turns into a shortage according to reports released 
today 
the authors of two reports both published in the new england 
journal of medicine contend that a feared doctor glut wont 
happen but at least one of the experts who has forecast an 
overabundance of physicians says he is not ready to change his mind 
several studies during the past decade have forecast that the 
united states will have too many doctors by the year 2000 and 
recommend that the nation train fewer of them but now with that 
date just 12 years away there are signs that opinion may be 
swinging the other way 
in one of todays reports drs william b schwartz of tufts 
medical school and frank a sloan of vanderbilt university predict 
that at best there will be just enough doctors by 2000 but a mild 
shortage is possible 
in the other less detailed paper dr ernest p schloss of the 
university of arizona looks into the early decades of the next 
century 
it is entirely possible that for the majority of people who 
are alive today there may be another shortage just when they will 
need doctors the most after 2011 the year in which the first of 
the baby boom generation will turn 65 and enter their retirement 
years he concludes 
in general the doctors argue that the earlier predictions 
overstated the supply of doctors and underestimated the demand for 
their services however schwartz said those predictions already 
have had an impact 
many college students are looking on medicine as an 
unpromising career in part because they are being told that there 
is going to be a huge physician surplus he said in an interview 
that is undoubtedly one of the factors that has led to a sharp 
reduction in the number of applications to medical school which 
have fallen 15 per cent since 1981 
schwartz report projects that 592000 physicians will be needed 
by the turn of the century and 585000 will be available 
dr robert g petersdorf president of the association of 
american medical colleges has been warning of a coming doctor glut 
for years he said schwartz study makes assumptions about 
physician supply and demand that may be wrong 
i agree with the authors that the presumed projected 
oversupply should not act as a deterrent to choosing medicine as a 
career petersdorf said at the same time i am not prepared to 
state that an oversupply does not exist the support for such an 
assertion is based on assumption and not on fact 
one of the most widely quoted of the earlier projections was a 
report in 1980 of the department of health and human services 
graduate medical education national advisory committee it 
predicted that in 2000 there will be 144700 too many physicians 
however schwartz said that and other predictions greatly 
overstated the supply of doctors the biggest mistake was assuming 
that all of the nations doctors will be treating patients 
instead schwartz said that about 93000 of them will be 
administrators teachers and researchers 
another miscalcuation he said was failing to take into 
consideration the impact of the growing proportion of female 
doctors who studies show work about 10 percent fewer hours than 
their male counterparts 
the researchers also did not foresee a movement to require 
resident physicians to work shorter hours in large teaching 
hospitals 
schwartz said the earlier predictions also made a mistake by 
assuming that the demand for physicians will remain constant 
instead he said the demand for care has been growing at an annual 
rate greater than 1 percent for several decades the availability 
of new kinds of care such as exotic imaging machines transplants 
and genetic analysis may speed up the demand for more doctors 
other factors that could increase demand he said include the 
increasing age of the population wider medical insurance coverage 
and the aids epidemic

discovery scheduled to make the 
first postchallenger space shuttle flight is beset by persistent 
technical problems which could delay its scheduled aug 4 liftoff 
in recent weeks there have been troubles with fuel and oxidizer 
pumps engine controllers and booster rocket insulation 
weve always said aug 4 is the target and like most targets 
its the bulls eye said thomas utsman deputy director of the 
kennedy space center but the technical troubles certainly are 
going to make that target a small bulls eye 
i still think from where we are today an august launch is 
achievable he said 
the problems have forced nasa to delay the rollout of the 
shuttle to the launch pad by a week from may 24 to june 1 also 
delayed a week until june 22 is a 20second firing of discoverys 
three main engines with the vehicle locked onto the pad 
hugh harris a nasa spokesman said there are several days of 
contingency time built into the launch preparation after june 22 
and although there are problems we havent given up on early 
august 
a decision on whether to postpone could be made april 14 when 
senior nasa managers meet at the johnson space center in houston 
however officials said a launch date assessment might not be made 
until after technicians finish assembling the two soild fuel 
booster rockets in late may 
the newest problem cropped up tuesday a faulty controller in 
one of discoverys inflight maneuvering engines replacement is 
expected to take two or three days 
workers also are removing and checking the highpressure 
oxidizer turbopumps from each of the three main engines a 
procedure that is taking several days 
earlier the hydrogen fuel turbopumps in all three main engines 
had to be replaced after a defective weld was found in a nonflight 
pump 
technicians also are repairing several small areas on a segment 
of a solid fuel booster rocket in these areas insulation 
separated or debonded from the steel rocket casing either before 
or during shipment here from the morton thiokol plant in utah 
failure of a joint on one of challengers two solid fuel 
boosters caused the shuttles explosion and loss of its seven crew 
members in january 1986 the shuttle fleet has been grounded since 
then 
the redesigned booster has undergone extensive redesign and 
successful testfirings in utah three more fullscale tests must 
be passed before the rocket is certified for flight these are 
scheduled april 20 june 3 and july 6

a protein that stimulates the body to produce 
blood cells may help doctors overcome a dangerous side effect of 
intensive chemotherapy when treating cancer patients researchers 
said 
the preliminary study is one of several under way to test the 
powers of a newly identified class of growth boosters called 
colonystimulating factors 
in the experiment doctors from duke university medical center 
gave a growth factor to cancer patients who had also received bone 
marrow transplants and chemotherapy to fight advanced skin and 
breast cancer 
cancer drugs damage the bone marrows ability to make white 
blood cells without enough of the diseasefighting cells patients 
may fall victim to lifethreatening infections 
the goal of the latest treatment was to restore patients blood 
counts with transplanted doses of their own bone marrow gathered 
before the chemotherapy started as well as injections of one kind 
of colonystimulating factor 
the researchers found that the cancer patients levels of white 
blood cells recovered dramatically and that the treatment may be 
useful in reducing the toxicity of highdose chemotherapy 
the study directed by dr stephen j brandt was conducted on 
19 patients and published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
in the research doctors used a naturally occurring protein 
produced through gene splicing that is called recombinant human 
granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor 
at new england deaconess hospital in boston dr jerome groopman 
has used the same growth factor to boost blood cell levels in aids 
patients he said he believes the proteins will have broad 
applications in treating cancer patients 
low white count leading to infection occurs in a number of 
different malignancies groopman said i think at the least it 
will make it more manageable and help support cancer patients 
he said the treatment may also allow doctors to use higher doses 
of cancerkilling drugs so that patients will have longer 
remissions 
the longerrange goal he said would be to improve the 
cure rate in certain cancers 
in an accompanying editorial dr arthur w nienhuis of the 
national heart lung and blood institute said the duke researchers 
have achieved an important objective by showing what dose of 
growth factor can be used safely 
he added that the availability of the factors seems destined 
to launch a new therapeutic era for those concerned with the 
treatment of patients with bone marrow failure

two young hooded seals that beached 
themselves earlier this year are now healthier and in need of a new 
permanent home but finding one isnt as easy as calling a zoo 
wookie and sweet pea may be adorable seal pups now but they 
eventually will become rather ferocious adults weighing more than 
700 pounds each said robert schoelkopf director of the marine 
mammal stranding center 
in addition a zoo or aquarium must have the proper refrigerated 
pool to keep the seals comfortable he said 
im afraid this is a passingthrough facility only he said 
of the nonprofit center he runs 
the two female seals beached themselves on long beach island in 
late january and early february schoelkopf said wookie was sickly 
and bald sweet pea was extremely ill and emaciated both had 
bronchial infections that took weeks to clear schoelkopf said 
the seals have regained their strength fat and rambunctious 
energy barking at each other and romping in the centers pool he 
said now they must find a colder home or else ill have to start 
buying a lot of ice cubes he said 
refrigeration is not so much the problem at this point but we 
start seeing stranded porpoises and sperm whales this time of 
year schoelkopf said theres no way i can put them in with 
the hooded seals these seals are not known for their 
friendliness 
he said that releasing the seals to the wild would also be a 
poor solution because they have become fairly docile 
sweet pea is estimated to be only a few months old and eats only 
when handfed wookie believed to be about a year old has bald 
spots and could not survive sunburn her rocky native coast of nova 
scotia or skirmishes with other animals schoelkopf said 
hooded seals named for the fleshy snouts of the adult males 
normally are never found south of nova scotia schoelkopf said 
that made them 1500 miles off course when the reached new jersey 
its like us planning to go to florida and winding up in south 
america instead he said 
he said the ideal situation would be to find a benefactor 
sympathic to the plight of the stranded seals and other stranded 
marine mammals who would donate enough money to build a nearby 
facility for them 
it would be a great tax writeoff and wed even name the place 
after them schoelkopf said only halfjokingly 
the marine specialist has contacted an animal placement agency 
in texas that spread the word about the seals in the past two 
weeks however no one has expressed an interest 
were not trying to find just anyplace we want the animals 
to go somewhere where they will be cared for properly schoelkopf 
said i want somewhere that has federal permits to handle these 
animals not a roadside attraction

no butts about it new york citys smokers are 
now officially prohibited from smoking in many of their old haunts 
no smoking signs went up across town wednesday as 
restaurants and other public places moved into compliance with the 
citys new antismoking law 
mayor edward i koch and dr stephen joseph city health 
commissioner hailed the new law on its first day 
were protecting the health of the people of the city of new 
york koch said as he posted a sign depicting the big apple and a 
crossedout cigarette at the tapis rouge bistro on duane street 
jean goutal the bistros owner and a former smoker said he 
likes the new law and may expand it to all of his 65seat 
restaurant currently he has set aside half his tables for 
nonsmokers as the new law requires 
the measure restricts smoking in workplaces restaurants 
hotels theaters large stores and taxicabs 
employers and businesses have begun to comply although joseph 
said enforcement wont begin for two months koch said that would 
give smokers 60 days to quit cold turkey 
there was no grace period at the new york post which has 
snuffed out smoking in all its offices 
its going to drive people mad said marie cundari a city 
desk assistant who planned to leave the premises every few hours to 
smoke 
you feel like youre in school then you snuck into the 
bathroom and if they smelled it you were in trouble she said 
its horrible 
tensions also ran high among some restaurant owners 
i have customers whove come here for 25 years and they are on 
a certain table now they say if i cannot have my table im not 
coming lamented andre soltner owner of lutece how can i 
please everybody its a nightmare 
alan nussbaum owner of club 1407 in the garment district said 
my complaint is that its the restaurateurs job to become the 
policeman 
gregory camillucci general manager of the russian tea room 
which phased in separate sections over the past three months said 
most of his customers are understanding i guess maybe its the 
flexibility of good old new yorkers 
smokers still light up wherever they please at the philip morris 
companies the law exempts tobacco businesses including an annex 
of the whitney museum in the philip morris building 
in that area common courtesy and accommodation and 
consideration will prevail said company spokesman steven h 
weiss 
philip morris is mailing city businesses more than 81000 
pamphlets detailing the new law as well as some 225000 booklets 
to smokers households were going to continue to let smokers 
know that you can still smoke in new york city weiss said 
the literature says smokers have the green light in private 
enclosed offices enclosed areas of restaurants hotels motels and 
convention halls being used exclusively for a private function 
bars restaurants with 50 or fewer seats and retail stores that 
accommodate fewer than 150 people if they post signs saying its 
permitted and in other specially designated areas 
smoking has been limited in all city buildings since june 25 
1986 when the mayor issued an executive order 
when enforcement of the new law begins businesses that fail to 
comply can be fined from 100 to 500 individuals can be fined 50 
per violation

boston university declaring that it owns all of 
martin luther king jrs papers has asked a court to order the 
widow of the slain civil rights leader to surrender the documents 
to the school 
the university made the demand wednesday in a counterclaim filed 
in response to coretta scott kings suit seeking the return of 
83000 documents her husband gave the school four years before his 
death 
bu trustee melvin b miller whose law firm is defending the 
university in the suit refused comment on the case and jim 
obrien one of mrs kings lawyers said he had not reviewed the 
universitys counterclaim 
the university argues that it not only owned the documents in 
its possession but also any other documents written by or 
collected by king who was assassinated 20 years ago this week 
the university asked for a court order requiring mrs king to 
surrender all her husbands papers contending that she violated 
kings pledge to bu and had wrongfully detained and converted the 
remainder of dr kings papers 
bu also seeks damages attorneys fees and an inventory of any 
kings papers that are in her possession or at the martin luther 
king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta 
in her suit filed in suffolk superior court mrs king requests 
that bu be ordered to give the king papers it has to the atlanta 
center which was established in 1968 and contains more than 
100000 documents belonging to king 
the bu collection contains speeches sermons letters and 
photographs from the 1950s and 1960s including the outline for his 
famous i have a dream speech delivered at a 1963 washington 
dc rally 
king assassinated in memphis on april 4 1968 wrote in a july 
1964 letter that the collection would become bu property following 
his death mrs king however claims her husband privately 
indicated he wanted his papers stored permanently in the south 
mrs king also accused bu of damaging her husbands papers by 
mishandling them in its response to her suit bu contended that 
any damage to the papers was caused by king mrs king or their 
associates 
central to the case is a onepage typewritten letter dated july 
16 1964 from king to the bu library 
king who received his doctorate in theology from bu in 1955 
wrote that the library would be the repository of my 
correspondence manuscripts and other papers 
in the event of my death all such materials deposited with 
the university shall become from that date the absolute property of 
boston university king said in the letter 
bu contends the letter made it legal owner of the documents when 
king died 
mrs king and her attorney contend the letter is not binding 
they also have noted that king never followed through on a pledge 
in the letter to make annual gifts to the university from the 
collection

president daniel ortega put pressure 
on contra negotiators participating in ceasefire talks in sapoa by 
threatening to launch a major military offensive against the rebels 
if the talks break down 
ortega also said contra leaders in managua for peace talks will 
not be allowed freedom of movement to talk with internal opposition 
leaders until rebel fighters have moved into designated ceasefire 
zones 
the president of the leftist government spoke wednesday as 
sandinista and contra military leaders reported making progress in 
technical ceasefire talks they planned to resume today in sapoa 
an outpost on the costa rican border 
key issues on bringing about a lasting peace have yet to be 
negotiated 
the sandinistas launched an offensive against the ussupported 
contras in northern nicaragua last month on president reagans 
orders 3200 us troops flew to honduras on march 1718 after 
honduran president jose azcona hoyo said 2000 nicaraguan soldiers 
had invaded his country in pursuit of contras 
the us troops never saw action and returned home at the end of 
march 
finishing their fourth technical meeting the military 
negotiators in sapoa agreed on seven zones in which contra fighters 
are to gather by april 15 two each in the north central and 
atlantic coast and one in the south 
still to be worked out are details for the combatants security 
the key issue of what needs to occur before the contras lay down 
their arms 
the two sides also agreed to postpone until april 15 a 
highlevel meeting in managua between contra and sandinista 
political leaders those talks had originally been scheduled for 
wednesday 
if the contras dont accept the agreements the people must be 
ready for combat and launch an offensive with all available 
force to be rid of the contras once and for all and not prolong 
the war ortega told farmworkers at an agricultural cooperative 
in the eastern province of granada on wednesday 
we have to fight so the peace agreements work but for the 
agreements to work we cannot let down the defense of the country 
he said in the remarks carried by staterun voice of nicaragua 
both the political and technical ceasefire discussions are part 
of a preliminary peace agreement the two sides signed on march 23 
in sapoa the accords put into effect a 60day truce last friday 
that aims to give negotiators time to arrange an end to their 
sixyear war 
in his speech ortega said contra leaders who come to managua 
for the highlevel talks will be restricted in their travel in the 
country until the rebels have moved into the ceasefire zones 
they can come to managua he said but to the meeting 
nothing more the contras have been pressing for permission to 
move about freely during their stay saying they want to meet with 
opposition groups 
they also have accused the sandinistas of violating a provision 
of the sapoa accords calling for unrestricted freedom of 
expression by not supplying newsprint to nicaraguas only 
opposition newspaper la prensa 
la prensa did not publish wednesday and its publisher violeta 
barrios de chamorro told a news conference that the newsprint 
restriction was a deliberate blow to freedom of expression in 
nicaragua 
the sandinistas who control the importation and distribution of 
soviet newsprint say a shipment has been delayed 
the sapoa accords do not directly deal with the issue of a 
contra surrender of arms of what will happen to rebel fighters 
after they move to the designated zones and the ceasefire expires 
the contras maintain they will not lay down their arms until 
they are assured of full democracy in nicaragua the government 
says the putting down of weapons is indispensable to the 
truces success 
the peace pact says the government pledges that individuals 
who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life will be able 
to take part in future elections but normal civilian life is 
open to interpretation in nicaragua where the government claims to 
have 300000 people under arms 
in complying with the accords the sandinistas on march 27 freed 
100 political prisoners the contras say only 10 of the prisoners 
they requested were released the pact does not give the rebels a 
say in who is freed 
both sides declared a truce march 21 at the start of the talks 
that led to the peace plan

hamdija pozderac who quit as vice 
president in september after being linked to the nations biggest 
postwar financial scandal died in sarajevo the tanjug news agency 
reported he was 64 
the official agency said pozderac died in a hospital wednesday 
as a result of a brain stroke which he suffered on march 29 
he resigned the vice presidency sept 12 1987 after his name 
was associated with the scandal surrounding agrokomerc a bosnian 
foodprocessing company that issued more than 1 billion worth of 
uncovered bills of exchange 
at the time pozderac said his resignation was of a principled 
nature if he had stayed in office he would have taken over 
yugoslavias rotating presidency this may 
pozderacs stance last september suggested he accepted no blame 
for the agrokomerc scandal 
several yugoslav media reports have suggested however that 
such fraud could not have taken place without the knowledge of 
pozderac and other bosnian communist leaders 
tanjug said the yugoslav communist party chief bosko krunic 
expressed condolences to the pozderac family and praised hamdija as 
a man who dedicated his life to socialism 
funeral plans were not immediately announced

the rust belt is back says fortune magazines 
latest annual list of the 500 biggest us industrial companies 
which boomed to record profits and sales led by a resurgent 
smokestack america 
a weaker dollar is helping manufacturers battle fierce foreign 
competition while economic fears raised by octobers stock market 
crash have faded 
across the rust belt you can hear the sound of champagne corks 
popping and beer cans spritzing open the fortune 500 had its best 
year ever in 1987 the magazine said in a cover story on the 
annual list 
after half a decade of sitting on the sidelines while the rest 
of the economy boogied the biggest us industrial corporations 
waltzed into the great american profit party with record sales and 
earnings fortune said 
fortune compiles the list of the 500 biggest industrial 
companies every year based on annual sales of the previous year 
the list is in fortunes april 25 issue available at newsstands 
monday 
fortune said total sales of the 500 climbed 9 percent last year 
to 188 trillion up from 172 trillion in 1986 and higher than 
the previous record of 181 trillion in 1985 
profits jumped from 64 billion to 91 billion a 41 percent 
increase that gave the 500 its biggest share ever of us 
industrial profits fortune said 
the magazine attributed the performance to freespending 
consumers unconcerned with the stock market collapse corporate 
restructuring that has reduced work forces and the weak dollar 
that has made us goods more competitive 
the most powerful catalysts in the smokestack revival the 
magazine said were basic industries such as forest products and 
chemicals which enjoyed the best advantage from the dollars 
protracted decline among paper makers median sales increased 179 
percent and median profits increased 60 percent 
profits at no 183 air products amp chemicals inc a maker of 
industrial gases rose more than 30fold to 1556 million making 
it the biggest profit gainer on the list 
chrysler corp returned to the top 10 for the first time in a 
decade helped by its acquisition of american motors corp 
the top six companies were unchanged from the previous year 
general motors corp exxon corp ford motor co international 
business machines corp mobil corp and general electric co 
texaco inc no 7 and american telephone amp telegraph co no 8 
swapped places from the year before 
ei du pont de nemours repeated in the no 9 spot and chevron 
corp was bumped out of no 10 by chryslers ascent from no 11 
this years list contained fewer members of industries such as 
building materials food industrial and farm equipment petroleum 
refining rubber products toys and sporting goods there were more 
companies producing chemicals computers furniture metals drugs 
and cosmetics 
newcomers to the list included sun microsystems a california 
computer maker founded six years ago by four 27yearolds which 
debuted at no 463 after a 156 percent increase in sales and 300 
percent jump in profits 
also thundering into the pack at no 398 was motorcycle 
manufacturer harleydavidson which modernized its factories and 
adopted japanesestyle production methods during the mid1980s

secretary of state george p shultz 
today asked king fahd to rally arab support for his middle east 
peace plan 
shultz who arrived today also was expected to discuss the 
saudis purchase of longrange chinese missiles 
there were few public signs that either jordan or israel was 
willing to accept shultzs initiative but shultz looked to the 
saudi king to try to generate support within the arab world for a 
twostep plan for negotiations with israel a us official said 
the saudis whose oil wealth is used to support syria jordan 
and the palestine liberation organization repeatedly have affirmed 
that they support a role for the plo in any peace talks 
the united states has refused to deal with the plo until it 
recognizes israels right to exist and renounces terrorism 
after his meeting with fahd shultz was to return to jordan to 
meet again with king hussein he met with hussein wednesday after 
apparently failing to win over israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the state department confirmed last week ambassador hume a 
horan has been withdrawn six months after he took up his post in 
riyadh the saudi capital no clear reason has been cited for his 
recall but it was widely believed that horan was not considered 
welcome in riyadh following his protests over the chinese missile 
deal 
saudi arabia stressed that it had not requested his transfer 
the saudis evidently bought the css2 missiles from china 
keeping the united states in the dark as a hedge against attack by 
fundamentalist iran which has called for the overthrow of the 
saudi royal family 
shultz has expressed concern because the missiles can be fitted 
with nuclear warheads the united states has accepted saudi 
assurances the missiles are not nucleartipped 
the american official said horans troubles with the saudis were 
personal and not political he did not explain the official 
briefed reporters aboard shultzs plane on condition of anonymity 
a new ambassador walter j cutler was expected to be named by 
president reagan shortly the official said 
israel also assured the reagan administration that it would not 
launch a preemptive strike against the missiles 
israeli leaders have warned that the missile has a range of 
1850 miles enough to reach their country with which saudi arabia 
and most of the arab world is technically in a state of war 
proisraeli us senators have moved to block us arms sales to 
saudi arabia us officials have said the saudis bought the 
missiles in frustration over repeated attempts by congress to block 
american arms sales 
the missile purchase has stirred a new us determination to 
carry out a oneyear agreement with western allies to keep 
intermediaterange rockets out of the hands of saudi arabia 
israel egypt jordan syria and other countries in the region 
while saudi arabia is not a direct party in the arabisraeli 
negotiations shultz seeks the official said the saudis would be 
invited if they wished to attend 
the possible participants are israel jordan palestinians 
syria and lebanon 
there were few public signs that jordan was willing to embrace 
shultzs initiative following his apparent failure to win over 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
chants of shultz shultz go home echoed through the jebel 
hussein refugee camp in amman early today as 200 palestinians 
staged an illegal march to protest the visit 
jordanian newspapers sharply criticized washingtons refusal of 
palestinian demands for an independent state or complete israeli 
withdrawal from lands captured in 1967 
he should understand that his peace mission is a flop the 
daily sawt ashshaab said in an editorial 
at the halfway point in his second middle east tour in a month 
shultz told israel television on wednesday he was still committed 
to making his plan work 
in all candor i am not able to say that it is happening he 
said while we have made some progress differences have not been 
substantially narrowed 
shultz ended his visit to israel on wednesday without overcoming 
shamirs opposition to his call for an international peace 
conference or to the concept of surrendering land captured in 1967 
in return for peace more than 135 arabs one israeli soldier and 
one israeli settler have been killed in four months of 
antioccupation rioting in the west bank and gaza strip 
shultz then flew to egypt for talks with president hosni 
mubarak who reasserted his support for the us proposal

the arizona supreme court is being asked 
to cancel the may 17 gubernatorial recall election now that the 
target republican evan mecham is no longer in office 
meanwhile a county court judge cleared the way wednesday for 
the new governor democrat rose mofford to appear on the ballot if 
the election is held 
both the suit and the favorable ruling were sought by supporters 
of gov rose mofford who took office in her own right after mecham 
was convicted by the senate impeachment court on monday 
a suit filed by phoenix residents elinor green and joel hunter 
asked the supreme court to order acting secretary of state karen 
osborne to cancel the recall vote 
the removal of the governor from office by impeachment and 
the swearing in of a new governor render the recall election 
unnecessary and improper said complaint said 
the lawsuit was filed after negotiations involving moffords 
chief of staff andrew hurwitz his law partner bill maledon and 
attorney general bob corbin 
the plaintiffs attorney andrew gordon said they were 
challenging the recall as taxpayers who believe the cost is 
unnecessary gordon would not say who was paying the cost of the 
lawsuit 
earlier this year corbin issued a nonbinding opinion saying 
that even if mecham were removed from office the election must go 
forward 
theres nothing in the constitution that says the recall 
election stops if the governor is removed corbin said recalls 
technically are aimed at the office not the officeholder he said 
mrs mofford has avoided talking about the possibility of being 
a candidate in the recall election because of arizonas resign to 
run law 
the supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments on tuesday 
gordon said he hopes for an early decision because absentee 
balloting is scheduled to begin april 14 two days later 
ed buck head of the mecham recall committee which filed almost 
400000 petition signatures seeking the recall vote said he 
supports mrs mofford but still believes the recall should be held 
because you will never put the issue to rest until the people 
have a chance to vote 
i think its shameful that someone would attempt to overthrow 
the constitution and cut out an election thats the kind of 
thing you do in russia you try to cancel elections you dont 
cancel elections in america said republican candidate jack 
londen 
mecham told a republican audience in mesa wednesday night he 
hoped to announce by friday whether he will attempt to run in the 
recall or try to appeal his impeachment conviction to a federal 
court 
corbin and others have said mecham is no longer entitled to be 
on the recall ballot 
in maricopa county superior court judge frederick martone 
rejected a challenge to the draft campaign that put mrs mofford on 
the ballot before she became governor in her own right mrs 
mofford the former secretary of state became acting governor when 
mecham was impeached by the house on feb 5 
plaintiff mike morgan a democratic party activist had 
contended that mrs mofford must file financial statements as other 
candidates are required to do 
martone ruled however that financial statements are not 
required in a recall election and that mrs mofford would not have 
to file one in any case because she was nominated without her 
formal consent

personal records of oliver north the former white house national 
security aide larouche contends plotted to ruin him because of his 
opposition to aid to the contras 
their subpoena was revealed wednesday at a hearing into whether 
prosecutors withheld from larouche lawyers evidence supporting 
defense claims that the fbi cia and other government agencies 
harassed and infiltrated larouche groups the subpoena was issued 
friday 
because of disputes over defense access to classified records 
discussing possible infiltration us district judge robert e 
keeton on wednesday delayed resumption of testimony in the case to 
april 19 at the earliest the jury has been in court only one of 
the past five weeks 
larouche six aides and five larouche political organizations 
are charged with conspiring to stymie a federal grand jury 
investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud by fundraisers 
for larouches 1984 presidential campaign four of the 
organizations are charged with fraud the trial began in december 
and is expected to last up to a year 
larouche who is seeking the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination contends evidence of fraud and obstruction was 
fabricated by fbi and cia agents in his organizations he says 
north was behind the plot because of larouches opposition to 
president reagans aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the north subpoena demands that he surrender any documents in 
his possession that mention the defendants government witnesses or 
three intelligence operatives who told the fbi they were asked by 
top fbi and cia officials to infiltrate larouche organizations 
to support the subpoena defense attorney william moffitt cited 
a memo in which retired air force maj gen richard secord told 
north of an apparent effort to collect information against 
larouche north and secord have been indicted for their roles in 
the irancontra scandal 
moffitt said norths lawyers have agreed to accept the subpoena 
but have indicated they will ask keeton to quash it 
washington attorney brendan sullivan who represented north 
during the congressional irancontra hearings did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment wednesday he was not available to 
come to the telephone his secretary said 
since the disclosure of the secordnorth memo a month ago the 
defense has pressed for access to a wide range of government files

keeton ruled last week that seven classified fbi files contained 
information that should be given to defense lawyers he said 
wednesday that an additional five classified fbi files contained 
material relevant to the defense involving an fbi informant who 
also has worked for larouche 
the fbi has refused to declassify the files on grounds they 
would expose highlevel intelligence sources and possibly endanger 
national security

the classified files under a protective order that would prohibit 
them from discussing their contents keeton is to consider the 
issue monday

iran and iraq bombed each others 
capitals and other towns today in one of the fiercest exchanges in 
their war of the cities scores of people were reported killed 
and wounded 
the deadly duel erupted at dawn after iran said squadrons of its 
warplanes bombed baghdad twice in the first air raids on the iraqi 
capital in more than two years 
the official iraqi news agency said only one iranian jet got 
through to baghdad and was shot down by an iraqi interceptor inside 
iran after being driven away from the capital by heavy 
antiaircraft fire 
but iraq then loosed six longrange missiles against tehran and 
the cities of karaj the holy city of qom isfahan and tabriz the 
agency reported iran also reported bombing the northern iraqi city 
of erbril and the southern ports of basra and umm qasr 
the sudden escalation overshadowed talks to resume in new york 
between united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
and irans deputy foreign minister mohammed larijani on efforts 
to arrange a ceasefire in the 7yearold persian gulf war 
iran is determined more than ever to punish this criminal 
regime in iraq for its aggression larijani said after a meeting 
wednesday indicating little change in tehrans refusal to accept 
the un security councils july 20 ceasefire resolution 
todays sharp upsurge in hostilities came on the eve of 
parliamentary elections in iran officials fear the iraqis will 
launch a missile blitz when voters go to the polls friday 
both sides reported scores of civilians killed or wounded in 
todays missile attacks on tehran and baghdad and other cities as 
well as air raids and artillery bombardments 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said iranian jets penetrated sophisticated radar and 
antiaircraft defenses ringing the iraqi capital to heavily 
bomb selected targets 
it said the first raid at 605 am scored accurate hits 
another formation of fighterbombers streaked above the city of 
5 million people 10 minutes later irna reported 
irna said all the jets returned safely to their bases but did 
not say how many were involved in the attacks or give any details 
of their targets 
although iraq said only that one iranian jet got through to 
baghdad and was shot down the ferocity and scale of the iraqi 
bombardment indicated that the iranian claim was probably true 
it was one of the most widespread missile barrages the iraqis 
have unleashed since the latest bout of the war of the cities 
exploded feb 29 
iran said iraqi warplanes also bombed tabriz and other cities in 
western iran in retaliation the iranians said they fired two 
missiles into baghdad and battered ports of basra and umm qasr an 
iraqi naval base with 13 shortrange missiles 
basra and other iraqi border cities were hammered with artillery 
fire irna reported 
irna said that other formations of iranian warplanes attacked 
iraqi troop concentrations in alamara north of basra and other 
areas in the southern front inflicting heavy losses 
the iranians have had some 250000 men massed east of basra for 
weeks but despite repeated air raids on iraqi defenses they have 
made no move to launch a longawaited offensive against the city 
ina said two iranian warplanes also bombed the northeastern city 
of erbil killing several civilians 
irna said iranian fighterbombers also attacked a headquarters 
of the national liberation army an iraqibased dissident movement 
seeking to topple the tehran regime in the northern diyala region 
destroying all their targets 
irans air force has been badly depleted by combat losses and a 
chronic shortage of spare parts 
outnumbered by around 8to1 by iraqs powerful air force it 
has not raided baghdad since early 1986 but in recent months it 
has become increasingly aggressive 
irna said the iranian air raids completely caught the enemy by 
surprise 
it said the warplanes destroyed iraqi military basses in 
baghdad killing or wounding dozens of soldiers 
irna quoted irans air force commander brig gen mansour 
sattari as saying the bombing raids were unique and very 
valuable militarily he did not elaborate 
half of tehrans 6 million people have fled the capital since 
feb 29 both sides have fired nearly 300 missiles into each 
others cities killing hundreds on both sides

the 65 mph speed limit appears to be 
partially to blame for a nearly 50 percent increase in traffic 
deaths on rural interstates in new mexico the first state to raise 
its limit a year ago an official says 
ninetyfive accidents resulting in 110 deaths were reported on 
rural stretches of interstate highways in new mexico between april 
2 1987 the day the law went into effect and march 31 
howard graff chief planner of the new mexico traffic safety 
bureau said 64 crashes resulting in 74 deaths were reported for 
the corresponding period the previous year 
my opinion is that it looks like the new limit has had an 
effect graff said wednesday rural interstates are supposed to 
be the safest of roads with wider shoulders medians and all 
that 
the national highway traffic safety administration released 
figures last summer indicating traffic fatalities increased 
nationwide about 50 percent within three months of the new speed 
limit taking effect states were allowed to boost speed limits to 
65 only on interstate highways outside urban areas 
graff said traffic deaths in new mexico more than doubled in the 
first three months after the increase but stabilized during the 
winter 
al lauersdorf a highway safety specialist for the national 
safety council in chicago said it is too early to detect a trend 
nationally 
my own personal observation is that there are some places 
where you can do 65 and no one passes you with the exception of the 
occasional leadfoot and there are others where if you go 65 
everyones going by you he said it just doesnt seem to be 
consistent in any way

new york gov mario cuomo in an interview 
published today was sharply critical of democratic presidential 
contender albert gore jr for his attacks on rivals michael dukakis 
and jesse jackson 
it does not work and its terribly dangerous cuomo said of 
the negative campaigning 
the new york governor told the washington post in a telephone 
interview that he is unlikely to make an endorsement before his 
states primary on april 19 
the closer you get to primary day the less reason there is 
to announce support for one of the candidates cuomo said adding 
that he would prefer to remain neutral until after the final 
primaries 
thats the time for leadership in this process he said 
new york already important by virtue of the 255 delegates at 
stake in its primary takes on an added significance because of the 
seesaw race being run by jackson and dukakis 
the two have remained close in the national delegate count 
jackson finished a strong second in the illinois primary and had a 
major win in the michigan caucuses dukakis came back with 
victories in the connecticut primary the colorado caucuses and the 
wisconsin primary 
cuomo said he expects the contest between dukakis and jackson 
will be very close here 
noting that jackson had garnered 26 percent of the new york vote 
in 1984 cuomo told the post youve got to give him 10 points 
more than that this year id say 35 to 40 percent is his base 
the governor said his call to hold down negative campaigning was 
intended for all democrats and specifically for al gore 
gore has said both jackson and dukakis lack experience in 
international issues and has been particularly critical of jackson 
it does not work and its terribly dangerous and 
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the 
nominee cuomo told the post you should not spend a lot of 
time criticizing your opponents especially if you have not 
established your own identity in this state 
another politician who has been vocal in his criticism of 
jackson has been new york mayor edward koch cuomo said there was 
little he could do to get koch to heed his call to tone it down 
the mayor has already ignored it and will continue to i have 
no hopes of conversion short of his being struck in the tush by a 
bolt of lightning and i have no command over the lightning 
he said 
cuomo said he expected about 10 percent of the jewish vote to go 
to jackson despite the furor in 1984 over jacksons reference to 
new york as hymietown 
most of them jewish leaders gore addressed last week agreed 
with him that jackson should be defeated but then the question 
comes are you mr gore the way to do it the sophisticated ones 
who read the polls may decide the best way to do it is with 
dukakis 
cuomo said he expected black voters in new york as they have 
elsewhere to go overwhelmingly for jackson

prosecutors and defense attorneys say the 
trial of a polygamist leader and three others charged in the 
bombing of a mormon chapel and a 13day standoff with police will 
proceed much more quickly because of the dismissal of a conspiracy 
count 
it relieves the government of proving a real complex count and 
makes the issues in the case much clearer fred metos attorney 
for defendant john timothy singer said wednesday 
a pool of 170 potential jurors reported wednesday to the 
courtroom of us district judge bruce s jenkins where they 
received a 20page questionnaire and heard the charges 
the federal charges now include bombing destruction of the 
kamas stake center with an explosive use of a bomb attempting to 
kill federal agents assault on federal officers possession of a 
bomb possession of a sawedoff shotgun and two counts of use of a 
firearm 
vickie singer is charged with all eight counts polygamist 
leader addam swapp faces all but the shotgunpossession charge 
jonathan swapp who had not been charged with conspiracy and john 
timothy singer face the firearms assault and attempted murder 
counts jonathan swapp is addam swapps brother and john timothy 
singer is vickie singers son 
associate utah attorney general paul warner said wednesday that 
state prosecutors would wait until after the federal trial to file 
homicide charges in the death of corrections lt fred house killed 
during the shootout that ended the siege at the defendants farm 
swapp 27 appeared in court wednesday in a buckskin coat 
emblazoned with a mormon pioneer flag his motherinlaw mrs 
singer 44 was dressed all in white including a white bow in her 
hiplength hair 
it is turning into a nightmare metos said 
ive done nothing but criminal law for 10 years and i never 
saw defendants do anything like that to draw attention to 
themselves he added 
although jenkins granted the prosecution motion to strike the 
conspiracy count he denied requests from all four defendants to 
separate their trials us attorney brent ward said 
the judge did not rule on a motion by swapp that his trial 
should be moved out of utah because of the predominance of the 
mormon church which abandoned polygamy in 1890 jenkins has said 
he would rule on the issue during jury selection 
swapp has said he was chosen by god to gather the american 
indians for the second coming of christ

the illinois supreme court today 
refused to review an appeals court ruling that a 57 million bank 
account controlled by the late black muslim leader elijah muhammad 
belongs to his religious movement not to his 22 children 
in a brief order issued without comment the states highest 
court let stand a 1st district appellate court ruling that a 
chicago bank acted properly in transferring the money to what was 
then the nation of islam the movement founded by muhammad 
muhammad died in february 1975 without executing a will leaving 
open to question the control of bank accounts that had held 192 
million in contributions from his followers 
the rest of the money apparently was spent by muslim groups or 
muhammads relatives after his death 
in 1986 a cook county circuit judge ruled that muhammads seven 
legitimate and 15 illegitimate children should inherit the 
remaining money the judge held that the funds were personal gifts 
to the leader of the muslim movement 
the appellate court disagreed saying that muslim literature 
indicated the donations were to be used for the care of the poor 
and needy members 
the nation of islam founded by muhammad in the 1930s 
fragmented after his death one group led by one of muhammads 
sons became known as the american muslim mission while a group 
led by louis farrakham took over the name nation of islam

iranian workmen began refueling a kuwaiti 
jetliner today after hijackers holding 50 hostages fired five shots 
at police and threatened to take off with nearempty tanks the 
iranian news agency said 
the gunmen earlier threatened to blow up the kuwait airways 
boeing 747 and demanded that the runway at mashhad airport in 
northeastern iran be cleared the islamic republic news agency 
reported irna said that the taxiway had been closed to prevent 
the plane from flying 
disciplinary and relief forces are on full alert while the 
situation is presently out of control and anything may happen at 
any moment said irna monitored in nicosia it said an iranian 
delegation in contact with the hijackers was advising them to 
keep cool 
the shooting erupted after the hijackers demanded that the plane 
be refueled and allowed to take off for an undisclosed destination 
irna said iran had refused 
the agency did not mention any casualties in the gunfire 
earlier irna reported that iranian officials have announced 
they would supply the hijackers with food and fuel provided that 
the passengers and crew members be released 
but the refueling went ahead without any release being reported 
the hijackers have demanded that kuwait free 17 convicted 
proiranian extremists 
a member of the kuwait royal family held on the plane appealed 
to iranian authorities to provide the plane with fuel to take off 
were very tired and our brothers the hijackers are very 
serious in their threat to blow up the plane fadel khaled 
alsabah told the control tower by radio irna said 
the iranian agency said officials at mashhad airport in 
northeast iran urged the hijackers to give up their threats 
the hijackers forced the kuwait airways airliner to land tuesday 
after seizing it on a flight from bangkok to kuwait 
the hijackers armed with grenades and guns are holding about 
50 hostages including three members of kuwaits royal family 
fiftyseven people have been freed since the plane landed 
including 32 released early today 
austrian passenger josef degeorgi released today said the 
seven gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but later 
treated the hostages well british passenger jean sifton who was 
freed wednesday said two of the hijackers had offered her pillows 
and drinks and chatted with her daughters 
irna quoted irans deputy prime minister ali reza moayerri as 
saying failure to negotiate an end to the hijack drama could god 
forbid lead to unpredictable events 
it quoted him as saying the kuwaiti negotiators sent to mashhad 
airport in northeastern iran appeared to attach no importance to 
the lives of their own citizens aboard the plane 
moayerri in charge of negotiating with the hijackers was 
quoted as saying while were trying to put an immediate end to 
the hijacking the kuwait delegation seems to have no authority to 
make any decision here 
the hijackers warned in an ultimatum radioed to the mashhad 
tower that they would blow up the jet if there was any threat 
against the plane by iranian security forces irna said irna did 
not say if the hijackers indicated where they planned to fly to 
the warning came after senior kuwaiti officials at the airport 
said they would negotiate only after the remaining hostages still 
being held were released the remaining hostages were believed to 
all be arabs including at least 30 kuwaitis 
irna said the hijackers declared in statement 
we give the kuwaitis until noon 430 am edt and if they do 
not give a positive reply to our demand we will leave mashhad 
airport 
we warn that we will not tolerate any threat against the plane 
and declare we are ready to blow it up 
earlier today the hijackers singled out the three members of 
the kuwaiti royal family two of them women who they said will be 
among the first passengers to pay a dear price if kuwait does 
not meet their demand 
the hijackers are demanding the release of 17 proiranian 
extremists imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies in that persian gulf state in 1983 
kuwait rejected the demand calling it blackmail 
the nationality of the hijackers was not known hostages who 
have been freed said there are five or six hijackers all wearing 
masks 
twentyfour female hostages were released on wednesday and a 
jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on tuesday 
the members of the kuwait royal family aboard are alsabah a 
businessman and his sisters ebtesam and anware 
release of the 17 jailed extremists has been a recurring demand 
of shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to iranian ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 western hostages 
in lebanon 
many acts of terrorism in kuwait have been blamed on shiite 
moslems acting for iran which has been at war with iraq since 
september 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding iraq

vice president george bush his bitter fight 
for the republican presidential nomination against senate minority 
leader bob dole behind him says he wants dole to help him win the 
general election in the fall 
the two men met privately wednesday in the capitol for the first 
time since their angry faceoff on the senate floor last february 
bush told reporters afterward that they had a good friendly 
discussion 
at an earlier session in the same building dole had lunch with 
pat robertson who is continuing a halfhearted campaign to be gop 
presidential nominee they discussed ways to keep the former 
television evangelists supporters active in republican politics 
theres no question that we plan to support the republican 
nominee and it looks as though its going to be george bush 
robertson said 
robertson said he wanted to be a rallying point for 
conservatives at the gop convention in new orleans so he could 
encourage his supporters to remain involved in republican politics 
i want to make sure that its the type of platform that will 
make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work he 
said 
robertson told the new york times he would not campaign in new 
york before the april 19 primary his secret service protection was 
withdrawn at his request wednesday 
in an interview published in todays editions of the paper he 
said it would be more quixotic than it is realistic to continue 
actively campaigning 
a robertson spokeswoman barbara gattulo said today he would 
make two or three speeches a week supporting conservative 
causes and candidates and go to the republican national convention 
whether we add delegates before then or not 
he has made a committment to supporters and a number of 
candidates in races around the counry at the local level said 
gattulo no matter how many delegates he takes to the 
convention he will have a voice there he is also laying the 
foundation for years to come as a conservative voice and for a 
future campaign 
he has already talked about running in 1992 she said 
robertson had already laid off most of his campaign staff and 
has made only a few campaign appearances recently because he is 
bumping up against federal campaign spending limits 
after his talk with dole bush told reporters that he wanted the 
kansan to work on his behalf as much as he possibly has time to 
give a lot of its here and a lot of it i hope will be around the 
country 
were ready to go to work dole said 
asked whether the two men had buried the hatchet dole said i 
dont have a hatchet im a nice fellow 
bush said their conversation focused on how to beat 
democrats 
dole spokesman walt riker said later that the men talked about 
keeping the republican nomination interesting until the 
convention in august and ways to get the issues out there 
during a senate vote last feb 4 dole walked up to bush and 
accused him of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to 
groveling in the mud 
the faceoff was sparked by a written statement made by a bush 
campaign aide implying that dole accepted favors from the wealthy 
it also said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind 
trust once held by his wife elizabeth h dole 
dole dropped out of the race and endorsed bush last month

fratricide establish peace throughout the countrys territory and 
form a coalition government with the participation of all forces 
representing afghan society including those who are currently 
opposed to one another 
the final status of their country among other states will be 
determined by the afghans themselves and nobody but them the 
soviet union reaffirms its support for president najibs statement 
on afghanistan as an independent nonaligned and neutral state 
it proceeds from the premise that the territory of that country 
or any of its part will never be used for purposes hostile to its 
neighbors with regard to which afghanistan will continue a policy 
of goodneighborly relations and cooperation 
this equally applies to the soviet union the peoples republic 
of china the republic of india the islamic republic of pakistan 
and the islamic republic of iran the soviet side backs the afghan 
presidents statement to the effect that afghanistans internal 
structure will rest on a multiparty system in the political field 
and on a multisectoral basis in the economic sphere 
it is of key importance for implementing the policy of national 
reconciliation to create satisfactory conditions for the return of 
afghan refugees and grant them rights on an equal basis with 
all citizens of the country the soviet union will extend 
assistance to afghanistan in creating such conditions 
the soviet union relying on relations of traditional and 
historical friendship expresses the readiness to cooperate with 
afghanistan at a high level to restore the economy and 
facilitate the economic and social development of afghanistan 
the general secretary and the president call on other states to 
contribute to establishing peace and national reconciliation in 
afghanistan and respect the geneva accords this would set a good 
and encouraging example for resolving other regional conflicts

a man who believes some police officers have 
a fascist background was dismissed today as a juror in the 
cocaine trial of john zaccaro jr 
zaccaro son of former democratic vicepresidential nominee 
geraldine ferraro is charged with selling a small amount of 
cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago 
on wednesday district court judge francis mccaffrey had refused 
to dismiss christopher mayka from the jury despite objections from 
the prosecutor about maykas comments on police 
under questioning mayka had said i have often felt that some 
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background 
they like to have power 
addison county states attorney john quinn renewed the argument 
today telling the judge that mayka has preconceived notions 
about police officers mccaffrey then agreed to dismiss mayka 
the feelings about police are important in the case because the 
defense wants to show that zaccaro then a student at middlebury 
college was entrapped by an undercover police officer acting only 
on rumor 
lawyers had hoped to start opening arguments today but the 
dismissal of mayka and slow questioning of replacements may delay 
those arguments until friday jury selection began monday 
only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the 
prominence of ferraro could affect his view of the case 
but most said they were aware of the case prompting the two 
sides to repeatedly ask whether the jurors deliberations would be 
affected by what they know 
although both the state and the defense have said they were 
fearful of the effect of the pretrial publicity many of the 
potential jurors said they discounted what they had read because 
of a distrust of the press 
they have a tendency to present people as guilty just because 
they have been charged said donald cioffi on wednesday 
ferraro and her husband john zaccaro sr have attended the 
questioning which is taking place in the cramped chambers of the 
presiding judge to put the potential jurors at ease 
the process has shed some light on the strategies lawyers may 
take in the trial 
addison county states attorney john quinn has asked potential 
jurors if they have any objections to police acting on rumors and 
to the use of undercover police officers 
police said they began their investigation of zaccaro after 
hearing he was dealing drugs 
defense lawyer charles tetzlaff has asked jurors if they would 
be willing to acquit someone based on a technical defect in the 
states case 
the defense is expected to try to prove that zaccaro was 
entrapped by the police and that the police singled him out 
because of his famous mother

a jump in the dow jones industrial average 
tested the new york stock exchange voluntary limit on computerized 
program trading for the first time but wall street experts differ 
on whether the restriction matters 
traders said a cheer erupted on the big boards vast floor when 
the widelyfollowed average careened past 50 points at about 320 
pm wednesday automatically placing the collar on socalled 
index arbitrage trading for the rest of the day the dow average 
closed at 206167 up 6416 points 
the momentum of that rally helped inspire strong buying in tokyo 
today that pushed prices past their precrash levels on the tokyo 
stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
which gained 19582 points wednesday gained another 25805 today 
reaching 2676922 
in london the london financial times 100share index was up 
about 22 points to the 1767 level by late afternoon 
but as of late morning in new york however the momentum 
stalled and the dow jones average was off about two points to the 
2059 level 
although the average had flirted with a 50point daily up or 
down limit at least four times since the restriction was announced 
feb 4 wednesday marked the first time the threshold was breached 
the collar is part of an effort to suppress wild price swings in 
the aftermath of the oct 19 market crash and restore investor 
confidence some traders said that without the limit the dow 
average might have risen as much as 100 points wednesday but 
others said it was impossible to know 
there was a lot of program trading when the dow was up between 
35 and 49 points said philip c puccio manager of institutional 
trading at dillon read amp co it went from 40 to 49 within five 
minutes 
several other influences boosted stocks notably a stronger 
dollar and lessening fears of higher interest rates but many 
brokers said program trading played at least a partial role in the 
dows sudden surge 
program trading refers to a sophisticated form of arbitrage the 
simultaneous purchase and sale of similar goods in different 
markets in order to profit from price disparities 
using computers that instantly place massive orders program 
traders buy stocks in new york and sell corresponding stockindex 
futures in chicago or vice versa 
many brokers have blamed the technique for injecting enormous 
volatility as well as crushing trading volume into the stock 
market without regard for underlying stock values some studies 
have suggested program trading was an important element in the 
october crash 
nyse spokesman richard torrenzano said wednesday after the 
50point collar was triggered that its not the solution but its 
clearly a first step in controlling what we call intraday 
volatility 
asked how far the dow average would have moved without the 
limit torrenzano said if you talked to 10 people youd get 10 
different answers i have no idea 
robert gordon president of twentyfirst securities corp which 
utilizies program trading said he believed the technique wasnt an 
element in the dows rise wednesday largely because the price 
disparities between stocks and stockindex futures werent 
profitable enough for widespread arbitrage 
its sort of a nonevent he said program trading wasnt 
fueling the up move i dont think there was any particular rhyme 
or reason to it 
others said the reaching of the limit caused the dow to retreat 
several points before it began moving up again but at a slower 
pace that reflected the absence of program tradings influence 
without the restriction i think you would have seen it up 100 
points today puccio said i think the limit is good because it 
gives people a little pause to reflect rather than buying with 
abandon

police found the body of kidnapped 
dutch retail tycoon gerritjan heijn buried in a forest seven 
months after his abduction a spokesman for the prosecutors office 
said today 
heijn was kidnapped last sept 9 and shot through the head the 
same day his body was exhumed in a forest near the town of renkum 
in the eastern netherlands on the instructions of his suspected 
killer who was arrested wednesday according to spokesman theo bot 
the discovery ended the longestrunning kidnap case in dutch 
criminal history the tycoons family had paid the kidnappers a 4 
million ransom in a bid to win his release 
heijn who was 56 when he died was vice president of ahold 
which owns the netherlands largest chain of supermarkets as well 
as the giant food and bilo stores in the united states 
on wednesday authorities arrested a 45yearold unemployed 
architect his wife his three children aged 17 to 25 and a house 
guest at the suspects home in the village of landsmeer 10 miles 
north of amsterdam the guest was released later 
according to bot the architect was found in possession of the 
murder weapon as well as a ransom worth more than 45 million paid 
for heijn in a nov 27 drop 
heijn was abducted on sept 9 while on his way to a dental 
appointment from his sprawling villa in bloemendaal an affluent 
suburb of this western dutch city 
after the estimated 4 million in diamonds and cash was paid in 
november nothing was heard from the kidnapped businessman or his 
abductors 
the kidnapping case was marked by lengthy and fruitless 
negotiations between the heijn family and the abductors via 
advertisements published in various national newspapers police 
imposed a news blackout only a few days after heijn was kidnapped 
at the request of the family 
on oct 14 after heijns relatives had demanded a sign of life 
from the kidnap victim the abductors mailed what appeared to be 
his little finger at the time it could not be established whether 
heijn had been alive or dead when the finger was cut from his hand 
stymied by the silence maintained by the abductors after the 
ransom drop police staged a massive media blitz late december 
when the authorities showed the scant evidence available in a 
nationally televised news conference 
that event triggered a flow of about 12000 tips which have 
been checked by the 40strong detective force permanently assigned 
to the case 
the suspects house was kept under surveillance by detective 
teams for six weeks the reports said early wednesday morning 
heavily armed police raided the house a small fourroom 
semidetached building surprising the suspects in their sleep 
according to the newspapers 
the main suspect was identified by the newspapers as ferdi e no 
immediate confirmation of his identity could be obtained from 
police 
the five suspects were being kept in police custody here pending 
charges the reports said

jewish activists who consider jesse jackson 
antisemitic antiisrael or both are mobilizing to turn voters 
against his democratic presidential bid in the crucial new york 
primary 
even though his efforts to make peace with jews appear to have 
diminished the degree of antipathy toward him since 1984 lingering 
suspicion has set the stage for what may become the most negative 
response to his 1988 campaign 
new york mayor ed kochs assessment of the situation was 
summarized in a new york post headline last weekend koch to 
jews youve got to be crazy to vote for jesse 
im getting dozens of letters every week with expressions of 
concern about the jackson campaign said rabbi abraham cooper of 
the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies in los angeles 
we will absolutely not support a jackson candidacy because he 
is not a friend of the state of israel 
in indianapolis on wednesday jackson was asked how he expected 
to fare among new yorks jewish voters 
youll never get all of any one group he said all you 
can do is reach out ive reached out and im glad to see people 
are responding 
the new york post reported today that jackson campaign advisers 
have suggested tackling the problem directly they propose either a 
private session with members of the new york jewish community 
relations council an umbrella group of local jewish organizations 
or a public speech to the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations 
jacksons support for setting up a palestinian state does not go 
over well with jews who are not pacified by his talk of the need 
to secure israels borders as well 
a widely circulated photograph of jackson embracing palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat further hurt jacksons 
reputation with jews 
in addition jewish voters have not forgotten that during his 
1984 presidential campaign he used the offensive terms hymie 
and hymietown and he associated with nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan who called judaism a dirty religion 
the support jackson enjoys among arabamericans is simply 
another reason jews find to be suspicious they are not swayed by 
the fact that he has a jewish campaign manager gerald austin 
jackson says farrakhan is not part of my campaign and that 
he is not in communication with him jackson apologized for his use 
of the hymie term 
but these issues will no doubt come to the fore in new york 
where the active and large jewish population is a significant 
portion of the electorate 
in new york koch has poured out antijackson commentary while 
jacksons rivals albert gore jr and michael dukakis are 
highlighting middle east issues in their campaigns 
in addition two jewish committees have formed to distribute 
material and demonstrate against jackson 
a new york poll by the marist college institute for public 
opinion in midmarch showed that jackson has made some headway 
among jewish voters thirtysix percent had a favorable opinion of 
him while 43 percent were unfavorable compared to 17 percent 
favorable and 62 percent unfavorable in january 
but that doesnt mean they will vote for him when given 
alternative democrats several jewish leaders said 
a vast majority of jews will not vote for him said michael 
miller executive director of the jewish community relations 
council of new york 
dov hikind a jewish state assemblyman from brooklyn said if 
jesse jackson is on the ticket or even in a position where it is 
clear that he is going to be a major player after the election my 
district will overwhelmingly vote republican i will speak in favor 
of the republican party theres no doubt about it 
he said his coalition for a positive america will distribute 
leaflets at jackson public events a cornell university group and 
americans against jackson a jewishoriented group are planning 
antijackson demonstrations 
already the groups are circulating flyers with a photograph of 
jackson and his best friend louis farrakhan 
jackson strategists have said there are no plans to change the 
overall campaign strategy to deal with jewish complaints they 
point out he has spoken on projewish issues such as soviet jewry 
and the need for a secure israel 
there are some people who wont let go of the past said 
jackson foreign policy adviser bob borosage he noted that since 
1984 jackson has met with many jewish groups and leaders in trying 
to mend fences 
it doesnt mean the suspicion is gone said rabbi david 
saperstein of the liberal religious action center in washington 
he now has to figure out how to take some of the things he has 
been saying and make them convincing to the jewish community

a memo to former fbi director william webster 
shows he knew as early as 1983 that teamsters president jackie 
presser was authorized to take part in illegal activities 
pressers attorneys say 
the memo to webster was among documents filed in federal court 
wednesday by pressers lawyers in an effort to show that presser 
had government permission to allow socalled ghost employees on 
the payroll of teamster local 507 in cleveland 
pressers lawyers claim the fbi authorized him to keep the 
noshow employees who reputedly had underworld ties as a way of 
gathering information about the mob presser has previously 
produced the statements of two fbi agents to support his claim of 
authorization 
the government claims presser his lawyer john r climaco of 
cleveland and three fbi agents concocted the authorization defense 
in 1985 to protectpresser from indictment 
presser secretarytreasurer of local 507 and two other union 
officials anthony hughes and harold friedman are charged with 
racketeering in the alleged 700000 payroll padding scheme their 
trial is set for july 12 
in the memo to webster assistant fbi director oliver revell 
recommended that authorization for jackie presser to participate 
in illegal activities be elevated from the field to fbi hq 
headquarters 
memos filed wednesday were intended to rebut a justice 
department claim that the government did not know about the 
authorization until 1985 when climaco told department officials 
about it 
how can the government now claim that it first learned about 
authorization on june 11 1985 and how can it now claim that it 
was concocted at or around that time when the director of the fbi 
knew about it at least two years prior climaco said in court 
papers with the revell memo 
pressers lawyers say they are having problems obtaining 
documents from the government to prepare their defense and have 
asked for a hearing on their motion to dismiss the case 
wednesdays brief was a response to a brief filed in march by 
prosecutors opposing pressers attempts to have the case dismissed

the soviet union and afghanistan said today they 
had solved all problems blocking a settlement in the afghan war 
moscow said it intended to begin removing its troops from 
afghanistan next month 
in geneva the un mediator in the afghanistan peace talks 
indicated that major differences remain but pakistans president 
said an agreement was ready to be signed 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and afghan leader najib said 
in a joint statement issued after meeting in the soviet city of 
tashkent that the troop withdrawal would start may 15 if the geneva 
negotiations are successful in the shortest period 
the statement didnt mention of the issue of foreign aid to the 
warring parties which is seen as the main obstacle in reaching an 
accord 
after the statement was released un mediator diego cordovez 
said in geneva there are very difficult decisions and the only 
good thing i think that is important is that the political will 
is obviously there to take them he would not elaborate 
the negotiating parties najibs sovietbacked government and 
pakistan representing afghan guerrillas tentatively agreed in 
february that the soviets would start removing their 115000 troops 
on may 15 if an accord were signed by march 15 
with the passage of that deadline the sides have tentatively 
agreed that the soviet withdrawal would begin two months after the 
signing of an accord 
the geneva talks have been stalled since march 2 because of the 
aid issue the united states the guerrillas leading weapons 
supplier has called for a simultaneous cutoff in military aid 
soviet officials contend they have every right to aid their ally 
afghanistan and say the issue has no place in the peace talks 
in islamabad pakistani president mohammad zia ulhaq was quoted 
today as saying that the united states and soviet union had solved 
that problem so the geneva accord could now be signed any time 
the official pakistani news agency quoted zia as telling 
parliament according to unofficial reports the two superpowers 
have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to 
provide continued assistance to their respective allies in 
afghanistan it did not elaborate on the unofficial reports 
the gorbachevnajib statement carried by the official news 
agency tass did not clarify how much time the two sides would 
allow for conclusion of a geneva accord before their offer of a may 
15 pullout expires 
the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been 
removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved 
in the settlement and favor their immediate signing the 
declaration said 
it said the road was now clear for formation of a coalition 
government including all political forces in afghanistan 
including those who are currently opposed to one another many 
of the rebels fighting the afghan government have refused to join 
in najibs previous political overtures which he calls national 
reconciliation 
pakistan has demanded that a broadbased coalition government 
including guerrilla and refugee leaders be in place before the 
soviets leave 
otherwise it says bloody civil strife could continue and an 
estimated 5 million afghan refugees in pakistan and iran would not 
want to return 
the afghan guerrillas have been fighting the kabul government 
since an april 1978 revolution brought communists to power soviet 
soldiers intervened dec 27 1979 
gorbachev flew to tashkent capital of the republic of 
uzbekistan on wednesday the soviet leaders trip occurred under 
unusually tight security even soviet photographers were not 
permitted to cover his departure or arrival 
uzbekistan borders afghanistan tashkent is 450 miles north of 
kabul the afghan capital and 1700 miles southeast of moscow 
tass said najib returned to kabul today 
radio moscow had said the two were meeting with the following in 
mind if no agreement is reached at the afghanpakistani talks in 
geneva the soviet union and afghanistan will act in keeping with 
their national interests the political decision on the soviet 
troops withdrawal remains unchanged

us negotiators today boycotted 
talks on us military bases after newspapers reported a dispute 
over american rights to launch combat missions without manilas 
approval sources said 
the two sides issued a joint statement saying us ambassador 
nicholas platt and filipino foreign secretary raul manglapus had 
agreed to skip the morning session 
but filipino sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the philippine panel waited more than two hours for the americans 
to show up for the morning meeting before learning they were not 
coming 
both sides attended an afternoon session 
talks began tuesday on the status of a 1947 agreement under 
which the united states maintains six military installations in the 
philippines 
the sources said the americans were angry about news leaks 
concerning sharp differences over terms for use of the 
installations including clark air base and the subic bay naval 
base 
most major manila newspapers reported that during wednesdays 
talks manglapus asked for changes in the agreement to require the 
united states to obtain prior consent for combat operations 
launched from the bases 
the current agreement simply requires prior consultations 
according to the reports platt said the demand would cripple 
us ability to maneuver and maintain its worldwide security 
network 
platt reportedly said the demand indicated the filipinos did not 
trust the united states 
us officials refused comment on the news reports but filipino 
sources close to the talks said the reports were accurate 
before the talks began manglapus had said filipino negotiators 
would seek changes in the agreement to strengthen philippine 
sovereignty and serve the national interest 
he has also called for increases in the 180 million annual fee 
that washington pays for use of the installations 
manglapus has said 12 billion a year would be reasonable 
the talks expected to last three months coincide with a 
growing public demand to close the bases many filipinos see them 
as a vestige of american colonial rule 
under the new constitution any extension of the base agreement 
beyond 1991 requires approval of twothirds of the 23member 
senate where antibase sentiment is strong 
platt said tuesday the bases are essential because of the 
significant soviet presence in southeast asia

genetic tests at a british university 
failed to shed any new light on whether gary dotson committed a 
rape that his accuser later said never happened gov james r 
thompson said today 
dr alec jeffreys the scientist who conducted the tests said 
the evidence was too degraded for analysis with the 
sophisticated genetic test the governor said in a written 
statement 
jeffreys suggested that an alternative test might be able to 
analyze the evidence and thompson said he would consider that 
recommendation 
the test focused on an article of clothing worn by cathleen 
crowell webb at the time dotson allegedly attacked her 
dotson was freed from prison in 1985 after serving six years 
when mrs webb recanted the testimony she gave at his trial 
earlier this week thompson received the results of a 
sophisticated genetic test used to compare mrs webbs 
semenstained panties with a semen specimen from dotson 
the test was prepared by jeffreys a professor at the university 
of leicester england 
the test analyzes dna genetic building blocks unique to each 
person the test has several drawbacks including the possiblity of 
an inconclusive finding because of the age of the evidence 
thompson commuted dotsons 25 to 50year sentence to the six 
years dotson had already served after three days of televised 
hearings in may of 1985 before the illinois prisoner review board 
dotson 30 has had brushes with the law since his 1985 release 
and says he is an alcoholic he has been arrested more than a 
halfdozen times for violent incidents and traffic violations 
he is being held without bond in the joliet correctional center 
on a parole violation under the goodbehavior terms of his 
lastchance release dotson could be forced to serve out the 
sentence imposed in the rape case

retired judge judge arlin m adams today 
denied a published report that said attorney general edwin meese 
iii spoke to him about retiring and said he wanted adams to be his 
successor as the nations chief law officer 
adams who declined an offer monday to become chief deputy 
attorney general of the us justice department said his remarks 
in an interview in allentown about meese leaving office were 
misinterpreted 
adams took issue with a story in todays editions of the morning 
call according to the article adams said meese told him it was 
the white house plan to have adams named to succeed meese if meese 
would have to step down 
that is not correct adams said i can tell you 
unequivocally there was never such a discussionits a very 
serious mistake 
adams said instead he discussed stepping in for meese when the 
attorney general was out of the country 
morning call city editor david erdman said the newspaper story 
was correct 
the version as we reported is what well stand by he said 
the philadelphia attorney here visiting muhlenberg college to 
lecture on the constitution discussed his interview with meese 
during a meeting with college officials and guests at a reception 
wednesday the newspaper said 
adams who was considered for appointment as meeses chief 
deputy last week declined the appointment because of reluctance to 
interrupt his law practice and leave his family for an indefinite 
period 
two ranking meese aides resigned out of concern that an 
11monthold criminal investigation of meese was hurting the 
justice departments operations and image a third top justice 
department official left to take a judgeship 
on tuesday meese recommended john c shepherd a former 
president of the american bar association for the numbertwo job 
at the justice department 
according to the morning call adams said the attorney general 
mentioned the possibility that he would leave the post several 
times he said he wanted to make sure he fully understood meeses 
plan 
well if you have to leave you would want me to become the 
attorney general is that correct adams said he inquired 
meese he said replied affirmatively according to the original 
story 
when asked whether president reagan would concur he said meese 
replied i have talked to the president and that is his wish 
also 
i told mr meese that i would do anything that i could to 
help adams said i would be available for counsel and i did 
give him my advice but i declined the job offer and i have no 
second thoughts 
adams said he does not think much will be accomplished at the 
justice department while meese is still there 
i dont think that he is going to leave and i dont think 
that the president is going to remove him ronald reagan is very 
loyal to his friends adams said 
when asked whether he thought meese would be indicted for his 
conduct adams responded it is very unlikely that he will be 
indicted i dont think that there is sufficient evidence against 
him to support an indictment 
although he is not privy to details of the investigation adams 
emphasized that an 11month review by special prosecutor james c 
mckay has not produced anything against meese that would warrant 
prosecution of the attorney general 
the 66yearold adams who recently retired from the 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals could not be reached for comment by the 
associated press early today because a woman who answered the phone 
at his house refused to wake him

sen paul simon put his faltering democratic 
presidential bid on hold today and said i have no illusions that 
the nomination will come my way but he kept a lock on his 
delegates in hopes he can wield influence at the july nominating 
convention 
in a year that has already seen many surprises no one knows 
what twists and turns may develop between now and then simon 
said at a washington news conference 
simon said he would make a final decision on his candidacy after 
the last primaries on june 7 in the meantime he said he will 
devote his time to his duties as an illinois senator 
he said by holding onto his delegates until the convention he 
hoped to have some influence over who the party nominates i want 
to make sure this country does what it ought to do he told 
reporters 
he attributed his campaigns stall to his own failure to 
effectively communicate his message of traditional democratic 
philosophy and advocacy of a legitimate role for government in 
bringing about social reforms the campaign also was hampered by a 
lack of money he said but added he will finish with only about 
400000 in debts 
simons quasiwithdrawal leaves just three democrats in the 
race his decision comes after months of poor showings he won only 
his homestate primary 
during his travels around the nation simon said he found 
there really is a yearning across this good land for leadership 
that appeals to the noble in us rather than the greed in us 
government is not the enemy he said government is simply 
a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely we can do better 
my friends 
he said problems like the arms race unemployment crime and 
inadequacies in health care and education are not the result of 
acts of god but the result of insensitive leadership chosen by a 
people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they might 
be 
in the statement simon minimized chances that he might seek the 
presidency again in 1992 running for president is a little like 
taking an icecold shower he said it is a great onetime 
experience but i have no yearning for a repeat performance 
simon according to an aide hoped to pick up additional 
delegates as an inactive candidate between now and the convention 
his decision reflects the reality of having lost a great many 
primaries and caucuses said spokesman terry michael it will 
give those who supported paul simon a chance to have full 
representation at the convention 
simons mother ruth said wednesday her son would remain an 
official candidate although suspending his campaign because too 
many people have advised him to stay in 
hes going to hang in there till the end she said 
mrs simon said the senator and his family would take a weeks 
vacation 
simon who entered the race a year ago promising a return to 
leadership rooted in the traditional values of our party was 
unable to put together a winning campaign formula 
he had a brief rendezvous with momentum prior to iowas 
firstinthenation february caucuses emerging on top in several 
polls of iowa voters taken late in 1987 but things began to cool 
off after gary hart reentered the race in middecember 
when feb 8 arrived simon finished a close second in iowa 
behind missouri congressman richard gephardt a week later he came 
in third in new hampshire behind michael dukakis and gephardt 
it was mostly downhill from there 
he placed third or worse in most primaries and caucuses and sat 
out the super tuesday contests in 20 states he has garnered 1705 
delegates compared with dukakis 74055 jesse jacksons 70455 
and albert gores 3948 
he did win last months primary in his home state of illinois 
but was unable to build on that victory and claim the midwest as 
simon country making poor showings in michigan wisconsin and 
elsewhere in the region 
simon 59 is known for his trademark bow tie and liberal views 
but on the campaign trail he portrayed himself as a 
makenoapologies democratic nominee waging a fight for the 
heart and the soul of the democratic party 
i want a government that cares i want a government that is 
responsive to the needs of the less fortunate he told voters 
he painted himself the modern equivalent of plaintalking harry 
truman saying people are ready for something other than the 
slick packaged product were ready for somebody whos going to 
level with us 
he proposed longterm health care for the elderly a public 
works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives and 
promised that as president he would balance the budget in three 
years 
that brought criticism from democratic rivals who claimed simon 
was short on details when it came to explaining how he would 
simultaneously finance expensive new programs and balance the 
budget 
gephardt in one debate said simonomics is really reaganomics 
with a bow tie he called simon a promiseasyougo democrat 
simon a firstterm senator and fourtime congressman countered 
such criticisms by claiming that too many democrats have bought 
into the republican mindset which claims we cant afford to invest 
in americas future

a danish group plans to set up 
europes first alligator farm in southern spain to produce skins 
and meat for export the project organizer said thursday 
the baby alligators would come from the united states and be 
bred at the farm in spain but it would take three to four years 
before production and export of the reptiles skin and meat could 
begin said leif skovgaard in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
skovgaard a chartered accountant who is organizing the project 
for a group of seven danish investors said 1000012000

roque 
european alligator institue as the project is called seeks 
financial support from the local and state governments in spain as 
well as the european economic community 
the farm which the group hopes to open by the beginning of 
1989 would employ about 100 people skovgaard said

rep edward p boland author of the 
amendments which barred us aid to the contras in nicaragua 
announced today that he will retire after 36 years in congress 
ive decided to call it a day the 76yearold democrfat 
said at a news conference at our lady of hope school surrounded by 
supporters in the irish neighborhood where he was born and raised 
the parades are all over the give and take of the campaign 
trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls 
on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling 
experience he said 
speculation that he might retire led three democrats 
springfield mayor richard neal former mayor theodore dimauro and 
state rep kenneth m lemanski of chicopee to announce they were 
interested in the seat provided they didnt have to oppose the 
incumbent in a primary 
boland did not endorse anyone to succeed him 
the reagan administrations frustration with the boland 
amendments inspired the diverion of profits from arms sales to 
support the contras that operation became a focus of the 
irancontra investigation and the recent indictment of former 
marine lt col oliver north and others 
the reserved boland came to washington with the man who would 
later become the speaker of the house thomas p tip oneill 
in 1952 for more than 20 years the two friends roomed together in 
an arrangement they described as a reallife odd couple with 
boland the neat and tidy half of the pair 
many expected him to follow oneill into retirement in 1986 but 
some believed that boland stayed in part in the hopes of taking 
over the chairmanship of the house appropriations committee 
boland is the no 2 democrat on the powerful panel and would be 
in line for the chairmanship if jamie l whitten of mississippi 
retired whitten who is a year older than boland has already 
announced plans to run for reelection 
the son of irish immigrants who settled in springfields hungry 
hill district boland was elected to the massachusetts house of 
representatives at age 22 and never lost an election in a 
halfcentury in politics 
boland served as chairman of the house intelligence committee 
from 1977 to 1985 
he remained a bachelor until 1973 when he married mary egan 
then the 35yearold president of the springfield city council 
they have four children

leaders of afghanistans fractious 
moslem guerrillas are forming their own regime to challenge the 
communist government from liberated areas when soviet military 
forces are gone 
the alliance of seven parties three moderate and four 
fundamentalist has been meeting almost daily to preserve unity 
while they lay the groundwork for their own government there is 
hope that it will work a moderate leader said 
no doubt when the russians leave afghanistan najibs regime 
will collapse said gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the alliance 
to avoid anarchy and possible armed clashes to seize power its 
necessary that all parties agree to a temporary government 
soviet forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 soldiers now are helping fight the insurgency 
which began after a communist coup in april 1978 
mikhail s gorbachev and afghan leader najib issued a joint 
statement thursday saying all obstacles had been cleared in 
negotiations to end the war and the soviets hope to start pulling 
their troops out next month 
in geneva the un mediator indicated major differences remain 
but pakistan where 35 million afghan refugees have taken refuge 
said an agreement was ready for signing 
the guerrilla alliance has agreed to hold elections among 
fighters in afghanistan and refugees in pakistan for a council that 
would vote on establishing of an interim moslem government 
leaders of the seven groups have named ahmad shah as president 
and zabihullah mojaddedi as his deputy to lead a 21member cabinet 
in which each party is to have at least two members 
a leadership council of the seven guerrilla leaders would 
function as the head of state and supervise ahmad shahs 
government which would operate from a defended area beyond the 
reach of the communist governments forces 
mohammad nabi mohammadi leader of the moderate harkat islami 
party named five guerrillacontrolled areas kunar noorestan 
pakitia panjshir and hazarejat 
sebghatullah mojaddedi leader of the moderate afghan national 
liberation front said if we come under pressure in one place 
we will move to another 
agreement also has been reached on having a judiciary committee 
to settle disputes among the parties 
we will work hard for the liberation of afghanistank but the 
devil may influence some people and encourage disputes 
mojaddedi said 
we hope our brothers will understand that except for unity 
solidarity and compromise there is no other way to reach our pure 
goals for the freedom of afghanistan and in order to create true 
islam in afghanistan we must put aside all these disputes there 
is hope that it will work 
not all rebel leaders are equally keen on forming an interim 
government inside afghanistan ahmad gailani of the moderate 
national islamic front of afghanistan fears it could cut the nation 
in half 
if there are two governments in afghanistan there is the 
danger of partition into north and south or east and west as with 
north and south korea or east and west germany he said 
gailani prefers a transitional government in exile until the 
communist regime can be overthrown 
yunis khalis of the hardline hezbiislami faction expects 
outside interference colonialist countries the superpowers 
east or west american or russian have joined hands to prevent 
the creation of a total islamic government in afghanistan he 
said 
khalis said iran where shiite moslems dominate is urging 
shiite guerrillas to reject a sunni moslem government in 
afghanistan where sunnis are in the majority 
therefore we cannot for certain bring about an islamic 
government in the present circumstances he said this is why 
we declare we will not abandon our jihad holy war 
deepseated frictions persist one source hekmatyar who is 
unpopular even in the hardline camp but recently replaced khalis as 
head of the alliance 
he is not the leader but only head of the alliance every 
party is independent mojaddedi said of course we have had our 
complaints the brothers have warned him that now that he has 
become the head it does not mean he has all the authority in his 
hand to do whatever he likes 
hekmatyars men have been accused of harassing guerrillas of 
other parties journalists and relief workers traveling to 
afghanistan 
his party also called hezbiislami has been blamed for the 
killing of a british cameraman last year hekmatyar has denied it

sen paul simon today put his presidential campaign on hold 
reducing the democratic quartet to a trio michael dukakis and 
albert gore meanwhile zeroed in on mideast issues seen as a 
likely sore spot for jesse jackson in the upcoming new york primary 
simon who has lost everywhere except in his home state of 
illinois suspended campaign activities but stopped short of 
dropping out he said he would make a final decision on his 
candidacy after the final primary on june 7 
in a year that has already seen many surprises no one knows 
what twists and turns may develop between now and then simon 
said at a capitol hill news conference but he added i have no 
illusions that the nomination will come my way 
the three remaining active democrats were all campaigning today 
in new york which holds its primary april 19 at stake are 255 
delegates in what will be the biggest state contest to date 
new york gov mario cuomo in an interview published today said 
he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary and he 
warned the democrats singling out gore that negative 
campaigning is terribly dangerous 
paul g kirk jr chairman of the democratic national committee 
today endorsed cuomos appeal to gore to tone down his criticism of 
rivals dukakis and jackson 
the admonitions that have been addressed to senator gore by 
governor cuomo just help to make sure we can continue to talk about 
the issues in a positive way kirk said at a news conference in 
washington dc 
all those admonitions are helpful and are on course as far as 
im concerned 
on the republican side there was plenty of parley vice 
president george bush the nominee in all but name met wednesday 
with former rival sen bob dole who pledged to work to get bush 
elected and dole talked with pat robertson who remains in the 
republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being 
nominated 
simon said that by suspending his campaign he will hold onto 
his delegates until the convention and perhaps have some say over 
the partys nominee 
i want to make sure this country does what it ought to do 
he said 
simon made his last stand in wisconsin where he finished a weak 
fourth in tuesdays primary the illinois senator ran second in the 
leadoff iowa caucuses on feb 8 in what was to be his best showing 
of the campaign outside of his home state 
after finishing third in new hampshire a week later he did not 
have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on 
super tuesday march 8 and was consequently clobbered 
many expected him to drop out after that but simon under 
pressure from illinois supporters stayed in for his homestate 
primary then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in 
the race 
for the other democrats the battle of new york began in earnest 
on wednesday dukakis was at work courting voters in new yorks 
large jewish community stressing the need for a mideast peace plan 
that would allow israel to live in peace and harmony 
gore reiterated his strong support for israel as he campaigned 
wednesday in new york city he said as president he would create a 
cabinetlevel position to focus fulltime on mideast negotiations 
gore also blasted dukakis and jackson for a lack of experience in 
international affairs 
cuomo decried such infighting saying his admonition was 
directed mainly at gore 
it does not work and its terribly dangerous and 
counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the 
nominee he said in an interview with the washington post 
cuomo seen by some democrats as a potential draftee in the 
event of a deadlocked convention said he preferred to wait until 
after the primary season to make an endorsement 
thats the time for leadership in this process the governor 
said 
jackson was campaigning in new york today after spending a day 
in arizona which holds democratic caucuses on april 16 and 
indiana where primary day is may 3 in indianapolis jackson was 
asked how he expected to do among new yorks jewish voters 
youll never get all of any one group he said all you 
can do is reach out ive reached out and im glad to see people 
are responding 
many jews were offended by jacksons 1984 reference to new york 
as hymietown for which he apologized and his association 
with muslim leader louis farrakhan who called judaism a gutter 
religion jackson no longer has ties to farrakhan his campaign 
says 
jackson has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the jewish 
community 
after three straight wins in connecticut colorado and 
wisconsin dukakis was leading in the national delegate race the 
latest ap count put him at 74055 jackson at 70455 uncommitted 
at 5136 gore at 3948 and simon at 1705 
even if he is not actively campaigning simon could continue to 
gain delegates and keep those he has that would leave him in 
control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the 
democratic national convention 
whether he meant it to or not simons decision to technically 
remain a candidate helps dukakis remain the leader in the delegate 
race 
under party rules simon is entitled to 47 atlarge delegates 
from illinois jackson to 13 and dukakis none a simon withdrawal 
would automatically shift his 47 delegates to jacksons column and 
thus put him ahead in national delegate count 
meanwhile dukakis widened his margin of victory over jackson in 
mondays colorado caucuses returns on tuesday showed dukakis had 
narrowly won on wednesday with 85 percent of the precincts 
reporting dukakis had widened his lead to 11 percentage points 45 
to 34 percent

global registration began thursday for a second 
sport aid race against time the sixmile street jog by nearly 
20 million people in 1986 that raised 35 million for starving 
africans 
organizers are hoping to involve all 218 countries and inhabited 
territories in the sept 11 extravaganza compared with 89 nations 
last time major charities and sports federations in 85 countries 
have already joined the sport aid 88 campaign 
were trying to build on that new constituency of 
compassion said an organizer simon dring all we can do is to 
create a forum for this to happen and say to the world please 
join us 
the united states is expected to contribute more this year 
dring said sport aid was a flop in america in 1986 because it 
coincided with a nationwide hands across america campaign to 
raise funds for the poor and homeless 
america is america dring said in an interview it lives 
within itself so adequately its very difficult sometimes to 
involve them in events of this nature 
were presently in discussions with the american red cross and

a civilian accused of taking a selfpropelled 
howitzer for a joy ride with an army private has pleaded guilty to 
a federal misdemeanor charge in exchange for dismissal of a felony 
charge 
roberto torres 26 and pvt norman clair 19 took the tracked 
armored army artillery piece from fort carson on nov 11 and drove 
it up interstate 25 to denver trailed by a parade of police cars 
when the howitzer ran out of gasoline police arrested the men 
clair was sentenced earlier to 15 months in prison on military 
charges 
torres faces a maximum of one year in prison and a 100000 fine 
as a result of his plea wednesday to a charge of stealing personal 
property valued at 200 or less he also may be required to pay 
restitution of 1000 for minor damage to the howitzer and to 
fences that were broken at fort carson 
the charge dropped was stealing the artillery piece assistant 
us attorney fred stephens said the 10year sentence under that 
charge was too stiff for what amounted to a joyride 
us district judge jim carrigan accepted the plea bargain after 
making sure torres had chosen a different mode of transportation to 
court 
yes we came here together in my car defense attorney 
robert erler said it gets better gas mileage than the vehicle he 
chose for his previous trip

and benefits after stealing a jeep in 1979 
torres is on a military disability pension after having been

former gov ab happy chandler today 
released a statement apologizing for a racial remark he made at a 
university of kentucky board of trustees meeting 
chandler said gov wallace wilkinson who appointed him to a 
voting position on the uk board earlier this year called him today 
and took me to the woodshed for the remark 
wilkinson suggested that he apologize but did not request that 
he resign from the board chandler said 
if he did id resign chandler said 
chandler used the racial epithet tuesday during a committees 
discussion of the universitys 1985 decision to dispose of its 
investments in south africa 
you know zimbabwes all nigger now there arent any whites 
he said about seven of the 20 board members were present 
chandler said today at a news conference at his home here he 
stands on his record of helping blacks and other minorities 
throughout his lifetime of public service as governor us senator 
and commissioner of baseball 
i didnt intend to be offensive to anybody said chandler 
in an interview wednesday with the lexington heraldleader 
chandler said students who protested the racial slur were trying 
to make a mountain out of a molehill 
i dont think i should be censured for this chandler told 
the newspaper i dont think i deserve any harsh treatment 
the student government association on wednesday night approved a 
resolution calling for chandlers resignation from the board 
earlier about 40 students marched on the universitys 
administration building to meet with president david roselle some 
carried placards with slogans like hopefully happy is sad 
tae dorham a member of the american association of university 
students said the group demanded an apology from chandler and if 
that wasnt accomplished his resignation 
lets see how far they students can go chandler said in a 
telephone interview from his home my whole record i think is 
good enough to overcome this 
chandler 89 was commissioner of baseball from 194551 and 
takes credit for opening the door for jackie robinson to become the 
first black to play majorleague baseball when robinson signed with 
the brooklyn dodgers in 1946 
during a second term as governor he won praise for his 
endorsement of racial integration of schools 
roselle told the students that the university completely and 
totally repudiates chandlers statement its completely 
contrary to what we want to have be the belief of the 
university of kentucky he said 
the universitys only black trustee edythe jones hayes said 
she would ask the board to issue a statement to be sure the 
public knows this is not representative of the feelings of the 
board

two doctors say usmade tear gas used by 
israel to curb arab protests may be causing deaths and injuries to 
civilians but further studies are needed to determine the extent 
of the problem 
adequate research just has not been done said dr howard 
hu an epidemiologist at the harvard university school of public 
health 
hu and dr jonathan fine are associated with physicians for 
human rights a bostonbased group which is concerned that the 
israelis may be misusing tear gas a chemical agent that overcomes 
its victims by causing severe irritation to the eyes skin and 
respiratory tract 
if tear gas is handled properly the effects are not 
longlasting but it can kill people if it is fired in high doses 
into enclosed areas 
it would not surprise me if there were deaths of infants or 
the infirm from too much exposure to tear gas in israel fine 
said we believe it is important to do planned studies on this 
the americanarab antidiscrimination committee a lobbying 
group claims that more than 30 people have died in israel and in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip from exposure to tear 
gas which also has caused injuries and miscarriages 
yossi gal a spokesman at the israeli embassy said those 
figures are wildly inflated the israelis have found only one 
probable death attributable to tear gas he said 
but the committee has asked transtechnology corp a tear gas 
manufacturer in sherman oaks calif to halt shipments to israel 
until it determines the substance is being properly handled 
israel has bought 120000 tear gas grenades or projectiles from 
us companies under the us governments military sales credit 
program since the arab disturbances began in the west bank and gaza 
strip four months ago 
burl alison a vice president at transtechnology said the 
company is redoubling its effort to ensure the material is 
being used correctly after the committee presented what looked 
like evidence that it is being misused 
two types of tear gas codenamed cn and cs by the us army 
are made at the companys federal laboratories in saltsburg pa 
we are writing to the prime minister of israel to try to get 
some attention to the proper use of the product mrs alison said 
the company also has offered to send staff to train the israeli 
military on how to use the substance but the israeli government 
has not responded she said 
there have been reports from israel that tear gas was fired into 
al aqsa mosque in jerusalem in january and a canister landed in 
ramallah hospital in march it has also been dropped by helicopter 
into refugee camps witnesses say 
but gal said it is not the governments policy to fire tear gas 
into closed spaces although some might drift into confined areas 
its mostly used outdoors he said 
mrs alison said tear gas is a safe effective way to control 
crowds if directions are followed and transtechnology has no plans 
to stop selling to israel 
even if it is misused you would see much more grief and many 
more fatalities and injuries if it werent available she said 
each batch of tear gas sold to israel must be licensed under the 
arms export control act which requires recipients to live up to 
us human rights standards in 1985 the united states refused to 
sell tear gas to korean police because of that countrys poor human 
rights performance 
a state department official speaking on condition he not be 
named defended the israelis use of tear gas and said the us 
government has not investigated any reports of misuse 
we think maintaining order should be in the most humane way 
possible the official said one of those ways is tear gas 
fine of the human rights group said the longterm effects of 
tear gas have been understudied and underreported he added 
i wouldnt belittle the problem 
since disturbances began in the occupied territories four months 
ago at least 138 arabs one israeli soldier and one israeli 
civilian have been killed

a murder two life insurance policies taken out in 1985 and 1986 
did not have suicide clauses in them and twoyear contestability

the chants of women recruits jogging 
in the warm april sun drift through the open windows of the law 
center at the marine corps recruit depot 
inside marine officers are continuing an investigation of 
lesbianism which has already led to charges against several former 
drill instructors and at least one officer 
five women marines have been charged with various counts 
including committing indecent acts two other women who were due to 
go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges 
each year 20000 recruits graduate from the 11week basic 
training program at parris island one of the four recruit 
battalions is made up of women and parris island is the only base 
that provides basic training for the 10060 women in the corps 
at least 10 women are under investigation and the probe by the 
naval investigative service is likely to expand according to a 
marine who said shes a target and who has leaked word of the 
investigation in letters to a number of news organizations 
every base ive been on has had one of these socalled witch 
hunts said the woman 
one of the reasons i went to the press is to show theres an 
injustice being done said the woman who spoke on the condition 
her name not be used if theyre going to conduct these 
investigations they need to do it on the male side of the house as 
well 
the woman denies she is homosexual and has not been formally 
charged 
during the last three federal fiscal years 90 women and 219 men 
have been dismissed for homosexuality according to the department 
of defense more than 40 percent of those discharged were women 
who represent only about 5 percent of the corps strength 
department of defense figures also show that during the 
threeyear period 662 cases of homosexuality among marines were 
investigated by the naval investigative services and about a third 
of the investigations involved women 
theres no clear reason for the disparity and the matter has 
never been studied said corps spokeswoman joanne schilling in 
washington she denied that special attention was being paid to 
lesbians 
a commanding officer has the responsibility if someone in 
their command has indicated a reason to believe theres a violation 
of the ucmj uniform code of military justice to check it out 
she said 
the investigation at parris island is not a regular occurrence 
but its not an unprecedented thing said maj robert mclean a 
spokesman for the base 
records of such cases are kept only about two years but mclean 
said he understood that there was a similar hearing involving women 
marines three or four years ago 
he said the base doesnt make unsolicited announcements of such 
hearings but will answer media inquiries 
the current proceedings are article 32 hearings which are 
similar to civilian grand jury hearings they are in effect an 
open investigation in which defendants have certain rights and 
defense and prosecution witnesses can be called 
the investigating officer then makes a nonbinding 
recommendation to the marines commanding officer the 
recommendation may be that the charges go to a courtmartial that 
the marine go before an administrative discharge board or the 
charges be dismissed 
in an administrative discharge board a board of marines 
determines whether the defendant has the potential for further 
service a courtmartial could lead to a prison sentence 
in addition to the counts of indecent acts the defendants face 
various charges including dereliction of duty sodomy conspiracy 
to obstruct justice and assault 
not all the charges are related to homosexuality mclean 
said in a larger sense we are talking about breaches of good 
order and discipline 
he said the corps cannot tolerate homosexuality because 
homosexuality is contrary to good order and discipline not 
because there is a statement being made about lifestyles 
recruit training must be conducted with the highest standards 
of order and discipline he added the overwhelming majority of 
those who serve perform faultlessly

two months after being given a new liver small 
bowel pancreas and a portion of stomach 9monthold michael 
steward is ready to go home his doctor says 
the success of the transplant operation so far is absolutely 
fantastic news that provides hope for other children suffering 
from multiorgan failure dr james williams says 
the boy who is from rockford underwent a multiorgan transplant 
operation at chicagos rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
in february 
michael the youngest child to receive such a transplant is 
scheduled to be released from the hospital saturday williams said 
wednesday 
only three other children are known to have had such 
transplants two have died the third still is hospitalized 
michael was born with a twisted intestine that turned gangrenous 
and had to be removed a week later that left him with an intestine 
too small to absorb food intravenous feeding kept him alive but 
destroyed his liver necessitating the transplants 
after the transplant surgery michael battled setbacks 
including holes in the donor small bowel williams said 
there have been a couple of times in this course that i didnt 
think he was going to survive williams said 
he said it was possible the boy will be able to function 
normally 
im very encouraged by the progress that has been made so far 
but its still an experiment and were still in the middle of it 
williams said 
williams said the donor bowel has been maturing well and the 
child now gets about twothirds of his nutrition through it he 
gets the rest of his nourishment through intravenous feeding 
the doctor said he expects the boy will be weaned entirely from 
intravenous feeding within two weeks 
the donor small intestine has not yet been connected to the 
boys stomach so he will have to return to the hospital in about 
two months to undergo an operation to connect it williams said 
we cant say that we have the total solution to short gut 
syndrome in children but we are strongly encouraged that this 
procedure can be a promising option for other children suffering 
from similar problems he said

officials of the knights of malta cast secret 
ballots friday for a new leader to carry on the roman catholic 
orders 900yearold tradition of chivalry charity and nobility 
thirtysix electors will lock themselves in a villa on the 
aventine hill on friday to vote for a successor to fra angelo de 
mojana di cologna the orders grand master died jan 18 at the age 
of 82 after 25 years as the knights supreme leader 
the 78th grand master will be chosen from among 22 of the 
electors including de mojanas interim replacement fra giancarlo 
pallavicini a hungarianborn american biochemist 
a grand master carries the title of prince and is addressed as 
your most eminent highness equal in rank to a cardinal he is 
elected for life and is considered the highestranking layman in 
the roman catholic church 
to be eligible for the position he must have attained the top 
rank of knight of justice and followed vows of poverty 
chastity and obedience he also must be able to prove 200 years of 
nobility on the side of both parents 
the result of the election will be announced only after the 
decision is ratified by pope john paul ii possibly several days 
after the vote 
the sovereign military order of the hospital of st john of 
jerusalem of rhodes and of malta the groups full title was 
founded during the crusades when it opened a hospice for pilgrims 
in jerusalem in the early 11th century 
it has the status of an independent state and has diplomatic 
relations with 50 nations 
the order is not related to the knights of columbus an american 
roman catholic society for men founded in 1882 in new haven conn 
that also is involved in charity and social works 
the knights of malta dedicate themselves to chivalry charity 
and nobility today the order has about 10000 members led by 
italy with 2800 and followed closely by the united states with 
2500 said spokesman monsignor antonio jannone said 
among its wellknown members in the united states are new york 
financier j peter grace attorney edward bennett williams former 
secretary of state alexander haig and the late cia director william 
casey italian members include foreign minister giulio andreotti 
president francesco cossiga and fiat chairman giovanni agnelli 
beyond the image of chivalry pomp and noblesse oblige 
symbolized by their uniforms cloaks medals plumed hats and 
swords the knights are known for their dedication to the sick and 
wounded 
the order operates about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in 
90 countries especially in third world nations and war zones 
after centuries of fighting to protect our citizens and 
territory the order has returned to its original function health 
assistance hospitals fighting against hunger and misery 
jannone said in an interview 
for centuries membership in the order required proof of blue 
blood but some ranks including knights and dames of grace and 
devotion are now accessible to those without noble ancestry 
about 60 percent of the orders members today do not come from 
nobility jannone said 
since 1834 the order has been based in rome where it owns a 
16th century palace on via condotti in the heart of the shopping 
district and a fouracre villa on the aventine hill the site is a 
favorite spot for romans and tourists who can peek through a gate 
keyhole down a cypresslined path that frames the dome of st 
peters basilica in the distance 
the order took on its militarychivalric character to defend 
pilgrims and the christian kingdom against moslem attacks the 
knights were forced out of the holy land at the end of the 13th 
century eventually settling in rhodes where they became a naval 
power in the eastern mediterranean 
they were driven from rhodes by the ottoman turks in the 16th 
century and moved to malta which they turned into an island 
fortress and a thriving center of christianity and trade 
the knights stayed in malta until 1798 when the island was 
captured by french emperor napoleon before settling in rome the 
order temporarily came under control of czar paul i of russia and 
shuttled among st petersburg catania and ferrara 
among their activities in the united states the knights of 
malta run free clinics at st vincents hospital in los angeles and 
providence hospital in oakland calif and a family dispensary in 
east los angeles they also give financial aid to fordham 
university in new york the pearson foundation and project hope 
in recent years the order has been waging a legal battle against 
some 22 groups in the united states that use similar names and 
titles and demand high fees and contributions the real knights say 
they collect minimal dues but that members are expected to 
contribute generously to the orders projects 
the order has filed suits in us courts against the false 
groups but all the cases have apparently been dropped jannone 
said

matts haircut is disrupting classes he was suspended for five 
days this week after his parents refused to promise that he would 
change it

white house chief of staff howard 
baker said today that president reagans arrangement for leasing a 
25 million bel air estate was beyond legitimate criticism and 
that the first family may not like all the publicity about the 
deal 
the white house refused to say how much reagan and his wife 
nancy will pay for the posh home where they will move when he 
leaves office real estate sources however estimate the 
fairmarket value at 12000 to 15000 a month 
without providing any figures the white house said the reagans 
will pay a fairmarket rental 
baker talking with reporters at the seaside hotel where he is 
staying during reagans vacation was asked if there was any 
appearance of impropriety in the leasing deal 
i dont think so he replied 
the white house the president and the first lady went to 
great lengths to make sure that this was an armslength 
transaction that there was a full appraisal of the rental price of 
this property and that all of the is were dotted and the ts were 
crossed and the president and the first lady have handled this in 
precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism of 
the transaction baker said 
asked if the reagans were upset by publicity about the house he 
said oh i dont think so i think after eight years theyve 
come to understand that that occurs and while they understand it 
they may not like it but they are not angry about it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to say how much 
the reagans would pay under a threeyear lease that took effect 
march 1 
there is no federal requirement to divulge the amount of the 
lease rental fitzwater said wednesday 
stephen shapiro of the los angeles realty firm of stan herman amp 
associates said the fair market value for a 6500 squarefoot home 
in that neighborhood would be 15000 a month realtor jeff hyland 
who lives in the neighborhood estimated the cost at 12000 a 
month 
the singlestory ranchstyle home with three bedrooms six 
baths and a heated swimming pool is situated on 1 acres in west 
los angeles in one of the most expensive areas of the state 
located at 668 st cloud road the home is near the kirkeby 
estate where the television show beverly hillbillies was filmed 
the reagans neighbors will include celebrities such as 
elizabeth taylor zsa zsa gabor joan rivers mac davis burt 
bacharach and robert stack 
real estate agents say the value of the home has shot up since 
it was purchased in 1986 for the reagans by a consortium of about 
20 people who have incorporated as the wall management services 
inc 
jeff hyland of the los angeles firm of alvarez hyland amp young 
said the value of the land alone could be as much as 3 million now 
the rental fee and the terms of the lease were negotiated by 
representatives of the reagans and the owners based on fairmarket 
rental estimates from two independent appraisers fitzwater said 
prior to buying the property the proposed owners obtained a 
legal opinion from the office of government ethics 
the ethics office said any potential lease or sale of the 
house to the president and mrs reagan will comply with standards 
of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes so long as 
the president pays a fair market rental or purchase price for the 
house fitzwater said 
the reagans lease gives them the option to renew the agreement 
or purchase the house fitzwater said no purchase price terms are 
set in the lease he added 
the spokesman said the lease allows the reagans to make 
further decisions about the home once the president is out of 
office and has exact knowledge of the assets and income in his 
blind trust 
the house is expected to be ready for occupancy in late 1988 
before reagan moves out of the white house next jan 20

us and european officials disagreed 
thursday over how to prevent food surpluses from building up in the 
developed nations when much of the third world goes hungry 
the twoday world food conference organized by the european 
parliament brought together 200 agriculture and development 
experts to discuss the problem of surplus food output in parts of 
the world and continuing shortages elsewhere 
us agriculture secretary richard e lyng said only an end to 
farm subsidies will bring about the necessary reform 
continuing current policies will inevitably lead to greater 
surpluses more wasted resources more disincentives for 
economic expansion in developing countries and more trade 
confrontation lyng told the delegates 
the united states is seeking an end to all state aids to farmers 
by 2000 in the current round of trade liberalization talks within 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but frans andriessen the european economic community 
agriculture commissioner said the us proposal was neither 
possible nor desirable 
some form of stabilization and protectionism will always 
be needed given the unpredictability of food production 
he said the 12nation eec agreed in february to curb its runaway 
growth of farm output through production ceilings and penalties for 
overproducers 
he termed this a major contribution toward restoring a 
balance between supply and demand he added european farmers 
expect a similar action by other producing areas 
the united states and the eec are the worlds largest food 
producers 
zambian president kenneth kaunda appealed for an end to 
economic parochialism and greater liberalization of world trade 
he urged the developed nations to put aside national 
differences we have to move from blind protectionism to 
regional and finally global harmonized free movement of goods and 
services he said 
the social and economic world order can no longer permit 
undue overemphasis on what i wish to call economic parochalism 
kaunda urged food producers not to dump surplus stocks on us 
through food aid but to help the third world become 
selfsufficient 
concessions to third world producers he said must be seen as 
a major incentive for promoting selfreliance in development more 
appropriate than food aid 
the delegates to the conference hope to adopt a common statement 
at the end 
a preliminary draft obtained by the associated press calls on 
key food producing nations to switch from accrosstheboard food 
price subsidies to income supports for needy farmers 
ending subsidies the draft said should be joint effort by all 
industrial nations 
delegates said the draft if adopted would echo the eecs 
views rather than the more radical ones of the united states as a 
way to come to grips with the imbalance in supply and demand 
lyng said the united states in seeking a way out of the worlds 
farm trade problems through gatt prefered a multilateral 
solution 
it would however continue to support us agriculture 
vigorously if fair trade cannot be achieved multilaterally 
he added 
the us proposal for a radical end to farm subsidies was backed 
by europes international organization of consumers unions which 
said agricultural export subsidies and measures with equivalent 
effect should be phased out over the next 10 years 
it added the developed nations should rid themselves of food 
surpluses through lower prices for farmers giving food to its own 
needy citizens and those in the worlds poor regions 
western food must be given to developing nations in emergency 
cases only the group said in a paper longterm western food aid 
carries the disadvantage that it competes with locally grown 
food 
it criticized as unfair to the third world the repeated eec 
efforts to tax imports of oils and fats and to pay eec farmers a 
bonus to use some of their cereal output as animal feed

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it plans to declare seven more superfund toxic dump 
sites cleaned up 
epa says it has completed work at 37 sites and has declared 13 
clean since the cleanup effort began seven years ago at another 
seven sites all work as been completed except groundwater pumping 
for purification which may continue for years or decades 
often chided for the small number of cleanups completed epa 
says such maintenance pumping will continue to keep the number 
of walkaway cleanups small 
two more sites were chosen for a cleanup declaration last month 
those two and the seven announced thursday are subject to public 
comment before the declaration is made formally 
the agency has estimated that there may be 25000 sites needing 
attention most are small but 951 have been chosen for a priority 
list eligible for federal cleanup funds from the superfund program 
some 149 of those have not been formally placed on the list 
epa says it has completed 604 initial site investigations 
decided on a cleanup method for 230 and has done some actual 
cleanup work as opposed to mere paperwork at 189 sites 
frequently as a temporary measure until a cleanup can be completed 
or a method decided on actual cleanups are currently under way at 
60 sites

here is a transcript of sen paul simons 
statement thursday as he suspended his campaign for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
i am today suspending my campaign for the presidency 
im grateful to all who have campaigned with me and for me 
and i leave the field of active campaigning with no regrets for 
having made the race 
no regrets first because it has been an exhilarating 
experience to get to know our nation better both our difficulties 
and our potential 
i understand more fully the plight of native americans in south 
dakota the nuclear energy in new hampshire and new york the 
similarities and difficulties that farmers in iowa and wisconsin 
share with their illinois counterparts the isolation of a small 
city in wyoming in winter the disfigurement oil rigs could cause 
to the magnificent coastline of california the sadness of 
unemployment in starr county texas and the wasted humanity in too 
much of our nation 
but ive also come to know better a nation with potential a 
nation that is limited not by our talent and resources but by our 
dreams and our leadership 
where i have had the opportunity to reach people i have seen 
them respond with a selflessness that must be tapped 
americans instinctively know that we are one nation one family 
and when anyone in that family hurts all of us eventually hurt 
there really is a yearning across this land for leadership that 
appeals to the noble in us rather than the greed in us 
i wish i had been able to tap that yearning more effectively 
but to the extent my supporters and i have been able to reach 
out and talk about programs and a vision of a better nation to 
that extent we have helped to make possible the building of a 
better nation 
for that i am grateful to far too many people to be 
acknowledged here but they include my wife jeanne a superb 
campaigner my daughter sheila and her husband perry knop who were 
married sept 12 and have since been honeymooning in places like 
audubon iowa and berlin nh and sturgeon bay wis and my 
son martin my traveling companion photographer and consultant 
no candidate could have stronger family support 
to the staff of my campaign who worked long hours for limited 
pay to our chairman chuck manatt and the countless volunteers 
more volunteers than any other campaign who are unbelievable in 
their efforts to those who raised money against great odds to a 
host of others i should be acknowledging my gratitude 
and to the people of illinois who have been both supportive and 
understanding my full efforts will now be devoted to being your 
senator and i shall be a better senator because of this rich 
experience 
the polish writer kazimierz brandys tells a story of two who 
were approached during a period of ferment in poland and asked to 
protest the illegal arrest and imprisonment of a leading 
intellectual 
one refused to sign and said i cant i have a son 
the other immediately took out his pen and said i have to 
sign because i have a son 
both acts are understandable 
but the legacy of honor that one leaves is vastly different than 
the other 
i entered this race beause i have a daughter and a son 
i entered this race because i have had the good fortune to 
understand the vast difference in the lives of millions of people 
action by government can make

school officials at hamilton high school in milwaukee wis who 
knew i helped create the law requiring that those with disabilities 
be given a chance by our public schools arranged for a chorus of 
retarded young people to sing for me 
they recited the preamble to the constitution in unison and 
then sang this is my country 
i glanced at the reporters covering the event and noted the 
moist eyes 
we all had them 
without that change in the law probably half of those young 
people would be in institutions today 
government is not the enemy 
government is simply a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely 
in passing that law we used it wisely compassionately 
to form a more perfect union these students recited from 
the constitution a goal partially achieved but in large measure 
still unattained 
we can do better my friends 
i entered this race because i want this generation to give the 
coming generations a sound economy not an uncontrollable debt 
i entered this race because i see a nation indifferent to the 
wasted lives of far too many children in schools where fear 
dominates rather than learning older citizens and their families 
financially devastated by longterm care needs hardworking 
farmers devastated by shortsighted government policies people 
eager to work who cannot find a job lose pride in themselves and 
their families and their nation and communities gripped by the 
terror of crime 
i entered this race because i know that the president of the 
united states can lead our nation and other nations away from the 
arms race 
the blight of the arms race and unemployment and crime and 
inadequate health care and educational shortcomings are not the 
results of god but the result of insensitive leadership chosen 
by a people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they 
might be 
i know we can do better 
you know we can do better 
i want leadership that will provide that 
after the last primary on june 7 i will meet with my delegates 
to determine what course should be followed 
in a year that has already seen many surprises no one knows 
what twists and turns may develop between now and then 
there will be many encounters with fate before the contest is 
ultimately decided in a wideopen convention 
for that reason while i am ceasing all campaigning i will make 
no decision formally withdrawing as a candidate until after june 7 
though i have no illusions that the nomination will come my way 
but i want my delegates to have a voice in this nations future 
we will weigh the options then 
i want to be in a position to do everything i can to help unify 
the party and ultimately the nation 
im grateful to those whove contributed to the nations 
dialogue who have withdrawn joe biden dick gephardt gary hart 
and bruce babbitt 
and im appreciative of the efforts already made and still to be 
made by jesse jackson mike dukakis and al gore 
all three have been working hard discussing and refining the 
issues sharpening our knowledge and challenging our conscience 
delegates to the convention probably will select one of these 
three who have come to know this nation well 
to those who have already asked the inevitable question will 
you run in 1992 i have two responses 
first i expect to campaign for a democratic president for 
reelection in 1992 
second running for president is a little like taking an 
icecold shower its a great onetime experience but i have no 
yearning for a repeat performance 
but we have a great nation and all of us working together can 
make it a better nation 
thank you

president reagan is pleased with 
news of an agreement that could lead to the beginning next month of 
a soviet army withdrawal from afghanistan white house chief of 
staff howard baker said today 
baker told reporters that reagan believes soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs agreement with afghan leaders clearing the way for 
settlement of the 10yearold afghan war is a step forward 
but baker also said reagan wants to see the fine print he 
wants to see the details of the arrangement he wants to know the 
reaction and the interpretation of the soviet union 
so the president is cautiously optimistic baker told 
reporters outside a seaside resort hotel here 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had said wednesday that 
planning for reagans summit in moscow with gorbachev is on 
track and wont be derailed by any continuing soviet military 
presence in afghanistan 
in a briefing that also touched on panama fitzwater said reagan 
will press the case for a pullout if soviet occupation forces 
are still in afghanistan when the summit begins may 29 
but in tashkent gorbachev and afghan leaders announced today 
that they had resolved problems blocking a settlement and the 
soviets offered to start pulling troops out of the country on may 
15 if agreement is reached in geneva on the terms for that 
withdrawal 
baker said today that weve got to examine that communique 
carefully weve had no direct communication i think from the 
soviets so far 
the chief of staff said the agreement may very well lead to a 
resolution of these issues and a pullout of soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
reagans national security adviser colin powell told reporters 
that it is a step forward and the soviets themselves say that 
they think conditions are present so that they could begin the 
pullout on the 15th of may and we hope that is the case 
but we have to see the final document and we have to have 
formal response from the soviets to our questions of last week 
powell said 
he said i think its important to reinforce our position that 
there has to be symmetry in the arrangements between us and the 
soviet union so that as long as they are able to continue 
providing military aid to the kabul regime we will retain the 
right to provide military aid to the afghan rebels 
asked wednesday whether a continuing soviet occupation of 
afghanistan could sabotage the summit fitzwater said that might 
be an even better reason to go 
the summit is on track and there are a number of issues the 
president will push while he is in the soviet union and if we 
dont have action to pull the troops out of afghanistan by the 
time we go i think that would probably move to the very top of 
the presidents agenda fitzwater said 
fitzwater had said wednesday that it is difficult to say whether 
soviet troops will be withdrawn by the time reagan visits moscow 
discussing us pressure to force panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega out of power fitzwater said another 800 us 
marines will be sent to the central american nation 
but fitzwater insisted that the movement of the marines from 
camp pendleton calif to a jungle training facility at fort 
sherman in panama has nothing to do with the increasing us 
military show of force there 
this unit training deployment has been scheduled since 
december he said these troops will be there for three weeks 
and theyll come out 
on other topics fitzwater cautioned against concluding that 
reagan plans to grant pardons to former white house aides john m 
poindexter and oliver l north who have been indicted in the 
irancontra case 
a congressman who attended a march 22 meeting quoted reagan as 
saying i like the sound of those words when someone in the 
meeting broached the possibility of pardons 
fitzwater acknowledged that the remark seemed to indicate that 
reagan favors pardons for his former top aides but he said i 
dont believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the 
basis of that throwaway comment

american authorities often aided by friendly 
foreign governments have had some successes lately luring or 
forcing criminal suspects out of safe havens abroad into the long 
arms of the law 
some people call it kidnapping but federal courts have 
generally approved the practice 
the latest dramatic case occurred this week when honduran police 
acting on information from us marshals arrested alleged 
international cocaine czar juan ramon matta ballesteros at his home 
in honduras and started him on a plane journey that ended in the 
federal penitentiary in marion ill 
matta who escaped from a us jail in 1971 and has been charged 
with subsequent drug offenses in the united states also was sought 
for questioning in the murder of a us narcotics agent 
honduran legislators citing a law against extradition of 
honduran citizens labeled the transfer a kidnapping but the us 
marshals service called it a major milestone in our worldwide 
assault on illegal drug trafficking 
the united states has extradition treaties with more than 100 
countries but each accord is different and some require long and 
often fruitless court proceedings that frustrate us law 
enforcement agents desire to get their hands on suspects 
getting other countries to help by using what are 
euphemistically called nondiplomatic means as in the matta 
case are common law enforcement authorities say though no 
statistics on such arrests are published 
police jokingly refer to these methods as mexican 
extraditions a reference to the longstanding mexican practice of 
shooing suspects wanted in the united states across the border 
where us police are waiting 
in the matta case two countries helped the hondurans put him 
on a plane to the dominican republic without a passport officials 
in that country expelled him by placing him aboard a flight bound 
for new york us marshals aboard the aircraft arrested him 
immediately 
last year carlos lehder a reputed drug kingpin from colombia 
was extradited to the united states at the request of the drug 
enforcement administration 
sometimes the united states captures people abroad without 
overt assistance from foreign nations 
last year according to the fbi undercover agents tracking 
fawaz younis a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of a jordanian 
aircraft tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the 
mediterranean sea and arrested him under a us law giving american 
courts jurisdiction to try suspected terrorists who act against 
us citizens younis is awaiting trial in washington 
in 1982 former cia agent edwin wilson who had fled to libya 
after being indicted on weapons sales charges was duped by an 
acquaintance into flying to the dominican republic 
authorities there put him on a nonstop flight to the united 
states where he was arrested 
timothy leary the drug culture guru who escaped in 1970 from a 
california jail was turned over to us narcotics agents in 
afghanistan even though the two countries had no extradition treaty 
defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases notably the 
wilson and younis cases have sought dismissal of charges on 
grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendants rights by in 
effect kidnapping them 
those requests however generally have been denied the courts 
have said the manner of a suspects arrest even an abduction is 
not relevant in assessing guilt or innocence 
the only exception based on a plea by a defendant brought back 
from uruguay in the 1960s would be a case in which the suspects 
treatment such as torture was so outrageous it shocked the 
conscience of the court even then a suspect would have to prove 
it was us authorities who committed the torture 
despite success in capturing such suspects as younis and wilson 
other big fish have eluded the us net 
since 1974 the united states has been trying to extradite 
fugitive financier robert l vesco to prosecute him on charges of 
looting 224 million from an international investors fund vesco 
first went to costa rica and the bahamas he has since emerged in 
cuba beyond the reach of american police 
the united states also tried for many months to arrange the 
arrest of abu abbas alleged mastermind of the 1985 hijacking of 
the italian cruise ship achille lauro during which new yorker leon 
klinghoffer was killed 
abbas was aboard an egyptian airliner forced down in sicily by 
us navy jets but italian authorities released him and he was 
later seen in several islamic countries

massachusetts gov michael dukakis said he talked 
thursday with new york gov mario cuomo whose elusive endorsement 
he described as relevant to new york primary voters despite 
cuomos opinion otherwise 
dukakis who has been courting a cuomo endorsement for months 
said his discussion with cuomo was a very pleasant conversation 
im sure we will be speaking frequently dukakis said 
asked if he felt a cuomo endorsement would still be helpful with 
less than two weeks to go before the new york primary dukakis 
said sure its relevant people in new york and across this 
country care very deeply about what gov cuomo thinks and what 
other governors think as i said the other day that is a decision 
that he has to make i respect it 
cuomo who appears to be leaning toward no endorsement said 
thursday his opinion means less and less as the primary approaches 
who cares what mario cuomo says he told reporters in 
albany 
dukakis said sen paul simons decision to put his presidential 
campaign on hold brings heightened attention to the trio of 
democratic hopefuls remaining 
as i said to somebody the other day dukakis said with a 
smile it suddenly struck me tuesday night that this was all 
getting kind of serious 
the governor told a statehouse news conference that simons 
decision thursday means that those of us who continue to be 
strong contenders are going to be looked at observed and listened 
to even more carefully and more intensively 
so its for me i think another step in the road and i hope 
a good step in the sense that ive got an opportunity now to take 
my case to the people of new york and ask them to make some choices 
among the three candidates that now remain 
asked about simons refusal to release his 170 delegates 
dukakis said it is his decision really as to what happens now 
with respect to his delegates obviously i want every delegate i 
can get

secretary of state george p shultz said 
thursday that king hussein of jordan is a possible partner for 
peace talks and that israel should take its cue from him 
shultz who is nearing the end of an arduous middle east peace 
shuttle returned from saudi arabia for more talks with the king 
and lauded husseins constructive approach to the us peace 
plan for the second day in a row 
indirectly applying pressure on israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir shultz said the message of that to israel is here is a 
possible arab partner in negotiations 
but shultz who returns home friday acknowledged it remains 
to be seen whether that can evolve into peace talks 
shamir remains opposed to an international peace conference 
which hussein has demanded as a precondition to negotiations 
shultz said he was able to put a little life into his peace 
plan since starting out in jerusalem but he said i dont want 
to exaggerate the progress that has been made 
the us initiative calls for negotiations in two stages the 
first would seek to establish some selfrule for palestinians who 
live in the israeli occupied west bank and gaza strip the second 
would deal with the settlement of the 40year arabisraeli conflict 
four months of antioccupation rioting in the occupied lands 
have left more than 140 palestinians and two israelis dead israel 
seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war 
shultz spoke to reporters in albareeda after an audience with 
saudi king fahd in a palace about 300 miles north of the capital 
riyadh 
he said the king encouraged him to pursue arabisraeli 
negotiations i found a great measure of support and 
encouragement shultz said 
on another subject shultz said the united states was nearing an 
agreement with the soviet union on afghanistan that would permit 
both sides to keep arming rival factions 
its an endgame situation shultz said but he declined to 
verify reports that a deal had already been struck we are in 
very active touch he said 
shultz said he took up with the saudis their purchase of 
ballistic missiles from china which has alarmed us officials as 
possibly sparking an escalation of missile arsenals throughout the 
region 
the rockets delivered surreptitiously can strike israel or 
iran and range even beyond 
another us official briefing reporters aboard shultzs flight 
to amman said the saudis gave assurances that the missiles were 
nonnuclear nontoday nontomorrow nonforever 
he declined to say whether the saudis gave the united states 
permission to inspect the sites another us official said israel 
gave washington assurances it would not launch a preemptive strike 
against the missiles 
the purchase angered a group of 30 senators who have threatened 
to try to block further arms sales to saudi arabia the reagan 
administration apparently intends to go ahead with its plan to 
provide new equipment for usbuilt awacs radar planes 
thats obviously got great value the us official said 
defending the deal 
in contrast to arabisraeli efforts shultz evidently has made 
headway with syria over a new constitution for lebanon 
he said he had quite constructive discussions with president 
hafez assad in damascus on tuesday the syrians evidently are 
prepared to help devise new constitutional guidelines that would 
rearrange the division of power among lebanons warring factions 
describing the plight of the country the us official 
traveling with shultz recalled that people said a year ago two 
years ago this is anarchy total anarchy two years later its 
worse 
shultzs kind words for hussein contrasted with his cool 
approach to shamir on wednesday he urged shamir to regard 
negotiations with his neighbors as the most fundamental element in 
israels security 
in an interview with israel television shultz lauded hussein as 
a man of peace and said the questions he posed about the us 
plan showed he was engaged in the us effort 
sizing up his fiveday visit shultz said i think its been 
worthwhile and weve made a little progress here and there but it 
comes very hard and slow and i dont want to exaggerate the 
progress that has been made but it is important to keep at it

a statue showing john f kennedy in midstride was 
unveiled thursday as the winner of a competition to select an 
official memorial to the late president in his home state 
his daughter caroline kennedy schlossberg unveiled a 
threefoot plaster model of the bronze planned for the front lawn 
of the statehouse 
the finished bronze sculpture that will be the states official 
memorial to kennedy is scheduled to be unveiled may 29 1989 which 
would have been his 72nd birthday 
it will stand a short distance from a statue of henry cabot 
lodge the republican whose son kennedy defeated in 1952 in the 
us senate campaign that launched his national career 
there are many memorials to my father in this country and 
around the world ms schlossberg said but of all of them 
this one in the state he loved means the most 
the winning design in a yearlong competition was executed by 
artist isabel mcilvain of concord it shows kennedy in what members 
of the selection commission called a classic pose midstride 
eyes forward elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit 
pocket 
gov michael s dukakis strode into the ceremony a few minutes 
late to speak about how kennedy inspired his own entrance into 
politics and ultimately his bid this year for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
echoing some of the things critics have said about himself 
dukakis said of kennedy people said he was too young he 
couldnt carry the south he had a religious burden 
longtime kennedy aide dave powers a member of the committee 
that selected the winning scupture told stories about the 1960 
kennedy campaign during which the massachusetts senator startled 
some visitors with his voice exercises designed to prevent him 
from losing his voice at a critical time 
powers said the sculpture reminded him of what eb white once 
wrote of kennedy he never feared the weather instead he 
challenged the wind to change its direction and to cause it to 
blow more kindly and more softly over the world and its people 
another commitee member paula kozol said she liked ms 
mcilvains design because theres steadiness a composure 
reflected there 
a fund drive to raise 150000 to build the eightfoot bronze 
statue began officially thursday when state senate president 
william bulger of boston gave the memorial organizers a check for 
1000 from his own campaign fund 
house speaker george keverian the original mover behind the 
kennedy memorial commission said he was proud that none of the 
money needed to execute the bronze would come from the public 
treasury 
bulger a frequent jokester added that with the states current 
tight fiscal situation and dukakis presidential aspirations the 
private fundraiser was a particularly good idea we want to keep 
the economic miracle alive in massachusetts at least until 
november bulger said 
for three months five small clay models of the proposed statues 
have been on display at the john f kennedy library in bostons 
dorchester section 
the other four finalists were by frederick hart of markham va 
penelope jencks of newton norman legassie of old lyme conn and 
robert white of new york each artist received 4000 to make the 
models 
mcilvain who attended the ceremony said she looked forward to 
executing the bronze im delighted to be doing this she said

iran said its warplanes sneaked through 
iraqi radar into baghdad on thursday and bombed a military base and 
oil refinery in the city killing or wounding dozens of iraqi 
soldiers 
it was the first reported bombing of the iraqi capital in three 
years iraq denied the city was hit but the ferocity of iraqi 
attacks later gave some credence to the iranian claims 
both sides bombarded each others cities and towns with missiles 
and reported scores of civilian casualties 
a un team arrived in baghdad from geneva to investigate iraqi 
allegations that iran used chemical weapons in a march 3031 battle 
in northeastern iraq iran accused iraq of using chemical weapons 
in the same battle 
in new york irans deputy foreign minister mohammed larijani 
met with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to discuss 
a ceasefire in the 7yearold war 
iran said squadrons of its fighterbombers dodged iraqs radar 
net and the heavy air defenses around baghdad just after 6 am and 
dropped bombs in two raids 10 minutes apart 
they were the first reported bombing raids on baghdad a city of 
5 million since march 1985 and came as iraq marked the 41st 
anniverary of the founding of its ruling baath socialist party 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said the air raids completely caught the enemy by 
surprise 
it said warplanes bombed the aldoura refinery and the khafaji 
military camp on baghdads southern outskirts killing or 
wounding dozens of soldiers and leaving their targets on fire 
iran said all its planes returned safely it did not say how 
many were involved in the raid 
the official iraqi news agency also monitored in nicosia 
quoted military communiques as saying only one iranian jet got 
through but was driven off by antiaircraft fire before it could 
drop any bombs 
it said the plane was later shot down by iraqi interceptors over 
western iran 
in one of their most widespread missile barrages the iraqis 
reported firing 11 longrange missiles four at tehran three at 
the central city of isfahan two at the industrial town of karaj 
northwest of the capital and one each at the holy city of qom and 
the northwestern city of tabriz 
it was the first time karaj had been hit by a missile since the 
war began in september 1980 
in retaliation the iranians said they fired two longrange 
missiles into baghdad and 13 shortrange projectiles into the ports 
of basra and umm qasr an iraqi naval base they also reported 
bombing basra and umm qasr and the northern iraqi city of erbil 
irna said iranian warplanes attacked iraqi troop concentrations 
in alamara north of basra and areas in the southern front 
the un talks between perez de cuellar and larijani were the 
fourth round since the un security council adopted a resolution 
july 20 calling for a ceasefire in the war 
the issue of chemical warfare dominated the talks 
larijani said the security council should condemn iraq for using 
chemical warfare and prevent this very criminal act 
the un team that arrived in baghdad visited tehran last week 
to investigate iranian allegations that iraq used chemical warfare 
and killed 5000 iraqi kurds in fighting last month 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in a letter 
delivered wednesday to perez de cuellar that another team of 
investigators should visit the village of halabja where the 
alleged chemical warfare occurred

new york gov mario cuomo refused again 
thursday to endorse any of the democratic candidates for president 
and implied that he might not back anyone until the primaries are 
over in june 
who cares what mario cuomo says the governor told 
reporters 
cuomo also said he had told candidate albert gore jr that his 
attacks on jesse jackson and massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
would be ineffective leading up to new yorks april 19 primary 
cuomo said he talked to gore thursday morning and told the 
senator that his criticism of jackson and dukakis wasnt helping 
him 
cuomo said his nomoreattacks message had also been passed 
along to the jackson and dukakis camps 
during a lengthy news conference cuomo again refused to endorse 
any of the democratic candidates and said every day this an 
endorsement means less because were getting closer to the 
primary 
many new york voters agree lee miringoff head of the marist 
college institute for public opinion said a new poll to be 
released friday found that more than 40 percent of likely new york 
democratic primary voters said it made no difference to them 
whether cuomo endorsed someone 
cuomo said he was thinking of not backing any of the candidates 
until the primary season ended june 7 as he has in the past cuomo 
said the candidate with a plurality at the end of the process 
should be the candidate of the party 
cuomo said party leaders should rally around the leader at that 
point and find enough votes to give him the nomination 
to help with that process it might be best to remain neutral 
through the primaries said cuomo 
youre already committed and for the rest of this thing youre 
committed he said of making an endorsement when they look at 
the whole scene at the end maybe at that point there should be 
some force 
cuomo again refused to rule out accepting a draft for the 
nomination himself if there was a deadlocked convention

new york ap us education secretary william bennett called on 
catholic schools thursday to enroll the worst 5 or 10 percent 
of public school students and ask state or local government to help 
pay for teaching them 
his proposal made in an address to the national catholic 
education associations 85th annual convention here was greeted 
warmly by catholic educators but was challenged as unconstitutional 
by several leading public education groups 
bennett dubbed his proposal project voluntas latin for good 
will 
parochial schools already have done an exemplary job teaching 
minority students who make up 22 percent of their 25 million 
total enrollment he told the gathering but he said catholic 
educators have not been effective in telling outsiders how much 
better theyve done with difficult students compared with many 
public schools 
the challenge is simple said bennett a parochial school 
product himself show educators around this country what works 
seek out the poor the disadvantaged the disruptive the 
dropout and take them in educate them and then ask society for 
fair recompense for your efforts bennett said 
he said catholic schools should ask state or local governments 
for half the price or twothirds of the price or something like 
that of whatever it would have cost to teach such students in 
public school 
governments would i believe be receptive to constitutionally 
sound efforts to pay for the education of such students 
but if government cant or wont bennett said business and 
others in the private sector would surely want to support such a 
worthwhile endeavor 
i think theres a good deal of possibility for it said the 
rev john pollard director of education for the archdiocese of 
chicago which enrolls 180000 kindergarten through 12thgrade 
students 
we do not subscribe to the absolute separation of church and 
state that others who oppose us do the socalled wall of 
separation is not in the us constitution he said 
but project voluntas was condemned by gary marx associate 
executive director of the american association of school 
administrators every thoughtful american should be appalled by 
the secretarys remarks he constantly hits people in the public 
schools below the belt and they are the ones who are working 
hardest to deal with the problems of atrisk youth 
thomas shannon executive director of the national school boards 
association called bennetts proposal a welcome challenge to 
catholic schools but questioned its constitutionality 
if the catholic schools are going to do what they are supposed 
to do that is teach catholic beliefs in an integrated way 
throughout the curriculum it would be unconstitutional on its 
face to support such schools with public funds shannon said 
bennetts proposal is the latest of several he has advanced 
largely unsuccessfully aimed at expanding educational options 
including the private school sector his ideas have included 
tuition tax credits and tuition vouchers that would offer tax 
breaks or direct assistance to parents of private school children 
but with prospects bleak for tax credits or vouchers bennett 
urged catholic schools to take the initiative and prove that they 
deserve community support 
roxanne bradshaw secretarytreasurer of the national education 
association the nations largest teacher union dismissed 
bennetts idea as a backdoor approach to finance private 
schools 
on the one hand hes saying that money is irrelevant to a 
quality education on the other hand hes saying the catholic 
schools need more money to educate atrisk children which is it 
secretary bennett does money matter or doesnt it she said 
but bennett said catholic schools have often done more with 
less 
citing studies by university of chicago sociologist james 
coleman bennett said the dropout rate among parochial high school 
sophomores nationwide is just 3 percent compared with 14 percent 
in public schools 
median tuition at catholic elementary schools is about 700 and 
1500 for high schools compared with an average of about 4500 a 
year to educate a child in public school said bennett 
still he said more than 4000 parochial schools have closed in 
the last 20 years and part of the blame is with catholic schools 
themselves for being reticent in proclaiming their excellence 
i believe that it is in your interest to take up this 
challenge bennett said it is also in societys interest 
catholic schools shouldnt be closing and disadvantaged children 
should be getting a good education

federal budget director james c miller iii 
pushed the idea of turning over the postal service to private 
companies thursday as about 100 picketing postal workers accused 
him of trying to destroy the us mail 
new postmaster general anthony m frank appearing at the same 
meeting opposed the privatization idea and called for greater 
discretion for the service to manage its finances and set rates 
picketers said they had no dispute with frank 
miller and frank appeared at a seminar sponsored by the cato 
institute a conservative policy research organization 
there is no good reason why the postal service should remain 
part of the us government and no good reason why it should enjoy 
a monopoly over the delivery of letter mail miller said 
he accused the service of wanting to be a governmentprotected 
monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it 
comes to federal subsidies and other benefits 
miller denied allegations from the postal unions and others that 
his office of management and budget has tried to intrude into 
management of the postal service which is an independent 
government agency 
he said his problem is not with the 800000 postal workers but 
with the system which he said is not working particularly well 
right now 
if given the opportunity to compete im sure the postal 
service including its employees would do very well indeed he 
said 
miller miller hes a jerk privatization just wont work 
chanted members of the american postal workers union who 
obstructed the front door of the hotel where the seminar was held 
until police arrived and ordered them to the sides 
moe biller president of the 365000member union called 
millers proposal cockeyed and said it would cause chaos with 
the mail and increase costs to the public 
no responsible businessman has advocated privatization 
biller said 
wearing a sign accusing miller of betraying postal reform 
biller stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes 
before the budget director arrived biller later followed miller 
into the hotel and shook his hand saying he wanted to debate him 
frank who took over the postal service march 1 said it should 
not be operated for profit 
it should be the most efficient reliable convenient public 
service in the country he said 
frank said he senses even among advocates of privatization a 
desire to effect only gradual changes 
i sense a desire to go slowly a recognition that the mail 
system like humpty dumpty once broken couldnt be put back 
together again he said 
he said that if privatization means eliminating the lettermail 
monopoly skimming off the profitable segments of the postal 
business or busting the postal unions he opposes it 
but the postmaster general said he was willing to explore the 
idea of privatization that would promote efficiency through more 
sharing of the workload with major mailers and more contracting of 
noncritical postal services

democratic national chairman paul g kirk jr 
on thursday added his voice to that of new york gov mario cuomo in 
suggesting that presidential hopeful albert gore jr tone down his 
negative campaigning 
kirk said that cuomos suggestions that the tennessee senator 
refrain from further attacks on jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
are helpful and are on course as far as im concerned 
the party chief also said sen paul simons decision to suspend 
campaigning made the remaining democratic contests all the more 
decisive 
the process is doing what it was designed to do narrow the 
field and pull from the field the strongest possible contender 
he told a news conference 
asked whether he thought gore would have to quit if he does 
poorly in the april 19 primary in new york kirk said he did not 
wish to prejudge the results 
on the subject of gores attacks on his rivals kirk said i 
spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep the 
debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any negative 
campaigning 
for the most part weve been quite successful in that regard 
the admonitions that have been addressed to sen gore by gov cuomo 
just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in 
a positive way 
on whether cuomo himself might become the nominee in a brokered 
convention kirk insisted the democratic nominee would be chosen 
from among the candidates now running 
there is a game going on on the field thats where the 
nominees going to be chosen from he said 
meanwhile kirk said that jackson would have significant 
representation on the partys platform committee regardless of 
who eventually becomes the nominee 
he disputed a reporters suggestion that jacksons influence 
might result in a more liberal platform than would otherwise be 
produced 
the fact that jesse jackson is running and doing well is an 
important constructive force within the democratic party and should 
not be looked upon as an overwhelming problem kirk said 
at the same time he appeared to temper slightly his earlier 
assertion that the partys 1988 platform be kept sparse and bland 
saying the party would not sound a retreat from issues it had 
championed in the past including the equal rights amendment and 
abortion rights 
asked specifically about abortion kirk said i think our 
party has always embraced the rights of privacy the rights of 
individual choice 
however kirk suggested that the platform would address these 
issues in a way that would not be divisive and which would give 
democratic candidates a document to run with and not shy away 
from 
although kirks suggestion last december that the party platform 
be kept vague won the support of other democratic leaders and the 
aflcio it was criticized by a variety of interest organizations 
michigan gov jim blanchard chairman of the platform committee 
said that state and regional hearings will be held on the platform 
in the coming months however blanchard said he would not permit 
the platform hearings to turn into an ideological battleground 
id like to think that someone will read it other than 
opponents i hate to work on something that will collect dust 
blanchard said

chinas population keeps growing but its 
rural population has shrunk dramatically since the early 1980s an 
agriculture department report showed thursday 
in 1982 when china reported a population of more than 101 
billion a record 8039 million or 79 percent lived in rural 
areas by 1985 the total population was more than 104 billion but 
rural residents were down to 6629 million people or 63 percent 
population figures and many others are included in a new edition 
of a usda publication agricultural statistics of the peoples 
republic of china 194986 by frederick w crook and others of 
the departments economic research service 
the new version expands greatly an earlier statistical report on 
chinas agriculture issued in 1984 which was the usdas first 
since the communists took charge in 1949 
although not likely to make this springs bestseller lists the 
158page report is expected to be in great demand from china 
watchers and us agricultural traders interested in that 
potentially huge asian market the first edition in 1984 was 71 
pages long 
the report relies on the important although still incomplete 
agricultural data that chinas state statistical bureau reported 
during 194985 with some updates through 1986 the authors said 
some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included 
along with an introduction explanatory notes references and 
suggested readings 
various sections include agricultural production inputs 
such as farm machinery fertilizer and labor exports and imports 
and consumption and procurement 
the provincial tables include chinas population by region and 
province agricultural areas by crops hog slaughter horse and 
camel yearend inventory milk production for cows and goats and 
consumption by peasants

the state department on thursday spurned a 
vietnamese officials invitation to the united states to send food 
aid to regions where villagers are being asked to search for the 
remains of american servicemen 
we are outraged at any suggestion of linking food assistance 
with the return of remains state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said as you know the united states does not provide aid 
to vietnam and does not plan to do so 
the spokeswoman said there was no official vietnamese request 
for food aid and that her response was based on news reports of 
comments in hanoi by foreign minister nguyen co thach after a visit 
by sen larry pressler rsd 
pressler a member of the foreign relations committee is 
exploring the possibility of assisting vietnam with the us food 
for peace program thach was quoted as saying the united states 
might consider offering food to areas of vietnam where rural people 
are asked to find us servicemens remains 
the reagan administration has ruled out us government 
assistance to vietnam as well as formal diplomatic relations as 
long as vietnamese troops remain in cambodia the administration 
has also accused hanoi of withholding information that could 
resolve what happened to at least some of the 1700 american 
servicemen still listed as missing in vietnam 
during an airport ceremony in hanoi on wednesday 27 bodies 
thought to be of missing americans were loaded aboard a us air 
force transport aircraft for a flight to hawaii where 
identification experts will try to identify the remains 
mrs oakley welcomed the vietnamese decision to turn over the 
remains but she declined to judge whether hanois action satisfied 
vietnams promise last year to do as much as possible to resolve 
the cases of missing servicemen 
the agreement was reached during a mission by retired gen john 
w vessey jr a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
under the agreement the united states promised to encourage 
private american organizations to provide relief services to 
vietnamese war victims the chief effort involves the supply of 
prosthetic devices to vietnamese who lost limbs during the war

scientists have confirmed the presence of 
an abnormal protein in normallooking brain cells in alzheimers 
disease patients adding evidence that it may be an early 
contributor to the disease 
further study may lead to a way of battling the memorydecaying 
condition before its effects are irreversible they said thursday 
you can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of 
intervening before there has been much irreversible damage 
antonio damasio head of the neurology department at the university 
of iowa said at a news conference 
there is no known treatment or cure for alzheimers disease 
which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million americans and is 
the single most common cause of mental decline in older people 
the results of damasios study done in collaboration with 
bradley hyman and gary w van hoesen of the university of iowa and 
brain chemists at the albert einstein college of medicine in new 
york city were to be published friday in annals of neurology the 
journal of the american neurological association 
alzheimers is centered in cells which transmit signals to and 
from the memory center in the brain damasio said 
he compared the diseases action to a computer with faulty input 
and output lines that limits the functioning of the computer 
while not doing too much damage to the computer itself damasio 
said 
the study done by autopsies on the brains of alzheimers 
patients shows that the disease is very specific in the brain 
cells it attacks damasio said 
the protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and 
named a68 by dr peter davies at albert einstein 
it looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey 
he said

under the threat of iraqi missiles and air 
raids iranians vote friday for a new parliament that will be a key 
factor in determining the course of the islamic revolution 
the election of a new 270seat majlis or parliament will be 
vital in determining who will hold power in iran after the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini dies he is 87 and reported in poor 
health 
the vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists 
who support an islamicstyle capitalism and radicals who favor a 
socialiststyle economy 
iranian leaders fear that iraq will blitz tehran and other major 
cities with a barrage of missiles to disrupt the elections and 
they have urged irans more than 20 million voters to turn out in a 
massive show of defiance 
the people will attend the election with gods help even if 
they are under missile attack i will vote under any 
circumstances khomeni said last week 
he added the people must beware and choose candidates among 
those loyal to islam they must choose their deputies from 
among those who have suffered from poverty and are real moslems 
not those who obey americas islam 
about 1400 candidates approved by provincial and city 
governors controlled by interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
will be running 
thas about 400 more than ran in the last election in 1984 
there will be 30 female candidates its the first time women have 
run for irans parliament 
it is the third parliamentary poll since khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution toppled the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
iranian leaders have said the election will be a crucial test 
for the islamic form of democracy and the campaigning has shown 
sharp differences between rival factions over the future course of 
domestic policy 
the 7yearold iraniraq war the countrys most pressing 
problem has not figured in the campaigning khomeini irans 
undisputed patriarch has decreed that the war will not end until 
his adversary iraqs president saddam hussein has been toppled 
the conservatives essentially identify with the religious 
fundamentalists who base their concept on a narrow interpretation 
of the teachings of the koran islams holy book which protects 
private property and free enterprise 
their protagonists seeking tighter state control are likely to 
garner widespread support from the increasingly discontented poor 
who have to cope with runaway inflation and a flourishing black 
market 
cigarettes cost 10 a pack red meat is about 16 a pound and 
eggs are 850 a dozen 
house speaker hashemi rafsanjani one of khomeinis closest 
aides and considered a pragmatist on most issues is expected to be 
reelected along with most of the leading figures in the hierachy 
but the hardliners such as prime minister hussein musavi are 
expected to make some gains a development that could have 
farreaching effects on the shape of the revolution in the 
postkhomeini era 
none of the candidates is running on party tickets the last 
formal party the islamic republic party which irans clerics used 
to gain power in the early days of the revolution was disbanded by 
khomeini last june because it was torn by factionalism 
the candidates will represent various shades of islamic and 
revolutionary thinking 
the results may not be known for 10 days and the new parliament 
may not sit until june while a new cabinet is screened and nominees 
scrutinized by the deputies

the constitutional council on thursday published 
its list of candidates for the april 24 presidential elections one 
woman and eight men including president francois mitterrand who 
leads all public opinion polls 
the nine candidates each fulfilled the requirement of obtaining 
the signatures of at least 500 elected officials and payment of a 
1750 fee 
french elections are run in two rounds if no candidate wins an 
absolute majority in the april 24 first round as expected a 
runoff will be held on may 8 
there is little doubt that the 71yearold mitterrand seeking a 
second sevenyear term will win the largest number of firstround 
votes polls show him with about 38 percent the real race is for 
the second runoff spot a battle between conservative premier 
jacques chirac and former centerright premier raymond barre 
polls indicate that mitterrand would easily defeat either 
chirac 55 or barre 63 in the second round many voters say 
however that they are undecided 
chirac who trailed barre in the early stages of the campaign 
since has overtaken him and now is shown in the polls winning about 
24 percent of the vote and barre about 15 percent 
farther back is jeanmarie le pen 59 leader of the extreme 
right national front with about 10 percent depending on the poll 
others in the race are andre lajoinie 58 official candidate of 
the communist party at about 6 percent and pierre juquin 58 a 
former communist party poliburo member now leading a splinter 
reform movement who has about 3 percent in the polls 
also on the list are the ecologist candidate antoine waechter 
39 with about 2 percent arlette laguiller 48 head of the 
trotskyist worker struggle movement 1 percent and pierre boussel 
67 leader of the new extreme left movement for a party of workers 
who hasnt turned up in any polls 
mitterrand was elected may 10 1981 defeating incumbent 
president valery giscard destaing 
mitterrands popularity which fell to as low as 27 percent at 
midterm has soared in the two years since he no longer has had 
direct control over the government 
the two leading conservatives chirac and barre have agreed not 
to attack one another so as not to split the right and to support 
the top conservative votegetter in the second round 
mitterrand who has abandoned most of his socialist rhetoric and 
taken pains to distance himself from the party he founded and led 
for many years has moved toward the center that has turned the 
campaign debate largely into a contest of personalities

a sixthgrader has done in a few 
months what critics say state leaders have been unable to do for 
years solve west virginias financial problems 
keeling fife jr did it as a school social studies project 
fife who became concerned last fall when he heard news stories 
about the states growing financial woes said his solution 
involves changing the gross state product by increasing the 
percentage of workers employed in industry 
his project won the wood county social studies fair and is 
entered in the may 20 state contest fife was last years state 
fair winner 
west virginia is in a desperate time and it will take 
patience and tough decisions to bring the state back to prosperous 
times the 11yearold said 
he suggests building hydroelectric dams training workers in 
hightechnology fields and lowering the costs of natural resources 
for instate users 
by 1990 fife said the northeastern united states wont have 
enough electric power and hydroelectric plants on west virginias 
rivers easily could generate power and help the state 
west virginia also needs technically literate workers to attract 
industries to the state he said 
included in fifes research along with newspaper accounts of 
the states indebtedness and legislative performance are responses 
from area legislators and an interview with state auditor glen

legislator he says he prefers collecting baseball cards playing 
baseball and taking piano lessons 
he doesnt limit his problemsolving to social issues he also

amendments which barred us aid to the contras in nicaragua is 
retiring after 36 years in congress 
ive decided to call it a day the 76yearold democrat said 
thursday at a news conference attended by several dozen of the kids 
from his sandlot baseball league now retired judges mayors 
district attorneys and city and county officials who helped 
launch his political career 54 years ago 
the parades are all over the giveandtake of the campaign 
trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls 
on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling 
experience said boland 
he had never lost an election since gaining the state house of 
representatives at age 22 
boland was chairman of the house intelligence committee from 
1977 to 1985 he was a member of the irancontra committee whose 
hearings produced some of the longest days and in some ways some 
of the most unpleasant of my life 
the reagan administrations frustration with the boland 
amendments inspired the diversion of profits from arms sales to 
support the contras that operation became a focus of the 
irancontra investigation and the recent indictment of former 
marine lt col oliver north and others 
boland came to washington with the man who would later become 
the speaker of the house thomas p tip oneill in 1952 for 
more than 20 years the two friends roomed together in an 
arrangement they described as a reallife odd couple with 
boland the neat and tidy half of the pair 
boland did not endorse a potential successor springfield mayor 
richard neal former mayor theodore dimauro state rep kenneth m 
lemanski of chicopee and state sen robert wetmore of barre have 
all indicated an interest in the democratic nomination

world demand for highprotein oilrich 
soybeans has led other producing countries into a fierce 
competition with american farmers an agriculture department report 
said thursday 
soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of lowincome 
people in the third world where it will be important to gain 
consumer acceptance for soybeans and soyfortified foods said gary 
vocke an agriculture and trade analyst in the departments 
economic research service 
a historical view shows that us dominance of world soybean 
trade founded on us research and development in the 1940s and 
1950s declined in the 1980s as south american countries spurred 
by high prices developed largescale production and processing 
facilities he said 
brazil and argentina have been the main us competitors in the 
international soybean market 
vocke added their success mainly in temperate areas has not 
been duplicated in tropical areas elsewhere in the third world 
the major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in 
the third world are rising incomes and population growth vocke 
said as families have more to spend their demand increases for 
meat and other food products such as margarine and cooking oil 
fierce export competition with the south americans for these 
markets as well as the developed country market will likely 
continue vocke said the expansion of largescale soybean 
production in south america will continue as long as soybean prices 
are high enough for brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands 
for soybeans 
further encouragement would be in the brazilian governments 
willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting 
the new lands to ocean ports he said 
if the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops 
farmers in brazil argentina and elsewhere will find it profitable 
to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans vocke 
said

pat robertson is pursuing delegates to 
the republican national convention even though he has given up a 
serious contest for the gop presidential nomination robertson 
campaign officials said thursday 
robertson has decided not to campaign in the new york primary 
dismissed his secret service protection this week and has scaled 
back his public appearances said barbara gattullo a spokeswoman 
for americans for robertson 
we did not mean to set off any alarm bells by this she said 
she later said we are going to the convention whether we add 
delegates or not 
the secret service agents are no longer needed because we are 
traveling about two to three days a week instead of the seven days 
a week we were prior to super tuesday she said 
since his poor showing in the march 8 primaries robertson has 
cut his staff from 200 to about 50 reduced his campaigning to 
those states that choose delegates by caucus rather than primary 
and turned his attention from 1988 to 1992 
ms gattullo said robertson had two rallies scheduled in 
virginia thursday night and friday and would fly to georgia on 
saturday for campaign stops over the weekend she said he would 
also make campaign appearances in california and ohio 
we are absolutely in this through the convention she said 
robertson has estimated he will go to the new orleans convention 
in august with 150 delegates so far he has 17 
since his campaign was derailed during the early march 
primaries when he failed to win any state including his native 
virginia robertson has shifted his emphasis from an attempt to 
broaden his base of support beyond the religious right to targeting 
delegates chosen by caucus 
with those delegates he said he will be able to bring a 
strong conservative message to the convention that message 
would include the adoption of a national platform that supports 
prayer in school the strengthening of the american family and 
opposition to abortion

genetic tests have failed to determine 
whether gary dotson committed a rape that his accuser now maintains 
never happened gov james r thompson said thursday 
the test conducted on semen on underwear belonging to cathleen 
crowell webb may mark the end of attempts to prove whether dotson 
actually committed rape in 1977 thompson said 
at some point the integrity of the judicial system demands 
that the proceedings come to an end and this may be the end 
thompson said 
dotson 30 now being held for parole violation had served six 
years of a 25 to 50year prison term when thompson commuted the 
sentence in 1985 following mrs webbs recantation to time served 
thompson said he was not convinced that dotson was innocent and 
dotsons attorney requested that the dna test be conducted on a 
pair of semenstained underwear mrs webb was wearing when she was 
assaulted 
thompson said thursday that tests at the university of leicester 
in great britain failed to shed new light on the case 
dr alec jeffreys who conducted the tests said semen that 
stained a pair of underwear worn by mrs webb was too degraded 
for analysis to determine whether it was dotsons 
jeffreys said another type of test might be effective but 
thompson said he was not sure of the credibility of that test and 
suggested that he was ready to close the books on the case 
dotsons attorney thomas breen of chicago declined to comment 
on the governors statements 
the test used by jeffreys analyzes genetic material unique to 
each person in the dotson case he sought to compare dna from the 
semen on the underwear to genetic material in a sample provided by 
dotson 
jeffreys said he believed the dna samples recovered from the 
panties had degenerated largely because the evidence was stored at 
room temperature from 1977 to 1985 he noted that the dna test 
became available only recently 
during televised hearings before the illinois prisoner review 
board in 1985 mrs webb now of new hampshire recanted her 
earlier testimony that dotson had raped her 
he is being held at the joliet correctional center on a parole 
violation after being arrested dec 26 and accused of shoving a 
cook and stabbing her in the hand during a quarrel in a bar 
in february the state prisoner review board ordered dotson 
imprisoned until aug 16 when he could be paroled if he undergoes 
alcoholism treatment and complies with other conditions set by the 
board 
under the goodbehavior terms of the commutation dotson also 
could be forced to serve out the sentence imposed in the rape case

eighteen black students were cited for 
trespassing and released after an allday sitin to protest alleged 
racism at the university of californiaberkeley 
the peaceful protest by about 50 members of the african students 
association ended wednesday when campus police cited 18 students 
who refused to leave the campus housing office at the close of the 
work day 
this protest is the culmination of a lot of different things 
that have gone unresolved at the university said asa president 
michael stoll 
the protest focused on charges by freshman traci morris who 
claims shes been harassed by three white male dormmates who 
allegedly damaged her bicycle morris also said she had suffered a 
year of racial slurs and jokes 
they say things like only 27 percent of you pass anyway why 
study morris said referring to a 1987 study which indicated 
that 27 percent of black students at the university graduate 
the protesters demanded the three men be expelled and that 
morris be refunded her housing expenses for the school year 
university spokesman ray colvig said the white students will be 
disciplined 
the office of student conduct did a rapid and thorough 
investigation and has drawn up a proposed settlement he said 
the agreement involves payment by the men for the damage to the 
bicycle moving the students to other dorms and requiring them to 
perform some community service 
i dont know about anything else all i did was hang her bike 
in the shower because shes my friend said tony sanchez 
identified as one of the students he called the incident a 
practical joke 
freshman jeffrey wisher also named by the asa admitted he hung 
morris bike in the shower a second time but it was only the 
bike it has nothing to do with racism he said

the federal communications commission on 
thursday dismissed five indecency complaints including one against 
a television station that aired a sexeducation program for 
teenagers and another against a radio station that apparantly 
aired a reading of james joyces ulysses 
in four of the cases the fcc said the material involved did not 
violate the agencys decency standards it said thre fifth case did 
not contain sufficient information to determine the context of the 
material aired 
a complaint filed against kingtv seattle cited a program 
called teen sex what about the kids which included what the 
fcc described as frank discussions of sexual topics the use of 
sex organ models and the simulated demonstration of various birth 
control devices 
in a letter to the seattle couple who complained the fcc said 
that while the program contained references to sexual and excretory 
organs and activities the references in context were not 
vulgar lewd or shocking nor were they made in a pandering 
or titillating manner 
the fcc judges material to be indecent if it depicts or 
describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory 
organs or activities the agency also says it will examine the 
context of the material 
the fcc has said indecent material may be broadcast between 
midnight and 6 am because there is little risk children would be 
in the audience then 
obscene material however cannot be aired at any time such 
material is defined as appealing to the prurient interest and 
lacking serious artistic literary political or scientific value 
broadcasters are challenging the fccs yearold decency 
standards in court charging the guidelines are vague they say the 
commission has refused to identify specific material that would be 
deemed indecent under the standards 
the fcc has said broadcasters should be guided by the decisions 
the agency makes in the cases that come before it 
a complaint against wbaifm a pacifica foundation station in 
new york city described portions of an unidentified program that 
the fcc said appeared to be a reading from the penelope chapter 
of ulysses 
assuming the program was a reading from the classic work the 
fcc said we would not expect that the commission would find such 
sexual and excretory references dispersed as they would have 
been throughout the threehour reading of this work of literature 
to be patently offensive 
another complaint the fcc dismissed had been filed by the mayor 
of north charleston sc john e bourne jr against wtmaam 
charleston sc for airing a political advertisement opposing his 
proposal to put a clock on the city hall toward the end of the ad 
someone shouts clocksucker 
the fcc also found the song i want to kiss her but 
aired by wtrgfm rocky mount nc was not indecent despite its 
use of double entendre 
the lyrics at issue here are not such that they are capable of 
only one sexual meaning rather the lyrics are capable of two 
meanings one innocent one sexual the fcc said 
the commission ruled last april in a case involving new york 
disc jockey howard stern that double entendre and innuendo could be 
deemed indecent when they were mingled with explicit references 
that made the material capable of only a sexually explicit meaning 
the public broadcasting services series heimat about the 
life of three german families from the end of world war i to the 
1960s was the target of another complaint because of scenes 
containing sexual activity 
the fcc said the complaint filed against wcettv cincinnati 
did not contain sufficient information to determine the context of 
the material 
ron wilson a wcet executive said the series that aired on 
about 70 pbs stations last october and november contained some 
nudity but he said it was relevant to the story line and the 
characters 
without those scenes a large part of the content would not 
have made sense he said

the world changed for the marukis when they left 
their small plot of land near tokyo for hiroshima three days after 
it was destroyed by an atomic bomb 
for millions born after 1945 the devastation of hiroshima is 
history for iri and toshi maruki it was a revelation that led to 
the creation of murals depcting the horrors of war 
the two are subjects of the film hellfire a journey from 
hiroshima produced by filmmaker john junkerman and nominated for 
a 1988 academy award as best documentary feature 
maruki born in hiroshima 86 years ago and his wife 76 went 
to hiroshima on aug 9 1945 the same day an atomic bomb was 
dropped on nagasaki to check on family members 
he had lost his father uncle two nieces and numerous friends 
in the inferno which killed an estimated 130000 people 
both say the death and destruction left by the bomb remains a 
living memory 
how can we forget maruki said the horror is always in 
our mind the stench of death was in our nostrils for three or four 
weeks 
he and mrs maruki were interviewed thursday at the 
massachusetts college of art which is displaying some of their 
works powerful ink canvases including some of the hiroshima 
panels auschwitz and the battle of okinawa the two are 
scheduled to receive honorary doctorates from the college 
titled surviving visions it is the first maruki exhibition 
in the united states since 1970 
the artists who spent a month in the devastated city describe 
this work as a procession of ghosts with hands held before them 
who pushed on dragging their burned bodies falling and 
piling into one another groaning and dying 
one lone child slept innocently with unburned skin they 
write in a an exhibit catalog perhaps it survived sheltered by 
its mothers breast 
one of the hiroshima panels ghosts completed in 1950 
depicts some of the dead and dying naked their bodies charred 
their faces anguished 
death of american prisoners of war is a 1971 canvas 
depicting a tragedy that was taboo in japan for decades the 
massacre of 23 us pows by enraged survivors of the bombing 
we trembled as we painted the death of the american prisoners 
of war mrs maruki wrote 
the victims manacled corpses are intertwined with erotic nude 
figures of their wives and lovers back home a dark menacing mass 
of enraged japanese crowds the periphery of the drawings 
auschwitz resulted from a trip to the former death camp in 
poland where 3 million jews and other inmates were gassed or 
starved to death by the nazis completed in 1977 the works eight 
somber panels pay tribute to holocaust victims and survivors 
the marukis said their art educates generations born too late to 
experience the horrors of world war ii 
the kids dont know because theyre not taught in school 
said mrs maruki suggesting that japan still was reluctant to come 
to grips with a painful period in its history i suspect that the 
ministry of education is somehow maneuvering not to teach this 
modern history to children

scientists have confirmed the presence of 
an abnormal protein in normallooking brain cells in alzheimers 
disease patients adding evidence that it may be an early 
contributor to the disease 
further study may lead to a way of battling the memorydecaying 
condition before its effects are irreversible they said thursday 
you can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of 
intervening before there has been much irreversible damage 
antonio damasio head of the neurology department at the university 
of iowa said at a news conference 
there is no known treatment or cure for alzheimers disease 
which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million americans and is 
the single most common cause of mental decline in older people 
the results of damasios study done in collaboration with 
bradley hyman and gary w van hoesen of the university of iowa and 
brain chemists at the albert einstein college of medicine in new 
york city were to be published friday in annals of neurology the 
journal of the american neurological association 
alzheimers is centered in cells which transmit signals to and 
from the memory center in the brain damasio said 
he compared the diseases action to a computer with faulty input 
and output lines that limits the functioning of the computer 
while not doing too much damage to the computer itself damasio 
said 
the study done by autopsies on the brains of alzheimers 
patients shows that the disease is very specific in the brain 
cells it attacks damasio said 
the protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and 
named a68 by dr peter davies at albert einstein 
it looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey 
he said

nine states and four environmental groups 
renewed their attempt thursday to persuade the environmental 
protection agency to order reductions in emissions of the 
pollutants that cause acid rain 
the states asked epa to publish for public comment two 
procedural findings made by the agency under president carter just 
before he left office that acid rain originating in us pollution 
endangers the environment in canada and that canada grants the 
united states the same rights to protest air pollution there that 
canada has to protest air pollution here 
the canadian province of ontario filed a similar petition of its 
own said jim hecker a washington lawyer representing the province 
those findings must be made before epa could order the states to 
require reductions in the precursors of acid rain thenepa 
administrator douglas costle announced those decisions in early 
1981 
in a case brought by eight of the states and ontario a federal 
appeals court said the findings to be valid as a starting point 
for further action had to be published as draft agency regulations 
to give the public a chance to comment on them the supreme court 
declined to intervene 
in asking for quick action within 60 days on the grounds 
that the substance of the question had been decided for years and 
indeed affirmed in statements by various officials including 
president reagan the states said these elementary decisions do 
not involve identification of sources or responsible states or the 
prescription of emission reductions or other remedial actions 
in the reagan administration epa has resisted doing anything 
about costles letter on the grounds that not enough was known 
about acid rain to tell the states what to do or even specify 
which states should be targeted the administration has agreed with 
canada to spend 25 billion matched by industry to speed the 
commercialization of cleaner methods of burning coal 
in earlier proceedings the plaintiffs said epa should order 
emission reductions in michigan ohio indiana kentucky 
tennessee west virginia and illinois 
acid rain results from the conversion of oxides of sulfur and 
nitrogen emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels into sulfuric 
and nitric acids in the atmosphere though there are many 
contributors sulfur dioxide emitted by coalburning power plants 
and factories is major source of the acid precursors 
many environmentalists blame acid rain for acidifying lakes and 
streams in the northeast and in eastern canada to the point that 
fish cannot live 
in a parallel case many of the same states are trying to force 
epa to order other states upwind of them to require emissions 
reductions from sources within their borders to enable the downwind 
states to fulfill their own air pollution control plans that case 
will be argued for the second time later this month before the us 
circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
thursdays petitioners were maine vermont new hampshire 
massachusetts connecticut rhode island new york new jersey 
minnesota the natural resources defense council the sierra club 
the izaak walton league and the national audubon society

federal agencies involved in housing 
hamstrung by a lack of congressional guidance are doing little or 
nothing about the threat from cancercausing radon the general 
accounting office said thursday 
although environmental officials say radon causes up to 20000 
cancer deaths a year the housing agencies see little 
responsibility to respond the gao an investigative arm of 
congress said in a report 
the report scrutinized the department of housing and urban 
development the veterans administration the farmers home 
administration and the national park service 
sen frank lautenberg dnj who requested and released the 
yearlong gao study called its results disturbing 
while millions of americans are at risk federal bureaucrats 
sit on their hands said lautenberg who chairs the senates 
environmental oversight subcommittee 
radon is a naturally occurring odorless and colorless gas the 
environmental protection agency says radon may cause from 5000 to 
20000 lungcancer deaths annually 
a byproduct of decaying underground uranium radon rises from 
the ground and can seep into buildings trapped indoors the gas 
poses health threats that can far surpass heavy smoking or 
inordinate exposure to xrays 
the gao noted that epa was assigned by congress to lead the 
attack on radon so far it said much work remains on epas 
acceptable but slowmoving strategy 
lautenberg asked the gao to evaluate the radon response by 
federal agencies who administer housing or subsidize home ownership 
investigators found an overall lack of response ranging from 
responding to a few sitespecific problems to not being involved 
with indoor radon at all the report said 
officials of the housing agencies are largely unaware of radon 
problems and are uncertain whether they have any legal 
responsibility it said courts appear unlikely to hold federal 
agencies liable in cases arising from radon it added 
the report said that while epas radon mandate is clear 
congress has said nothing to hud the va or fmha in addition it 
said the agencies are further confused by the lack of an epa 
standard for how much radon is too much 
gao said the hud secretary and epa administrator should meet to 
define their respective responsibilities and planned actions 
congress meanwhile could consider specifying how it wants other 
agencies to deal with radon it said 
the reports poorest grades went to hud which administers the 
home mortgage insurance program and subsidies for public and indian 
housing it said hud has reacted to radon hazards in a limited 
piecemeal manner 
department spokesman bill glavin said hud has no overall radon 
policy but has reacted to specific cases of suspected pollution 
the va which administers a guaranteed and insured loan program 
for veterans buying homes has no radon policy and essentially is 
not involved with the issue the gao said 
va spokesman bonner day said the agency in backing mortgage 
loans generally defers to state law on housing construction and 
safety standards 
the gaos highest grades went to the fmha which lends mortgage 
money in rural areas according to the report fmha has trained its 
field workers in radon measurement and mitigation and is at work 
on an overall policy 
fmha spokesman ron ence said weve been on top of this for 
several years 
only the park serice which operates housing for visitors and 
staff has pursued comprehensive radon testing at those dwellings 
and its administrative buildings the gao found

jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists 
thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal 
government and to kill a federal judge and fbi agent 
the allwhite jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of 
deliberations a day after us district judge morris arnold 
refused to accept the panels statement that it was deadlocked on

president reagans top aides voiced 
concern thursday about the safety of deposed panamanian president 
eric arturo delvalle and stressed that the united states recognizes 
him as the central american countrys rightful leader 
white house chief of staff howard baker and national security 
adviser colin powell said the united states continues to maintain 
contact with delvalle in the wake of the arrest warrant issued 
against him in panama 
delvalle as far as the government of the united states is 
concerned is the lawful president of that country baker told 
reporters and well be greatly concerned if general manuel 
antonio noriega were to attack the vested authority of panama and 
we will watch that very carefully 
baker and powell staying at an oceanside hotel not far from the 
mountaintop ranch where president reagan is vacationing said they 
were still checking out some aspects of the move by noriega to have 
delvalle arrested 
delvalle has been in hiding since feb 26 when he was toppled 
from power following a failed attempt to fire noriega as chief of 
the panamanian defense forces 
baker and powell who were traveling to rancho del cielo later 
thursday to brief reagan on panama afghanistan and other issues 
said they put no stock in reports that delvalle frustrated over 
noriegas continued grip on power was considering giving up his 
quest to reassume power 
ive had no indication of that baker said and powell said 
no in fact his representatives have said that is not the case 
he is still very much the president of panama we recognize him as 
such we know of no plans on his part 
delvalles wife mariela delvalle had said wednesday that her 
husband received assurances from the united states of new steps to 
dislodge noriega 
asked about that thursday powell replied im not going to 
describe what options we may have under consideration or what our 
conversations have been with president delvalle 
baker said were fully prepared to deal with contingencies 
but he did not elaborate 
asked whether he thought delvalle was in an increasingly 
perilous position because of the warrant powell said i dont 
believe that is the case but of course we are in touch with him 
and we are concerned about his security and we will be in touch 
with him make sure he is satisfied with his security 
powell also said we have channels open to noriega but said 
that im not going into any detail as to what those channels are 
or what might be passing through them 
panamanian government prosecutor alvoro visuetti announced on 
television wednesday night that arrest warrants had been issued 
against delvalle gabriel lewis galino a former panamanian 
ambassador to the united states and juan b sosa delvalles 
ambassador to washington who remains in the us capital 
the warrant against delvalle accuses the deposed president of 
crimes against the state and the nations economic security 
powell would neither confirm nor deny thursday a report in the 
los angeles times saying that an interagency task force has 
recommended that reagan invoke the international emergency economic 
powers act ieepa to stop payments by us businesses and 
individuals to panama or any of its governmental agencies 
powell in response to questions said he did not rule out the 
possibility that reagan would invoke the seldomused law 
authorizing the us government to seize tax payments and other 
monies 
i said we had ieepa under consideration and we had not made a 
decision on that 
the united states has slapped a variety of economic sanctions on 
panama already including the freezing of its assets in the united 
states and the withholding of payments to the panama canal 
commission 
but administration officials have been showing growing 
impatience with the fact noriega remains despite the economic 
political and military pressure brought against him

sandinista and contra military 
delegations on thursday discussed technical details of providing 
humanitarian aid to the rebels and controlling zones where the 
insurgents are to gather during a ceasefire 
a spokeswoman for the contra umbrella organization the 
nicaraguan resistance said thursday the rebels were refusing to 
discuss giving up their arms 
the talks were at the southern border town of sapoa where the 
two sides reached a ceasefire accord on march 23 that agreement 
requires them to reach a permanent truce to end the nearly 
7yearold war that the leftist government says has claimed more 
than 26000 lives 
the two delegations decided wednesday on the number and location 
of the zones where the rebels will gather during the 60day 
ceasefire it went into effect last friday although all the 
details were not worked out 
president daniel ortega warned wednesday that the sandinistas 
would launch an offensive against the contras if they fail to 
comply with the march 23 accord 
under that agreement the rebels said they would gather in the 
ceasefire zones while their leaders negotiated a more permanent 
truce in exchange the sandinistas have pledged to carry out 
democratic reforms 
but the sapoa talks have been marked by mutual distrust and 
differing interpretations of the vaguely worded plan 
still unresolved were pledges of security for the contras inside 
the ceasefire zones how they would receive food and other 
supplies who would control the areas and how compliance would be 
verified 
marta sacasa a spokeswoman for the nicaraguan resistance said 
the rebels at the sapoa talks were refusing to discuss the delicate 
issue of the contras laying down their weapons 
the march 23 accord does not mention disarming something the 
contras vow they will never do ms sacasa said in a telephone 
interview thursday from miami 
the sandinistas claim that surrendering of weapons is implicit 
in the agreement and essential for peace 
meanwhile progovernment newspapers thursday described as 
false a document circulating in the capital said to be from the 
ruling sandinista national liberation front 
the document marked secret appears to have been written 
earlier this year and outlines party strategy 
according to the document sandinista troops should stage an 
offensive along the honduran border to rid the area of contras and 
their supply bases 
such an offensive it argues would oblige honduras to accept 
the presence of united nations peacekeeping troops in the border 
area 
the incursions by our troops into honduras in pursuit of the 
mercenaries will surely provoke imperialist reactions which we 
have to watch but not fear the document said 
the sandinistas did carry out an offensive against the contras 
in the northern border area in march 
president jose azcona hoyo of honduras charged that sandinista 
forces had entered his countrys territory while chasing the 
rebels president reagan responded by sending 3200 us troops to 
honduras for two weeks of exercises ortega denied his troops had 
entered the neighboring country 
the document also noted house speaker jim wrights opposition to 
the reagan administrations policies towards nicaragua 
it called wright dtexas the head of a parallel power that 
has enabled us to tie the hands of the reagan administration 
ortega said thursday his government sent a letter of protest to 
the organization of american states denouncing a reported offer by 
honduras to allow contra supplies from the united states to arrive 
there 
speaking in a radio interview ortega said honduras made itself 
an instrument of american policies by acting as an illegal 
springboard for supplies for the mercenary forces

white house chief of staff howard 
baker on thursday defended the propriety of president reagans 
secret leasing arrangement for a 25 million estate and said the 
first family may not like all the publicity about the deal 
the white house refuses to say how much reagan and his wife 
nancy are paying for the threebedroom six bath home in the 
exclusive bel air section of los angeles that has a heated swimming 
pool and threecar garage 
real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at 12000 to 
15000 based on fairmarket value 
moreover it is unclear why the reagans are leasing the home 
instead of buying it outright also unknown are the identities of 
the 1820 people who formed a consortium specifically to buy it for 
the reagans 
the reagans are planning to move into the home at 668 st cloud 
road after he leaves office next jan 20 
the 1acre property in the poshest area of bel air touches 
the kirkeby estate where the beverly hillbillies television 
series was filmed and is located near the homes of elizabeth 
taylor zsa zsa gabor and other celebrities as well as some of the 
reagans closest friends 
baker rejected the notion that there was any impropriety in the 
deal 
responding to reporters questions at the seaside hotel where he 
is staying during reagans vacation baker said the white house 
the president and the first lady went to great lengths to make sure 
that this was an armslength transaction that there was a full 
appraisal of the rental price of this property and that all of the 
is were dotted and the ts were crossed 
baker said the president and the first lady have handled this 
in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism 
of the transaction 
asked if the reagans were upset by publicity about the house he 
said oh i dont think so i think after eight years theyve 
come to understand that that occurs and while they understand it 
they may not like it but they are not angry about it 
a white house statement released wednesday said the reagans 
threeyear lease took effect march 1 and contained an option to 
renew or purchase no purchase price was specified in the lease 
the white house said 
before buying the property the prospective owners sought an 
opinion from the office of government ethics on the propriety of 
leasing or selling the property to the reagans 
the opinion said the reagans would comply with standards of 
conduct regulations and conflictofinterest statutes if they paid 
a fairmarket rental or purchase price for the house the white 
house said 
it said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of 
the owners and the reagans based on fairmarket value rental 
estimates from two independent appraisers 
in washington donald campbell deputy director of the office of 
government ethics confirmed that lawyers representing the 
consortium approached the agency in july 1986 and we did make an 
analysis of it and provide an informal opinion letter 
eighteen people were listed in the consortium all but one 
described by the lawyers as friends of the reagans for a number of 
years campbell said 
presidents are not required to adhere to the standards or to 
federal conflictofinterest criminal laws but traditionally have 
committed themselves to doing so 
the property was purchased in august 1986 by the consortium 
which has incorporated itself as wall management services inc 
realtor jeff hyland of the los angeles firm of alvarez hyland amp 
young said that with rising prices since the purchase the land 
alone now is worth 3 million 
they got a great buy he said the bought it for land 
value as far as im concerned they got the house for free 
realtor john aaroe of the jon douglas co said the house built 
in 1954 still has the original kitchen and bathrooms and needs 
updating and renovations

illinois sen paul simon suspended his stalled 
presidential campaign thursday but held onto his 170 delegates in 
hopes of influencing the choice of a nominee at the democratic 
national convention in july jesse jackson immediately blasted 
simon for keeping the delegates saying many of them were 
rightfully his 
in a year that has already seen many surprises no one knows 
what twists and turns may develop between now and then simon 
told a news conference there will be many encounters with fate 
before the contest is ultimately decided in a wideopen 
convention 
in a quasiwithdrawal simon said he would no longer actively 
campaign for the nomination but said he technically would remain a 
candidate even though he conceded he has no illusions that the 
nomination will come my way 
i want to have an impact on who the party nominates simon 
said i want to have an impact on the whole process there at the 
atlanta convention and on where we go 
jackson however said simons move was a lessthanhonorable 
one and that he ought to release his delegates 
if one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of 
honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that 
state will get those delegates thats what mr gephardt did it 
was the honorable and the fair thing to do jackson said in new 
york 
rep richard gephardt dropped out of the democratic race last 
month 
i would hope that in time mr simon likewise now that he has 
made the decision to leave the race will leave so honorably and 
hide behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which 
in fact belong to me jackson said 
simons decision to nominally remain a candidate and retain his 
delegates means he holds onto 47 atlarge delegates won in the 
illinois primary had he formally withdrawn from the race those 
delegates would have gone automatically to jackson who finished 
second in illinois 
asked whether his move could be seen as an effort to deprive 
jackson of support simon said i am sure it is not perceived by 
jesse jackson as a stopjackson effort he said he had spoken to 
jackson and the other two remaining democratic candidates 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and sen albert gore jr about 
his plans 
simon said he would keep a lock on the 170 delegates he has won 
and an aide said he hoped to perhaps attract a few more by the time 
the partys last primaries end on june 7 at that point simon 
said he will meet with the delegates and decide what to do next 
i owe something to those delegates he said a total of 
2082 delegates is needed to nominate a candidate 
simon showed early strength in the democratic campaign 
finishing a close second in iowas firstinthenation caucuses 
but he dropped to third in new hampshire and failed to rebound as 
the primary season wore on except for a lone win in his home 
state his bid bottomed out tuesday in wisconsin where he finished 
last with just 5 percent of the vote 
he blamed his campaigns precipitous decline on a failure to 
effectively communicate his message of traditional democratic party 
values and on a lack of money but said he did not see his failure 
as a rejection of those values 
i do belive we have to have a government that cares and the 
american people believe that too that i know he said to the 
cheers of supporters who packed a senate hearing room where he made 
his announcement 
i really believe the american people are ready for a candidate 
who says lets put unemployed people to work lets have quality 
schools for this nation he said 
but simon said he still is concerned as he said at the outset 
of his campaign a year ago that the democratic party could 
become a clone of the republican party by forgetting its past 
we cant build the kind of nation we want if we simply pander 
to the wishes of the rich and powerful he said 
simon 59 stayed true to his liberal background during the 
campaign with his trademark bowtie and claim to the plainspoken 
legacy of harry truman he said often that voters were ready for 
something other than the slick packaged product 
he proposed longterm health care for the elderly a public 
works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives and 
promised that as president he would balance the budget in three 
years but critics questioned how he could reconcile promises to 
set up expensive new programs while also claiming to be a fiscal 
conservative who would balance the budget

attorneys for three of four defendants charged 
in the irancontra case moved thursday to dismiss the indictment on 
the ground that prosecution evidence is illegally based on their 
testimony to congress 
lawyers representing former national security adviser john m 
poindexter lt col oliver l north and businessman albert hakim 
contended that some of the evidence prosecutors used to obtain the 
23count indictment last month came from testimony the three gave 
to the house and senate irancontra committees 
poindexter north and hakim testified under grants of limited or 
use immunity from prosecution that prohibits independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh from using their answers to congressional 
questioning as evidence against them 
even though walsh tried to insulate his staff and grand jurors 
from publicity surrounding the hearings given the widespread 
dissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society the 
broad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable undeniable 
and so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matter 
of law the defense lawyers said 
they asked us district judge gerhard a gesell to hold a 
hearing to determine whether grand jurors prosecutors and 
investigators on walshs staff relied on the immunized 
congressional testimony 
never in the history of this nation has the immunized 
testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live on all major 
networks to tens of millions of viewers and listeners said the 
written request 
the defense contended that use of that congressional testimony 
or information derived from it has been and will be used against 
them in many ways in this prosecution in violation of their rights 
under the fifth amendment 
north poindexter hakim and retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord were charged with conspiring to divert proceeds of the 
usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan contras at a time when 
congress banned american military aid to the rebels 
lawyers for secord who brokered the arms deals with hakim and 
testified on capitol hill without use immunity charged in a 
separate motion that walsh illegally ignored congressional 
testimony of north and poindexter that would vindicate their client 
the independent counsels decision to exalt prosecutorial 
convenience above general secords fifth amendment right to a fair 
and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and 
requires as a matter of fundamental fairness that the indictment 
be dismissed secords lawyers said in their brief 
secord tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to force the grand 
jury to consider north and poindexters congressional testimony 
both men told congress that secord was acting as a us government 
agent a point the defense says should have been made to the grand 
jury before he was indicted 
walsh is expected to respond in court pleadings on friday the 
independent counsel must prove that he insulated his staff and 
grand jurors from the publicity surrounding the hearings 
gesell has scheduled a hearing for next tuesday to explore the 
issues sketched out in the defense brief 
before the congressional hearings got under way last spring 
walsh rushed many witnesses through the grand jury and filed 
evidence he had obtained under court seal to prove it was obtained 
independently of the congressional testimony 
among other things the defense asked gesell to question 
individual grand jurors to determine if they learned of the 
immunized congressional testimony from friends relatives or news 
reports 
the hearing should also determine whether or not grand jurors 
were exposed to immunized testimony from witnesses who testified in 
the grand jury 
the defense said it planned to challenge the legal authority of 
former federal judge herbert stern to represent walshs office on 
the immunity issue stern was retained by walsh as an outside 
counsel so that prosecutors on the independent counsels staff 
would remain insulated from the congressional testimony 
defense lawyers contended stern lacks legal authority to 
represent the us government under the disputed independent 
counsel law or the justice department regulation that walsh 
received to counter constitutional challenges to the special 
prosecutor statute

fighting raged for the third day in a 
showdown for dominance in south lebanon between shiite moslem 
militias allied with syria and iran police said 39 people were 
killed and 96 wounded 
casualties for the three days stood at 51 dead and 130 wounded 
according to police figures 
the battle is between justice minister nabih berris mainstream 
militia amal supported by syria and hezbollah or party of god 
which is loyal to iran 
it continued despite repeated ceasefire appeals from the 
highest shiite clerics that may indicate syria wants to crus 
irans challenge to its role as the main power broker in lebanon 
where the syrians have 25000 troops 
a police spokesman said amal units with armored personnel 
carriers advanced about noon into the coastal town of ghaziyeh a 
key hezbollah stronghold 
by nightfall amal recaptured the village after ferocious 
housetohouse fighting police reported they said most of the 
days casualties occurred in ghaziyeh five miles south of sidon 
the provincial capital of south lebanon 
amal said its fighters had captured and disarmed several 
hezbollah militiamen 
with the recapture of ghaziyeh amal has established 
undisputed control over the whole of south lebanon as well as the 
main coastal highway which links the predominantly shiite south 
to the rest of lebanon the communique said 
trouble between amal and hezbollah began feb 17 when lt col 
william r higgins the us marine who commands un truce 
observers was kidnapped near tyre and amal rounded up dozens of 
hezbollah members it accused of involvement 
shiite militants loyal to iran are believed to hold most of the 
22 foreign hostages in lebanon who include nine americans held 
longest is terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press kidnapped march 16 1985 
the police spokesman said amal had seized 11 towns and villages 
and hezbollah fighters remain entrenched in three hamlets in 
addition to ghaziyeh 
hezbollah issued a statement in sidon accused amal of stopping a 
convoy of international and lebanese red cross vehicles that 
carried three wounded hezbollahis from south lebanon for treatment 
in beirut 
the assailants forced all red cross personnel out of the 
ambulances and then raked the vehicles with gunfire killing the 
three wounded men on their stretchers the statement said 
amal denied involvement in the attack whichoccurred after 
nightfall near the village of aaqbiyeh 12 miles south of sidon 
police confirmed the attack without reporting the politics of 
the assailants or victims they said no red cross personnel were 
hurt 
the attack by amal on ghaziyeh obviously aims at stripping 
hezbollah in south lebanon of its main supply line said the 
police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations 
the road to south lebanon has been blocked at ghaziyeh since 
wednesday when hezbollah fighters overran an amal checkpoint in 
the town 
the spokesman said hezbollahs 40 fighters in the village of 
kfar roumman surrendered to amal a few hours after amal seized the 
adjacent town of nabatiyeh in a sweeping attack nabatiyeh 18 
miles southeast of sidon is a mainly shiite town of 50000 
an associated press reporter saw six hezbollah fighters their 
hands up emerging from a gutted house in nabatiyehs old sector 
and surrendering to amal militiamen 
fighting for nabatiyeh was fierce the two sides traded 
rocketpropelled grenades and mortar rounds until hezbollahs last 
stronghold at the towns christian school fell to aamal attackers 
the school occupied by hezbollah when the confrontation broke 
out tuesday was devastated with its walls peppered with shell 
holes blownout windows and fireblackened wooden desks

a major rift appeared thursday in the 
opposition to gen manuel antonio noriega who is getting tough 
with critics in defiance of the us economic squeeze and a buildup 
of american forces in panama 
two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own 
antigovernment movement their leaders argued that the economic 
sanctions are hurting panamas people more than they are damaging 
noriega and the civilian government he controls 
roberto arosemena and mauro zuniga leaders of the popular 
action party announced formation of the popular civic movement in 
a break with the national civic crusade an alliance of about 200 
organizations that has led the 10monthold effort to oust noriega 
they told a news conference their movement also is backed by the 
authentic panamanian party the largest opposition political party 
washington has supported the civic crusade in its effort to 
remove noriega as chief of the 15000member defense forces which 
include the military and police noriega is under indictment in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges which he denies 
zuniga said the new movement rejects any us influence 
for us no recipe that comes from washington has been 
favorable to the panamanians he said the people of the world 
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals the 
united states and the soviet union never are favorable to the 
interests of the people 
he added it is absolutely necessary for gen noriega to 
abandon his post for us this is fundamental 
leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations strikes 
and other protests of the civic crusade while differing with some 
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line 
popular action for example refused to join the crusade 
authentic panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to a 
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the roman 
catholic church 
political parties linked most closely with the civic crusade are 
the democratic christians and the liberal republican nationalist 
movement known as molirena 
those two parties the crusade and the united states all 
recognize deposed president eric arturo delvalle as the 
constitutional head of state popular action and the authentic 
panamanian party do not 
noriega orchestrated the ouster of delvalle on feb 26 the day 
after delvalle tried to fire the general 
zuniga brother of a former popular action presidential 
candidate said the movement will center its fight on the 
original principles of the civic crusade 
he and arosemena denied its creation amounted to a split with 
the civic crusade but rejected a proposal for dialogue with the 
government mediated by marcos g mcgrath the roman catholic 
archbishop 
they also demanded an end to us economic sanctions which some 
civic crusade leaders have said should be strengthened and opposed 
the idea of us intervention 
the united states should not continue economic and military 
action against panama arosemena said the panamanian people 
are capable of solving their own problems 
the last of 1300 additional us soldiers arrived thursday at 
howard air force base outside panama city completing a buildup 
meant to provide greater security for the panama canal american 
installations and us citizens 
late wednesday the government said it had issued arrest 
warrants for three leading opponents including delvalle who has 
been in hiding in panama 
it also asked interpol the international police organization 
to arrest gabriel lewis galindo a former ambassador to the united 
states and juan b sosa who was delvalles envoy in washington 
and remains there 
in washington the state department said thursday the united 
states would regard any efforts by the noriega regime to attempt 
arrests or prosecutions of president delvalle and the others for 
their activities in urging and supporting us sanctions as the 
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime

the reagan white house on wednesday 
urged illegal aliens eligible for amnesty to take advantage of a 
citizenship offer that expires may 4 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a statement that 
reagan urges those who may be eligible to attain this privilege 
and benefit to do so promptly 
fitzwaters statement noted that more than 125 million illegal 
aliens have come forward to seek legal status under the general 
amnesty clause of sweeping immigration legislation reagan signed 
a little more than a year ago 
among the laws amnesty provisions are requirements that the

states continously since before 1982 
fitzwaters statement took no notice of a bill approved march 31 
by the house judiciary committee that would extend the may 4 
amnesty application deadline to nov 30 
the spokesman said that among the more than 1 million aliens who 
have applied so far for citizenship are people comprising nearly 
every nationality 
by their actions in this country over the past six years they 
have demonstrated that they deserve the privilege of remaining here 
in a fully legal status without having to live in an underground 
society and fearing discovery of their unlawful existence 
fitzwater said 
but the time to apply for citizenship under this amnesty 
provision will end on may 4 1988 it said there may still be 
those who for one reason or another have not taken advantage of 
this onetime opportunity 
fitzwater said reagan calls on all americans to do whatever is 
in their power to remind their neighbors friends coworkers and 
others who may be living outside our immigration laws that the 
time is growing short for them to come forward and join us as 
recognized members of our nation and society 
immigration and naturalization service figures show that besides 
the more than 125 million general amnesty applications there have 
been roughly 300000 applications for citizenship under a separate 
program for farmers and farm workers 
of the applications that have reached the decision stage only 
12700 have been rejected and 782000 have been approved 
the remaining applications are in the clearance pipeline at ins

albert gore jr got a message from two democratic party 
heavyweights on thursday to tone down his criticism of presidential 
frontrunners michael dukakis and jesse jackson while sen paul 
simon put his campaign on hold but kept his delegates in pocket 
but gore ignored the message making fresh attacks as he 
campaigned in new york 
new york gov mario cuomo one of the gore critics implied he 
might withhold his soughtafter endorsement and said who cares 
what mario cuomo says 
cuomo said he told gore that his negative campaigning wasnt 
helping him in new york ahead of that states april 19 primary 
democratic national chairman paul g kirk jr endorsed cuomos 
appeal to the tennessee senator the admonitions that have been 
addressed to sen gore by gov cuomo just help to make sure we can 
continue to talk about the issues in a positive way kirk said in 
washington dc 
but gore consultant david garth a sometime adviser to cuomo 
took exception to the governors comments big chief big 
blanket sends up big signal like make nice and roll over 
garth said adding that he assumed cuomo was trying to help dukakis 
win new york 
simon who managed only a primary victory in his home state of 
illinois said he would suspend campaigning but refused to release 
his 170 delegates in hopes of influencing the national convention 
i want to have an impact on who the party nominates simon 
told a capitol hill news conference i want to have an impact on 
the whole process there at the atlanta convention and on where 
we go 
simon added that he had no illusions that the nomination will 
come my way 
but jackson didnt appreciate simons nearwithdrawal as the 
runnerup to simon in illinois he stood to gain the lions share of 
47 atlarge delegates if simon quit cleanly 
if one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of 
honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that 
state will get those delegates jackson said adding that the 
illinois atlarge delegates in fact belong to me 
the remaining democratic trio addressed the new york state 
democratic meeting the irishamerican forum and the democracy 
project as they sought support from new york officials the state 
holds its primary on april 19 with 255 delegates at stake 
gore under attack for criticizing his rivals charged the 
dukakis campaign with fueling a stop jackson movement 
i fear that in other camps something else is going on behind 
the scenes gore told the democratic meeting last week the 
wisconsin director of the dukakis campaign pat forceia was quoted 
publicly as saying a vote for gore is a vote for jackson in 
my opinion that kind of politics is insulting to jesse insulting 
to me and insulting to the democratic party 
let me make one thing clear a vote for gore is a vote for 
gore and if the dukakis campaign wants to start a stop jackson 
movement i want no part of it he said 
gerald austin jacksons campaign manager said that earlier in 
the campaign it was the tennessee senator who used similar tactics 
in south carolina gore said a vote for anybody but him was a 
vote for jackson said austin so if the shoe fits wear it 
hes worn the shoe before 
cuomo skipped the state party meeting and stayed in the state 
capital to deal with a budget crisis cuomo found time however 
for a lengthy news conference in which he refused to endorse any of 
the democrats and implied he might stay mum until the primaries end 
in june 
every day this an endorsement means less because were 
getting close to the primary who cares what mario cuomo says 
earlier in the day dukakis said cuomos endorsement would still 
be relevant and indicated that he had spoken to the new york 
governor thursday morning 
people in new york and across this country care very deeply 
about what gov cuomo thinks and what other governors think as i 
said the other day that is the decision that he has to make 
jackson weighed the possibility of meeting with jewish leaders 
in new york to allay their fears about his arab sympathies 
sometimes you cant beat your head against the wall you have 
to walk away from the wall said austin who is jewish 
on the republican side a spokesman for pat robertsons campaign 
said he would continue to pursue delegates through the gop 
convention even though he has given up a serious run for the 
nomination 
robertson let go his secret service protection because we are 
traveling about two to three days a week instead of the 
sevendaysaweek we were prior to super tuesday said barbara 
gattullo a campaign spokeswoman 
but she added we are absolutely in this through the 
convention

sen sam nunn gov joe frank harris and georgia house speaker

jackson if nominated by their party at the national convention 
here in july can win the election in november

credibility of other political candidates said decatur mayor

mayor edward i koch said thursday he may not be 
a delegate to the democratic national convention because he favors 
new york gov mario cuomo for president 
koch said he would like to be an uncommitted delegate so he 
could work to draft cuomo who is not running for the nomination 
however he said 15 percent of the voters in the april 19 
primary must cast ballots for uncommitted to empower the state 
democratic committee to send uncommitted delegates such as koch 
to the convention 
the mayor has balked at backing one of the candidates even 
though his commitment would end after the first ballot 
im not going to endorse before the convention because i still 
want cuomo he told reporters i think it would be unfair for 
me to endorse someone other than mario cuomo and then desert 
them at the convention

the worcester telegram says michael 
dukakis is using a line about charisma and competence that sounds a 
lot like one used a decade ago by edward i koch 
dukakis the massachusetts governor running for the democratic 
presidential campaign has responded recently to comments that he 
is on the dull and boring side by saying that after eight years 
of charisma maybe its time for a little competence 
the telegram said thursday that in 1977 when koch was running 
for mayor of new york city he asked after eight years of 
charisma and four years of the clubhouse why not try competence 
a reference to the terms of mayors john lindsay and abe beame 
but koch apparently is not disturbed by dukakis failure to 
attribute the quote the newspaper said and it quoted koch aide 
larry simonberg as saying were not charging for the slogan 
and adding it doesnt bother him the least hes aware of it 
mark gearan spokesman for the dukakis campaign agreed the 
quote was similar to the one used by koch but he said there was no 
deliberate attempt to steal it i think by any measure it was 
total happenstance he said

four variations of the winters most prevalent 
flu type have been circulating in the united states and that could 
pose a tricky question for researchers trying to concoct next 
winters flu vaccine health officials said thursday 
the 198788 vaccine did not protect patients against the various 
viruses as well as it could have against the single virus expected 
to predominate said suzanne gaventa a researcher with the 
national centers for disease control 
there have been people coming down with influenza who did 
receive the vaccine ms gaventa said 
although the current flu season is winding down some activity 
continues the cdc said new york connecticut and new hampshire 
reported widespread flu outbreaks last week covering areas 
including more than half the population 
eight other states alaska delaware montana new mexico north 
dakota oregon vermont and washington reported less severe 
regional outbreaks 
late last year as the 198788 influenza season began the cdc 
saw evidence of an apparent drift in the predominant flu type 
which this past winter was the one researchers call type ah3n2 
one of three major types of flu 
the predominant ah3n2 virus the cdc said at the time was 
drifting away from the leningrad flu the ah3n2 strain the 
198788 flu vaccine was designed to stop and toward a somewhat 
different form 
on thursday the cdc said it had now identified four different 
variants of ah3n2 flu virus circulating in the united states in 
recent months they are known as the sichuan flu the victoria flu 
the sydney flu and the shanghai flu 
cocirculation of two or more closely related variants in 
a single season is not uncommon the atlantabased cdc said in 
its weekly report 
but the four different viruses present something for cdc 
immunization experts to think about ms gaventa said 
each year the cdcs immunization practices advisory committee 
recommends which flu types the next winters vaccine should protect 
against and which specific strains of those types should be 
targeted 
the reports of the four different ah3n2 strains circulating 
this past winter will be used in deciding which h3n2 antigen to 
use in next winters vaccine ms gaventa said 
theyll take this information along with information provided 
from other areas and put that together and try to determine which 
strain is most likely to circulate next season she said 
a single flu vaccine cannot protect optimally against four 
different flu viruses belonging to the same type she said 
instead vaccine experts will try to determine which virus to 
target and how much protection that vaccine might offer against 
closely related viruses 
cdc recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and 
those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu 
type ah3n2 flu has long been associated with excess 
mortality the cdc said and many states have reported outbreaks 
of flulike illness this winter in nursing homes where patients 
might be particularly vulnerable

the soviet union and afghanistan said thursday 
agreement is at hand on ending the afghan civil war and urged that 
a formal accord be signed in geneva so the kremlin can begin 
withdrawing its troops may 15 
that would be two weeks before mikhail s gorbachev and 
president reagan begin their summit in the soviet capital 
agreement on afghanistan would resolve an issue that has troubled 
relations for nearly a decade prompting a us grain embargo and 
keeping americans home from the 1980 olympics in moscow 
gorbachev and afghan leader najib issued a joint statement after 
meeting in the soviet central asian city of tashkent 
there is certain to be a signed agreement on political 
normalization tass quoted gorbachev as saying while he toured a 
collective farm near tashkent after the meeting i think both 
pakistan and afghanistan will come to agreement and that we and 
the americans will agree to be guarantors 
the joint communique distributed by the tass news agency and 
read during the nightly news program vremya omitted the usual 
criticism of positions taken by pakistan and the united states at 
the geneva peace talks this omission could indicate some 
behindthescenes compromise 
president mohammed zia ulhaq said the geneva accords were ready 
for signing but un mediator diego cordovez indicated problems 
remained 
there are very difficult decisions and the only good thing i 
think that is important is that the political will is obviously 
there to take them he told reporters in geneva after the 
sovietafghan statement ws isasued 
gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the sevenparty afghan guerrilla 
alliance said in islamabad pakistan said it was the first step 
toward victory and a defeat for the russians he said the 
guerrillas will try to intensify the war 
draft documents in geneva call for an end to outside aid for the 
rebels and us officials have pressed for symmetry a 
simultaneous end of soviet military aid to najibs government 
zia quoted by pakistans official news agency said 
according to unofficial reports the two superpowers have agreed 
on the symmetry under which both would be able to provide continued 
assistance to their respective allies in afghanistan no details 
of the alleged agreement were given 
in the united states administration sources said the 
sovietafghan agreement appears to meet us conditions for ending 
aid to the warring parties and president reagan was described by 
his chief of staff howard baker as cautiously optimistic 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley addressing the 
issue of symmetry said we have not yet received a response from 
the soviet government on our proposal until its received we must 
reserve judgment 
soviet officials claimed earlier this week that pakistan 
afghanistans eastern neighbor and the united states were delaying 
a settlement they threatened to make a separate withdrawal 
arrangement with the afghan leadership if the geneva talks failed 
moslem insurgents began fighting in afghanistan after a 
communist coup in april 1978 soviet military forces entered the 
country in december 1979 and an estimated 115000 soldiers now are 
there to help fight the guerrillas 
pakistan is involved in the negotiations because about 35 
million afghan refugees live there most are in border towns and 
camps that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas who 
are armed and trained by pakistan and the united states 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman was 
asked at a news briefing whether there was a ussoviet compromise 
on afghan aid 
the situation is evolving he said 
he refused comment about zias statement and would not answer 
questions about the sovietafghan statement saying only lets 
let the communique work for itself for a while 
gorbachev and najib declared in the eightpoint communique they 
believe that the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have 
now been removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are 
involved in the settlement and favor their immediate signing 
they said withdrawal would begin may 15 if the peace package was 
signed within the shortest period 
their statement praised cordovez who has worked to produce a 
negotiated settlement of the afghan war since the geneva talks 
began four years ago 
it also said najib welcomes the readiness of the soviet union 
and the united states to guarantee adherence to the accords 
gorbachev flew to tashkent capital of the uzbek republic on 
wednesday tass did not explain the purpose the trip for more than 
six hours then said najib and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze also had flown there from kabul 
shevardnadze had spent four days working with najib on a 
withdrawal plan to be implemented in case the geneva talks failed

the sovietafghan agreement under which the 
red army may start pulling out of afghanistan by may 15 appears to 
meet us conditions on continuing aid to the warring parties 
administration sources said thursday 
president reagan was described by his chief of staff howard 
baker as cautiously optimistic but reagan still wants to 
see the fine print baker told reporters in california where 
reagan is vacationing 
we think an agreement now is clearly within reach said one 
administration source in washington who closely monitors afghan 
developments 
administration officials interpreted a statement issued by 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and his afghan ally najib as 
an indication that they have agreed to our conditions but we 
want to know that authoritatively said the source who spoke on 
condition of annoymity 
the administration is waiting to hear from the soviets on a 
proposal advanced by secretary of state george p shultz on march 
31 he said the united states under what is being called a 
gentlemens agreement would continue its estimated 600 
million a year in covert aid to the afghan guerrillas as long as 
moscow was aiding the kabul regime 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said thursday that 
the united states has not budged from the shultz formula which 
embodies what diplomats call positive symmetry 
she said the soviets had rejected a proposal involving 
negative symmetry in which the two sides would end aid shortly 
after an agreement was signed 
our position is clear mrs oakley said such an agreement 
must be a comprehensive settlement that provides for the prompt 
withdrawal of all soviet troops an independent nonaligned 
afghanistan selfdetermination for the afghan people and the 
return of the refugees in safety and honor 
two other administration sources involved with afghanistan also 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the next step would be to 
seek agreement at the united nationsbrokered talks in geneva on 
formation of an interim afghan government during the soviet 
withdrawal 
the parties are going to work very hard on the interim 
government said one official it is the next item on the 
agenda but it is not clear whether it will be part of the 
agreement 
the gorbachevnajib communique issued after a surprise meeting 
between the two in the soviet central asia city of tashkent said 
the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been 
removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved 
in the settlement and favor their immediate signing 
the declaration said the road was now clear for formation of a 
coalition government including all political forces in afghanistan 
including those who are currently opposed to one another 
many of the guerrillas balked at najibs previous political 
overtures which he has billed as national reconciliation 
the administration has seesawed on the question of ending aid to 
resistance the state department had been pushing for cessation of 
aid to the guerrillas within 60 days of an agreement 
but last december reagan said he would continue sending aid to 
the mujahedeen guerrillas until the last of the 115000 soviet 
soldiers left afghanistan 
the senate acting on a resolution introduced by majority leader 
robert byrd dwva urged reagan in a 770 vote to stick to his 
guns and at the beginning of march the state department made the 
tougher line a formal us position at the geneva talks 
the soviets rejected that and shultz proposed negative 
symmetry or simultaneous cessation of aid a softer line than 
advanced by reagan in december but the soviets rejected that too 
and shultz proposed positive symmetry which was closer to the 
positions taken by reagan last december and the senate in february 
byrd applauded the latest turn of events 
secretary shultz has kept me informed of the developments 
during the last three weeks of negotiations from our 
conversations i believe that my concerns have been met i want to 
give this agreement a chance byrd said in a statement issued by 
his office 
another lawmaker who has vocally supported the guerrillas sen 
gordon humphrey rnh was pessimistic about the chances of the 
proposed agreement 
if the option to resupply is not in writing then the 
government of pakistan which channels aid to the guerrillas is 
going to find itself in under tremendous domestic and international 
pressure to pinch or sever the arms pipeline humphrey said in a 
telephone interview 
at the same time the united states greatly increased its covert 
arms shipments to the guerrillas but curtailed shipments of 
handheld stinger antiaircraft missiles according to 
congressional sources who closely track the issue

a warrant issued by the italian judicial authority he is 
expected to be tried in italy the main judicial authority is in 
italy 
judge gerunda added however that there might be some

police returned with a new search 
warrant thursday to a house where skulls and bone fragments were 
found after a man said he was tortured and sexually abused there 
for four days last week 
the owner of the house flea market merchant robert berdella is 
jailed without bond on seven counts of forcible sodomy and one each 
of felonious restraint and firstdegree assault 
the alleged offenses all involve a 22yearold man who wore only 
a dog collar when he escaped from berdellas home by jumping from a 
secondfloor window on saturday authorities who arrested berdella 
39 said they found pictures of the man being tortured and abused 
and similar pictures of other young men one of whom appeared to be 
dead 
police have been looking for possible links between berdella and 
11 missing persons cases including those of two young men with 
whom he was reportedly seen 
his arrest led to the discovery of two human skulls one 
apparently a relic in the home while another was unearthed from 
the backyard along with bone fragments it has not yet been 
determined if those fragments are human 
police said thursday that an interview with a carpenter who had 
helped build a deck at the back of the house led authorities to 
believe they might find more skulls or skeletons under the deck 
but they began their work thursday by using power saws to cut 
through planks of the front porch 
we dont want to take a chance on overlooking anything said 
meyer were not going to leave that stone unturned 
he also said the investigative team working on the case had been 
increased from six detectives to 11 so police can follow up on 
calls from people who claim to have known berdella 
police are still trying to identify eight young men in hundreds 
of bondage pictures found in berdellas home

britons freed from a hijacked kuwaiti jumbo jet in 
iran said thursday the seizure was frightening but the arab gunmen 
soon relaxed and became quite considerate 
the 22 britons were among two groups of hostages freed by 
hijackers who forced the kuwait airlines boeing 747 which was en 
route from bangkok to kuwait to land early tuesday at mashhad in 
northeastern iran the foreign office said all the freed britons 
were fit and well 
several spoke to british broadcasting corp radio from iran 
before leaving for home 
various reports put the number of hijackers at five to seven 
they demand the relase of 17 proiranian extremists convicted and 
imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies in 
the persian gulf sheikdom in 1983 
susan carewjones an advertising executive from london said 
the hijacking began as passengers slept 
suddenly there was a lot of shouting and we saw the terrorists 
with grenades and we were told to put our hands on our heads and 
look down she said when you see people with grenades and guns 
you have to fear for your life 
after 15 or 20 minutes the passengers were herded together in 
one section of the plane and told to keep their hands on their 
heads until the landing at mashhad airport she said 
then they told us to relax and be calm and they were fine 
mrs carewjones said they were quite relaxed themselves by 
then nobody panicked 
they were quite considerate she said allowing her to 
change seats to sit with her husband david they gave oxygen to 
passengers who felt ill when the cabin grew stuffy she added 
social worker jerry moore also from london said the hostages 
were treated very well 
there was no violence no aggression he said obviously 
we were very frightened and intimidated for the first two or three 
hours but once we landed things settled down 
an austrian businessman among those released said the gunmen 
were brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the 
hostages well 
josef degeorgi 53 who manages the ibm office in kuwait said 
all the hijackers wore masks and they spoke english to nonarab 
passengers 
at the outset crew members were forced to lie on the floor with 
their hands behind their heads and some passengers were handcuffed 
degeorgi said 
at this stage things were quite brutal he said but they 
told passengers repeatedly to be calm not to worry they were 
really very friendly to us 
degeorgi said the air conditioning system failed to work at 
times and it became very hot inside the aircraft but the 
treatment was excellent otherwise with plenty of food and water

a jury was selected thursday in the trial of 
john zaccaro jr after four days of questions about attitudes 
towards drugs and the prominence of the defendants mother former 
vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
zaccaro 24 is charged with selling onequarter gram of cocaine 
to an undercover agent opening arguments in the case are scheduled 
for friday morning and attorneys said the trial could last three 
days 
the 12 jurors and two alternates were selected from more than 60 
rutland area residents who were also questioned about their 
attitudes toward undercover police work 
among those dismissed was a man who described people interested 
in police work as fascist 
district court judge francis mccaffrey had initially refused to 
dismiss the potential juror christopher mayka on wednesday 
despite objections from the prosecutor 
under questioning mayka had said i have often felt that some 
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background 
they like to have power 
on thursday addison county states attorney john quinn renewed 
the argument telling the judge that mayka has preconceived 
notions about police officers he feels police officers generally 
are on power trips 
the feelings about police are important in the case because the 
defense wants to show that zaccaro was entrapped by an undercover 
police officer acting only on a rumor that zaccaro might be selling 
drugs 
jury selection was prolonged by the wide publicity given the 
case most potential jurors said they were aware of the case 
prompting lawyers to repeatedly ask whether this knowledge would 
affect their deliberations 
only one juror was dismissed for acknowleging that the 
prominence of ferraro could affect his view 
ferraro and her husband john zaccaro sr were present for the 
questioning

about 180 tons of material presumed to be 
components for cluster bombs were shipped from italy to iraq since 
june police said thursday 
italian law forbids sale or supply of arms to iraq or to iran 
which have been at war in the persian gulf since september 1980 
officials here said two men were arrested and a third was sought 
the shipments were halted with the march 24 seizure at romes 
leonardo da vinci airport of nearly 27 tons of bomb parts about to 
be loaded on an iraqi airways jet bound for baghdad said officials 
of the carabinieri italys paramilitary police force 
an added 33 tons of parts waiting to be transported to the 
airport and eventually to iraq also were seized recently in italy 
the police said 
customs declarations were falsified to describe the components 
as parts for furniture or spare parts for home appliances or 
plumbing repair the police said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
they said documents examined by police showed the iraqi ministry 
of planning ordered the shipments and the iraqi government 
provided for export agents in rome a letter of credit for 8 
million to cover dealings with italian factories manufacturing the 
parts 
cluster bombs designed to spread shrapnel over a wide area are 
an effective antipersonnel weapon iraq has used such bombs to 
break up mass iranian ground assaults iran says iraq dropped 
cluster bombs in kurdistan against villages which it says were also 
hit by chemical bombs march 1617 
police reported finding iraqi government documents outlining 
which components were needed for the cluster bombs 
a police official said other bomb components 16 tons in all 
were seized at 27 small factories that received the iraqi orders a 
few factories are in the milan area others are in tuscany 
no one answered at the iraqi embassy in rome when called for 
comment 
police said thursday the two men arrested were charged with 
construction export and illegal holding of war arms both worked 
for an importexport firm in rome that police said arranged the 
bomb parts delivery 
officers identified them as iraqiborn ahmad al kodasi 30 an 
italian citizen and hamoudi jaffar kasim 21 of baghdad 
police said they a third man sought is an iraqi 
they said no charges have been brought against factory officials 
the parts ranged from metal tubes and cones which the factories 
described as plumbing pieces to plastic connecting parts listed on 
the inventory as table legs police said 
several investigations are being carried out in italy into the 
alleged supply of weapons to iran by italian arms manufacturers

the government on thursday 
night apparently backtracked on its claim that the army killed 
four anc terrorists in an attack on a house in botswana 10 days 
ago 
a south african television report indicated only one of the dead 
was an operative of the outlawed african national congress and that 
any connection between two of those killed and the anc was 
uncertain 
botswana itself on thursday in a letter from the office of 
president quett masire demanded an apology and compensation for 
south africas unprovoked act of aggression it earlier called 
the attack coldblooded murder of four innocent people in their 
sleep 
the south african defense force said march 28 that the three 
women and one man killed in its predawn assault on the house 
which was blown up were all anc terrorists defense force 
spokesmen refused to say at the time who they had killed but 
insisted the identities were known 
the botswana government said the three women were batswana 
civilians and the man was a south african refugee who had been in 
the country since 1979 all were buried thursday in gaborone the 
capital 
governmentrun south african tv said thursday night in reporting 
on the burial that the dead man was a senior anc commander and that 
at least one of the three women was involved with the anc 
south africa identified the man as solomon molefi also known as 
paul naledi and said he was anc regional commander in botswana 
botswana said the man was charles mokoena a south african 
refugee and that neither he nor the three women were anc members 
it called south africas identification of the man deliberate 
fabrication 
botswanas government supports the ancs goal of ending 
whiteminority domination in south africa but says it does not 
allow guerrillas to launch crossborder attacks from its territory 
botswana also said south africa has failed to substantiate its 
allegation that botswana was being used as a transit route for 
anc attacks 
the anc based in lusaka zambia wages a bombing and sabotage 
campaign trying to overthrow south africas government 
since the march 28 raid several south african tourists said 
they were harassed while visiting botswana 
the department of foreign affairs wishes to lodge strong 
protest for the aggravated actions launched by the botswana 
defense force against tourists said a diplomatic note sent to 
botswana 
south africa has not responded to botswanas demand for 
compensation for the attack

manuel antonio noriega 
marcos g mcgrath the catholic archbishop of panama said in a 
statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons 
opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it 
showed it was willing to discuss the departure of noriega 
the archbishop had not received noriegas explicit and 
personal backing of the initiative in writing 
there were no assurances that the four international leaders 
who proposed the talks could be present 
the breakdown came a day after noriega ordered the arrests of 
several leading opponents the general has defied us efforts to 
force his resignation 
in another development banking and diplomatic sources said 
panamas banks would not reopen friday and possibly not next week 
the government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning 
again friday 
a major rift appeared thursday in the antinoriega opposition 
as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own 
antigovernment movement 
their leaders argued that us economic sanctions are hurting 
panamas people more than they are damaging noriega and the 
civilian government he controls 
roberto arosemena and mauro zuniga leaders of the popular 
action party announced formation of the popular civic movement in 
a break with the national civic crusade an alliance of about 200 
organizations that has led the 10monthold effort to oust noriega 
they told a news conference their movement also is backed by the 
authentic panamanian party the largest opposition political party 
washington has supported the civic crusade in its effort to 
remove noriega as chief of the 15000member defense forces which 
include the military and police noriega is under indictment in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges which he denies 
zuniga said the new movement rejects any us influence 
for us no recipe that comes from washington has been 
favorable to the panamanians he said the people of the world 
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals the 
united states and the soviet union never are favorable to the 
interests of the people 
he added it is absolutely necessary for gen noriega to 
abandon his post for us this is fundamental 
leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations strikes 
and other protests of the civic crusade while differing with some 
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line 
popular action for example refused to join the crusade 
authentic panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the 
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the catholic 
church 
the dialogue was proposed by presidents oscar arias of costa 
rica prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain and expresidents 
carlos andres perez of venezuela and daniel oduber of costa rica 
political parties linked most closely with the civic crusade are 
the democratic christians and the liberal republican nationalist 
movement known as molirena 
those two parties the crusade and the united states all 
recognize deposed president eric arturo delvalle as the 
constitutional head of state popular action and the authentic 
panamanian party do not 
noriega orchestrated the ouster of delvalle on feb 26 the day 
after delvalle tried to fire the general 
zuniga brother of a former popular action presidential 
candidate said the movement will center its fight on the 
original principles of the civic crusade 
the united states should not continue economic and military 
action against panama arosemena said the panamanian people 
are capable of solving their own problems 
banking and diplomatic sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said bank would not open friday even on a limited basis 
they said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if 
they reopened 
the government whose deposits in us banks have been frozen 
has not met public payrolls since the crisis began 
the last of 1300 additional us soldiers arrived thursday at 
howard air force base outside panama city completing a buildup 
meant to provide greater security for the panama canal american 
installations and us citizens 
late wednesday the government said it had issued arrest 
warrants for three leading opponents including delvalle who has 
been in hiding in panama 
it also asked interpol the international police organization 
to arrest gabriel lewis galindo a former ambassador to the united 
states and juan b sosa who was delvalles envoy in washington 
and remains there 
in washington the state department said thursday the united 
states would regard any efforts by the noriega regime to attempt 
arrests or prosecutions of president delvalle and the others for 
their activities in urging and supporting us sanctions as the 
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime

students at chinas leading university put up 
posters this week criticizing government education policy but 
unlike student protesters in 1986 they made no sweeping calls for 
democracy 
the official response so far also has been more restrained the 
posters have been allowed to stay up for days on beijing 
universitys main bulletin board 
in 1986 tens of thousands of students at beijing university and 
schools in other cities put up posters and took to the streets 
demanding more democracy 
authorities were lenient at first but cracked down when they 
thought the students became too bold posters were torn down and 
students were ordered back to campus 
the authorities decision to leave the latest posters alone 
appeared to be an example of a new government openness which is 
being promted during the present session of the national peoples 
congress chinas legislature 
lu hao president of beijing universitys student association 
noted that most of the opinions advanced in the posters have been 
expressed by congress delegates or printed in the official press 
he said it was normal that students should raise such complaints 
he and other students said the posters contained no radical 
ideas and should not be interpreted as signs of widespread student 
discontent 
a lengthy open letter directed to congress delegates was 
posted wednesday at beijing university and on thursday other 
posters were put up which picked apart official educational policy 
and proposed reforms 
students said an open letter would be presented to the 
congress demanding that more money be spent on education and 
charging that leaders were neglecting education in their attempts 
to modernize china 
some of the posters opposed a proposal from the state education 
commission which would require students and faculty to earn money 
for their universities by running their own factories or hiring 
themselves out to other businesses 
students regard the idea as further evidence that the leadership 
is unwilling to invest in education and instead wants students and 
teachers to fend for themselves 
one poster called on students to express their displeasure with 
the idea by going to tiananmen square in central beijing to earn 
money by shining shoes 
about 80 students were gathered at about noon thursday reading 
and discussing the posters most seemed to agree with the 
criticisms 
presidents of four of chinas major universities including 
beijing university told the englishlanguage china daily last week 
that state funding falls far short of their operating needs

command said that all deployed forces will return to their home 
bases by early may 
the command said team spirit which was first held in 1976 was 
designed to improve defensive readiness of south korean and us 
forces through joint operations 
seoul has attached a special meaning to the joint exercise 
because north korea threatens to disrupt the seoul olympic games 
pyongyang has refused to take part in the games unless its demand 
to be made a cohost is met 
us assistant secretary of state gaston sigur said tuesday 
while on a visit here that the exercise was a valuable 
demonstraton of our commitment to preserving peace and timely 
in this year of the seoul olympics 
washington has pledged to provide necessary security support to 
prevent north korea from disrupting the games 
also on thursday the us air force said it plans to introduce 
at least 24 more f16 fighters this year to improve combat 
capability of its tactical fighter wing in south korea 
the us air force said its 51st tactical fighter wing here 
would replace f4e phantom ii fighters now in service with f16 
fighters this fall 
us officials said the introduction of f16 fighting falcons 
would help meet military threat from north korea and the 
modernization of the soviet military in the region 
currently 12 f4e phamtom fighters are assigned to two us air 
bases in south korea each the 36th tactical fighter squadron in 
osan and the 497th tactical fighter squadron in taegu they said 
a us air force statement said the 36th tfs will receive 24 
f16c and d models in october 1989 to improve and modernize its 
combat capability and readiness 
the 497th tfs in taegu will be deactivated early next year in 
line with budget cuts with its 12 f4e phantom fighters to be 
released for foreign sales the statement said

the men in borderlines the umbrella title 
for two new oneact plays by john bishop sure have their problems 
right now im having trouble connecting to things admits 
charles graham the protagonist in the evenings pretentious 
curtainraiser its called borderline without the s 
presumably to mark its antiheros precarious state of mind 
charles is a yuppyish marketing specialist who sells things like 
shampoo and toothpaste but his mind is not on his work he worries 
about his stale marriage frets about the big basketball game he 
blew in high school commiserates and drinks with a crude 
coworker sleeps with a young secretary and finally kills the 
womans jealous boyfriend 
in between these episodes a lecturer appears on stage to 
outline charles violent family tree which she traces back several 
centuries to the border wars between england and scotland his 
ancestors made their way to america where they were involved in one 
disastrous episode after another from indian wars in pennsylvania 
to battles between cowboys and sheepmen in arizona and fights over 
land in oklahoma 
bishop suggests that charles homicidal nature was preordained 
its in mans genes and no amount of moping about and worrying is 
going to change things 
much of the same anxiety pervades keepin an eye on louie 
the second and much more successful half of the evening this time 
the man at sea with himself is dave a policeman who keeps a new 
york mobster named louie under surveillance 
dave is just as miserable as charles but in this play the 
dialogue crackles with bluecollar banter there are a lot of jokes 
about members of the mob with first names like bananas or tomatoes 
or philadelphia or detroit 
also enlivening the proceedings is the appearance in drag of 
louies recalcitrant soninlaw who has decided to help the police 
and identify members of the mob 
dave also cant communicate with his wife the reason is never 
made clear although the playwright paints a picture of a man 
closer to his job and his fellow police officers than the woman he 
married its an unsatisfactory portrait 
the cast is firstrate particularly cotter smith as the 
distraught executive in the first play and bruce mccarty as the 
unnerved policeman in the second they bring a conviction to their 
roles that is not supported by the writing 
despite those performances and robert baileys fluid direction 
borderlines which arrived thursday at offbroadways circle 
repertory company never becomes much more than two morose murky 
tales of male menopause

jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists 
thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal 
government and to kill a federal judge and fbi agent 
the allwhite jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of 
deliberations a day after us district judge morris arnold 
refused to accept the panels statement that it was deadlocked on 
two of the counts 
the defendants included three leaders of white supremacist 
groups louis ray beam jr 41 of houston robert e miles 63 of 
cohoctah mich and richard g butler 70 of hayden lake idaho 
asked how the sevenweek trial affected the white supremacist 
movement miles said who knows what movement whats left of it 
after this 
us attorney j michael fitzhugh said he thought the government 
had proved its case but we accept the verdict of the jury 
nine defendants were charged with seditious conspiracy accused 
of wanting to overthrow the government and start an allwhite 
nation in the pacific northwest five were accused of conspiring to 
kill the federal officials and two also were charged with 
transporting stolen money across state lines 
six of the defendants are already serving prison terms for other 
crimes 
the jury reached a verdict wednesday on the charge involving the 
judge and fbi agent but arnold ordered it sealed until 
deliberations were complete 
the government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored 
trucks of 41 million including about 1 million that still is 
missing 
the defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key 
government witness james ellison 47 who led a supremacist group 
in arkansas and now is serving 20 years for racketeering 
the government was going to send a message to the movement 
the movement sent a message to the government the message was the 
same one god told pharoah let my people go said thom robb 
the national chaplain of the ku klux klan who hugged several of 
the defendants after the verdict was announced 
fitzhugh said it was not a political trial we werent after 
them for what they believed or what they said but what they did 
he said 
he declined to say whether any investigations of a similar 
nature are under way and said he did not know the cost of the trial 
burton levinson national chairman of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith said in a statement from new york that the 
verdicts were a real setback in the war against organized hate 
although many of the defendants are already serving prison 
terms growing out of their extremist activities the others 
including the most important leaders will now be free to once 
again promote their antidemocratic and bigoted aims the outcome 
means that we must and will remain vigilant levinson said 
beam celebrated his acquittal by going to a confederate memorial 
opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he 
called the zionist occupation government 
there are over 150 other political prisoners being held in 
zogs jails that need to be freed beam said 
i think zog has suffered a terrible defeat here today i think 
everyone saw through the charade and saw that i was simply being 
punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of zog 
beams wife sheila fainted and was carried a block to an 
attorneys office by her husband 
maximum penalties for conviction would have included 20 years 
and a 20000 fine for seditious conspiracy life for conspiracy to 
murder and 10 years and a 10000 fine for transporting stolen 
money

airport workers in northeast iran 
refueled a kuwaiti jetliner and its arab hijackers said they would 
take off friday morning with about 50 hostages held for three days 
irans news agency reported 
the plane was refueled after the hijackers fired at security 
guards at the masshad airport and threatened to force the pilot to 
fly with the little fuel left in the jets tanks said the official 
islamic republic news agency 
it first quoted the hijackers as saying the plane would leave at 
midnight 430 pm edt in a dispatch filed only two minutes 
before that time and said later the departure had been delayed 
until 6 am 1030 pm edt the second departure time passed 
with no new word from irna 
no destination was given 
according to irna iranian officials asked the hijackers for the 
extension to provide time for the turkish and pakistani prime 
ministers turgut ozal and mohammed khan junejo to talk to kuwaiti 
officials in an effort to convinve them to accept the hijackers 
demand 
the hijackers said to number five to seven want kuwait to free 
17 proiran extremists convicted and imprisoned in the persian gulf 
sheikdom for bombings at the us and french embassies there in 
1983 
irna monitored in nicosia said ozal spoke by telephone with 
prime minister hussein musavi of iran on thursday 
it said musavi told ozal his government wanted to end the 
incident without any unhappy event but added of course you 
should know that our possibilities are limited and therefore we 
hope the kuwaiti government will understand the restrictions in the 
holy city of mashhad and fulfil its humanitarian duty in trying to 
bring the problem to a peaceful end 
thirtytwo people were released from the plane early thursday 
and along with 25 freed earlier left mashhad for kuwait the 
agency reported the british foreign office said early friday that 
the passengers had arrived in kuwait 
the hijacking occurred early tuesday as the plane with 112 
people aboard was flying from bangkok to kuwait 
when irna reported the original departure time it said there 
are still obstacles on the runway placed there earlier by 
airport officials to keep the jet from taking off 
on the third day of the drama the hijackers said they placed 
explosives throughout the kuwait airways boeing 747 which still 
had 55 passengers and crew aboard irna reported 
among the hostages are three members of kuwaits royal family 
one appealed to iranian authorities to provide jet fuel irna said 
were very tired and our brothers the hijackers are very 
serious in their threat to blow up the plane fadel khaled 
alsabah told the control tower by radio irna reported 
the hijackers fired several shots out of the plane thursday 
after repeating their demand for fuel irna said it did not 
mention casualties 
iranian media and some of the freed hostages have described the 
hijackers as masked arabicspeaking men armed with pistols and 
hand grenades 
one of the passengers josef degeorgi 53 of austria told the 
associated press the gunmen carried handguns and claimed to have 
hand grenades he said there were seven and that all wore masks 
in london freed british passenger jean sefton was quoted 
thursday as saying that two of the hijackers offered her pillows 
and drinks and chatted with her daughters in english 
we didnt have time to be frightened things happened so 
fast ms sefton told londons daily mail 
irna had reported that iranian officials were refusing to supply 
fuel or food to the hijackers unless the passengers and crew were 
released but the refueling went ahead without any more releases 
reported 
irna paraphrased an iranian negotiator deputy prime minister 
alireza moayyeri as saying a kuwaiti negotiating team in mashhad 
does not take the issue of the hijacking seriously 
kuwait has rejected the hijackers demands 
the kuwait news agency reported that the government sent a 
letter to musavi praising irans efforts to end the hijacking but 
opposing any moves to allow the plane to leave 
numerous acts of terrorism in kuwait have been blamed on shiite 
moslems acting with backing from iran which acccuses kuwait of 
aiding iraq in the iraniraq war kuwaiti diplomats were brought 
home after their embassy in tehran was ransacked 
bahraini sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
passports held by five alleged bahrainis aboard the plane must be 
fake 
they said that when the passport numbers were provided by 
authorities in bangkok and checked in bahrain they did not match 
with the names given 
no positive breakdown by nationality of the remaining hostages 
was possible due to discrepancies between lists released by irna 
and by the airlines offices in bangkok

working indoors may be hazardous to your health 
after all suggests a study that says modern energy efficient 
buildings may significantly increase the risk of communicable 
respiratory infections 
the study examined the incidence of influenza and other 
respiratory illnesses among about 400000 trainees at four army 
training centers in the southeast and southcentral united states 
from october 1982 to september 1986 but the researchers said the 
findings may apply to office buildings and other structures 
designed for maximum energy efficiency 
researchers found that trainees housed in modern barracks were 
about 50 percent more likely to contract a respiratory infection 
during the sevenweek basic training period than those who stayed

the beat of a different drummer that makes

be a biological rhythm set at birth and continued throughout life 
researchers say 
in a study appearing friday in the journal science three 
researchers said they found that extremely inhibited children 
actually experience an increased heartbeat a dilation of the 
pupils and a tensing of muscles when confronted by strangers or 
other social stresses 
it appears that a small percentage of children are born with a 
biological disposition that would tend to make them shy and this 
is independent of what the parent has or has not done said

when abc news decided to do a documentary on 
just how pervasive the drug problem is all across the country the 
result was an unusual collaboration between the network and about 
40 of its affiliates 
drugs a plague upon the land airs sunday on abc it is 
anchored by abcs peter jennings and features several network 
correspondents but includes oncamera reports by local 
correspondents as well as a lot of affiliateprovided tape 
the opening montage set to the urgent rock beat of wang chung 
includes footage from 14 affiliates showing drug busts in small 
towns drug busts in big cities police breaking into crack houses 
and emergency workers picking up victims of drugrelated gang wars 
what we have done for the first time i think is created a 
news network division as opposed to network news division said 
executive producer av westin weve put together in one place in 
one hour at one time the resources of our 212 affiliates plus the 
resources of abc news to bring to the public in a concentrated way 
a clear demonstration of what drugs are doing to america 
cbs seeitnowstyle 48 hours on crack street has 
become the definitive drug documentary of late a plague upon the 
land has a completely different focus said westin 
48 hours on crack street made it sound like it the drug 
problem was in one place and it was kind of an adventure and our 
team was right in there and isnt it terrible said westin 
although he praised the cbs documentary he said viewers at the 
end of it could be expected to say well thats on 42nd street 
thats on crack street its not in my town 
this is a call to action westin said of his documentary 
we are angry in delivering the conclusion of the documentary 
jennings is less angry than inquiring 
we dont have specific answers to the crisis weve identified 
tonight he says but like you were kind of angry and we have 
a lot of questions if this is a war on drugs and everyone from 
the president on down has called it that shouldnt it be fought 
like a war 
jennings lists and then discounts some of the wilder suggested 
solutions such as the death penalty for drug dealers or 
searchanddestroy missions to foreign lands that produce drugs 
the documentary makes no attempt to ask why people even 
privileged people take drugs in the first place and how a society 
can convince povertystricken disenfranchised youths that taking 
drugs and taking money for drugs is wrong 
jennings suggests presidential candidates should come up with 
some answers but he does say one thing we should keep in 
perspective you cant win the war against drugs unless you attack 
poverty and illiteracy and remember for the poor coca farmer in 
bolivia as well as the poor kid dealing drugs in our streets its 
the only way theyre making any money 
this is not a broadcast about how it comes in across the 
border westin said it is not a broadcast about why americans 
use it it is a broadcast about the fact it is here in terrifying 
amounts and it is destroying the fabric of america 
the documentary is indeed effective in demonstrating the 
pervasiveness of the drug problem it would seem if you dont get 
gunned down in the cross fire of a gang war you might get on a 
plane whose pilot is under the influence or get left sitting in a 
hospital emergency room with your broken arm while the staff is 
occupied with restraining a psychotic pcp user 
none of us is safe no matter where you live says the 
father of a new york police officer who was shot to death as he 
guarded the home of a drug trial witness it was that slaying that 
prompted the documentary westin said 
as westin showed a rough cut of the documentary he provided a 
running commentary local correspondent network correspondent 
local pictures our correspondent local video network 
video 
he said the final cut of the documentary will have a graphic 
crediting each affiliates who were paid for their contributions

ive never been an ideologue says rose 
bird who was voted out of office for being in the minds of many 
exactly that 
as a fledgling television commentator californias former chief 
justice says her biggest problem is reading cues with emotion and 
feeling after youve learned to be more reserved and also to be 
less expressive as a jurist 
shes also editing a book of essays a sense of justice 
working on a second more autobiographical book and preparing for 
a modest return to the legal profession as a parttime mediator 
one subject bird will not discuss is the state supreme court 
the old liberal court cast out when she and justices joseph grodin 
and cruz reynoso were defeated in a bitter 1986 campaign or the 
current court that has been busy narrowing or undoing its 
predecessors work 
i am not going to use my television position as an 
opportunity to redo the election of 1986 bird 51 said in an 
interview 
i said from the very beginning that i was placed under a 
microscope and allowed no breathing room when i was placed on the 
court i would not do that to anybody else for over a year i have 
not made any comments on the new court id never put anybody 
through what i went through 
her second book will be a historical analysis of what took 
place and why in the election she said but added id like to 
see some years pass before that is published 
a public defender law professor and state cabinet officer 
before her appointment in 1977 bird is resuming her legal career 
by joining a burlingame calif firm dispute mediation services 
that will negotiate outofcourt agreements in business and 
labormanagement disputes other mediators will include former 
court colleagues grodin now a law professor and reynoso a 
sacramentobased lawyer 
in february she ended a year of virtual public invisibility by 
becoming a twiceaweek commentator on evening news programs on 
kgotv in san francisco and kabctv in los angeles 
advertised in advance by kabc as the most controversial woman 
in california bird was portrayed by both stations as a liberal 
counterpart to bruce herschensohn a former republican us senate 
candidate who appears on two other days 
but while a typical recent herschensohn commentary found 
numerous similarities between the democratic and communist 
platforms on central america bird has been far less partisan 
her topics have sometimes been provocative the power of the 
press the destruction of rain forests the world war ii internment 
of japaneseamericans 
but her conclusions have generally been mild the press should 
be aware of its influence people should treat the earth with the 
respect it deserves the internment must never happen again 
birds tribute to the japaneseamericans in her first show in 
the form of a poem she had written and recited publicly several 
years earlier got some critical catcalls 
a rose in prose would be much sweeter declared tv critic 
john carman of the san francisco chronicle who also advised her to 
try lesssafe topics 
but recently howard rosenberg the los angeles times tv 
columnist described her commentaries as forceful thoughtful and 
eloquent and said she was offering viewers her version of the 
big picture 
rather than comment so much on political issues and tell 
people how to think about them id rather comment on more of the 
human condition bird said i just am not a rabid person who 
believes theres one way to look at things 
that selfassessment seems to fit her television presence but 
it might shock anyone whose impressions of bird were formed in the 
1986 election when she was portrayed by opponents as a rigid 
ideologically driven opponent of the death penalty law and order 
and judicial restraint 
an overwhelming majority of viewer responses were negative at 
first but now include nearly an equal amount of praise many 
comments have focused on who bird was rather than on what she has 
said 
one writer from petaluma promised to stop watching kgotv if it 
continued to show that creature who was the friend of 
criminals a berkeley resident cited the death penalty a subject 
bird has not mentioned on the air 
the response has been tremendous both positive and 
negative said terry crofoot news director of kabctv its 
good tv that theres something to react to 
bird gets little editing on her twominute scripts but plenty 
of coaching on her television delivery 
she is tentative right now but writes well and learns fast 
said andrew shinnick the assistant news director in charge of the 
6 oclock news at kgotv shes fun to have around a newsroom 
the job has given the former chief justice a better 
understanding of the reporters who used to cover her with 
deadlines and oneday stories she said it presents enormous 
problems in trying to give depth and full coverage where everybody 
wants to know at the moment what the headline is

if you employ a cleaning person on a regular 
basis you must deduct social security taxes of 751 percent from 
the paycheck and in addition contribute a like amount as the 
employees portion of the tax 
this is one of the touchiest areas of american tax policy many 
employers of household help are ignorant of their obligations many 
domestics are equally unaware and in many instances either side 
elects to ignore the obligations 
but those obligations and others are very real they could 
lead to fines they could lead to more costly problems if an 
exemployee sues to reclaim benefits that should have been paid 
but were not over a period of years 
it is a growing challenge to families since many are able to 
exist only by having two breadwinners each working at a fulltime 
job and therefore unable to handle household chores without the 
help of a domestic 
since there is already enough confusion about the obligations of 
those who employ domestics a concerned household should describe 
its specific situation and accept guidance from an accountant or 
tax authority 
the key word is employee a young person who rakes your lawn 
once a year isnt an employee but a domestic who cleans your house 
once a week is almost certainly an employee for whom you must pay 
taxes 
specialists at spicer amp oppenheim an accounting and tax firm 
define a domestic as someone who performs service in or about a 
private home including housekeepers maids cooks and babysitters 
payments made for the performance of such services are generally 
subject to the federal insurance contribution act or social 
security 
an exclusion exists says the accounting firm for all payments 
under 50 made to an individual for occasional domestic help during 
a calendar quarter also excluded are payments in the form of 
lodging or meals 
otherwise you might be liable and again it is wise to check 
with an accountant or tax adviser about your specific case for 
deducting your employees portion of fica and adding in the 
employers identical fica payment 
your tax responsibilities might not end there either you might 
also be responsible for collecting both federal and state 
unemployment taxes 
wages paid for domestic service are subject to federal 
unemployment tax says the firm if cash paid to a performer of 
domestic service totals 1000 or more in any quarter of a taxable 
year or in a preceding taxable year the maximum tax rate is 62 
percent of the first 7000 in wages 
for state unemployment tax purposes each state establishes its 
own quarterly requirements but whatever is paid to the state may 
earn a credit deductable from the federal tax 
almost needless to say one reason many households ignore these 
tax laws is that they have more paperwork than time in which to do 
it and more legal and financial complications than they feel 
competent to contend with 
there is a way out of this one if you hire domestic help through 
an agency in the business of furnishing the actual services then 
the agency is viewed as the employer responsible for all taxes 
for the agency to qualify and for you to be relieved of taxes 
the agency must claim to be in the business of providing domestic 
services it must fix compensation levels its income must be 
derived from its employees income 
by that definition a company listed with the state as an agency 
that merely furnishes domestic workers to prospective employers for 
a fee that is an employment agency doesnt meet the 
requirements 
final advisory check with a tax authority or an accountant 
about your specific situation

the gullible among us believed that actor james 
dean died in the wreckage of his lowslung porsche spyder on a 
california highway 33 years ago but readers of private lives 
magazine were not fooled 
he didnt die he lives on maybe right next door to you and 
someday soon perhaps jimmy in his own way and in his own good 
time will once more come back and face the world that waits for 
him the magazine suggested at the time 
private lives was not alone among the exploitation magazines in 
suggesting in the weeks and months after deans accident on sept 
30 1955 that the 24yearold actor was alive 
i think people wanted to believe that dean was alive said 
alan betrock editor of the best of james dean in the scandal 
magazines 195558 a collection of jamesmania from such 
magazines as whisper on the qt anything goes hushhush and 
uncensored 
i think this happens whenever someone with a fairly rabid 
following dies at an early age betrock said remember after 
the assassination there were those who believed john f kennedy 
was braindamaged and living in the bahamas something that wasnt 
too supported by facts 
betrock has reproduced the pages of the scandal magazines in 
full along with ads for shrunken heads molded of virgin rubber 
and photographs of a woman named lolita if you like em buxom 
maybe youll like my photos 
the articles are also accompanied by many pictures of dean the 
wreck and shapely starlets such as pier angeli ursula andress and 
terry moore who were linked romantically with the star of rebel 
without a cause and east of eden 
the actors death in the crash on old state highway 466 
transformed him from a movie actor on the brink of stardom to the 
patron saint of young american rebels his portrayals of vulnerable 
and moody young men who openly expressed fear and pain became 
standards for a generation 
his mystique has endured 
rock songs such as the eagles james dean and david essexs 
rock on evoke his name the movie 93055 studied the 
reactions of contemporary fans to deans death a broadway play 
come back to the five and dime jimmy dean jimmy dean took 
aim at the hopeless nostalgia created by some fans 
some magazines knocked the dean is not dead stories lowdown 
magazine reported that the deceased dean received 8000 love 
letters a month this is gruesome mental illness of the 
unhealthiest order wrote the editor 
to prove the point lowdown printed a collection of letters 
my sweet darling when night falls and my stupid fat husband 
snores at my side i hold you closely in my arms i know you are 
not dead you are disfigured and ashamed to show your face 
writes one woman who promises to leave her husband and five 
children and shower dean with her 4500 fortune 
the scandal magazines covered every angle on the qt asked 
did jimmy dean leave a son a persistent story coming out of 
hollywood claims that the teen idol fathered a carhops baby 
shortly before he died 
did he commit suicide did black magic woven by exgirlfriend 
myla nurmi a los angeles tv personality also known as vampira 
have anything to do with the wreck did dean steal an oscar from 
frank sinatra these questions are posed and authoritative answers 
are posited 
a whole slew of articles purport to be the accounts 
firstperson and otherwise of deans secret friend fiancee or 
wife most of them are pictured wearing few clothes 
he told her you know in hollywood i see the most glamorous 
girls in the world expensive faces and bodies but youre 
wholesome and like a good piece of bread to a hungry man youre 
like sweet well water to a thirsty man thats the way he always 
spoke to betty lou lowdown reported 
betrock who previously edited the i was a teenage juvenile 
delinquent rock n roll horror beach party movie book does not 
take all of this very seriously the books cover promises that its 
contents are exclusive amazing fully illustrated possibly 
true 
but betrock says the sordidness of the dean stories makes an 
important point about a time that is often portrayed as an era of 
sweetness and naivete 
ive always been interested in the darker side of popular 
culture the 37yearold record producer and editor said the 
1950s are often described in terms of eisenhower and hulahoops 
but there was a whole undercurrent the underbelly of americana

rena owen remembers the 2022 bricks in her tiny 
cell sue rossiter can still hear the clink of locks and keys the 
sights and sounds of prison are vivid years later 
owen and rossiter both jailed on drug charges dont forget 
through an unusual theater group called clean break they and other 
female exoffenders are leaving their experiences behind by putting 
them on the stage 
begun nine years ago in a british prison clean break has grown 
into a theater group which has toured in the united states and 
europe performed on the royal shakespeare companys london stage 
and produced more than a dozen plays 
for the women its a chance to perform to produce plays about 
the traumas of lives that led to jail sentences and most of all 
an opportunity to speak out about an experience many others try to 
hide 
one of the most important things women cant do when they come 
out of prison is articulate their experience says chris 
tchaikovsky who helps run a reform group called women in prison 
and wrote one clean break play 
prison floats around in the back of your head she says 
if people can articulate crime it puts it behind you and clean 
break makes a unique contribution 
apart from that its great fun adds tchaikovsky who 
served three years for check fraud its not everyone sitting 
around thinking god im a victim 
still prison life is not the stuff of comedy 
britain has only 1755 women in jail out of a total prison 
population of nearly 49000 cramped into an overcrowded prison 
network 
but women prisoners are disciplined twice as often as men are 
punished more often for violence and injure themselves more often 
than men studies by the private national association for the care 
and resettlement of offenders nacro show 
womens prisons have never really been considered theyre run 
like mens prisons but with women in them says nacro spokeswoman 
jill matthews 
the main question is why are they there she says its 
terribly expensive its so destructive its such a waste this is 
true for men but more true for women 
jenny hicks who cofounded clean break in 1979 with a fellow 
inmate jackie holborough at a lowsecurity prison says leaving 
jail doesnt mean the problems end 
hicks and holborough with the support of a liberal warden at 
askhams grange prison expanded the annual christmas show into a 
theater workshop then a troupe with a 21strong group they 
became the first british prisoners to perform outside jail 
presenting a play in edinburgh of the group only holborough had 
had any prior experience in the theater 
it was an absolutely freeing activity from the bordom and 
general uselessness of prison hicks said 
now hicks works mainly with creative and supportive trust 
cast a group for exoffenders that shares clean breaks drafty 
basement rooms in london and is closely allied with the theater 
group 
most productions have small casts and a barren set and clean 
break can afford only one annual tour of london fringe theaters 
however the actresses have union cards and salaries and the 
group which numbers about 30 permanent members has expanded its 
activities 
with its first public grant in 1986 clean break took 
holboroughs play the sin eaters on an american tour including 
stops in new york an iowa prison and a boston womens festival it 
has also toured in amsterdam 
the group has performed at psychiatric hospitals drug and 
alcohol rehabiliation centers and detention centers opened its 
ranks to former inmates and sought the help of several professional 
actresses 
ann mitchell a former royal shakespeare company actress who 
worked on the sin eaters has for more than a year led writing 
workshops with therapist kate hall 
last year she combined a cast of rsc and clean break actresses 
in performing a collection of writings from both former and current 
prisoners called voices from prison at the barbican the london 
stage of the rsc 
mitchell also recently directed the latest production affiliated 
with clean break 27yearold rena owens passionate account of how 
the therapy she demanded in prison helped her accept her heritage 
as a maori the indigenous minority of new zealand 
as clean break enters its ninth year those involved question 
whether its main role is theatrical or therapeutic 
still for many clean break remains a dramatic help 
its a refuge says sue rossiter it was real therapy

when delain lindgren of choteau mont 
became pregnant last year she called her local doctor and 
learned hed dropped obstetrical services to save on spiraling 
malpractice insurance costs 
he was the last doctor delivering babies in the town of 1700 
so mrs lindgren had no choice but to look for a doctor in great 
falls a 100mile round trip 
even there she found few doctors taking new patients i had 
to wait three months before i could see one 
but nine days before her first appointment her baby was born at 
home three months premature the 2pound 15ounce girl was taken 
in the jan 4 cold to the choteau hospital airlifted to great 
falls and later transferred to a salt lake city hospital where she 
remains while her lungs develop further 
mrs lindgren is one of many women affected by a national shift 
by doctors abandoning obstetrical services many citing malpractice 
costs for women in large metropolitan areas its an inconvenience 
in the country it can mean life or death 
it happens in cities but when it happens in cities there are 
plenty of alternatives around when it happens in rural areas 
already there arent very many doctors providing that care said 
robert van hook executive director of the national rural health 
association 
he said there have been informal discussions in congress about 
the possible use of special pools of doctors from the national 
health service corps to assist hardhit areas 
somebodys going to have to do something pretty soon or were 
going to end up having to rebuild those systems of care out 
there he said were concerned that well end up with 
higher infant mortality 
a survey last year by the american academy of family physicians 
found that just over half of its members who delivered babies had 
stopped doing so said mike miller the organizations general 
counsel onethird of those who quit blamed malpractice insurance 
costs 
were very concerned miller said the whole concept of a 
family doctor is to take care of the whole family the big area of 
concern is in some of these isolated areas 
not everyone agrees malpractice coverage is the villain and yet 
the national average annual premium for doctors delivering babies 
has risen from 10946 in 1982 to 37015 now according to the 
american college of obstetricians and gynecologists premiums 
average 52000 in florida and new york spokeswoman teri malone 
said 
she said about 12 percent of obgyns each year stop doing 
deliveries and that the age at which they stop is getting lower 
mirroring the national trends is montana 
at least 60 of the approximately 250 doctors delivering babies 
in the state three years ago have quit that service according to 
the montana academy of family physicians 
the vast expanse of rural montana has never enjoyed an abundance 
of physicians now there is too often a disheartening search for 
medical care that is basic yet unattainable 
in malta on the north central plains only a parttime 
obstetrician remains women travel 90 miles to havre or 70 miles to 
glasgow to see a doctor who delivers babies 
in thompson falls in the western mountains no doctors do so 
the journey is 100 miles to missoula or 90 miles to sandpoint 
idaho 
montana doctors say they are victims as well paying soaring 
rates despite the fact that none has been hit by a fabled 
multimilliondollar verdict 
insurance executives say theyve been forced to increase rates 
not only to cover the higher and more frequent settlements in 
malpractic suits but also to build up reserves in anticipation of 
future damages 
but doctors pay the tab despite flawless records 
four years ago dr jim ashcraft of sidney mont paid about 
7000 for a malpractice insurance policy that covered claims made 
at any time for treatment he performed that year this year he 
faced a 19500 insurance premium that would cover him only for 
claims brought by the end of the year 
if he quit the practice he would have to pay an additional 
36000 to cover any claims brought in the future 
in 12 years of practice ashcraft has never been sued for 
malpractice in connection with a delivery 
such cases are rare in montana in fact but malpractice claims 
and payouts for obstetrical cases have been increasing here and 
insurers point to those increases to justify their rates 
obstetrics are our loss leader without question said martin 
oslowski president of utah medical insurance association which 
insures about 200 doctors in montana its probably damn near 
everyones loss leader 
about 15 percent of the malpractice claims in montana in the 
last five years have been obstetric cases but oslowski said such 
cases accounted for 25 percent to 50 percent of insurance losses 
precise figures on losses in montana obstetrical cases are not 
readily available but insurers say it is the fear of huge verdicts 
that not only forces them to charge higher premiums but also to 
settle malpractice claims out of court frequently 
figures compiled by the montana medical association show that 
since 1982 actual payments to malpractice claimants in the state 
rose steadily from 1 million that year to a high of 38 million 
in 1985 they dropped to 33 million in 1986 
doctors and their insurers want to deal with the problem by 
altering the legal system that resolves torts or wrongful acts 
such as medical malpractice they say if tort reform is enacted to 
make the system more predictable insurance rates will stabilize or 
drop 
an advisory council appointed by montana gov ted schwinden is 
studying the issue and most likely will recommend tortreform 
measures to the 1989 legislature 
but others question whether the rate increases are justified and 
whether reforming the system will really solve the problem of 
costly insurance or doctors quitting obstetrical services 
dr sydney wolfe director of the public citizen health research 
group in washington dc said many physicians stop delivering 
babies because of the inconvenience of being on call at all hours 
its easy to blame everything on the malpractice insurance 
crisis but it aint so he said 
karl englund an attorney representing the montana trial lawyers 
association added everyone has looked at the problem only in 
terms of tort reform that may result in lowering of insurance 
rates for doctors but it certainly doesnt solve the whole 
problem of the availability of health care in rural communities 
that problem may not be solved until lawmakers feel the pressure 
from women who need medical care and cant find it said plains 
physician jacob lulack 
if you took a thousand pregnant women and had them sit on the 
capitol steps wed have this problem solved in a minute said 
lulack

glen kaye gets paid 
federal tax dollars to serve the american people as chief 
naturalist for rocky mountain national park 
he helps the 27 million citizen bosses who visit each year to 
understand the 414 square miles of national patrimony located 75 
miles northwest of denver 
its kayes job to tell us what it all means what are those 
funny looking birds will this mushroom kill me if i eat it what 
time do the rangers turn off the waterfalls 
his is a fivepage singlespaced job description he supervises 
two visitor centers two museums four amphitheaters two 
information booths a 2000volume library and an outpouring of new 
books and pamphlets oversees six park employees more than 30 
seasonal workers and 50 volunteers and administers an annual 
budget of 400000 
he is park spokesman for good news such as international 
wilderness conferences and bad news such as people falling off 
mountains 
a 25year veteran of the us government he earns 43891 
annually and lives with his wife harriet a pianist and caterer 
and their two teenage children in a governmentowned house five 
minutes walk from his office his burning ambition is to return to 
hawaii ideally as a park superintendent 
assigned for five years to hawaii volcanoes national park kaye 
says i left my heart there its the first place on earth that 
really sang to me 
but the return will have to wait in midmay kaye begins work 
as chief of interpretation for the park services southwest region 
hell be based in santa fe nm a beautiful place even if not 
his paradise 
if glen kaye didnt exist woody allen would invent him 
at 46 he reports for work dressed like the boy scout he once 
was yet often spends his days immersed in cosmic dilemmas such as 
the future of the ozone layer 
he is an acrophobic who tries and fails to overcome his fear 
of heights by climbing mountains 
a painter of tropical scenes a wearer of hawaiian shirts kaye 
lives in a landlocked alpine valley where winter lasts seven months 
he describes himself as a diffident man yet he boldly creates 
fiveyear plans for his department tall and gangly with a monks 
fringe of hair he is a solitary outdoorsman but seizes every 
opportunity to attend grand opera with crowds 
growing up in medford ore kaye decided he wanted to spend his 
adulthood in the outdoors so straight out of oregon state 
university in 1963 he joined the park service as a naturalist at 
crater lake national park 
there werent many interpreters back then 
rangers were hugging trees or working with three spine 
sticklebacks an ugly little fish they werent big on people or 
communications skills 
today hundreds of workers on the federal payroll do nothing but 
explain the nations parks to its people 
what i try to do is get people to realize a park is not 
protected by boundaries on paper and a handful of rangers kaye 
said but we cant go out and say you must save this national 
park 
we must lay out information and let people make up their own 
minds in the long run parks are protected by the peer attitudes 
of society 
kaye believes one of the best ways to educate americans about 
their natural treasures is through art that notion and an old log 
cabin inspired him to create rocky mountain national parks 
artistinresidence program in 1984 
the cabin once owned by the late kansas newspaper editor 
william allen white has a breathtaking view of 14255foot longs 
peak every summer kaye selects creators and communicators to 
spend from one to three weeks in the cabin doing their own thing 
the park provides housing and firewood guests provide groceries 
glen broke through the inertia of this is the way weve 
always done it and came up with a great idea said bill sontag 
chief of the park services rocky mountain region interpretation 
office in denver 
sontag attributed the programs success to kayes enthusiasm 
he raised money for the restoration and contributed his own elbow 
grease but added there are quite a lot of those folks in 
government 
participating last summer were four journalists three artists 
two composers a photographer a writer and an actor 
artists need time to goof around and glen understands that 
said paul sullivan a new york pianist and composer who stayed in 
the cabin after he was commissioned to create a score for a park 
service film 
sullivan taped wildlife water and wind sounds to help him write 
a piano composition he also practiced daily on the piano kaye 
moved into the house for his tenure 
the cabin was offered with no strings attached the guy was 
genuinely offering an experience to us to see what we would do with 
it sullivan said at first it seemed too good to be true but 
i learned that glen kaye is a truly gentle man who has a very 
sincere respect for artists 
sullivan plans to return to the park later this year to premier 
his musical work 
this is the best thing the united states has ever done for me 
personally the pianist said speaking of the opportunity kayes 
program presented i feel ive been given a great gift 
art kaye says has helped change americans perception of their 
land from fear and loathing of wilderness to embracing and 
positively administering it 
kaye writes magazine articles and a column in the local 
newspaper in one recent piece he gently warned readers about 
world overpopulation and dwindling natural resources and cautioned 
of a growing scarcity for future generations 
he wished them freedom from the regimentation of overcrowding 
access to beauty in nature clean air and water and the 
opportunity to achieve their potential 
above all he concluded i want them to know of their 
history and their responsibility for in their action is the future 
of their lives

sometimes its hard to get from frogfuzz 
junction over to blitz center where the courthouse is or up to 
wrathgrape falls where aunt sophie lou has the family in for sunday 
dinner now and then 
most often rural people who are too poor or infirm to drive a 
car have to find a friend or relative to take them around you 
dont trot or teeter down to the corner to catch a bus or train 
because there arent any 
and sometimes people who live in the countryside in the 
thousands of small towns and hamlets that make up rural america 
simply stay home when theyre lonely or really should see a doctor 
railroad whistlestop passenger service the local or milk 
train of yesteryear has long passed into history stagecoaches 
mostly gave way to buses by world war i and even the buses are now 
becoming hard to find 
increasingly if one lives in a rural community efficient bus 
service may be only a distant memory nor may rail or air service 
be available says the agriculture department 
thats why usdas office of transportation and the department of 
transportations urban mass transportation administration are 
joining with the united bus owners of america to discuss a solution 
to rural transportation problems 
two regional meetings will be held this spring in annapolis 
md april 2022 and in san francisco calif may 1820 a 
national conference will be held in august in omaha neb 
ellen stommes of usdas office of transportation said the 
governments major financial aid involves the section 18 funds 
provided states by the department of transportation dot under the 
urban mass transportation act 
the money has totaled around 75 million annually and is 
apportioned to states under a formula to help improve passenger 
transportation systems available to rural people 
no increase in federal money is being talked about at this 
point ms stommes said in an interview instead she said the 
conferences will be focusing on coordinating the resources that 
are out there and trying to bring together the private and public 
sectors 
its sort of a hodgepodge of programs right now 
states are contributing to rural transportation programs along 
with the federal government local transportation providers mostly 
nonprofit groups often have authority to operated within a single 
county or a certain multicounty region 
to some extent these contract with human services agencies to 
provide specialized transportation to health facilities for 
example but in order to qualify for section 18 funds general 
public transportation must also be provided 
one of the things that were trying to encourage is the 
coordination of schedules between these providers and the intercity 
carriers ms stommes said that is not happening in a great 
many places 
but there are exceptions she said 
for example greyound is establishing what they call their 
rural connector program in which local or nonprofit providers are 
feeding their passengers into the intercity network ms stommes 
said 
improving rural transportation is not a new or novel idea it 
has been the goal of countless community efforts since americans 
started heading west any smalltown chamber of commerce worth its 
salt has had a plan prospectus or lobbying effort on behalf of 
gaining or keeping its railroad service bus station or airport 
much work already has been done at the federal level in the 
carter administration a white house rural development initiatives 
project included ways to overcome isolation by improving 
transportation in rural america 
the farmers home administration of usda in 1979 took the lead 
with the national council for the transportation disadvantaged in 
turning out a handbook rural rides for starting and operating a 
rural public transportation system 
a point made by the 1979 handbook is the relatively scant amount 
of federal money available for rural transportation although 
nearly 30 percent of the us population lives in rural areas only 
about 1 percent of the federal money spent on public transportation 
goes to rural needs 
the handbook although dated in many ways sounded a call for 
coordinating the fragmented transportation services that did exist 
exactly what ms stommes said is one of the priorities of the 
1988 effort 
coordination is good for the taxpayers and contributors who 
foot the ultimate bill because waste inefficiency and duplication 
of effort should be eliminated the handbook said and its 
good for everybody in the participating town county or area 
because the savings can be passed on to the public in the form of 
increased transportation services

since august 1986 10 british scientists all with 
some connection to security projects or establishments have died 
in unusual circumstances 
there is no evidence or at least evidence that has been 
disclosed of a direct link or a cloakanddagger conspiracy but 
the deaths have baffled coroners the widows politicians and 
others who cannot believe it is merely a coincidence 
opposition lawmakers have called without success for a 
government investigation into the socalled mystery of the dead 
scientists the authorities deny there is any mystery 
is it simply overwork or is there something more sinister 
afoot asked labor party lawmaker doug hoyle after the latest 
death that of a computer engineer working on guided missile 
research he was found dead march 25 in a fumefilled car 
it is very alarming said hoyle what is the link between 
all these 
the government acknowledges the string of unexplained deaths is 
odd but says investigations have been left to the police 
computer news a respected industry periodical has conducted an 
investigation and plans to release a detailed report shortly 
what does link the scientists other than their connection to 
the sometimes murky world of defense or security work 
all 10 victims were men 
four were in their early 20s 
all died in southern england some far from their homes 
five worked for marconi or its related companies marconi is an 
electronics subsidiary of the general electric co a leading 
defense contractor not related to the american company 
four worked for british government or military installations 
most of the deaths resemble suicides although only two have 
been ruled as such so by inquests in several cases the families 
said the scientists suffered from nothing more than overwork 
the mystery began aug 5 1986 when vimal dajibhai 24 was 
found dead in the gorge below clifton bridge near bristol 
southwest england suicide was suspected but a coroners inquest 
reached no decision about the cause of death 
in the next eight months until april 1987 there seven more 
deaths then a lull until one each this february and march 
dajibhai was a junior engineer checking torpedo guidance systems 
for marconi underwater systems ltd near london no one has 
determined what he was doing in bristol 105 miles away 
three months after dajibhais death ashhad sharif a computer 
systems analyst working on a defense project for another marconi 
unit near london died in a park near bristol 
an inquest ruled that sharif 26 killed himself by tying a rope 
to a tree looping the other end around his neck and then driving 
off in his car at high speed 
coroner donald hawkins called it suicide but he too wondered 
why it happened in bristol 
in january 1987 computer designer richard pugh was found dead 
in his home east of london the circumstances were never explained 
but a jury ruled it was accidental death during sexual 
experimentation pugh 37 had previously worked on defense 
ministry contracts 
also that month john brittam a 52yearold computer expert at 
the royal armaments research and development establishment was 
found dead in his garage with his car engine running brittam 
previously worked for the royal military college of sciene 
a month later a senior metallurgy lecturer at the college 
peter peapell was found dead under his car with the engine 
running the government said peapell 46 was working on an 
unclassified project studying recent trends in beryllium in the 
soviet union 
in march 1987 computer expert david sands drove his car its 
trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline into a vacant restaurant and 
was burned to death sands 37 worked for easams a marconi 
associate on a tender for an air defense systems contract 
john cartwright another labor party member of parliament 
called for a government investigation following sands death 
he wrote in a letter to the conservative government i do not 
wish to be accused of inventing plots more suited to a tv thriller 
than real life but i think the circumstances of these cases 
stretch the possibility of mere coincidence too far 
in april 1987 two more scientists were found dead 
one was mark wisner 25 a computer specialist at a royal air 
force weaponstesting base who an inquest ruled committed suicide 
by placing a plastic bag over his head the other was a marconi 
scientist victor moore 46 who an inquest determined died of a 
drug overdose 
wisner was working on computer software for the tornado fighter 
plane and moore had worked on a night vision project for the 
british army 
the mysterious deaths stopped until this past feb 2 when 
police found the body of russell smith a 23yearold junior 
scientist halfway down a cliff police said they found a note in 
his car in a clifftop park but refused to say what was in the 
note they have declined to speculate on the cause of his death 
smith worked for the ultrasecret united kingdom atomic energy 
authority in harwell no one has determined why he was at lands 
end 150 miles from harwell 
finally on march 25 another marconi employee 52yearold 
trevor knight was found dead in his fumefilled car in harpender 
25 miles northwest of london he was a computer engineer working on 
guided missile research at marconi headquarters

edna dinola has trouble recreating the 
jumbled events of april 10 1963 the night she was told the uss 
thresher a nuclear submarine carrying her husband and 128 other 
men had not resurfaced from a dive 220 miles off the new england 
coast 
she isnt quite sure who came to her home or what they said she 
thinks friends helped put her five children to bed and turned away 
reporters clamoring for reaction she thinks a portsmouth naval 
shipyard chaplain told her he would be there if she needed him 
there is one thing however dinola did remember as she 
reflected last week on sundays 25th anniversary of the nations 
worst submarine disaster i just didnt think that they wouldnt 
come up again 
but the submarine powerless with a crippled nuclear reactor 
never had a chance sinking deeper and deeper in the atlantic until 
fierce water pressure crushed its hull and killed all aboard 
rear adm dean axene threshers commanding officer until three 
months earlier was returning to portsmouth from boston when he 
heard on the radio a submarine was missing 
he drove immediately to the shipyard which thresher had left 
two days earlier 
after midnight axene began calling family members many of whom 
were close friends and had faith in the 278foot submarine that the 
navy said could dive deeper move faster and carry more weapons 
than any other submarine in the fleet 
it was a great ship and it had a great crew he said when 
i was reassigned i fought to stay on it 
thresher had three years of success when it left for tests the 
morning of april 8 accompanied by the submarine tender skylark 
threshers 112 military personnel and 17 civilian technicians were 
looking for minor glitches in the machinery after a routine 
overhaul 
but the problems were more severe than anyone suspected 
at 902 am on april 10 the skylark received a message from 
thresher 1000 feet below the surface experiencing minor 
difficulties 
garbled radio messages followed saying thresher was exceeding 
test depth then attempting to blow a naval term for 
resurfacing 
at 917 lt jim watson listening to skylarks radio heard 
the sounds of a ship breaking up a dull muted roar 
then silence 
skylark radioed that thresher was missing 
it was a terrible experience a terrible thing axene now 
retired and living in pensacola fla said of calling crew 
families he plans to attend sundays memorial services for the 
first time in 24 years but the memories are still too painful for 
his wife 
some crewmens wives like dinola didnt believe thresher was 
lost and told reporters to print the good news when their husbands 
returned 
dinola finally went to bed that night i had three babies and 
two other children and they had to be taken care of so you just 
go on she said 
although the navy told her the sub was lost she told shipyard 
officials to leave her husbands car waiting at the pier 
you would think that you would react immediately to something 
like this but you dont she said 
dinola wasnt alone some speculated that crewmen might be 
alive sustained by air bubbles trapped in the wreckage another 
sub detected what some believed were hull noises prompting the 
secretary of the navy to declare the night after the tragedy that 
there is absolutely no possibility that there might be 
survivors 
but the truth didnt register with dinola until days later when 
friends told her ships had spotted an oil slick the telltale sign 
of wreckage 
i finally realized what was happening and i went into 
orbit she said 
a navy board of inquiry pieced together what went wrong 
the board considered 120 witnesses 225 exhibits and 1700 pages 
of testimony before concluding problems probably started with a 
leak in the saltwater piping the board said water had shorted out 
electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor leaving 
thresher powerless 
the thresher presumably blew main ballast started to rise 
then slowed and began to sink vice adm ew grenfell wrote in a 
1964 analysis of the disaster 
when the sub sank below its collapse depth water pressure 
crushed the hull 
in august 1964 a research submarine found and photographed the 
wreckage about 1 miles down a witness described the ocean floor 
as resembling a huge automobile junkyard with big pieces of heavy 
metal all over the place 
threshers sole surviving crew member who took leave just 
before the sub left because his wife had had an accident said he 
still believes the submarine could have been saved 
raymond mccoole threshers reactor officer said he might have 
been able to use the subs momentum to prevent its plunge he would 
have sacrificed the reactor to save the submarine he said 
after thresher the navy developed a submarine safety program 
based on the boards findings the program includes strict 
construction methods and testing for saltwater piping more initial 
shallowwater sea trials and design improvements 
my feeling is that progress is expensive and the navy has 
certainly learned from thresher mccoole said last week its a 
hard way to learn however 
neil collier who was 4 when his father merrill perished 
agreed 
a lot of good came out of that sad day said collier who 
spent three years on a submarine himself and now is an instructor 
at a navy training center in saratoga springs ny 
collier has read names of the dead at several thresher services 
and helped plan this years service expected to be the largest 
since the tragedy 
despite the pain of growing up without his father collier said 
mourning isnt the main purpose of the service 
i take the memorial service very seriously and its a big deal 
to me every year he said but from my point of view the 
thresher incident and what impact it had on national defense is 
really why its important 
it made subs a lot safer many many lives have been saved 
because those guys gave their lives 
dinola will be at sundays service after working years in a 
school lunch program and as a nurse dinola decided in 1986 to 
honor her husband with a plaque in arlington national cemetery 
i finally decided it was time to have our own service for 
michael she said i felt that by then everyone would understand 
the situation 
aided by veterans benefits and social security dinola has 
raised her family this spring her last child will graduate from 
college 
you do what you have to and the good lord guides you she

hopes continue waning in the oil markets that an 
upcoming opec committee meeting will result in actions to stabilize 
crude prices 
in quiet trading wednesday on the new york mercantile exchange 
crude oil futures prices finished marginally higher while refined 
oil products were mixed 
contracts for may delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude edged up 2 cents per barrel to 1681 other 
contract months gained between 1 cent and 3 cents 
among refined products wholesale heating oil for may delivery 
rose 014 cent a gallon to 4534 cents while most longerterm 
months declined wholesale unleaded gasoline for may fell 022 cent 
a gallon to 4842 cents but longerterm contracts advanced 
crude prices failed to reach the 17abarrel level which they 
had tumbled below tuesday following reports that the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries pricing committee would not 
recommend a full ministerial conference of the cartel at its april 
9 meeting 
the upcoming meeting in vienna austria earlier had incited 
hope that the 13nation cartel would act aggressively to stabilize 
prices and enforce production limits to curb excessive supplies 
the market is no longer expecting great shakes from the 
april 9 meeting said bob baker an oil analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
but baker said prices were supported by the latest weekly 
statistics on the nations oil supply and demand which showed a 
jump in oil imports and a substantial drawdown of oil stocks from 
the previous week 
the data released late tuesday by the american petroleum 
institute an industry group based in washington were construed as 
indicating continued robust demand for oil

stock prices have jumped sharply in response to 
optimism over the outlook for inflation and interest rates 
propelling the dow jones industrial average to its second biggest 
gain of the year 
the wednesday rise in the dow was sharp enough to trigger a new 
york stock exchange restriction on computerized program trading for 
the first time since the limit was announced feb 4 
but stocks kept rising even after the restriction effective 
once the dow industrials moves more than 50 points up or down from 
the previous days close kicked in late in the session 
the dow industrials finished 6416 points higher at 206167 it 
was the averages ninthbiggest gain ever and the largest since it 
rose 7642 on jan 4 
nearly three issues rose for every one that fell among 
nyselisted issues nyse trading volume grew to 18976 million 
shares from 13529 million shares on tuesday 
analysts said the markets rise was triggered by a news report 
from japan that officials of the seven major industrial countries 
likely would agree on a plan to support the dollar in foreign 
exchange 
a strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure which in 
turn could ease upward pressure on interest rates analysts said 
recent expectations that the fed would tighten credit and push 
interest rates higher had depressing stock market psychology said 
newton d zinder a market analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
but some analysts were skeptical about how long the strong gains 
would last given the markets recent volatility 
the nyse program trading restrictions took effect after the dow 
industrials passed the 50point gain mark at about 319 pm edt a 
spokeswoman for the exchange said 
program trading is a technique used by big investors to profit 
on price differences between stocks and the corresponding 
stockindex futures it has been blamed for injecting volatility 
into the market frightening investors away and harming the

crushing trading volume during last years stock 
market crash has prompted the new york stock exchange to broaden 
the planned expansion of its trading systems with a daily 
capability of 1 billion shares targeted by the end of 1989 
at a time when many firms are cutting costs we believe the 
securities industry needs to take action to insure the ability to 
handle high volume nyse president robert birnbaum said wednesday 
the exchange now can efficiently process the buying and selling 
of 200 million shares a day it initially planned to broaden its 
capacity to 400 million shares a day this year but increaesd that 
target following the october stock market crash 
volume exceeded 600 million shares on both oct 19 and 20 
representing 200 million shares more than the systems current 
theoretical capacity 
the exchange now expects to be able comfortably to handle daily 
volume of 600 million shares by june according to its operations 
advisory committee which is coordinating the upgrading of the 
securities industrys trading and communications systems 
last year trading volume averaged 197 million shares a day 
among additional measures the nyse has taken to upgrade its 
systems capacity since the october market crash are 
increasing and restructuring the designated order turnaround 
dot systems memory for more efficient order processing 
program changes to the limit order systems to reduce 
bottlenecks during peak volume periods a 50 percent capacity 
increase is targed for this month 
adding 20 printers to the trading floor thereby increasing 
capacity by 20 percent and increasing the number of electronic 
display books on the floor by 25 percent 
replacing the automated pricing and reporting system 
since 1982 the nyse has spent more than 250 million upgrading 
its systems and technology the exchange has budgeted another 200 
million to be spent on improvements over the next five years

mexico will continue pursuing efforts to pare 
its 100 billion foreign debt despite the limited success of its 
novel program to swap some loans for usbacked bonds according 
to the nations chief debt negotiator 
jose angel gurria director of public credit for the treasury 
department told foreign reporters that the nations debt outlook 
had improved dramatically since the beginning of the crisis in 1982 
but he said the matter of the foreign debt continues being a 
matter of fundamental importance and great worry for mexican 
authorities 
its obvious that today we have a situation drastically 
different from 1982 and obviously from a positive point of 
view he said 
the situation is much better it is more comfortable he 
said 
but foreign debt remains a problem because of the hefty amount 
of interest mexico must pay its creditors mexico paid 8 billion 
to 9 billion in interest on its debt last year secondhighest in 
the developing world after brazil 
gurria talked to foreign reporters late tuesday on the condition 
that his remarks not be released as a matter of courtesy before 
he spoke to a panel of the mexican legislature on wednesday 
the treasury official said mexican officials were pleased with 
the concept of the program to erase some of its foreign debt by 
exchanging old loans for special usbacked bonds 
but he acknowledged februarys auction of the bonds had not 
lived up to expectations the operation was smaller than what we 
had expected certainly smaller than what we had wanted gurria 
said 
the program involves exchanging some of the debt mexico owes 
foreign commercial bankers for new 20yearold bonds issued by the 
mexican government the bonds are backed by special us treasury 
securities and carry a higher interest rate than mexico is paying 
on the old debt 
during the feb 26 auction mexico received bids from 139 banks 
in 18 countries but rejected 45 percent of the bids 
the bids that were accepted will result in retiring 366 
billion in debt at an average discount of 6977 cents on the 
dollar offering 256 billion worth of bonds in exchange 
that sale will reduce the mexican debt by 11 billion a small 
amount in comparison with the total oustanding credit but the 
cancellation of debt will mean savings of 15 billion in interest 
charges over the next 20 years the government said 
gurria said officials were pleased with the discount on the 
loans mexican debt has been selling for about 50 cents on the 
dollar in the secondary market 
in his remarks to foreign reporters and the legislature he 
emphasized mexicos desire to erase some of its foreign debt while 
capturing more new money to use in developing the economy 
the balance is difficult to achieve and the final objective 
even more so to reduce the burden of the debt without closing off 
to the country doors to possible support that will be required in 
the future he said in remarks released by the treasury 
department

sales of imported cars in japan surged by 411 
percent in the fiscal year ended in march to a record 104340 
units partly because of the rising yen and government efforts to 
simplify inspection procedures an industry group announced today 
import sales surpassed the previous record of 73924 units in 
fiscal 1986 according to officials of the japan automobile 
importersassociation 
germanmade cars topped the list accounting for 78468 units of 
the total sales followed by 7541 british and 4675 
usmanufactured cars 
the group said that in march overall import car sales rose 261 
percent from a year earlier to 11976 units also a record march 
marked the 51st consecutive month in which sales rose from the 
yearearlier levels officials said 
germanmade cars accounted for 74 percent of the total import 
sales in march they said 
the group said the rise in import car sales both in fiscal 1987 
and in march stemmed from lower interest rates on auto loans and 
the yens sharp appreciation which makes imported goods cheaper 
they also said the government simplified inspection procedures 
as part of its attempt to bolster imports and cut the nations 
large trade surplus while foreign car makers stepped up marketing 
campaigns in japan by establishing local subsidiaries

minimum for the dollar the market appeared to be reluctant to sell 
dollars before the meeting in washington next wednesday 
until the group of seven meeting it probably wont go any 
lower one dealer at a european bank in frankfurt said 
while the group may not have specific targets one trader in 
rome said it is clearly the intention of the central banks

millionaire industrialist victor posner sentenced 
for tax fraud to create a 3 million project to aid the homeless 
insists he wants to go ahead with the plan despite the objections 
of a federal prosecutor 
posner 69 faced what could have been up to a 40year prison 
term after pleading no contest to inflating that value of land 
donated to a college in order to deduct it from his tax return 
instead the miami beach financier was ordered to set up the 3 
million project to aid the homeless and pay 4 million in back 
taxes interest fines and court costs 
while the 4 million part of posners sentence wont be changed 
us attorney leon kellner who did not prosecute posner has 
argued the sentence gives the appearance that the wealthy can buy 
their liberty 
kellner said in his motion he was dutybound to call to this 
courts attention the fact that this court does not have the power 
to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a 
condition of probation 
at a hearing wednesday judge eugene p spellman required the 
69yearold posner to state under oath that he did not wish the 
sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the plan 
freely and voluntarily 
posner and a 10member blue ribbon committee met wednesday in 
spellmans courtroom to discuss the first stage of the program a 
study of the homeless in south florida 
since february i have been studying and learning about the 
problems of the homeless both nationally and in florida posner 
said in a brief statement all the studies in the world will not 
help one homeless person i will come to you with what will solve 
the problem 
posners attorney edward bennett williams must formally reply 
within 30 days to kellners motion which was filed monday 
spellman said 
the initial study will include a sixpart census of south 
floridas homeless an examination of subpopulations such as 
alcoholics the mentally ill and families with children and a 
review of how government policy affected the problem and what 
services are available to the homeless in each community 
spellman said he didnt plan to take an active role in the 
committees deliberations but suggested that the initial study not 
use more than 500000 of posners donation 
findings are scheduled to be available by may 16 said david 
fike of barry university which was chosen by posner to administer 
the study because of its social work program 
sister jeanne oloughlin president of barry university praised 
the tycoons ideas and said she hoped that posners donation would 
be the nucleus of a program that might grow to 300 million 
he has a very fast mind she said hes creating solutions 
even before we give him all the data

taiwan registered a trade surplus of 163 
million in march the lowest monthly surplus in six years the 
government reported thursday 
taiwans surplus with the united states the islands largest 
trading partner totaled 298 million in march down sharply from 
127 billion a year earlier the government said 
the monthly surplus was down sharply from 994 million in 
february according to the directorate general of budget 
accounting and statistics 
exports totaled 451 billion up 109 percent from march last 
year while imports amounted to 435 billion up 676 percent the 
report said 
taiwans monthly surplus has not been that low since april 1982 
when it was 60 million

sending the most goods to taiwan with us imports reaching 13 
billion in march up 152 percent from a year earlier taiwans 
exports to the united states equaled 16 billion down 105 
percent the report said 
trade officials attributed the surplus decline to tariff 
reductions on 3500 items and the 39 percent appreciation of the 
taiwan dollar against the us dollar since january 1986 which has 
made american products less expensive here 
taiwan has been under us pressure to reduce its massive 
bilateral trade surplus which totaled a record 16 billion last 
year the third largest surplus with the united states after those 
of japan and canada 
taiwans trade deficit with japan its second largest trading

united auto workers members moved closer 
to wrapping up demands for midapril chrysler corp contract talks 
but continued wrangling internally over whether to extend the 
contracts protections to some former american motors corp workers 
about 140 delegates from 49 chrysler local unions approved 
contract proposals wednesday that closely mirror economic and 
jobprotecting provisions in contracts signed last fall with 
general motors corp and ford motor co 
the unions main strategy in talks set to open april 18 is to 
return to uniform bargaining with the big three us automakers by 
imposing the fordgm pattern contract on chrysler and by limiting 
the contract to two years so that all three contracts expire 
together in 1990 
weve had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a 
year it should not take a long time for us to put this 
together uaw president owen bieber said of the coming 
negotiations after addressing the delegates 
the strategy prevents the union from seeking to win chryslers 
59500 active and 8000 laidoff workers any significant 
improvement on the gmford pattern in this years talks but it 
will strengthen the uaws bargaining power in 1990 when its 
members jobs will be further threatened by as many as eight 
japaneseowned us factories capable of building up to 25 million 
vehicles a year 
the decision against asking for pay raises breaking the gm and 
ford pattern angered some chrysler bargainers 
were stuck with something that was negotiated with gm and 
ford gregg betts unit chairman of local 573 of the office and 
clerical workers told the detroit news were not getting any 
raises and the membership doesnt want it 
like the gm and ford contracts the uaws chrysler proposals 
would give workers yearly bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 
annual wages forbid plant closings and prevent layoffs for any 
reason except a drop in sales 
but unlike the two earlier pacts the chrysler proposal also 
would forbid sale of plants or operations during the life of the 
contract an attempt to force chrysler to back further away from 
plans to sell its 28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary 
the council was scheduled to finish approving demands today and 
to vote on whether to include nearly 1000 former amc workers at an 
engine and stamping plant in kenosha wis under the chrysler 
contract or to leave them to bargain for themselves as they did 
before chrysler bought amc last august

koppers co has won a second federal court 
injunction blocking hostile suitors led by british industrialist 
brian c beazer and the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
the scale comes down on the side of koppers us district 
judge maurice b cohill jr wrote in issuing a preliminary 
injunction wednesday preventing the beazer group from proceeding 
with its 17 billion tender offer before april 15 
the beazer group said today it would extend its 60ashare 
offer launched march 3 from its scheduled expiration at midnight 
today until midnight april 15 
a federal judge in los angeles issued an injunction monday 
blocking the hostile 60ashare offer indefinitely on antitrust 
grounds cohill said if beazer succeeded in overturning the 
california ruling his order immediately blocks the offer until 
april 15 when he intends to rule on koppers claims that the 
tender offer violates securities law 
koppers stock fell 87 cents to 5537 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
a federal judge in delaware last friday rejected the beazer 
groups request to invalidate koppers poison pill takeover 
defense which greatly would increase the cost of a hostile 
takeover 
it was not immediately clear how the hurdle raised by cohill 
will affect the tender offer from bns inc the takeover company 
formed by beazer shearson and national westminster bank plc 
bns attorney edwin mishkin told cohill the investors were 
prepared to extend the tender offer scheduled to expire at 
midnight tonight until his ruling bns had contended that delays 
in closing the deal could jeopardize its financing 
meanwhile koppers chairman charles r pullin testified before 
cohill wednesday that he expects the koppers board eventually to 
reject as inadequate the 60 offer as it did beazers earlier bids 
of 45 and 56 per share 
koppers board stated tuesday it would take no position on the 
latest offer immediately due to the pending litigation and the 
companys ongoing attempts to seek alternatives to the hostile 
buyout 
the 64yearold koppers chairman said he expected someone to 
beat the 60ashare offer but im not sure i could hazard a 
guess as to when 
pullin testified that the board was considering selling an 
interest in all or part of the company which has operations in 
construction materials and services and chemicals management 
prefers to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued 
construction materials and services group he said 
koppers has said it also was considering a recapitalization 
plan or the sale of the entire company 
some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout 
of the chemicals businesses which beazer has indicated he would 
sell if successful in his takeover of koppers although pollution 
cleanup obligations make that option less likely pullin said

texaco inc officially ended a year under 
bankruptcy court protection today completing its epic legal fight 
with pennzoil co but facing continued pressure from dissident 
shareholders and takeover strategists 
under a reorganization plan approved march 23 by a federal 
bankruptcy court judge the white plains nybased oil giant 
transferred 3 billion to a houston bank account in pennzoils name 
today texaco also will begin making another 26 billion in 
payments to its other creditors 
the four wire transfers to texas commerce bank began at 1003 
am cst today and took 10 minutes to complete officials at the 
texas commerce bank said 
in exchange for the 3 billion pennzoil will drop its claim to 
a 103 billion judgment against texaco that houstonbased pennzoil 
was holding when texaco filed for chapter 11 protection from its 
creditors on last april 12 
texaco said it took that action to avoid having to post a 
potentially ruinous multibilliondollar security bond while 
appealing the judgment awarded pennzoil by a houston jury in 
november 1985 
the jury found texaco had improperly interfered with a january 
1984 pennzoil acquisition of part of getty oil co then bought all 
of getty itself 
following us bankruptcy court judge howard schwartzbergs 
approval of the plan worked out in december by the two companies 
and committees representing texaco creditors and shareholders 
pennzoil borrowed 27 billion from a consortium of banks 
the loan was to be repaid today once the 3 billion is deposited 
in pennzoils account at texas commerce bank in houston pennzoil 
spokesman mike white said in a telephone interview wednesday 
bob harper another pennzoil spokesman said today that no 
company celebration was planned to mark the occasion but he added 
he was glad to see the case finally end 
its obviously been a very protracted affair harper said 
i think it is important that all the parties concerned move into 
the mainstream of what we really do best and thats run our 
companies 
the money pennzoil borrowed has been invested in shortterm 
securities such as government securities and highgrade corporate 
bonds harper said pennzoil borrowed the money before actually 
getting the cash so the company could invest it in an orderly 
manner 
harper said he does not expect any immediate major investments 
by pennzoil 
our board really wants to take a look at all the options out 
there he said weve been looking at various opportunities 
our board will meet in early june to assess various possibilities 
officials of both companies have said they chose to settle the 
matter so they could get back to their businesses without the 
prospect of endless litigation 
takeover strategist carl c icahn who holds 148 percent of 
texacos stock and is its largest shareholder last week filed an 
appeal of the reorganization plan objecting to certain financial 
conditions and provisions giving legal releases to texaco officials 
but icahn stressed he never opposed the plan as a whole 
im glad they came out of bankruptcy and did not want to 
stand in the way of that event he said in an interview wednesday 
icahn added that he thought it was wrong that shareholders 
were forced to give releases to those involved in the getty oil 
acquisition without having to vote on the releases separately 
his objection joined by other shareholders has been that 
texaco was throwing away a chance to recoup some of its losses by 
suing the people who were responsible 
icahn also opposed a default provision of a loan texaco will use 
to help fund the reorganization 
under a provision of texacos agreement with a consortium of 
about 25 banks providing up to 3 billion in credit the loans 
would be callable on a vote by twothirds of the banks if control 
of the company changed hands 
attorneys representing icahn and some shareholders criticized 
the indemnity and changeofcontrol provisions as devices for 
entrenching texacos management 
but schwartzberg in approving the plan cited contentions by 
texaco and pennzoil that the indemnities were necessary to end the 
litigation 
he also cited testimony that the banks insisted on the 
changeofcontrol provision as a requirement for granting texaco 
the 3 billion loan

president reagan has imposed 
fishing sanctions against japan in reprisal for alleged violations 
of an international whale conservation accord 
in a letter to house speaker jim wright dtexas reagan said 
the commerce department found that japan has been granting permits 
allowing the killing of its minke whales in the antarctic for 
research purposes 
in tokyo an official from the japanese fisheries agency said 
his government would seek to lift the sanctions through discussions 
with us authorities 
he said that the issue of fishing rights in us waters had 
nothing to do with the whaling accord 
the feeling is that weve been hit through some irrelevant 
issue he said 
invoking the magnuson fishery conservation and management act 
and the fishermens protective act of 1967 reagan ordered the 
state department to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privileges 
that would otherwise be available to japan in an exclusive us 
fishing zone 
ken cook a spokesman for the us affiliate of the world 
wildlife fund said wednesday the announced fishing sanctions would 
hurt the japanese to a degree but he said the punitive measures 
come too late to save any of the 300 minke whales that japan plans 
to take in this years research program 
in his letter to wright reagan said that japan had been 
granting the whalekilling permits despite a 1987 international 
whaling commission resolution against this practice 
that resolution recommended that japan refrain from issuing 
further permits until uncertainties in their scientific research 
proposals were resolved 
the presidents letter said the commission adopted a second 
resolution since the finding of noncompliance by commerce 
secretary c william verity in which the panel again recommended 
that japan discontinue the practice 
reagan said he had no evidence that japan is bringing its 
whaling activities into conformance with the whaling commission 
recommendations 
he said that because of this the us government would deny 
japans request to fish for 3000 metric tons of sea snails and 
5000 metric tons of pacific whiting 
reagan also told wright that japan will be barred from any 
future allocations of fishing privileges for any other species 
including pacific cod until the secretary of commerce determines 
that the situation has been corrected he called the sanctions 
the strongest possible under existing law 
reagan however stopped short of moving against japanese fish 
products imported into the united states saying the steps he took 
represented the most effective means of encouraging japan to 
embrace the iwc conservation program

a danish investment group plans to 
set up europes first alligator farm in southern spain to produce 
skins and meat for export the projects organizer said thursday 
the baby alligators would come from the united states and be 
bred at the farm in spain but it would take three to four years 
before production and export of the reptiles skin and meat could 
begin said leif skovgaard in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
skovgaard a chartered accountant who is organizing the project 
for a group of seven danish investors said 10000 to 12000 
alligators would be bred yearly at a farm near the town of san 
roque 
european alligator institue as the project is called is 
seeking financial support from local and state governments in spain 
as well as the european economic community 
the farm which the group hopes to open by the beginning of 
1989 would employ about 100 people skovgaard said 
as alligators are dangerous at any age our personnel will be 
specially trained to cope with them so they dont lose fingers 
he added 
the investors hope to develop a nature park where visitors can 
observe the animals which can grow to 15 feet in length in an 
outdoor environment 
alligator meat according to skovgaard tastes like something 
between veal and chicken and is popular in american british and 
french fish restaurants 
the skins are used for shoes handbags and other leather 
assessories 
skovgaard said he did not anticipate protests from animal 
protection or environmental groups 
the united states banned hunting alligators because the species 
was disappearing but the ban was lifted recently after the 
alligators made a strong comeback

buoyed by favorable court decisions and growing 
political support eastern airlines labor leaders say they believe 
theyve got the momentum in the battle to save the financially 
troubled carrier 
theres a new sense that the right people are finally 
listening to what were saying said ron cole spokesman for the 
air line pilots association at eastern a subsidiary of mammoth 
texas air corp 
its very heartening to a lot of employees cole said up 
until not long ago everyone thought texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo was unbeatable 
i have felt a lot of confidence all along that we were gaining 
momentum that we were going to get justice added charles bryan 
veteran leader of the eastern machinists union which represents 
12000 maintenance and ground workers in a company with 33000 
employees 
lorenzo was just arrogant thumbing his nose at justice 
weve been able to hold the resistance movement together very 
effectively 
speaking in his union office less than five miles from the miami 
offices of the contra rebels the nicaraguan resistance bryan 
smiled as he realized his description of the unions as the 
resistance movement 
were an occupied country right now said bryan 54 a 
32year veteran of eastern its our airline we built it up but 
weve been invaded 
eastern management officials declined to be interviewed about 
the recent developments 
spokesman robin matell said the situation was too uncertain to 
speculate but he said the unions have exaggerated the significance 
of court rulings and added that management still considers reducing 
labor costs crucial to salvaging the carrier which has lost 900 
million in the past 10 years 
it still comes down to this do you pay baggage handlers 
47000 a year matell said 
us district judge john pratt in washington declared march 10 
that eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell its 
profitable northeast shuttle to another unit of texas air earlier 
this week pratt said he has accepted a report from eastern 
officials that the airline no longer planned to sell off the 
shuttle and would not find them in contempt if they follow through 
with that pledge 
on march 28 us district judge barrington parker also in 
washington granted a preliminary injunction sought by eastern 
pilots which would prevent eastern from using its planes to train 
pilots from orion air 
eastern management hoped to use the north carolina cargo line to 
fly eastern routes in case of a strike 
the rulings were crucial to halting what the unions believe are 
two major pushes by lorenzo who began taking over eastern two 
years ago following his successful takeover of continental airlines 
and has since swallowed up new york air people express and other 
small carriers 
stymied by continental unions in 1983 lorenzo shut the airline 
down took it into federal bankruptcy reorganization got union 
contracts voided and emerged with a lowcost carrier 
the pratt injunction halted the spinoff of the shuttle 
which the labor leaders see as part of a strategy by lorenzo to 
cannibalize easterns assets the eastern reservations system was 
bought by texas air last year and planes and gates have also been 
sold off 
the parker injunction against training orion pilots sets back 
easterns strike contingency program bryan warned machinists last 
december when labor talks deadlocked to be ready for a 
managementprovoked strike that he said was aimed at crushing the 
union 
but the federal mediator sent in for the talks has so far 
declined to classify the talks at an impasse if he makes that 
declaration a 30day cooling off period must follow 
the unions in a national election year have rallied political 
support 
democratic presidential candidates michael dukakis and richard 
gephardt criticized eastern management during february campaign 
appearances here congressional hearings have been held into 
eastern safety practices and some congressmen are calling for a 
federal probe into the texas air takeover 
a report by the house committee on government operations said 
orion air should correct deeply rooted and pervasive problems 
before gaining federal aviation administration permission to fly 
eastern planes 
other unions have joined eastern employees in jobs for 
justice rallies on the capitol steps and other locations 
the attitude in other unions is if frank lorenzos model for 
destroying unions is successful it may well spill over it 
threatens most unions bryan said 
the unions have numerous court cases including lawsuits from 
fired employees and hundreds of pending grievances the machinists 
filed a new federal suit march 31 in washington charging eastern 
texas air and other defendants with systematically violating 
federal securities and labor laws 
more than a year ago eastern management called for a 30 percent 
reduction or 490 million in labor costs union leaders responded 
that eastern employees have made concessions for years and are 
tired of paying for bad management 
the employees say they want to buy eastern and run the airline 
themselves 
eastern has everything it needs to be a success an 
established name dedicated professional employees good routes 
major airports we could make it the airline it should be said 
nancy currier a vice president of the eastern flight attendants 
local 
takeover strategist t boone pickens last month expressed 
interest in helping the unions realize their dream of taking the 
airline from lorenzo independent analysts have said such a 
takeover seems unlikely but could intensify pressure on lorezno 
whose texas air empire is 5 billion in debt

alex s tillman feels left out when he reads 
about the national alliance the white supremacist group that wants 
to abolish affirmative action at american telephone amp telegraph co 
tillman a 42yearold black executive at bell laboratories is 
wondering why no one has paid attention to his own proposal for 
atampt to increase its affirmative action 
while the national alliance occupies no 5 on the atampt 
shareholders ballot tillman is an uneasy neighbor at no 4 
i dont have any ax to grind with atampt im very pleased with 
my employment here but our name carries america in it if 
anybody should be setting the example it should be atampt tillman 
said thursday 
tillman said he is worried the national alliances resolution 
might get a significant number of shareholders votes at the annual 
meeting april 20 in denver 
atampt managers might allow a big vote for the national alliance 
proposal to justify weakening their commitment to hiring and 
promoting minorities and women tillman fears 
im not speaking out against white males im saying in gods 
land theres space for everybody tillman said 
tillman who joined bell labs in 1971 handles accounting and 
budget preparation for a bell labs unit in murray hill nj he has 
recruited minorities for the company and visits colleges under the 
urban leagues black executive exchange program 
tillman is casting his argument in terms that he thinks 
shareholders will appreciate shifting trends in population mean 
that more of the new entrants to the work force through the year 
2000 will be minorities and women as much as 90 percent of all 
new entrants fortune magazine said in its april 11 issue 
were in an economic race with worldwide competition to have 
people with potential and not use that potential to the fullest is 
something america cannot afford he said 
atampt promoted only one black to the level of vice president from 
1979 to the end of 1987 namely naseby pete rhinehart jr a 
corporate vice president for tax planning and compliance tillman 
said 
atampt says 39 percent of its senior managers were women and 16 
percent were minorities as of the end of 1987 in contrast 462 
percent of all company employees are women and 208 percent are 
minorities 
atampt spokeswoman luann gardner said the companys started an 
affirmative action advisory board last year and has increased its 
hiring of women and minorities it added a second black vice 
president earlier this year 
there have been some improvements under the jim olson 
administration but not enough tillman said referring to 
chairman james olson today it is sound business to ensure that 
minorities and women are fully utilized in upper levels

investors led by britains brian c beazer 
thursday extended their 17billion hostile bid for koppers co 
until april 15 when a federal court ruling is due on whether the 
offer violates securities laws 
beazer said he was shocked that koppers board of directors has 
not yet given shareholders any advice on the 60ashare offer 
which has been on the table for two weeks 
the board declared as inadequate beazers previous offers of 
45ashare and 56ashare 
analysts said the pittsburghbased cement and building products 
company has strengthened its position by shifting the battle from 
the stock market to the courtroom 
it looks like koppers has won a lot of the early skirmishes 
said an analyst at a wall street investment house who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
arbitrageurs who speculate on stock prices during takeover 
struggles are getting nervous he said noting that koppers 
stock has not been performing well 
in late trading on the new york stock exchange koppers rose 75 
cents to 56125 a share 
as of tuesday 137154 common shares out of koppers 285 
million outstanding shares had been tendered under beazers offer 
the suitors said thursday 
beazer complained in a statement that the board is denying 
shareholders the benefits of an offer that neither it nor its 
financial advisers could conclude was inadequate 
observers say that the offer makes a fair valuation of the 
company i think its a very generous offer said the wall 
street analyst i think management should accept it 
us district judge maurice b cohill jr on wednesday barred 
the beazer group from proceeding with its offer until april 15 
when he plans to rule on koppers defensive lawsuit filed in 
pittsburgh 
cohill said his preliminary injunction will not take effect 
unless beazer succeeds in overturning a similar injunction issued 
monday by a federal judge in los angeles on antitrust grounds 
separately bns inc the takeover company formed by beazer 
shearson lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank plc 
failed to persuade a federal judge in delaware to revoke koppers 
poison pill a shareholder rights plan that would greatly increase 
the cost of a takeover 
koppers chairman charles r pullin testified before cohill 
wednesday that he expects the koppers board eventually will reject 
the 60ashare offer and that the bid will be topped by some other 
bidder but pullin added im not sure i could hazard a guess as 
to when 
koppers has said it is considering selling all or parts of the 
company borrowing heavily to recapitalize the company or paying 
special dividends to enhance shareholder values in order to keep 
koppers away from beazer

in hong kongs cutthroat business world the 
highest acknowledgment of success is to be recognized as the 
taipan the big boss himself 
later this year a transplanted new yorker 38yearold brian m 
powers will assume the title the first american to do so only 
two years after arriving in hong kong as an executive with jardine 
matheson the venerable trading company whose history is 
intertwined with that of this british colony 
when the massapequa ny native becomes the companys senior 
representative in hong kong later this year he will inherit the 
prestigious title which means big boss in the cantonese chinese 
dialect and traditionally is reserved for the local head of jardine 
matheson 
the company was founded in nearby canton in 1832 by scottish 
surgeons mate william jardine and highlander james matheson it 
moved to hong kong in 1841 when the colony was established 
jardine mathesons origins were in the opium and tea trade with 
the decaying qing dynasty and the title taipan still brings to mind 
the early merchant ships plying the south china sea the company 
has since evolved into a diversified international conglomerate 
that includes hotels shipping management vast lnd holdings and 
pizza parlor franchises 
throughout the companys rich history it has been led by 
scotsmen most recently by simon keswick but when keswick 
announced in march that he would step down as taipan powers was 
named as his replacement 
the fact that i was american was either neutral or to a 
negative probably more neutral powers said in a recent 
telephone interview about becoming taipan he added that he first 
learned of the title when everyone else did with james clavells 
book 
clavell authored taipan and noble house two fictional 
accounts of hong kongs business elite that romanticized the 
position of taipan 
after studying economics at yale and earning a law degree at the 
university of virginia powers joined the new york law firm of 
debevoise plimpton lyons amp gates in 1975 handling corporation 
mergers and acquisitions he then joined the ford foundation as 
financial counsel 
in 1981 powers joined james d wolfensohn inc which he 
described as a boutique merchant bank very small with very 
large clients he provided financial and strategic advice on 
mergers and acquisitions and in early 1982 was asked to help 
jardine matheson 
keswick was impressed with powers performance and in 1986 the 
american joined the hong kong company as executive director 
responsible for group strategy corporate finance and financial 
services 
powers a sandyhaired man who exudes confidence and good humor 
in his appearances at news conferences quickly was named managing 
director of jardine matheson and its three principal public holding 
companies and joint managing director of its property arm hong 
kong land 
on march 25 keswick made public what had long been suspected 
powers would become the top jardine matheson official in the colony 
keswick chairman and managing director of jardine matheson 
since 1983 said he would return to britain after the annual 
general meeting in june and serve as the companys nonexecutive 
chairman his family still retains control of the company through 
stock holdings 
when one sees them keswick and powers operating together 
clearly there is tremendous empathy they seem to feed off each 
others strengths said martin spurrier a consultant to jardine 
matheson who worked in the group for 13 years brians not only a 
strategic thinker but hes a doer 
powers who speaks furiously fast and displays total recall 
said he is excited about becoming taipan 
before i do anything there are always two things i ask myself 
do i think ill enjoy it and will it be challenging 
powers takes over a company was nearing bankruptcy in the early 
1980s largely because of a collapse in the local property market 
and a shipping slowdown but it earned 101 million last year up 
64 percent from 1986 
jardine matheson employs more than 23000 people in 22 countries 
while its affiliates have 53000 people about threequarters of 
its business activity is in hong kong but overseas operations are 
expected to expand powers said 
in terms of new busineses of the acquisitions necessary to 
allow us continued growth we have to look to overseas markets 
powers said this is a natural pattern because the big groups 
with big capital and the familycontrolled businesses in hong kong 
limit buying ability 
for example he noted that after two years of searching the 
largest hong kong business jardine matheson could find worth 
purchasing was the 37outlet optical shops the price tag was 35 
million 
other interests in the conglomerate include the mandarin 
oriental hotel group life insurance 7eleven convenience stores 
and pizza hut franchises 
all this makes powers excited at the big challenge of a 
multifaceted diversified business that involves not one big 
issue but a series of issues to be faced every day 
powers who will head the empire from his 48thfloor office 
above the colonys famed harbor also said hes glad to be facing 
these challenges in hong kong a teeming territory of 57 million 
people whom he describes as wonderfully pragmatic 
he has stressed the company headquarters will remain in hong 
kong even though jardine matheson set up a firm in bermuda four 
years ago as the groups ultimate holding company the move was 
made to ease the anxiety of trading partners about hong kongs 
future after 1997 when china regains sovereignty over the 
territory 
the new taipan was born aug 25 1949 so that makes me an 
ox he said in reference to one of 12 animals in the chinese 
zodiac people born under the sign of the ox are said to be 
marathon workers and empirebuilders 
powers and his wife paula have a son 8yearold jeremy the 
new taipan enjoys tennis and golf frequents the theater and has a 
fondness for russian cellist mstislav rostropovich 
powers taught at stanford university law school before entering 
the business world and says he would one day like to return to 
teaching

for the next 18 months those in a hurry here can 
fuel up their cars and themselves in one stop in whats believed to 
be the nations first combination fast food gasoline outlet 
the city was chosen as the test market for an 18month joint 
venture which began thursday by miamibased burger king corp and 
chicagobased amoco oil co 
basically were both in the energy industry said suanne 
map a burger king spokeswoman in denver amoco provides food for 
the car and we provide the food for the body 
walt knake an amoco marketing specialist said both companies 
clientele are similar 
our typical customer is between 18 and 49 so that means our 
customers will match up pretty well with burger kings customers 
he said and the typical amoco and burger king customer wants 
speed they want to save time 
amocos end of the operation consists of four pump islands a 
security booth and a cashier the burger king restaurant sits at 
the rear of a 150foot lot and consists of a drivethrough and 
walkup window but no sitdown service 
burger king customers can use their amoco credit card to pay for 
food 
amoco first approached burger king in early 1986 with the idea 
knake said he said the operation will be evaluated during the next 
18 months 
there are no plans to roll it out because we dont know how 
its going to work he said were going to have to evaluate 
it

the japanese appetite for us real estate 
is expected to remain strong this year but may not exceed the 6 
billion they invested last year bank of america said thursday 
at minimum we expect japanese investment to be equal to or 
slightly below 1987 levels said jack s cooper managing 
director of the banks investment real estate group 
the japanese remain concerned about volatility in the us stock 
market as well as the nations huge trade and budget deficits but 
cooper said in a statement that if there is improvement in the 
global economic and political issues that are causing those 
concerns the amount invested in this country could be 
substantially higher than last year 
investment will continued to be focused on the west and east 
coasts but the japanese increasingly are looking beyond the major 
cities for opportunities among the new spots to draw attention are 
atlanta more than 150 japanese companies have established 
subisidiaries in atlanta according to bank of america and that 
will serve as a magnet for more japanese investment 
nashville tenn the bank cites tennessee officials as saying 
about 10000 workers are employed by japanese firms within the 
state as in the case of atlanta that is likely to lead to 
additional real estate investment there 
portland ore the city is becoming an increasingly 
wellknown market in japan largely because of its own promotion 
efforts the bank noted 
seattle bank of america noted that this city is particularly 
convenient because of simple airline connections to japan 
investors are likely to be attracted by its port and diverse 
economy 
san diego physical limitation of the citys growth because of 
the pacific ocean the mexican border and the desert increase the 
potential for strong real estate appreciation the bank said 
washington dc japanese recognize the citys growing demand 
for offices housing and shopping centers the bank said 
sacramento calif japanese investors are likely to turn to 
this city as an alternative to the higherpriced san francisco and 
los angeles markets bank of america said 
phoenix continued population growth of this city has 
maintained a need for apartments and shopping centers

the delaware supreme court has upheld 
damages and interest awarded to trans world airlines in a 25year 
legal battle with the late howard r hughes and his hughes tool co 
in a ruling dated april 4 the states highest court upheld an 
award of more than 483 million in damages plus interest against 
the hughes tool co also known as toolco 
a chancery court in january last year awarded twa more than 
172 million plus prejudgment interest of about 311 million 
post judgment interest was allowed only on the damage award 
twa filed the lawsuit in 1962 claiming the defendants had 
breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty by deliberately 
interfering with twas commercial success to benefit themselves 
at that time hughes owned 78 percent of twa stock according to 
the ruling toolco used its control position to twas detriment it 
said that because of hughes evasive nature toolco was slow to 
order jets twa needed to remain competitive 
toolco appealed to the state supreme court and twa filed a cross 
appeal 
twa sought to have postjudgment interest calculated on both the 
damage award and prejudgment interest 
the state supreme court said the claim was without merit because 
delaware courts have traditionally disfavored the practice of 
compounding interest and we see no reason to depart from that rule 
here 
toolco appealed on four issues including a clain it did not 
breach its fiduciary duty to twa through its failure to place an 
earlier order for boeing jets 
toolco claimed twa did not need that type of jet toolco 
contended it should not be held accountable for twas lost profits 
due to toolcos failure to order such aircraft 
the supreme court held that toolcos argument ignores the fact 
that the intrinsic fairness test placed the burden upon toolco to 
prove that it was not the cause of twas lost profits and toolco 
failed to meet that burden 
toolco also disputed the inclusion of accounting changes made by 
twa in late 1963 in calculating damages the ruling said however 
that there was no error or abuse of discretion by including the 
accounting changes in calculating the damages through 1963 
in its final argument toolco claimed it was erroneous to use an 
interest rate in excess of the legal rate in calculating the 
prejudgment interest 
but the supreme court noted that chancery court is a court of 
equity and has broad discretion subject to principles of 
fairness in fixing the rate to be applied in chancery court 
the legal rate is a mere guide not an inflexible rule the 
ruling said 
in selecting the interest rate the trial court considered the 
nature of the plaintiff the nature of the wrong remedied and the 
peculiar facts of the case each of those factors was appropriate 
and there was no abuse of discretion in the courts choice of 
rate the ruling said

police charged david mayhew a partner with 
british investment firm cazenove and co with three offenses 
related to guinness plcs 1986 takeover of distillers co 
mayhew was arrested thursday and taken to a london police 
station to answer questions about the guinness affair and was later 
charged 
the first charge accuses him of inducing distillers shareholders 
to dispose of their shares by dishonest concealment of a material 
fact the police said 
the second charge alleges unlawful financial assistance and the 
third accuses him of involvement with an undisclosed party which 
purchased distillers shares in april 1986 
mayhew who was released is scheduled to appear in a london 
magistrates court on friday to hear the charges 
he is the seventh person to be charged by british police in 
connection with the guinness affair 
the other accused are former guinness chairman ernest saunders 
roger seelig a former corporate finance director for morgan 
grenfell and co ltd financier sir jack lyons heron corp 
chairman gerald ronson lord spens a former director of henry 
ansbacher and co and stockbroker anthony parnes 
british police have also issued a warrant for the arrest of 
former guinness director thomas ward a washington lawyer 
guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for 
company outsiders to purchase the brewers shares to boost their 
price in order to make guinness cash and stock offer for 
distillers more attractive than a rival bid 
cazenove which acted as guinness broker during the distillers 
bid reaffirmed on thursday a 1987 statement in which cazenove 
denied that any of its representatives broke the law or offered 
improper indemnities or inducements to purchase distillers 
shares 
cazenove insisted on mayhews innocence saying he would remain 
a partner and would continue to have the firms complete support

four years and two months after the start of an 
epic legal battle between two oil industry rivals it took just 10 
minutes thursday for texaco inc to deliver a 3 billion settlement 
into the bank account of pennzoil co 
a halfdozen tightlipped executives from texas commerce 
bankhouston and pennzoil huddled around a computer terminal in a 
sterile bank office waiting like expectant parents for the green 
computer screen to signal the beginning of the largest cash 
settlement in the nations judicial history 
ill be glad when its over a tense dave alderson 
assistant treasurer of pennzoil said itll be a relief 
bank officials warned about a dozen reporters and photographers 
before escorting them into room 1760 of the banks electronic 
services divisionfunds transfer section that the place was a 
highsecurity area and they would not be allowed to wander 
ironically the bank is two blocks south of pennzoils houston 
headquarters and two blocks north of the downtown texaco building 
margo somers an operations officer at texas commerce bank 
repeatedly punched in the pennzoil account number on her terminal 
to see if the texaco money electronically appeared on the bank 
ledger 
this is the largest one ive ever handled she said 
to get an idea of how much 3 billion really is consider this 
if you spent 1 every second it would take 92 years to go through 
3 billion if comprised of 1 bills only the stack would reach 
203 miles high and weigh 3061 tons according to ira polikoff a 
spokesman at the us treasurys bureau of engraving and printing 
at manufacturers hanover trust co which handled texacos end 
of the transaction from new york james p witkins a senior vice 
president gathered the cash from 26 or 27 banks using a task force 
of four people 
its not really the raw money itself its the sensitivity and 
the technicality he said you want the thing to shut out in 
one day three billion dollars works out to about a half a million 
dollars a day in interest money like that doesnt sit around 
idle 
at 1003 am cdt the first payment 600 million came in to 
houston 
so far so good someone said 
alderson smiled faintly 
bank officials notified manufacturers hanover the payment had 
been received 
then they waited eyes still glued to the computer screen 
there was little small talk the minutes dragged a bank 
spokesman explained that the next wire transfer probably was hung 
up in the computer queue behind other business 
mrs somers typed in the pennzoil account number again 
payment no 2 arrived at 1010 am pennzoil had another 800 
million 
alderson smiled a bit more 
he and linda condit director of treasury operations for 
pennzoil scribbled notes on legal pads 
at 1012 am another 700 million appeared in the pennzoil 
account 
aldersons smile grew 
just a minute later at 1013 am the fourth and largest 
single payment 900 million arrived 
there it is mrs somers said its all in 
alderson flashed a 3 billion grin 
a few people began applauding 
were all very glad its all over alderson said accepting 
congratulations but hurrying out of the room 
going to call the boss a reporter asked 
exactly right the assistant treasurer said 
a few blocks away joe jamail the colorful houston attorney who 
headed the pennzoil legal team and stands to make millions from the 
case was in court trying another case 
i dont have any gloating feeling he said im just glad 
that the system of justice prevailed and we won now i hope they 
texaco quit crying about it

foreigners continue to own just under 1 
percent of us agricultural land slightly more than the level of 
a year ago the agriculture department said thursday 
the departments economic research service said its 1987 
yearend review of reports under the agricultural foreign 
investment disclosure act found 125 million acres of agricultural 
land in foreign hands 202000 acres more than reported in 1986 
of the land owned by foreign interests 50 percent was forest 
land 17 percent cropland 28 percent pasture and other 
agricultural land and 5 percent used for nonagricultural purposes 
or unreported 
corporations held 80 percent of the foreignowned land with the 
balance held by individuals partnerships institutions and other 
entities 
as in the past much of the ownership is concentrated in the 
united kingdom canada west germany the netherlands antilles and 
switzerland those countries combined to account for 69 percent of

oil futures prices put on a late rally and broke past 17 a 
barrel thursday with traders at the new york mercantile exchange 
looking ahead to a weekend opec committee meeting on prices 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mostly higher 
livestock were mostly weaker and precious metals were mixed 
most of the action in the energy markets was buying to offset 
earlier sales to square away accounts before the price committee 
meeting said andrew lebow an analyst in new york with edamp f 
man international futures inc 
theres the general expectation that the price committee isnt 
going to do anything substantial he said in fact they have 
no power to do much of anything 
but theres still some fear that opec could throw a curve 
ball and take meaningful steps to stabilize international oil 
prices he said 
gasoline and heating oil futures also advanced responding to 
firm demand and to the rally in crude oil said lebow 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in may at 1706 a barrel 
heating oil was 39 cent to 71 cent higher with may at 4573 cents 
a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 35 cent to 40 cent higher 
with may at 4882 cents a gallon 
livestock futures were mostly lower while pork bellies advanced 
at the chicago mercantile exchange 
the cattle market is basically on the fence said chuck 
levitt an analyst in chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
a recent bull market appears to have stalled because the profit 
margins of processors and retailers are very thin and they see 
larger supplies later in the spring he said 
so theyre not willing to commit themselves in a big way to 
feature or push beef 
this means processors are resisting paying top dollar for live 
cattle but at the same time there is no surplus of marketready 
animals so the producers arent willing to drastically cut their 
prices 
pork futures are stymied by their high price compared with the 
cash market levitt said 
the premium about 7 a hundredweight is about as wide as 
its been any time in the 1980s he said 
so before they can move ahead futures need cash prices to 
catch up said levitt 
live cattle were 20 cent lower to 15 cent higher with the 
april contract at 7382 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged 
to 20 cent lower with april at 7957 cents a pound live hogs were 
45 cent lower to 27 cent higher with april at 4535 cents a 
pound and frozen pork bellies were 08 cent to 40 cent higher 
with may at 5332 cents a pound 
soybean futures prices put on a late rally and pulled corn a 
little higher at the chicago board of trade 
a large speculator who had driven prices up earlier in the week 
came into the market as a buyer again said dale gustafson an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
this forced traders who had sold earlier in the hope of prices 
would decline to start buying to limit their losses 
trading in the grains was relatively quiet 
corn was helped by the rally in beans while wheat has some 
underlying support from the soviet union bidding on a half million 
tons of the grain and the expectation that india may be interested 
in buying some 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the may contract 
at 313 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with may 
at 207 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents higher with may 
at 165 a bushel and soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents higher 
with may at 673 a bushel 
gold futures moved higher while silver was a little lower at the 
commodity exchange in new york 
gold settled 140 to 180 higher with the june contract at 
45270 a troy ounce and silver was 3 cents lower with may at 
6435 a troy ounce 
stock index futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange 
where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp poors 500 
index contract settled 20 point higher at 26760 the underlying 
spot index closed 67 point higher at 26616

dairy farmers complained thursday they 
are not sharing in the agricultural economys rebound from the 
devastating farm recession of the mid1980s 
dairy farmers are facing a rough year while the rest of 
agriculture is prospering a farmer told sen charles grassley 
following the iowa republicans remarks to the annual meeting of 
the midamerica dairymen inc 
the farmer who rose from the audience at the meeting of the 
milk marketing and processing cooperative to question the senator 
complained that the price of grain for feeding herds had climbed 
while the price paid farmers for their milk has declined 
i cant say i dont disagree grassley replied but he noted 
a healthy turn of events and added that in all his years as a 
farmer and member of congress hed never seen a time when all 
segments of agriculture do well at the same time 
the government this year reduced dairy price supports by 50 
cents a hundredweight and another cut is possible next year because 
of surplus production that continued despite an earlier government 
herd buyout program 
grassley told the meeting that the dairy industry may yet be 
able to provide alternatives to future cuts in price supports 
despite efforts to reduce huge federal budget deficits 
he encouraged dairy farmers to work with cattlemen as they 
recently did in supporting a beef promotion referendum 
the agriculture bloc has become fragmented in recent years 
leading to a dangerous reduction in agricultures political 
support the senator said in his speech to the group the 
diverse chorus of voices representing agriculture creates difficult 
choices for congress as ben franklin warned competing factions 
more than 200 years ago we must all hang together or we shall all 
hang separately 
despite the call for unity delegates later amended a resolution 
that would have encouraged members of the cooperative with assets 
of nearly 367 million to support the beef referendum instead 
the group voted to be neutral on next months beef vote 
tom townsend a senior vice president of the cooperative said 
that change in position will be a bargaining chip in negotiations 
with cattlemen to seek their support for dairy programs 
one recent example of unity in the dairy industry was a 
unanimous recommendation from its national commission on dairy 
policy presented march 31 to congress and the secretary of 
agriculture 
the proposals by the 18member panel of dairy farmers from 
around the country was the first unified industry proposal in more 
than a decade said clyde rutherford a syracuse ny farmer who 
is chairman of the commission and president of dairylea milk 
everything weve done in the past has been a quick fix 
rutherford said in an interview after he addressed the midamerica 
dairymen he said the commission tried to come up with a dairy 
policy to carry the industry through the end of the century 
the commission concluded federal policy should create an 
economic environment that makes profitability possible but not 
guaranteed for the nations milk producers he told the 
convention those who are efficient innovative and industrious 
will benefit under the commissions plan 
he also noted that while the recommendations were unanimous 
they also were controversial adding there is something for 
everyone to dislike 
for example it favors an end to californias separate 
manufacturing allowance for milk made into butter cheese and 
nonfat dry milk 
among its major proposals the commission recommended 
giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to 
raise or lower dairy price supports by 5 percent with a oneyear 
limit of 50 cents a hundredweight 
giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to 
impose production controls when government purchases of surplus 
milk exceed 5 billion pounds in one year and requiring production 
controls if surplus stocks rise to 75 billion pounds 
providing the secretary of agriculture with two options for 
future production controls a herd buyout program similar to the 
one that removed 11 million cows and heifers from the nations 
herds in 198687 or a twotiered price system that would 
provide a reduced price for any milk marketings above a set quota 
support of quotas to limit imports of dairy products to keep 
the united states from becoming a dumping ground for world foreign 
dairy surpluses 
delegates at the 20th annual meeting of the midamerica dairymen 
later adopted their own legislative goals that included a call for 
deemphasizing the use of price supports as a means of controlling 
dairy supplies

consider other alternatives to boost its value including possible 
reorganization to focus on california operations a leveraged 
recapitalization with possible distributions to stockholders by a 
dividend or share repurchase and a negotiated sale of the company 
to a third party 
we are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives 
will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our 
stockholders said john m lillie luckys chairman and chief 
executive officer

states and lucky would have make lucky the nations largest 
supermarket chain surpassing no 1 kroger co
